Damaged <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs regenerate efficiently early in the third larval instar (L3) but progressively lose this ability. This correlates with reduced damage-responsive expression of multiple genes, including the WNT genes <italic>wingless (wg</italic>) and <italic>Wnt6</italic>. We demonstrate that damage-responsive expression of both genes requires a bipartite enhancer whose activity declines during L3. Within this enhancer, a damage-responsive module stays active throughout L3, while an adjacent silencing element nucleates increasing levels of epigenetic silencing restricted to this enhancer. Cas9-mediated deletion of the silencing element alleviates WNT repression, but is, in itself, insufficient to promote regeneration. However, directing <italic>Myc</italic> expression to the blastema overcomes repression of multiple genes, including <italic>wg</italic>, and restores cellular responses necessary for regeneration. Localized epigenetic silencing of damage-responsive enhancers can therefore restrict regenerative capacity in maturing organisms without compromising gene functions regulated by developmental signals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11588.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11588.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11588.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The ability of many animals to regenerate damaged tissues decreases as they age, for example, newborn mice can regenerate damaged heart tissue while older mice cannot. Researchers are trying to discover why older animals lose the ability to regenerate, which may help us to develop therapies that can regenerate damaged tissues in humans.</p><p>Fruit flies are relatively simple animals that are often used as models in biology experiments. In young fruit fly larvae, there are tissues called imaginal discs that regenerate well after damage; however these discs lose this ability as the larva matures. A gene called <italic>wingless</italic> is very active in young larvae if the imaginal discs become damaged and helps them to regenerate. Previous studies show that this gene is not as strongly switched on in older larvae after tissue damage. However, since <italic>wingless</italic> also performs other roles in fruit flies, it is not clear how cells can stop <italic>wingless</italic> from being highly activated after tissue damage without affecting other important processes.</p><p>Regions of DNA called enhancers can regulate the activity of genes. Harris et al. studied an enhancer that had previously been shown to drive the activation of <italic>wingless</italic> following tissue damage. The experiments show that there are two separate sections within the enhancer that control <italic>wingless</italic> activity. One section activates <italic>wingless</italic> in response to tissue damage and can perform this role even as the tissue matures. However, in older larvae, the other section alters the properties of the first section’s DNA to reduce its effectiveness. By switching off this section of the enhancer – but not the <italic>wingless</italic> gene itself – the activity of <italic>wingless</italic> no longer responds to tissue damage, but can still be regulated by signals that influence other processes.</p><p>Harris et al. also found that several other genes that are not active in mature tissues can be re-activated by a protein called Myc. Therefore, increasing the production of Myc in cells can promote the regeneration of more mature tissues. The next step is to find out if other genes involved in fly tissue regeneration are regulated in a similar way. A future challenge will be to find out if the same mechanism also limits tissue regeneration in humans and other more complex animals as they age.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11588.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11588.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>wnt</kwd><kwd>drosophila</kwd><kwd>epigenetic regulation</kwd><kwd>growth</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM085576</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hariharan</surname><given-names>Iswar K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Professor Award, 120366-RP-11-078-01-DDC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hariharan</surname><given-names>Iswar K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007557</institution-id><institution>California Institute of Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Robin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009559</institution-id><institution>Life Sciences Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Robin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Localized silencing of damage-responsive enhancers can block regenerative growth while permitting those same genes to be used for normal development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability of tissues to regenerate following damage varies greatly between different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Even some vertebrate species are capable of fully regenerating organs that have essentially no regenerative capacity in humans such as heart tissue in adult zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Poss et al., 2002</xref>) and limbs in urodele amphibians such as newts and salamanders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tanaka and Reddien, 2011</xref>). Understanding the cellular differences between homologous organs that differ in their regenerative capacity among species could suggest genetic or pharmacological manipulations that improve the regenerative capacity of damaged organs in humans.</p><p>The ability to regenerate specific organs differs not only between species, but can also change within a single species during its development. In general, for organisms that have determinate growth, i.e. growth that ceases once a genetically pre-determined size is reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sebens, 1987</xref>), the capacity for regeneration usually decreases with increasing maturity. For example, embryonic and neonatal mice are able to regenerate myocardial tissue following substantial damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Drenckhahn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>). However, within the first week of life, this capacity to regenerate is lost almost completely, and the damaged tissue is instead replaced by fibrotic scarring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>). Other examples include appendage regeneration in developing <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dent, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Slack et al., 2004</xref>) and the progressive loss of digit regeneration in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">King, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borgens, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reginelli et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The basis for this phenomenon is not well understood. In some instances where tissue re-growth is dependent on stem cell based replacement of tissue (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tanaka and Reddien, 2011</xref>), the loss of a stem cell population could account for the inability to regenerate. However, this explanation cannot account for situations where regeneration is not driven by a stem cell population but rather by the proliferation and de-differentiation of adjacent tissue. In these cases the loss of regenerative capacity in a still-developing organism necessitates a mechanism that selectively inactivates regenerative processes while still allowing cell proliferation and differentiation associated with normal development. Since most genes that function during regeneration also have a variety of functions either in normal development or in maintaining homeostasis in the same tissue, it is presently unclear how their expression could be regulated so as to selectively block regeneration.</p><p>Genetic studies using <italic>Drosophila</italic> have provided important insights into the genetic regulation of tissue growth. Many of these studies have examined growth of the imaginal discs, larval epithelial tissues that are precursors of adult structures, such as the wing and the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen, 1993</xref>). Imaginal discs are capable of regenerating missing portions following damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Worley et al., 2012</xref>). Studies of imaginal disc regeneration were pioneered by the group of Ernst Hadorn and were mostly conducted by transplanting damaged discs into the abdomens of adult female flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Ursprung and Hadorn, 1962</xref>). More recently, imaginal disc regeneration has been studied in intact larvae by damaging portions of the disc via brief expression of a pro-apoptotic gene in a spatially-restricted manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergantiños et al., 2010</xref>). Using either a genetic ablation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</xref>), or following X-ray irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Halme et al., 2010</xref>), it was observed that the capacity of the wing-imaginal disc to regenerate progressively diminished during the later stages of the third larval instar as the larva approached the beginning of metamorphosis. Expression of <italic>wingless (wg, Drosophila WNT1</italic> ortholog) is robustly upregulated in regenerating discs following genetic ablation. However, in more mature discs, which do not regenerate, there is a strong reduction in this <italic>wg</italic> upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We chose to address the basis for reduced regeneration in mature discs by examining the mechanisms underlying the reduction in <italic>wg</italic> upregulation following damage. The upregulation of WNT proteins is an early and often essential response to tissue damage, observed in diverse species including <italic>Hydra</italic> and planaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gurley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lengfeld et al., 2009</xref>), as well as vertebrate species such as zebrafish, axolotls and <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kawakami et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stoick-Cooper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yokoyama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lin and Slack, 2008</xref>). Multiple studies have demonstrated that WNT signaling is essential for regeneration and is able to augment the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kawakami et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stoick-Cooper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yokoyama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lin and Slack, 2008</xref>), even in tissues that do not normally undergo regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kawakami et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the mechanisms that link tissue damage in imaginal discs to <italic>wg</italic> upregulation, and the basis for diminished <italic>wg</italic> upregulation with increasing maturity, are likely to provide insights into similar processes in diverse organisms.</p><p>Here we characterize the properties of an enhancer in the major WNT locus of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schubiger et al., 2010</xref>) that mediates the upregulation of both <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Wnt6</italic> following damage to imaginal discs, and show that deletion of this enhancer impairs regeneration. We show that damage-responsive activation and age-dependent attenuation can each be ascribed to separate modules within the enhancer, and while the damage-responsive module is equally effective in promoting damage-responsive gene expression in mature discs, its activity is overridden by an adjacent element that nucleates epigenetic silencing with increasing effectiveness as the larva matures. Importantly, this epigenetic silencing is restricted to the immediate vicinity of this enhancer, thereby not interfering with the activation of <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Wnt6</italic> by distinct developmentally regulated enhancers. We also describe a way of overcoming this silencing and improving regeneration in more mature larvae.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In order to study the mechanisms that regulate regenerative growth in imaginal discs, we used a genetic ablation system developed in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</xref>), which demonstrated that damage-responsive <italic>wg</italic> expression in mature discs is reduced compared to younger discs. A pro-apoptotic gene, either <italic>eiger (egr</italic>) or <italic>reaper (rpr</italic>), is expressed specifically in the wing pouch by <italic>rn-Gal4</italic>, and temporally regulated by temperature-controlled inactivation of Gal80 (encoded by <italic>Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Depending on the transgene used, this system is hereafter referred to as <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup></italic>&gt;<italic>egr</italic> or <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup></italic>&gt;<italic>rpr</italic>. This system was used to initiate cell death early in the third larval instar (L3) on day 7 (hereafter “day 7 discs”) or late in L3 on day 9 (hereafter “day 9 discs”)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After 20 hr of <italic>rpr</italic> expression or 40 hr of <italic>egr</italic> expression, the tissue that comprises the wing pouch is almost completely ablated in both a day 7 and a day 9 disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</xref>). However, ablations initiated later in L3 result in significantly less regenerative growth, yielding adult flies with wings of greatly reduced size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Regeneration of younger discs is associated with an extended larval stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which allows sufficient time for tissue re-growth before the pupal stage of development. This extension is significantly smaller in ablated day 9 discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, the decline in regenerative growth is not simply due to restricted proliferation in mature discs, as both ablated and unablated discs from day 9 discs still express markers of cell-cycle progression, albeit at a lower level than in day 7 discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). As suggested by the reduced damage-responsive <italic>wg</italic> expression in older discs, other mechanisms likely exist to limit regenerative growth.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11588.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cellular changes that accompany reduced regeneration in older discs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup>&gt;rpr</italic> ablation system used to induce tissue damage and stimulate regeneration in L3 wing-imaginal discs on day 7 and day 9 of development.

Since this technique involves embedding the specimens in agarose for visualization, the three dimensional architecture of the disc is preserved and can be accurately examined. Additionally, we used confocal microscopy to visualize the cells at the edge of the ablated region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–I</xref>). The JNK signaling pathway is known to be activated strongly in regenerating imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bosch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mattila et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergantiños et al., 2010</xref>). We therefore used an AP-1 reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chatterjee and Bohmann, 2012</xref>) to identify the cells in which the JNK pathway was active. In both day 7 discs and day 9 discs we observed that the disc proper (DP) epithelium in the central portion of the wing pouch had been ablated, while both the peripodial epithelium (PE) and the basement membrane underlying the DP were intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). Indeed, visualizing the basement membrane using a GFP-tagged version of Viking (Vkg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buszczak et al., 2007</xref>), a collagen that is deposited in the basement membrane, shows no lack of continuity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The lumen between the basement membrane and the overlying PE of each disc was filled with cellular debris, marked by the activated caspase DCP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). In both day 7 and day 9 discs the AP-1 reporter was strongly expressed in the cells adjacent to the ablated portion of the DP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>), as well as the overlying PE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>, single arrowheads), indicating that the JNK pathway is activated consistently in discs of both ages. However, despite the equivalent level of activation, the pattern of AP-1 expression differed between the two developmental stages. In day 7 discs the cells expressing the AP-1 reporter in the DP became flattened and appeared to migrate towards the interior of the ablated region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), leaving the majority of the debris between the PE and the newly migrated epithelium. Hence, these AP-1 positive cells could be seen clearly in basal confocal sections but not in apical ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In contrast, in day 9 discs, the AP-1 positive cells at the edge of the ablated region maintained their columnar profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and remained at the periphery of the ablated wing pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), allowing the debris to extend beyond the plane of the basal DP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, double arrowheads). Thus, the cellular response to damage is markedly different in mature discs compared to younger discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–K</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-11588-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11588.006</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>The morphological response of a day 7 disc to ablation.</title><p>Three dimensional imaging using light sheet microscopy of discs ablated with <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup>&gt;rpr</italic> on day 7, with AP-1-GFP (green) and stained for DCP-1 (red), and DE-Cadherin (blue).

We also compared the activity of other signaling pathways that are known to function in the context of imaginal disc damage and regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–G</xref>). For all genes, we examined whole-disc expression by imaging at the level of the basal and apical DP, and the PE of each disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). A reporter of <italic>Stat92E</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bach et al., 2007</xref>), an indicator of signaling via the JAK/STAT pathway, which has recently been implicated in imaginal disc regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Katsuyama et al., 2015</xref>), was strongly upregulated all around the ablated region on day 7, but on day 9 the expression was restricted to those regions that also express the reporter in unablated discs of a comparable developmental stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The <italic>bantam</italic>-GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Matakatsu and Blair, 2012</xref>), which can be activated by increased Yki activity, also shows a moderate decline in expression following ablation as larvae progress through L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The cell cycle regulator Cyclin E and a reporter of E2F activity also showed a similar reduction in ablation-induced expression in a day 9 disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>), indicating that the proliferative response to damage can still occur in late stage discs, but is diminished.

Our observations of the AP-1-GFP reporter suggest that the JNK pathway is still strongly active in mature ablated discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,G,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Surprisingly however, when we examined expression of <italic>matrix metalloprotease 1 (MMP1</italic>), a JNK target gene that is important for cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Page-McCaw et al., 2003</xref>) and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stevens and Page-McCaw, 2012</xref>), we found a strongly reduced response to ablation in a day 9 disc compared to that of a day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This was indicated by both protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and transcriptional readout by an <italic>MMP1-lacZ</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The JNK phosphatase <italic>puckered (puc</italic>), another JNK target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ring and Martinez Arias, 1993</xref>), was also not as strongly activated in an ablated day 9 disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, expression of <italic>DILP8</italic>, a secreted protein released by damaged tissue that delays entry into metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colombani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garelli et al., 2012</xref>), and which is regulated by JNK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colombani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Katsuyama et al., 2015</xref>), was reduced in day 9 discs when compared to day 7 discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, while JNK activation, as assessed by a synthetic promoter with multimerized AP-1 binding sites, is comparable on day 7 and day 9, a number of known JNK pathway targets demonstrate strongly reduced damage-responsive expression in mature discs compared to younger discs. This correlates with an altered morphological response to damage and a loss of regenerative capacity. One explanation for this change in gene expression is that the damage-responsive signaling cascades that activate these pathways are less active in day 9 discs, although the AP-1 reporter suggests that, at least for JNK targets, this is not the case. An alternate possibility is that the transcriptional response to these activating signals is actively repressed by a mechanism that becomes more potent as discs mature. To distinguish between these possibilities, we conducted a detailed characterization of the mechanisms that regulate <italic>wg</italic> expression following damage, as <italic>wg</italic> is a gene whose orthologs have well documented roles in regeneration in many organisms.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>The BRV118 enhancer activates both <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Wnt6</italic> expression to promote regeneration</title><p>A number of enhancers have been identified that regulate the normal pattern of <italic>wg</italic> expression in the wing disc during L3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Neumann and Cohen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pereira et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Koshikawa et al., 2015</xref>).

Moreover, the upregulation following damage of both <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Wnt6</italic> RNA was diminished in day 9 discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, our findings indicate that expression of both <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Wnt6</italic>, the two genes that flank BRV118, is upregulated in response to damage, and that this response declines with larval maturation.</p><p>To study whether BRV118 regulates the expression of both <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Wnt6</italic>, we examined their expression in ablated <italic>wg<sup>1</sup></italic> discs.

Homozygous <italic>wg<sup>1</sup></italic> adults are viable, and have the ability to develop normally sized and patterned wings, suggesting this region is not essential for normal development.

This loss of wing tissue is phenotypically distinct and easily distinguishable from ablated wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In ablated <italic>wg<sup>1</sup></italic> discs, expression of both <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Wnt6</italic> was markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) suggesting that sequences disrupted in the <italic>wg<sup>1</sup></italic>mutant are necessary for the upregulation of both genes.

We deleted these sites in the BRV-B reporter to generate BRV-B∆AP1. Following physical fragmentation, discs bearing the BRV-B reporter strongly expressed GFP along the wound edges, coincident with AP-1-RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In contrast, deletion of the AP-1 sites in BRV-B∆AP1 completely abolished expression of GFP in fragmented discs despite AP-1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F’</xref>). Similarly, the BRV-B∆AP1 reporter failed to be activated following <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup></italic>&gt;<italic>egr</italic> ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), or after irradiation (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that upon tissue damage, WNT signaling is activated, in significant part, by JNK signaling via the BRV-B enhancer. Consensus sites for several other candidate activators are also present in the BRV-B sequence, including Grainyhead, a transcription factor that has been shown to function with AP-1 in larval epidermal wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mace et al., 2005</xref>), and the Dpp signaling transducers Mad and Medea. Several potential binding sites for the WNT pathway transcription factor TCF/Pangolin also exist, consistent with a previous observation that ubiquitously expressed <italic>wg</italic> can activate this enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schubiger et al., 2010</xref>). In this way, <italic>wg</italic> could activate or maintain its own expression as part of a feed forward mechanism during regeneration. Thus, although a high level of JNK signaling may be able to activate the enhancer on its own, under conditions of damage in vivo JNK signaling may act in concert with other damage-induced signals to activate <italic>wg</italic> expression via the BRV-B enhancer.</p><p>We also examined several other situations where JNK signaling is activated in the absence of tissue injury. The BRV-B reporter was expressed in discs mutant for <italic>discs large (dlg</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>) or following knockdown of <italic>scribble</italic> (data not shown). In both situations there is a loss of epithelial apicobasal polarity that results in neoplastic growth. In contrast, expression of <italic>yorkie (yki</italic>), the growth-promoting co-activator downstream of the Hippo pathway, for 20 hr using the <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup></italic> system elicits overgrowth while preserving apico-basal polarity, but does not activate reporter expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). The BRV-B reporter was also not activated in two situations where JNK is activated under physiological conditions: in the notum of late stage larval discs, which is required for dorsal thorax closure during the pupal stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and dorsal closure of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These differences may reflect the extent of JNK activation since BRV-B is mostly activated under conditions where JNK is activated at high levels. Alternatively other factors specific to stress or damage may function in combination with JNK to modulate expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A separate silencing element mediates maturity-dependent Polycomb-mediated repression</title><p>Unlike the 2.9 kb BRV118 full enhancer, the expression directed by BRV-B covers a broader region and is also unchanged between day 7 and day 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>).

We found that as more of the BRV-C fragment was deleted, there was a progressive loss of silencing, indicating that multiple regions within BRV-C contribute to this activity. However, there was a strong difference in silencing activity between deletions that retained 441 and 183 bp of BRV-C, suggesting the presence of significant silencing activity within this 258 bp region. Sequences at both ends of this 258 bp region have almost complete conservation of nucleotide identity across 12 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), including two predicted binding sites for the transcriptional co-repressor Brinker (Brk). We generated a BRV-BC enhancer with both Brk sites mutated but found no loss of silencing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>), indicating either that Brk does not function in mediating the repression, or that its activity is redundant with other mechanisms that are still functional. Thus, unrecognized motifs, likely within the conserved blocks clustered near the predicted Brk binding sites, must mediate the silencing activity associated with this region.</p><p>In many cases, developmentally-regulated gene silencing is mediated by the recruitment of Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schuettengruber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schwartz and Pirrotta, 2007</xref>), which act by promoting the trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cao et al., 2002</xref>). For many transgenes that contain elements capable of recruiting PcG proteins, silencing of the adjacent mini-<italic>white</italic> gene in the transgene is also observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kassis and Brown, 2013</xref>). In these cases, the silencing of the mini-<italic>white</italic> gene is sensitive to the levels of PcG proteins. Indeed, we observed that transgenic flies bearing the BRV-BC reporter had lighter eyes than those bearing the BRV-B reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>) even though both reporter genes were inserted at the identical site in the genome, suggesting that the BRV-C fragment was capable of mediating silencing of surrounding DNA when integrated at a genomic locus outside of the WNT cluster. However, in flies that were heterozygous for <italic>pleiohomeotic</italic> (<italic>pho</italic>) or <italic>pleiohomeotic-like (phol</italic>), the eye color was similar to those bearing the BRV-B fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>), indicating that the silencing activity induced by the BRV-C fragment was indeed sensitive to PcG group gene dosage. We examined the sequence of BRV-C and found multiple potential binding sites for proteins shown to be important for PcG silencing at PREs, including 2 conserved <italic>pho/phol</italic> binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>). To test whether the silencing activity of BRV-C during disc regeneration is regulated by PcG, we examined the expression of the full length BRV118-GFP reporter in <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup></italic>&gt;<italic>egr</italic> imaginal discs heterozygous for the null allele of <italic>Polycomb, Pc<sup>15</sup></italic>. In these flies, robust expression of the reporter was observed in day 9 discs, as was expression of the Wg protein expressed from the endogenous <italic>wg</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–D’</xref>). However, due to changes in developmental timing, increased lethality, and the significant transdetermination levels associated with the <italic>Pc</italic> allele, documented previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2005</xref>), we were unable to test whether <italic>Pc</italic> gene dose affected levels of regeneration in our genetic ablation system. In order to avoid potential organism-wide pleiotropic effects of the <italic>Pc</italic> allele, we generated <italic>Pc<sup>15</sup></italic> clones in developing discs that also had the BRV-BC reporter. Day 9 mosaic discs were irradiated to induce damage and examined for enhancer activity. Despite morphological disruption within the disc epithelium, likely due to the presence of <italic>Pc</italic> mutant tissue, and widespread cell death associated with irradiation, GFP was clearly expressed in the <italic>Pc</italic> mutant clones, and to a lesser extent in the surrounding heterozygous tissue, but was absent from the wild type sister clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–E’</xref>). Thus, Pc is required to prevent damage-induced activation of the BRV-BC reporter in mature discs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Epigenetic silencing is restricted to the damage-responsive enhancer</title><p>To directly examine whether there is a change in the levels of PcG-mediated repression of the <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Wnt6</italic> genes between day 7 and day 9, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to examine the levels of H3K27 methylation across the WNT gene cluster from undamaged wing imaginal discs. In comparison to day 7 discs, there was a significant increase in the levels of H3K27 methylation in day 9 discs, which was mostly restricted to the BRV118 enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Most of the <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Wnt6</italic> transcription units showed no change in H3K27 methylation, nor was there a significant increase in methylation observed in regions known to regulate aspects of developmental <italic>wg</italic> expression in third-instar discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Neumann and Cohen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pereira et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Koshikawa et al., 2015</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that both <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Wnt6</italic> are expressed in undamaged discs at this stage of development. Two other genomic regions examined, <italic>act5C</italic> and the heterochromatin <italic>H23</italic> locus, also showed no significant change between day 7 and day 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Since the increase in the histone modification most characteristic of PcG-mediated silencing during L3 is mostly restricted to the BRV118 region, this suggests that the damage-responsive enhancer is silenced in day 9 discs, while developmentally-regulated WNT enhancers are not.</p><p>To examine the importance of the silencing induced by BRV-C in vivo, we used CRISPR-mediated genome editing to generate a deletion that removed 1132bp, including the entire BRV-C fragment (BRV-∆C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Flies homozygous for the deletion are viable and have no observable developmental abnormalities, but often hold their wings in an outstretched position reminiscent of the <italic>wg<sup>P</sup></italic> allele, in which the region encompassing the entire BRV118 enhancer is removed from the <italic>wg</italic> coding sequence by a genomic inversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buratovich and Armer, 2002</xref>). ChIP experiments performed on day 9 BRV-∆C discs demonstrated a pattern of H3K27 methylation that resembles that normally found in wild-type day 7 discs in the region of the BRV118 enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Thus the sequences within BRV-C are necessary for the increased deposition of H3K27 histone marks by day 9. To examine the functional consequences of this changed pattern of H3K27 methylation, the level of <italic>wg</italic> expression was examined in regenerating <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup></italic>&gt;<italic>rpr</italic> day 9 BRV-∆C discs. In the absence of BRV-C, damage-induced <italic>wg</italic> expression is greatly increased in the disc proper epithelium surrounding the ablated pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–G’</xref>), indicating that the BRV-C region is required in vivo to suppress <italic>wg</italic> expression following damage in day 9 discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). However, when assayed for regeneration, there was no observable difference between BRV-∆C and flies bearing an intact enhancer region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>).</p><p>We also attempted to restore expression of <italic>wg</italic> in another way. The BRV-B enhancer directs expression to a wide region surrounding the damaged tissue and only in response to tissue damage. Moreover, the BRV-B enhancer is equally active on day 7 and day 9. We therefore attempted to generate a transgene that expressed <italic>wg</italic> directly under the control of BRV-B, independently of Gal4/UAS. However, we did not obtain viable transformants. We were able to obtain transformants where <italic>wg</italic> was driven by a sub-fragment of BRV-B, BRV-B3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4A</xref>) possibly because it drives expression at lower levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4B</xref>). While these transformants have high levels of <italic>wg</italic> following damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4C</xref>), we did not observe an improvement in regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4D</xref>) indicating that increased <italic>wg</italic> expression alone is insufficient to improve regeneration and that the damage-responsive expression of other genes necessary for regeneration might also be silenced in mature discs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title><italic>Myc</italic> expression can reactivate the silenced enhancer and promote regeneration</title><p><italic>Myc</italic> is upregulated during regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</xref>), and is therefore likely to be an important driver of regenerative growth.

In these discs, cells expressing the AP-1 reporter resembled the cells normally found in day 7 discs in that they were more flattened and <italic>Mmp1</italic>-expressing cells appeared to be migrating into the ablated portion of the disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–D</xref>). Moreover, expression of Wg protein was increased in day 9 discs to levels comparable to those found in day 7 discs following ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). This likely results from an increase in <italic>wg</italic> transcription, since the full length BRV118 reporter, which includes the entire negatively acting BRV-C element, was also expressed in ablated day 9 discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). This reactivation of the enhancer by <italic>Myc</italic> is cell autonomous, as clones expressing <italic>Myc</italic> in mature discs activate the enhancer following irradiation, while neighboring irradiated cells do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G–G’</xref>). Interestingly, clonal expression of <italic>Myc</italic> causes limited activation of the enhancer even in the absence of damage, but at a significantly reduced level than with irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H–H’</xref>). Thus, at least on day 9, expression of <italic>Myc</italic> is able to activate transcription mediated by an enhancer that is normally epigenetically silenced.</p><p>Finally, as BRV-B driven <italic>Myc</italic> increases the expression of several genes that are usually absent from day 9 ablated discs, we examined whether regenerative ability was also affected. When compared to wild type, flies bearing <italic>BRV-B-Myc</italic> had significantly improved regeneration following ablation on day 7, 8, 9 and 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). This improvement in regeneration occurred without extending the delay in pupariation induced by ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>). The improvement in regeneration elicited by <italic>Myc</italic> expression is modest by day 10, indicating that the loss of regenerative capacity becomes progressively more refractory to reversal even by increased levels of <italic>Myc</italic> expression. Overall, these data show that using an endogenous damage-responsive enhancer to target <italic>Myc</italic> expression specifically to cells surrounding the ablated tissue that give rise to the blastema can augment the regenerative process, likely by circumventing or reversing the repression of multiple genes that function in regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Discussion</title><p>Many organisms lose the ability to regenerate damaged tissues as they mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dent, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reginelli et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Slack et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cox et al., 2014</xref>). This change often occurs concurrently with a slowing of the growth of the organism, or a major transformation in its developmental state, e.g. metamorphosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</xref>) and <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dent, 1962</xref>). The loss of regenerative capacity is likely an important mechanism to balance the successful progression to reproductive adulthood at the cost of forming functionally complete tissue. Very few ‘true’ regeneration-specific genes have been identified (i.e. genes that are not required at any other time throughout the organism’s life), but rather developmentally required pathways are often re-used during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sun and Irvine, 2014</xref>). Thus, how regenerative growth can be selectively inhibited without compromising cell proliferation or differentiation remains unknown. Here we have shown that in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc this loss of regenerative capacity is achieved in part by the localized epigenetic inactivation of a damage-responsive enhancer that regulates the expression of <italic>wg</italic> and potentially <italic>Wnt6</italic>. This mechanism allows an organism to continue with its normal developmental program while shutting down its regenerative response to tissue damage.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that the JNK pathway is robustly activated following tissue damage and has an important role in regenerative growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bosch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mattila et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergantiños et al., 2010</xref>). Our data confirm that JNK is strongly activated following damage, but furthermore, it appears similarly activated in both day 7 and day 9 discs, as assessed by the expression of an AP-1 reporter. Thus, the loss of regeneration that occurs between day 7 and day 9 cannot be attributed to a failure to activate JNK. Despite the similar levels of AP-1 activity, the cellular responses and changes in gene expression elicited by tissue damage differ considerably as the disc matures. Importantly, genes that are known to be downstream targets of the JNK/AP-1 pathway such as <italic>Mmp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006</xref>) and <italic>DILP8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colombani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Katsuyama et al., 2015</xref>) have reduced expression on day 9 when compared to day 7. These changes in gene expression are likely to account for many of the differences in the cellular responses to tissue damage that we observe.</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned genes, the WNT genes <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Wnt6</italic> also exhibit a significant decline in damage-induced expression with disc maturity. Our data shows this is due to the highly localized epigenetic silencing of a damage-responsive WNT enhancer, BRV118, that prevents their expression specifically in response to injury in mature discs, but still allows expression from nearby developmentally regulated enhancers. This mechanism ensures that the contribution of both genes to a regeneration program can be shut off in mature tissues independently of their essential roles in growth and development of the disc. Our inability to detect expression of the BRV118-GFP reporter in unablated discs suggests that the BRV118 enhancer does not have a role in normal development. However, the <italic>wg<sup>1</sup></italic> allele, which results in an incompletely-penetrant phenotype characterized by a failure to specify the wing pouch, is a deletion whose breakpoints are very close to the boundaries of the BRV118 fragment that we have studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schubiger et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that a separate element, possibly very close to, but not fully contained within the boundaries of BRV118, may also be disrupted by the <italic>wg<sup>1</sup></italic> deletion.</p><p>The expression profile of regenerating discs suggests the regulation of multiple genes is required during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klebes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blanco et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Katsuyama et al., 2015</xref>), and that a significant number of these genes are also involved in developmental processes. Thus, equivalent regeneration specific enhancers, like BRV118, might also exist for these genes, such as <italic>DILP8</italic> and <italic>Mmp1</italic>. Both genes are known to be activated by JNK, although damage-responsive enhancers have not yet been characterized. Notably though, the <italic>Mmp1</italic>-lacZ reporter we used to investigate <italic>Mmp1</italic> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), which accurately reflects Mmp1 protein expression following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006</xref>), consists of a ~5 kb intronic region upstream of a lacZ reporter, which, based on its pattern of expression on days 7 and 9, must possess regulatory regions that allow both damage-induced activation and maturity-dependent silencing. Sequence comparison with BRV118 reveals several AP-1 binding sites that are identical to those found in BRV118, and multiple consensus sites for PcG repression. This combination of regulatory motifs could therefore reflect a molecular signature of genes that function in regeneration, and thus could potentially be used to identify genes that comprise a regeneration program through genome-wide analyses in the future.</p><p>Our studies of the regulation of <italic>wg</italic> expression have shown that, despite similar levels of JNK activation, increased levels of PcG-mediated epigenetic silencing can override the effect of JNK activation and suppress gene expression in late L3. PcG-mediated silencing is best characterized for its role in the epigenetic silencing of Hox genes during embryonic development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beuchle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beck et al., 2010</xref>), but also has important functions in imaginal disc development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pirrotta et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maurange and Paro, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Perez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mason-Suares et al., 2013</xref>) and during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klebes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McClure et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Katsuyama et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed inappropriate cell fate switching following damage in imaginal discs (transdetermination) is associated with changes in PcG gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klebes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McClure et al., 2008</xref>), and in one instance JNK signaling reduced the extent of PcG mediated repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). A key property of epigenetic regulation by PcG is the ability to simultaneously silence multiple regions across the genome via the activity of a single master regulator complex, and, moreover, this silencing is heritable and thus its activation can maintain the locus in a repressed state through subsequent cell generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Déjardin and Cavalli, 2005</xref>). Such a mechanism is ideally suited to the sustained and progressive silencing of a regeneration program during the ongoing growth and development of imaginal discs. However, unlike Hox genes, silencing of <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Wnt6</italic> does not involve the entire transcription unit, but rather, is restricted to a damage-responsive enhancer. A similar local mode of epigenetic regulation has been described for the <italic>Drosophila rpr</italic> locus, in which epigenetic blocking of an irradiation-responsive enhancer region through enrichment of H3K27me3 prevents <italic>rpr</italic> expression following irradiation in late embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, the remainder of the <italic>rpr</italic> locus itself remains accessible, and is thus responsive to developmental signals required for programmed cell death to occur in the nervous system in late embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rogulja-Ortmann et al., 2008</xref>). Localized epigenetic silencing of individual regulatory elements is therefore likely an important and potentially pervasive mechanism by which gene expression can be selectively activated or repressed by distinct inputs.</p><p>But how is this epigenetic silencing limited to just the enhancer? Elements that are responsible for expression of the &quot;inner circle&quot; of <italic>wg</italic> expression at the edge of the pouch and for expression in the leg disc are immediately adjacent to the BRV118 enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pereira et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, while the BRV-C fragment nucleates PcG-mediated repression that then spreads over the remainder of the BRV118 enhancer, mechanisms must exist that limit spread beyond the borders of the enhancer and thus preserve the activity of the adjacent developmentally-regulated enhancers. Chromatin boundary elements that are able to block the spread of heterochromatin formation have previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gaszner and Felsenfeld, 2006</xref>) and are found in a variety of organisms including <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Roseman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kahn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). Unlike other boundary elements such as insulators that inhibit enhancer-promoter interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gurudatta and Corces, 2009</xref>), these ‘chromatin barrier’ elements can prevent the propagation of repressive histone marks separately from a role in enhancer blocking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Recillas-Targa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, a similar barrier element might be present within or near BRV118 to limit chromatin modifications to the damage responsive region, yet allow nearby developmental enhancers to remain active.</p><p>If multiple genes that function in regeneration have a similar bipartite mode of regulation, it is unlikely that expressing just one of these genes at a later stage of development can restore the ability to regenerate. Indeed, we found that restoring <italic>wg</italic> expression in day 9 discs did not promote regeneration. In contrast, expression of <italic>Myc</italic>, which is able to increase the levels of expression of both <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Mmp1</italic>, and possibly the expression of other genes that are similarly regulated, was able to enhance regeneration. However, it is likely that Myc does not promote the expression of all genes that have been silenced in late L3. Indeed, unlike <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Mmp1</italic>, we found that the JAK/STAT reporter is not reactivated in mature discs by the presence of Myc (data not shown). In addition, the delay in pupariation is not restored, which possibly results from a failure to restore the damage-responsive DILP8 expression level to that of a younger disc. While we have shown that Myc functions cell autonomously to reactivate BRV118-mediated expression of WNT genes, it is unclear whether Myc reverses the PcG-mediated repression of BRV118 or bypasses it completely. However, since the <italic>BRV-B-Myc</italic> transgene is only expressed in a small region of the disc, it is not easy to detect a change in the overall level of H3K27 methylation at the WNT locus in these cells with confidence. Additionally, even increasing Myc levels has little effect by day 10, suggesting that the silencing mechanism has become even more effective. It might be necessary to combine <italic>Myc</italic> overexpression with other manipulations to restore regeneration at even later stages. Previous studies have implicated Myc as a regulator of chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amente et al., 2011</xref>) and also as a regulator of cellular reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Smith and Dalton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chappell and Dalton, 2013</xref>), and therefore studying the role of Myc in reactivating BRV118-mediated expression might provide a tractable way of understanding the role of Myc in these processes.</p><p>Overall, our investigation has revealed a mechanism by which genes required for both regeneration and development can be regulated to allow the age-dependent restriction of a regenerative response without affecting normal organismal growth and patterning of tissues. As PcG proteins are highly conserved from flies to vertebrates, as indeed are the targets they regulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ringrose, 2007</xref>), it would be of considerable interest to determine whether the loss of regenerative capacity in vertebrates also results from the selective epigenetic silencing of damage-responsive enhancers that regulate orthologs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes that we have studied, such as matrix metalloproteases and WNT genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Fly stocks and ablation experiments</title><p>Stocks and crosses were maintained on yeast food at 25°C, except those for ablation experiments, which were maintained at 18°C.

Larvae were scored for puparium formation every 12 hr from the beginning of the temperature upshift that activates ablation, and throughout the regeneration period in which the larvae were maintained at 18°C. At least 3 independent ablation experiments (separate upshifts) using multiple vials (&gt;250 larvae per repeat) were used to generate pupariation curves, which were plotted to estimate the average delay of puparation following damage.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank D Bilder, A Dernburg, M Welch, D Bohmann, G Morata, A Teleman and G Schubiger for stocks, reagents and equipment.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Hugo Bellen as the Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. One of the three reviewers, Richard Mann, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission..</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes an impressive and exciting study from the Hariharan lab of the function of an apparently regeneration-specific enhancer in promoting regeneration of imaginal discs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The work here significantly advances previous studies of disc regeneration carried out by the Hariharan lab and others and demonstrates that silencing of a specific enhancer plays a major role in limiting a regeneration response to tissue damage. Since many organisms lose the ability to regenerate with increasing age this work suggests a mechanism that may be broadly used.</p><p>Using a conditional system of inducing tissue damage and regeneration the authors explore their previous finding of differences in the regeneration response between damage induced &quot;early&quot;(day 7) versus &quot;late&quot; (day 9), which correlated with ability of Wg to be activated. Here they find that Wg expression during regeneration requires activation of the BRV-118 enhancer, first identified by the late Gerold Schubiger. This enhancer is located at the Wg/Wnt locus and regulates both Wg and <italic>Wnt6</italic>, and its activation occurs after early damage but not late damage. Structure function studies indicate that the enhancer has separate activating and repressive components and consists of an activating region with AP1 sites (among others) and a repressive element that contains PcG binding sites; these factors are demonstrated to be genetically required for the activation and repression, respectively. They observe increased H3K27me, a marker of PcG silencing, on the enhancer after damage at day 9, but not day 7; but none on other regions of <italic>Wnt6</italic> or Wg genes nor on developmental Wg enhancers in L3 during normal development, suggesting selective silencing of this damage-responsive enhancer.</p><p>The authors then use genome editing to delete the repressive region of the enhancer. The resulting flies are viable, and develop relatively normally (except for a held-out wing phenotype like wgP, which also correlates with removal of the enhancer region). H3K27me is absent from BRV-118 region in these flies, consistent with a requirement for the repressive sequences in deposition of H3K27me. When damaged at day 9, however, regeneration was not enhanced over controls with an intact BRV-118 even though Wg expression was induced in the discs similar to an early damage response. However when Myc was driven by BRV-B, Wg, MMP1 and BRV-118:GFP enhancer induction was increased after damage at day 9 and regeneration was improved ~20% over controls. Since the delay was not increased it appears that Myc expression increases the rate of recover, although not sufficient to account for all aspects of regeneration.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors argue that theBRV-118 enhancer is specific to the damage response, stating that it is not expressed in L3 discs under normal conditions. However, I wonder if the authors should consider the idea that the enhancer could be used as a &quot;developmental&quot; enhancer earlier than they have looked. A few of their statements suggest it is worth looking into: they suggest that the <italic>wg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">1</xref></sup></italic> phenotype is due to less robust wing pouch specification; they observe that BRV-118 is not relevant to Wg expression in the notum even after damage; their &quot;early L3&quot; disc is actually not so early, as the Wg pattern is mature in the discs shown; and they make the point that BRV-118:GFP is not expressed in the absence of damage in early L3 wing discs. However, we do not get to see if it is expressed at any earlier stage. What does it look like prior to the maturation of the Wg pattern of expression (at 25<sup>o</sup>C this would correspond to prior to 80-85 hrs AEL)? Is BRV-118 &quot;only&quot; for regeneration, or is it an early (perhaps transient) enhancer that boosts Wg to promote robust wing pouch specification, that has been co-opted for use in regeneration (which also needs a boost)? If so, this would be consistent with and provide support for the view that disc regeneration involves a reversion to earlier developmental state.</p><p><italic>Myc</italic> can induce cellular growth and proliferation.

We have put in a considerable amount of effort into addressing this issue. Thus far, we can find no evidence that this enhancer is expressed above background levels at any stage of disc development. In the revised manuscript, we have included an image from an L2 disc where wingless expression is still in the immature diffuse pattern in the pouch and which shows a clear lack of reporter expression. We have also examined discs from the L1 stage (not easy to dissect and mount) but they do not have any reporter expression above background either.</p><p>This then raises the issue of why the <italic>wg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">1</xref></sup></italic> allele, which has a deletion that approximates the boundaries of the BRV118 fragment we have studied, has an incompletely penetrant phenotype characterized by a defect in wing pouch specification. One possibility is that the <italic>wg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">1</xref></sup></italic> chromosome has a second mutation that is responsible for this phenotype. We have excluded this possibility – we have generated the same deletion using CRISPR-Cas9 on a “clean chromosome” and found that those flies also have the same incompletely-penetrant wing-specification phenotype. We suspect that there might be a developmentally-regulated enhancer that functions early in larval development that is close to the boundary of the <italic>wg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">1</xref></sup></italic> deletion and which may be disrupted by this deletion. However, this enhancer is likely to be distinct from the damage-responsive enhancer since the BRV-118 reporter which contains a robust damage-responsive enhancer is not expressed in the absence of damage. We have included a sentence to summarize this conclusion in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Myc can induce cellular growth and proliferation. Can other inducers of these changes in cellular behavior also rescue regeneration in older discs? In other words, how specific is Myc's ability to do this? Is the myc rescue of regeneration cell autonomous?</italic> </p><p>These are all good points. In the revised manuscript, we have included some additional experimental data that show that reactivation of the enhancer in older imaginal discs appears to be cell autonomous.</p><p>In previous work from our laboratory (Smith-Bolton et al. 2009) we had shown that even in younger discs, <italic>Myc</italic> was more effective at promoting regenerative growth than other growth drivers that we tested (Rheb, CyclinD/CDK4, JAK/STAT). In subsequent unpublished experiments using older discs, we obtained results that hinted that <italic>Myc</italic> might also promote some regeneration in older discs. However in all these experiments, we expressed the growth-promoting gene under UAS control. It was therefore expressed in the ablated cells and in some cells that expressed the proapoptotic gene yet survived the ablation. In this study, we used the BRV-B fragment to target expression to the blastema. Since the earlier experiments suggested that other growth-promoting genes were ineffective at promoting regeneration even in younger discs, we chose to focus our efforts on whether <italic>Myc</italic> could promote regeneration in older discs. Hence when we found a way to target expression to the regeneration blastema using the BRV-B fragment, we only generated BRV-B-driven Myc transgenics and did not pursue the other pathways.</p><p>In response to the reviewers’ suggestion, we came up with a way of testing whether re-activation of the enhancer by <italic>Myc</italic> in older discs is cell autonomous. This is difficult to do using the genetic ablation system. However, the BRV-BC enhancer is also robustly activated by X-irradiation in younger (day 7) discs but is silenced in day 9 discs. By generating FLP-out clones that express UAS-myc, we now show clearly that the re-activation of the enhancer is cell-autonomous. Interestingly, we find that <italic>Myc</italic> activates the silenced enhancer, albeit at a much lower level, in day 9 discs even in the absence of radiation. These data have been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
