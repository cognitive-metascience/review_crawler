Here, we report that yeast chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF1), a conserved histone chaperone complex that deposits H3-H4 during DNA replication, binds a single H3-H4 heterodimer in solution. We identify a new DNA-binding domain in the large Cac1 subunit of CAF1, which is required for high-affinity DNA binding by the CAF1 three-subunit complex, and which is distinct from the previously described C-terminal winged-helix domain. CAF1 binds preferentially to DNA molecules longer than 40 bp, and two CAF1-H3-H4 complexes concertedly associate with DNA molecules of this size, resulting in deposition of H3-H4 tetramers. While DNA binding is not essential for H3–H4 tetrasome deposition in vitro, it is required for efficient DNA synthesis-coupled nucleosome assembly. Mutant histones with impaired H3-H4 tetramerization interactions fail to release from CAF1, indicating that DNA deposition of H3-H4 tetramers by CAF1 requires a hierarchical cooperation between DNA binding, H3-H4 deposition and histone tetramerization.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23474.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23474.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23474.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animal and plant cells contain very long DNA molecules that are tightly packaged by being wrapped around proteins called histones to form structures known as nucleosomes. While this is a useful way to store DNA, it also makes it inaccessible to many proteins and other molecules that activate genes, copy DNA or perform other important cell processes. To enable these processes to take place, the cell can selectively disassemble particular nucleosomes and remove the histone proteins. Afterwards, the nucleosomes must reassemble to repackage the DNA.</p><p>A single nucleosome contains four pairs of histones, with two pairs consisting of a H3 and a H4 histone. Histone chaperones assemble nucleosomes in a two-step process. First, two of these histone H3-H4 pairs (collectively known as a tetramer) interact with DNA to form a group or “complex”. Then, two more pairs of different histones bind to complete the nucleosome. An enzyme called CAF1 is known to attach H3-H4 tetramers onto DNA as the DNA is being copied, which allows nucleosomes to form on the newly made DNA. However, it is not known how CAF1 deposits H3-H4 tetramers onto the DNA.</p><p>Sauer et al. explored how yeast CAF1 works by carrying out a series of experiments in a cell-free system. The experiments showed that each CAF1 enzyme binds to a single H3-H4 pair. When attached to their histone cargo, two CAF1 enzymes bind to DNA and attach a H3-H4 tetramer onto it. The tetramer has to form in this way for histones to be correctly delivered to DNA after the DNA has been copied.</p><p>Sauer et al. also identified a new region of the CAF1 enzyme that binds to DNA. Together with another region, this enables CAF1 to bind to an extended stretch of DNA that accommodates the H3-H4 tetramer. Together, the findings explain the sequence of events that take place when CAF1 attaches H3-H4 tetramers onto DNA in the first step of nucleosome formation. Future work will be required to understand the structure of CAF1 in different situations and to find out how the cell targets this enzyme to stretches of DNA that have just been copied.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23474.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23474.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>histones</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>chromatin assembly factor 1</kwd><kwd>histone chaperone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE11-0028-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sauer</surname><given-names>Paul Victor</given-names></name><name><surname>Timm</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Danni</given-names></name><name><surname>Sitbon</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The CAF1 complex binds single histone H3-H4 dimers, and two such complexes associate with extended DNA elements to ensure the deposition of H3-H4 tetramers, the first step in the assembly of nucleosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nucleosomes in eukaryotic cells enable packaging of the DNA within the cell nucleus and provide an important layer in genome regulation. They are composed of an octameric core of histones, around which 147 bp of DNA are wrapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). The majority of nucleosomes in chromatin contain two copies of each of the four major histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 that are assembled in a step-wise manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith and Stillman, 1991</xref>). Following the initial H3-H4 tetramer, two H2A-H2B dimers are deposited to complete the octameric core particle. Nucleosome assembly is promoted via the action of histone chaperones, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">De Koning et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gurard-Levin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>DNA replication requires doubling of the amount of chromatin which is accomplished through recycling of parental and incorporation of newly synthesized histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Groth, 2009</xref>). It has been suggested that the parental histone modifications are propagated to newly incorporated nucleosomes upon cell division (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Margueron and Reinberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Probst et al., 2009</xref>), however whether a purely histone-based inheritance mechanism exists remains a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ptashne, 2013</xref>), and the mechanism of how histone modifications are maintained following DNA replication remains unclear.</p><p>Cumulative evidence supports the model that upon replication, parental H3-H4 are conservatively propagated as tetramers in proliferating cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jackson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prior et al., 1980</xref>). Newly deposited H3-H4 tetramers are assembled entirely of new histones thus precluding the acquisition of new histone modifications based on preexisting parental modifications within the same nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Katan-Khaykovich and Struhl, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, one mechanism to ensure the maintenance of epigenetic modification could involve a read-write mechanism in which parental histone modifications are copied over to newly incorporated nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Probst et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ragunathan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A central, unanswered question is how parental H3-H4 tetramers are propagated and how new H3-H4 tetramers are assembled behind the replication fork. The conservative nature of tetramer propagation and de novo assembly could be due to the biochemical properties of the histone chaperone machinery that operates at the replication fork. A number of histone chaperones including antisilencing function 1 (Asf1) and DAXX bind H3-H4 dimers but not tetramers, indicating that chaperon-mediated tetramer assembly requires a two-step mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Elsässer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">English et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Natsume et al., 2007</xref>). Asf1 associates with H3-H4 and Mcm2, a subunit of the replicative helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Groth et al., 2007</xref>). A crystal structure of the complex and binding studies reveal a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry indicating that dimeric H3-H4 is propagated at replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Richet et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, a current model suggests that the Mcm2-Asf1 complex mediates the passing of parental H3-H4 through transient tetramer disruption and conservative reassembly onto DNA behind the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clément and Almouzni, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Richet et al., 2015</xref>). This model underlines the importance of H3-H4 dimers as intermediates even for the recycling of parental histones and raises the question of how such dimers are reassembled into tetramers behind the replication fork.</p><p>Chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF1) is a histone chaperone complex that deposits new H3-H4 de novo in a DNA-synthesis-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smith and Stillman, 1989</xref>) and is functionally conserved throughout eukaryotes. CAF1 contains three subunits: p150, p60 and p48 (Cac1, Cac2 and Cac3 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaufman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Verreault et al., 1996</xref>). CAF1 is recruited to the replication fork by interaction of the p150 subunit with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the DNA polymerase processivity clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gérard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shibahara and Stillman, 1999</xref>). Human CAF1 preferentially interacts with the replication-dependent histones H3.1/2 but not with the replication-independent histone variant H3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>). Budding yeast contains only a H3.3 ortholog which is used in both replication-dependent and independent H3 deposition pathways.</p><p>The C-terminal region of p150 contains a conserved Winged-helix DNA-binding domain (WHD) that is thought to contribute to stabilization of CAF1 at the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). The p60 subunit preferentially associates with Asf1b in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abascal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gurard-Levin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>), and Asf1 is thought to deliver H3-H4 dimers to CAF1 for deposition onto DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tyler et al., 1999</xref>). The p48 subunit (Rb-associated protein RbAp48) interacts with a single H3-H4 dimer through the N-terminal tail of H3 and the N-terminal helix of H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nowak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmitges et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Song et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). However, in the context of CAF1, the N-terminal H3 and H4 tails are not essential for histone deposition activity, indicating that additional contacts are made between p150 and/or p60 and the H3-H4 core histone fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shibahara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Winkler et al., 2012</xref>), a model supported by recent hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HX) data and cross-linking MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Whether CAF1 binds a H3-H4 dimer or tetramer has remained controversial. Human CAF1 has been found to bind a single H3-H4 dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>), whereas yeast CAF1 (yCAF1) has been reported to bind H3-H4 tetramers in a non-canonical conformation in vitro and in vivo and prior to deposition onto DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Winkler et al., 2012</xref>). Further, it has been proposed that the Cac1 subunit in isolation is sufficient to enable H3-H4 tetramerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Together, the model is emerging that H3-H4 are maintained as dimers from synthesis up until tetramer assembly by CAF1. Whether the tetramerization of H3-H4 occurs on CAF1 prior to deposition onto DNA or via a sequential CAF1-mediated deposition of two H3-H4 dimers onto DNA, remains unclear.</p><p>To explore the molecular mechanism underlying H3-H4 deposition by CAF1, we performed structure-function analysis of yCAF1 and of the yCAF1-H3-H4 complex and analyzed the histone deposition reaction onto DNA. We report that yCAF1 binds a single H3-H4 heterodimer and prevents H3-H4 tetramer formation. Our data imply that two yCAF1-H3-H4 complexes cooperate for assembly and deposition of H3-H4 tetramers. Biochemical studies show that the Cac1 subunit contacts DNA through a DNA-binding domain that is located in the region comprising the predicted coiled-coil segment of Cac1 and that high affinity DNA-binding also requires the WHD domain. High affinity DNA-binding by yCAF1 requires a B-form DNA substrate in the range of ~40–80 bp, due to cooperative binding of two yCAF1 complexes. Such extended DNA substrates allow deposition of H3-H4 tetramers by yCAF1. While DNA binding does not prove necessary for tetramer deposition using purified components, it is required for DNA synthesis-coupled nucleosome assembly in an in vitro assembly system. DNA-binding deficient mutants retained the ability to bind H3-H4 heterodimers yet histone binding per se was not sufficient for the chaperone activity of yCAF1. In addition, H3-H4 binding to yCAF1 and yAsf1 or Mcm2 was mutually exclusive suggesting a possible hand-over mechanism for final H3-H4 tetramer deposition onto DNA by yCAF1. Finally, we report that H3-H4 tetramerization is required for release of H3-H4 from yCAF1 during DNA deposition. We thus propose a model in which two yCAF1-H3-H4 complexes cooperatively bind to an extended DNA element enabling deposition of two copies of H3-H4, the first step in nucleosome formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression and purification of yCAF1 variants</title><p>Budding yeast CAF1 (yCAF1) is a heterotrimeric complex containing the Cac1, Cac2 and Cac3 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaufman et al., 1997</xref>). Cac1 contains a predicted coiled-coil region rich in amino acid residues K/E/R, an acidic E/D domain and a C-terminal WHD, which was shown to interact with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Cac2 and Cac3 are predicted WD40 domain proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While Cac2 contains a C-terminal Asf1 interaction motif, Cac3 is predicted, based on sequence similarity to the mammalian ortholog RbAp48, to interact with histones H3-H4. To determine the molecular architecture of the yCAF1 complex, we established a co-expression system for Cac1, Cac2 and Cac3 in insect cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Expression and purification of this complex yielded a stable, monodisperse heterotrimeric yCAF1 complex with 1:1:1 stoichiometry, as judged from size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This complex was able to bind histones H3-H4 to yield a homogeneous complex that, despite the additional mass, had a slightly smaller hydrodynamic radius as indicated by mobility on the size-exclusion column (see also below). To derive further insights into the architecture of the yCAF1 complex and its interaction with H3-H4, we used limited proteolysis to identify stable yCAF1 subcomplexes. In agreement with disorder predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we found that while Cac2 and Cac3 were mostly protease cleavage resistant, Cac1 was readily cleaved into smaller fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed a C-terminal fragment of Cac1 (Cac1T; amino acid residues 230–606). Using this information, we designed a series of N- and C-terminal Cac1 truncations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and co-expressed these with Cac2 and Cac3 in insect cells. We found that all the Cac1 truncation variants were able to bind to Cac2 and Cac3 allowing purification of stable and monodisperse heterotrimeric complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). These data show that the Cac1 region required for interaction is located in the segment spanning amino acid residues 230–494. All the yCAF1 variants described here retained the ability to bind H3-H4, indicating that the deleted regions of Cac1 are not essential for histone interaction. Additional limited proteolysis revealed yCAF1 complex dissociation during SEC analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). LC-MS analysis showed that peak two contained a complex of Cac1 comprising amino acid residues 234–442 and close to full-length Cac3 spanning amino acid residues 5–422. This complex did not retain Cac2 binding activity, which migrated as separate peak on the SEC column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This Cac2 fragment, spanning residues 1–434, was only missing the B domain, a known binding site for yAsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Malay et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore tentatively assign the Cac2 and Cac3 binding regions on Cac1 to amino acid residues 443–489 and 234–442, respectively. The assignment of the Cac2 and Cac3 binding regions on Cac1 is in agreement with earlier data from yeast and human CAF1 and emphasizes the conserved nature of the CAF1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaufman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krawitz et al., 2002</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23474.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Overall biophysical parameters of yCAF1. Column labeling: SEC-MALLS (Size-exclusion chromatography - multi-angle laser light scattering); EQ-AUC (equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation); SV-AUC (sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation); SAXS (small angle X-ray scattering); Native MS (native mass spectrometry); <italic>MM<sub>SLS</sub></italic> (Molar masses determined by SEC-MALLS); <italic>MM<sub>AUC</sub></italic> (Molar masses determined by equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation); <italic>s<sup>0</sup><sub>20,w</sub></italic> (Sedimentation coefficient determined by velocity analytical ultracentrifugation)<italic>; s<sub>th</sub></italic> (computed sedimentation coefficient derived from SAXS envelopes); <italic>R<sub>g</sub></italic> (radius of gyration); <italic>MM<sub>SAXS</sub></italic> (molar masses determined by SAXS); <italic>D<sub>max</sub></italic> (maximum dimension); <italic>V<sub>p</sub></italic> (excluded particle Volume); <italic>MM<sub>MS</sub></italic> (molar masses determined by native MS; <italic>MM<sub>th</sub></italic> (theoretical molar mass calculated).</p><p>The errors reported for SEC-MALLS are the residual standard deviations of the observed data from the fitted values calculated using Astra.

For yCAF1-H3-H4, we obtained an <italic>R<sub>g</sub> of</italic> 6.02 and a <italic>D<sub>max</sub></italic> of 25 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The molecular masses determined from SAXS were 175 kDa (yCAF1) and 203 kDa (yCAF1-H3-H4), in close agreement with those determined from orthogonal methods (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). <italic>Ab initio</italic> reconstructions showed an elongated particle for yCAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In the H3-H4-bound form, a similar elongated shape was obtained with additional mass towards the center of the particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). <italic>Ab initio</italic> calculation of the Svedberg coefficients of yCAF1 and yCAF1-H3-H4 using the molecular envelopes obtained from the SAXS experiments also match the measured Svedberg values from sedimentation velocity AUC experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), also emphasizing the elongated shape of the particle. For yCAF1T we obtained an <italic>R<sub>g</sub> of</italic> 5.66 nm and a <italic>D<sub>max</sub></italic> of 20 nm and for the H3-H4-bound complex an <italic>R<sub>g</sub> of</italic> 5.10 nm and a <italic>D<sub>max</sub></italic> of 17.3 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). <italic>Ab initio</italic> reconstructions also showed an elongated particle for yCAF1T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). As for yCAF1, addition of H3-H4 to yCAF1T, resulted in additional mass towards the center of the particle. Based on the overall reduction of the particle diameter of yCAF1T, which matches the expected volume of the flexible N-terminal region of Cac1, we suggest that the bulk of this segment is located there. Comparison of H3-H4-bound and unbound yCAF1 variants indicates that the histone heterodimer is positioned towards the center of the particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). We consistently observed, as also shown in SEC-MALLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), a smaller radius of gyration for the H3-H4-bound yCAF1 complexes, indicative of conformational compaction upon histone binding. Together, a series of rigorous and complementary biophysical techniques led us to conclude that yCAF1 forms an elongated trimer with 1:1:1 stoichiometry, which binds a single H3-H4 heterodimer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>DNA-binding elements of the yCAF1 complex</title><p>Previous data show that Cac1 contains a C-terminal WHD DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). The WHD binds to a 10–16 bp DNA element in a non-specific fashion with a dissociation constant K<sub>d</sub> of ~2 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). As previous studies were limited to the isolated WHD, we investigated the DNA-binding requirements of full-length yCAF1. Purification of the yCAF1 complex from insect cells revealed the presence of contaminating nucleic acids and insect cell histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 suggesting that yCAF1 potentially directly interacts with nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To test this model, we analyzed binding of yCAF1 to reconstituted nucleosome core particles using recombinantly produced <italic>Xenopus</italic> histones, which were assembled on a 147 bp DNA fragment containing the 601 nucleosome positioning sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lowary and Widom, 1998</xref>). Native PAGE analysis showed that these preparations contained nucleosomes and a fraction of unbound 147 bp DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Titration of the yCAF1 complex showed that in this direct competition assay, yCAF1 preferentially interacted with the naked DNA but not with the nucleosome core particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, lanes 2–8). Thus, surfaces of H3-H4 that are required for yCAF1 binding are buried once these histones are assembled into nucleosomes.</p><p>We found that yCAF1 bound to the 147 bp DNA fragment with a dissociation constant K<sub>D</sub> of ~2.1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). Quantitative analysis of the binding reaction showed a Hill coefficient of 2.0, indicative of cooperative binding. yCAF1U, a construct lacking the WHD domain had a K<sub>D</sub> of ~4.1 μM, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). The non-conserved N-terminal region (amino acids 1–129) did not contribute significantly to DNA binding as a construct lacking this segment (CAF1X) had similar DNA-binding affinity (5.7 μM). yCAF1U and yCAF1X showed less steep binding isotherms but still largely retained their ability to assemble cooperatively as judged by a positive Hill coefficient (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). yCAF1T, a variant lacking the N-terminal 229 amino acids including the K/E/R-rich coiled-coil, showed no detectable DNA binding, despite the fact that it contained the WHD domain indicating that the DNA-binding activity of the WHD domain is masked. yCAF1V, which contained a deletion of the WHD, showed also no detectable DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that the region spanning the K/E/R-rich coiled-coil segment of Cac1 contains a DNA-binding domain which appears to hierarchically cooperate with the C-terminal WHD for high-affinity DNA binding as constructs lacking this domain are devoid of DNA binding. The WHD contributes to overall DNA-binding avidity but is not sufficient to enable high affinity binding in the absence of the coiled-coil domain.<table-wrap id="tbl4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23474.011</object-id><label>Table 4.</label><caption><p>DNA binding by yCAF1.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23474.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23474.011</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Protein sample</th><th>DNA substrate</th><th>K<sub>D</sub> [μM] *</th><th>Hill coefficient</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>yCAF1</td><td valign="top">147 bp</td><td>2.1 ± 0.1</td><td>2.0 ± 0.4</td></tr><tr><td/><td valign="top">84 bp</td><td>2.3 ± 0.3</td><td>2.2 ± 0.3</td></tr><tr><td/><td valign="top">42 bp</td><td>2.5 ± 0.5</td><td>2.2 ± 0.4</td></tr><tr><td/><td valign="top">17 bp</td><td>5.1 ± 1.0</td><td>1.3 ± 0.2</td></tr><tr><td>yCAF1U</td><td valign="top">147 bp</td><td>4.1 ± 1.9</td><td>4.3 ± 5.8</td></tr><tr><td>yCAF1V</td><td valign="top">147 bp</td><td>&gt;10</td><td>N.D.</td></tr><tr><td>yCAF1X</td><td valign="top">147 bp</td><td>5.7 ± 1. 7</td><td>2.9 ± 0.6</td></tr><tr><td>yCAF1T</td><td valign="top">147 bp</td><td>&gt;10</td><td>N.D.</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn3"><p>*Values determined from experiments using the 147, 84, 42 or 17 bp DNA fragment.

While this would not be unusual for a DNA-binding factor, the fact that yCAF1 discriminated against DNA shorter than 40 bp was unexpected as the WHD binds DNA of 10–16 bp length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). To further test the interplay between DNA substrate length and yCAF1 binding efficacy we investigated whether yCAF1 can also cooperatively bind to DNA molecules that are shorter than 40 bp in length. We performed DNA-binding assays with 17 bp, 42 bp or 84 bp DNA substrates and analyzed the binding isotherms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In agreement with our previous results we observed that while 42 bp and 84 bp DNA were clearly bound cooperatively by yCAF1 (Hill coefficient of 2.2 for both substrates), the 17 bp DNA substrate displayed standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Hill coefficient of 1.3) indicative of a single binding site (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). Of note, while yCAF1 efficiently bound to free B-DNA, the DNA geometry of the nucleosome core particle, a reaction product of yCAF1-mediated assembly, is not compatible with yCAF1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Together, our results suggest that yCAF1 uses a two-pronged DNA-binding mode involving the WHD and the coiled-coil segment of Cac1. Optimal yCAF1 DNA binding requires regular B-DNA geometry and a minimum of ~40 bp length.<table-wrap id="tbl5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23474.014</object-id><label>Table 5.</label><caption><p>Sequence information on 10 bp DNA ladder (Promega). AT content (%) for all DNA fragments is 60%.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23474.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23474.014</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Length (bp)</th><th>Sequence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>10</td><td valign="top">GGACTATACT</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>GGACTATACTAGACATTGAC</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>GGACTATACTAGACATTGACGTGGTTGTAA</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>GGACTATACTAGACATTGACGTGGTTGTAAGATGATCATG</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>GGACTATACTAGACATTGACGTGGTTGTAAGATGATCATGTGTTAATGGC</td></tr><tr><td>60</td><td>GGACTATACTAGACATTGACGTGGTTGTAAGATGATCATGTGTTAATGGCAAGGTGAGTT</td></tr><tr><td>70</td><td>CATGATCATCTTACAACCACGTCAATGTCTAGTATAGTCCTACTCTGTGATATGGTTCTCTGTCGATGTA</td></tr><tr><td>80</td><td>GCCATTAACACATGATCATCTTACAACCACGTCAATGTCTAGTATAGTCCTACTCTGTGATATGGTTCTCTGTCGATGTA</td></tr><tr><td>90</td><td>AACTCACCTTGCCATTAACACATGATCATCTTACAACCACGTCAATGTCTAGTATAGTCCTACTCTGTGATATGGTTCTCTGTCGATGTA</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>ATGATCATCTAACTCACCTTGCCATTAACACATGATCATCTTACAACCACGTCAATGTCTAGTATAGTCCTACTCTGTGATATGGTTCTCTGTCGATGTA</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DNA-binding by yCAF1 is not essential for tetrasome deposition with purified components</title><p>Considering that two yCAF1-H3-H4 complexes need to come together for assembly of two copies of H3-H4 on DNA to form so-called ‘tetrasomes’, we hypothesized that the DNA length requirements are due to binding of two complexes to an extended DNA substrate for histone deposition.

With both mutant complexes, addition of yCAF1-H3-H4 to DNA resulted in the appearance of tetrasomes and free yCAF1T or yCAF1V. Only when the free DNA was exhausted from the reaction, the excess yCAF1T-H3-H4 or yCAF1V-H3-H4 complexes were seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, right panels, lanes 8–10). As expected for these DNA-binding deficient variants, free yCAF1T or yCAF1V, liberated during the histone deposition reaction, did not interact with the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, left panels, lanes 3–10). For the DNA-binding competent yCAF1U and yCAF1X, as for wild-type yCAF1, we observed in addition to tetrasome deposition, that the released yCAF1U or yCAF1X further partitioned into a DNA-bound complex at lower concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>, left panel, lanes 3–10) or free yCAF1U or yCAF1X when in excess over DNA. Together, we conclude that DNA binding by yCAF1 is not necessary to mediate H3-H4 deposition in vitro. Addition of DNA consistently resulted in tetrasome deposition and release of H3-H4 from yCAF1. In no instance could we detect a yCAF1-H3-H4-DNA co-complex. Supporting this model, a yCAF1-DNA complex formed in the absence of H3-H4 migrated at a similar position on the native PAGE gel as the yCAF1-DNA complexes seen in the H3-H4 deposition reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>To assess the contribution of the H3-H3’ tetramerization interface, we produced a yCAF1 complex bound to the H3M-H4 mutant and analyzed DNA deposition. This complex was deficient in histone deposition on DNA as seen by a lack of disome or tetrasome deposition. Instead, mostly non-specific binding is seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, left panel, lanes 4–10). Apparently this defect arose due to a failure to release histones from yCAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right panel, lanes 3–9). Released yCAF1 would be expected to migrate as the free yCAF1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lane 12). While some free yCAF1 is seen at the highest concentration used (10 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lane 10), the amounts of free yCAF1 were clearly lower than that seen in other DNA deposition assays. We also confirmed the deposition defect directly by extracting the yCAF1-DNA bands from the native PAGE gel followed by analysis by SDS-PAGE. As expected, in the absence of DNA, the extracted yCAF1-H3-H4 band, which migrated close to top of the gel (* in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 11), showed yCAF1 and bound H3-H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>, lane 1). With wild-type H3-H4, the DNA-bound complex (* in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 7), showed yCAF1 but no H3-H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>, lane 2), showing that yCAF1 had released H3-H4. However with the H3M-H4 mutant, the DNA-bound yCAF1 complex (* in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lane 8) contained H3M-H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>, lane 3), demonstrating that the deposition defect arose due to a failure to release H3-H4 from yCAF1. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence that the ability of H3-H4 to tetramerize upon DNA deposition contributes to histone release from yCAF1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>DNA-binding of yCAF1 is required for DNA synthesis-coupled nucleosome assembly</title><p>Our biochemical studies suggest a mechanism in which two yCAF1-H3-H4 complexes cooperatively bind to an extended DNA sequence element to assemble and deposit H3-H4 tetrasomes.

Such p150-depleted extracts were unable to assemble chromatin in a DNA synthesis-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lane 4). Previous data show that these HSEs can be complemented with human p150 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Quivy et al., 2001</xref>). Here, we report that addition of increasing amounts of yCAF1 rescued DNA synthesis-dependent chromatin assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lane 4–7). This experiment allowed us to establish limiting concentrations of yCAF1 that allow nucleosome assembly, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mello et al., 2002</xref>). The different CAF1 mutants showed, to varying degrees, defects in DNA synthesis-coupled nucleosome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and specific conditions allowed us to discriminate for their efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). The construct lacking the coiled-coil K/E/R domain (yCAF1T) showed residual nucleosome assembly activity as judged by the relative intensity of supercoiled product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Constructs lacking the WHD (yCAF1U) or both the N-terminal region and WHD (yCAF1X), showed more deficient nucleosome assembly activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). yCAF1V, a variant containing a deletion of both the coiled-coil and WHD of Cac1 showed the greatest assembly defect, as judged from the amount of supercoiled plasmid product (labeled I in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This defect of yCAF1V was even observable when increasing the yCAF1-DNA ratio such that all other mutants were able to almost fully compensate for the nucleosome assembly defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The mutants yCAF1T and yCAF1V contain a partially truncated PIP motif in which the first two residues of the conserved Q-x-x-I-x-x-F-F motif are absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As this motif is a PCNA binding site, we asked whether the nucleosome assembly defect of these mutants is due interference with PCNA binding. A FLAG-pulldown experiment showed that yCAF1V was able to interact with PCNA, albeit to a lesser extent than yCAF1 wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5-supplemental figure 1C</xref>). We therefore cannot fully exclude that the defective PIP motif contributes to the phenotype that we describe here. However it is clear that DNA binding is required for yCAF1 activity. The two DNA-binding domains were essential for CAF1 activity as the absence of either domain interfered to different degrees with DNA synthesis-dependent chromatin assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Interaction of yCAF1 with Asf1 and Mcm2</title><p>A current model suggests that upon DNA replication, parental H3-H4 are transiently maintained as dimers by Mcm2-Asf1 and reassembled into tetramers by CAF1 behind the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clément and Almouzni, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Richet et al., 2015</xref>). Asf1 is known to interact with the Cac2/p60 subunit of CAF1 possibly to enable histone transfer between the two chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Malay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mello et al., 2002</xref>). To assess a possible histone hand-over mechanism from Asf1-Mcm2 towards yCAF1, we systematically analyzed various combinations of these histone chaperones in the absence or presence of H3-H4 substrate by SEC-MALLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6">Table 6</xref>). yAsf1 and yCAF1 did not interact under these conditions, presumably due to the transient nature of this interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Malay et al., 2008</xref>). In the presence of H3-H4, we observed yCAF1-H3-H4 and Asf1-H3-H4 but no higher-order complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Addition of a fivefold molar excess of preassembled Asf1-H3-H4 to yCAF1 resulted in appearance of a yCAF1-H3-H4 complex, due to transfer of H3-H4 from Asf1 to yCAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These data show that yCAF1 is able to receive H3-H4 from Asf1, but that there is no stable higher-order complex of these histone chaperones. An N-terminal fragment of Mcm2, spanning amino acid residues 1–160 and sufficient for H3-H4 binding, also did not interact directly with yCAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). In a direct competition assay, H3-H4 interacted preferentially with yCAF1 and Mcm2 migrated in its unbound form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Incubation of a fivefold molar excess of Mcm2-H3-H4 with yCAF1 resulted in transfer of H3-H4 to yCAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Finally, addition of equimolar ratios of the three chaperones Mcm2 (1-160), yAsf1 and yCAF1 followed by addition of H3-H4 led to the formation of the yCAF1-H3-H4 and yAsf1-H3-H4-Mcm2 complexes. Of note, the molecular masses obtained are compatible with the model that a single H3-H4 dimer is bound to the complexes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6">Table 6</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23474.020</object-id><label>Table 6.</label><caption><p>Summary of SEC-MALLS data.

Previous data are based on fluorescence titration or FRET experiments which show that yCAF1 binds two copies of H3-H4 or a covalently crosslinked H3-H4 tetramer with high (K<sub>D</sub><sup>app</sup> ~5 nM) binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Winkler et al., 2012</xref>). Our data suggest that high-affinity histone binding by yCAF1 is driven, at least in part, by the highly polar DNA-binding surface of H3-H4. Considering that the DNA-binding surface is maintained in the crosslinked H3-H4 tetramer, it is not too surprising that this substrate binds with high affinity if it can be accommodated sterically.</p><p>We found that yCAF1 can receive H3-H4 from Asf1 or Mcm2 without forming a stable higher-order complex among these histone chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, we propose that the mechanism of H3-H4 tetrasome assembly by yCAF1 requires yAsf1- or Mcm2-dependent transfer of H3-H4 towards yCAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Although the Cac1 subunit contains a reported DNA-binding WHD that binds to 10–16 bp DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), this domain is not sufficient for high-affinity DNA binding. In agreement, point mutations that abolish DNA binding of the isolated WHD do not abolish DNA binding by yCAF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, the WHD clearly contributes to overall yCAF1 activity and might play a role in transcriptional silencing activity and the DNA damage response presumably by aiding recruitment of yCAF1 to replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23474.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for yCAF1 recruitment and H3-H4 deposition.</title><p>Free monomeric yCAF1 (step 1) is loaded with dimeric H3-H4 through association of yAsf1 with the Cac2 subunit.

This region is also critical in human p150, as a deletion mutant spanning the equivalent region (amino acids 311–445) abolishes chromatin assembly activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaufman et al., 1995</xref>). We identified two mutants, yCAF1T and yCAF1V, that were deficient in DNA interaction but that retained H3-H4-binding activity. Counterintuitively, the WHD appears to be inert for DNA binding in yCAF1T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Previous hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HX) data indicate that H3-H4 binding results in structural rearrangements in Cac1 as evidenced by increased HX for amino acids 550–591 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, H3-H4 binding to yCAF1 could result in unmasking of the DNA-binding activity of the WHD. However DNA synthesis-dependent chromatin assembly requires the presence of both the coiled-coil K/E/R and WHD DNA-binding domains.</p><p>yCAF1 binds preferentially to DNA of 40–80 bp length and we find that binding to such extended DNA elements is cooperative. Assembly of H3-H4 tetrasomes requires a DNA substrate of similar length ~60–80 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). Cooperative binding usually requires some form of interaction between binding partners but we do not find evidence for yCAF1 or yCAF1-H3-H4 dimerization in solution. Previous studies have indicated, that the isolated Cac1 subunit and the p150 ortholog, have a tendency to dimerize in the absence of their binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gérard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Quivy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Winkler et al., 2012</xref>). A C-terminal fragment of Cac1, spanning amino acid residues 385–606, is sufficient to bind H3-H4 and to promote deposition of a H3-H4 tetramer onto DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), but the physiological relevance of dimerization of isolated Cac1/p150 remains unclear. yCAF1 binds cooperatively with DNA and when loaded with H3-H4 heterodimers, this results in tetrasome deposition. Our model is that histone tetramerization gives directionality to the deposition reaction as it is required for histone release from yCAF1. H3-H4 tetramers interact with higher binding affinity (~1 nM) with DNA as compared to yCAF1 (~5 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Winkler et al., 2012</xref>). A H3M-H4 mutant is expected to show decreased DNA-binding affinity as tetramerization stabilizes H3-H4 on DNA. However the H3M-H4 mutant retains high affinity (~5.5 nM) yCAF1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Winkler et al., 2012</xref>), likely explaining the failure to release from yCAF1 in a DNA deposition assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>yCAF1 has a preference for regular B-DNA as we failed to detect binding to nucleosome core particles that are known to contain DNA with unusual conformational parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). An extended nucleosome-free DNA region of ~250 bp is present behind and ~300 bp ahead of the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gasser et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sogo et al., 1986</xref>). Nucleosome assembly occurs as soon as DNA of sufficient length to wrap around the histone octamer core has passed through the replication machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sogo et al., 1986</xref>). Thus it is conceivable that the DNA-binding preferences of yCAF1 described here allow yCAF1 to ‘sense’ regions of extended nucleosome-free DNA and promote nucleosome assembly preferentially onto the nucleosome-free region of replicating DNA. In contrast, assembled chromatin, which contains nucleosomes separated by small linker DNA (~15–20 bp on average in yeast), would be expected not to allow the yCAF1 binding thereby preventing its action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radman-Livaja and Rando, 2010</xref>). This could explain why yCAF1 does not promote significant nucleosome assembly in the absence of ongoing DNA replication. Not unlike what we propose here for yCAF1, direct DNA binding by HIRA and Rtt106, histone chaperone complexes involved in deposition of different H3 variants, has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ray-Gallet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schneiderman et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>PCNA has long been reported to act as the key recruitment vehicle for CAF1 at replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moggs et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shibahara and Stillman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>). Yeast Cac1 contains one PCNA binding site (PIP) that is conserved from yeast to human p150 and is required for interaction with PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krawitz et al., 2002</xref>). We suggest that yCAF1 recruitment to sites of DNA replication requires cooperation between DNA binding and PCNA interaction. Such dependencies are frequently seen in chromatin regulators that utilize high-affinity nucleic acid-binding domains coupled to low-affinity binding modules that recognize histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ptashne, 2009</xref>). The high-affinity interactions thereby reduce the entropic penalty of bringing the weakly binding modules and their substrate together and expand the dynamic range for local recruitment by increasing affinity up to several-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ptashne, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our data are consistent with a model where two yCAF1-H3-H4 complexes cooperatively bind to an extended DNA sequence element to deposit H3-H4 tetrasomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In solution, H3-H4 tetramerization in the yCAF1 complex is not permitted, possibly because residues in the H3-H3’ dimerization interface are occluded. Furthermore, considering that H3-H4 binding to yCAF1 or DNA is mutually exclusive, we propose that yCAF1 interacts with the DNA-binding surface of H3-H4. This model is also consistent with our competition experiments with Mcm2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). All the yCAF1 variants analyzed allowed tetrasome assembly using purified components, but the presence of the DNA-binding domains is required for DNA synthesis-coupled nucleosome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). H3-H4 tetramerization stabilizes the H3-H4 dimers on DNA and triggers the release from yCAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This model is in agreement with data showing that H3-H4 dimers do not assemble as tetramers prior to deposition onto DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>) and puts forward the importance of a series of coordinated transitions that require the unique DNA-binding properties of yCAF1. Together, we propose a model for DNA synthesis-coupled chromatin assembly in which (i) yCAF1 binds to a single H3-H4 dimer, (ii) two yCAF1-H3-H4 complexes can bind to nascent DNA in a concerted manner enabling H3-H4 tetramer formation on DNA, which (iii) results in release of histones from yCAF1. The DNA substrate requirements of the reaction could fit nicely with the length of Okazaki fragments during replication on the lagging strand, the periodic sizing of which also depends on yCAF1-dependent histone deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith and Whitehouse, 2012</xref>), and would also be relevant during nucleotide excision repair. Future work, in vivo and in other organisms, should address how the mechanistic insights provided here are linked to inheritance of chromatin-based information.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construct design, generation of baculoviruses and expression in Hi5 cells</title><p>The three yCAF1 subunits Cac1, Cac2 and Cac3 from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> were amplified by PCR from pPK133, pPK160 and pPK134 and cloned into the pIDC, pIDK and pFL vectors for the Multibac system using InFusion cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trowitzsch et al., 2010</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Insights into the molecular architecture and histone H3-H4 deposition mechanism of the Chromatin assembly factor 1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers find that the paper describes novel aspects of the mechanism of histone (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetrasome deposition by Chromatin Assembly Factor-1, particularly in regard to the role of DNA binding in the reaction.</p><p>Central conclusions:</p><p>1) There is a previously unrecognized DNA binding domain in the Cac1 subunit of yeast CAF-1 that is distinct from the winged-helix domain (WHD) near the C-terminus.</p><p>2) This DNA binding domain is required for efficient histone deposition in vitro.</p><p>3) Under the conditions used here, the CAF-1 complex interacts with a H3-H4 dimer, rather than a tetramer as suggested by previous studies.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is insufficient comparison of these results to previous studies of the stoichiometry of histone binding, which came to a different conclusion. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the size exclusion profile of CAF-1 and CAF1-H3-H4 complex is totally different from previous data. Winkler et al. 2012 show clear separation between CAF-1 and CAF1-histone complexes via S200 size exclusion chromatography. The tetramerization of H3-H4 is sensitive to ionic strength, and it must be noted that the buffer conditions used here, especially with regard to ionic strength, were considerably different in some cases to those that have been previously published. For example, Winkler et al. 2012 carry out SEC-MALS under 150 mM NaCl and find that yCAF1 binds a tetramer of H3-H4, whereas in this present study 500 mM NaCl was used for SEC-MALS and SAXS, 200 mM NaCl used for AUC and 250 mM ammonium acetate used for native-MS.

For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the size exclusion profile of CAF-1 and CAF1-H3-H4 complex is totally different from previous data. Winkler et al. 2012 show clear separation between CAF-1 and CAF1-histone complexes via S200 size exclusion chromatography. The tetramerization of H3-H4 is sensitive to ionic strength, and it must be noted that the buffer conditions used here, especially with regard to ionic strength, were considerably different in some cases to those that have been previously published. For example, Winkler et al. 2012 carry out SEC-MALS under 150 mM NaCl and find that yCAF1 binds a tetramer of H3-H4, whereas in this present study 500 mM NaCl was used for SEC-MALS and SAXS, 200 mM NaCl used for AUC and 250 mM ammonium acetate used for native-MS. Is there any significance to the choices of conditions used here? Did the authors test what oligomerization state the free H3-H4 was in under the given assay conditions in MALS, AUC and Mass Spec? Because of these discrepancies, the authors need to test how differences in experimental conditions might affect the results.</italic> </p><p>We have attempted to reproduced the results shown by Winkler et al. 2012 and found that these conditions (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl, 5% glycerol and 1 mM TCEP) repeatedly resulted in poor sample behavior as judged by the higher polydispersity of the eluting complex and multiple ‘shoulders’ when using a &gt;90% pure sample (see Author response image 1). We repeatedly obtained (as also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) monodisperse CAF1 and CAF1-H3-H4 complexes in 500 mM NaCl and consistently found that the histone-bound complexes almost elute at the same position as CAF1 alone. Further optimization of the buffer conditions for CAF1 was performed using standard thermofluor assays which can be used to assess sample stability.</p><p>Of note, Liu et al. 2012 also analyzed the CAF1 and CAF1-H3-H4 complex by gel filtration in buffer containing 300 mM NaCl and found, in agreement with our results, the two complexes eluting a similar position from the column (Liu et al., 2012). Thus, conditions used by Winkler et al. 2012 appear to adversely affect sample behavior. Any determination of mass and stoichiometry under such non-optimal conditions is of course difficult (see table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23474.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23474.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23474.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23474-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>To validate our results, we used methods that allow mass determination independently of shape and matrix interactions such as AUC and native-MS.

As a result, the binding isotherms are more variable and show higher error bars as compared to yCAF1. It is not possible to reliably quantify kinetic parameters from these data to clearly distinguish between Hill coefficients of 2-4. It is however clear that the binding isotherms do not fit to a Hill coefficient of 1 (non-cooperative binding). Even in some of the best studied systems such as hemoglobin, in which four oxygen molecules are known to bind with positive cooperativity, the measured Hill coefficient ranges from 1.7 to 3.2 rather than 4 (Weiss, 1997).</p><p>As there are a number of binding sites available on the extended DNA substrate, the Hill coefficient in this case provides more an ‘interaction’ coefficient reflecting cooperative binding rather than as a reliable estimate of binding sites (Weiss, 1997).

New experiments done on 4% Polyacrylamide gels show however that CAF1 forms a well-defined DNA complex that migrates into the gel (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We also show the full gel for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> as requested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As indicated above, in this experiment the CAF1-DNA complexes do not enter the gel due to the high percentage of polyacrylamide used.</p><p>We also have done CAF1-DNA binding experiments at higher CAF1 concentrations as requested. These data show that at very high concentrations of CAF1, shorter (17bp) DNA substrates can be bound by CAF1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However longer DNA substrates (42bp and 84bp) are bound with higher affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Analysis of the binding isotherms shows that long but not short DNA substrates show cooperative binding behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>We attempted to characterize the CAF1-DNA complex by SEC-MALS as requested, but found that the DNA and CAF1 did not co-elute from the SEC column. This is not surprising considering the weak DNA binding affinity of CAF1 (in the low μM range). Native PAGE analysis, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is more suitable for the analysis of weakly interacting DNA binding complexes.</p><p><italic>3) The data regarding the activity of the mutant CAF-1 complexes in the Xenopus extracts does not distinguish the activities or mechanisms of these, they all appear similarly inactive.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment and have addressed this point by carefully repeating the experiments to define the exact titration limit at which the wild type yCAF1 appears to be fully able to compensate for the endogenous xCAF1 loss. We used the obtained parameters to further analyze the activity of mutant CAF1 complexes in DNA synthesis-coupled nucleosome assembly. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, at higher ratios of mutant CAF1:DNA, some nucleosome assembly activity is recovered for CAF1T, U and X. We found that the CAF1T mutant has slightly higher activity as compared to CAF1U and X. Our interpretation is that while both the WHD and K/E/R-rich coiled-coil domains contribute to nucleosome assembly activity of CAF1, the WHD domain is slightly more important. CAF1V, the minimal CAF1 construct lacking both the WHD and the K/E/R-rich coiled-coil domain, is defective in nucleosome assembly activity. These new data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and described in the subsection “DNA-binding of yCAF1 is required for DNA synthesis-coupled nucleosome assembly”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
