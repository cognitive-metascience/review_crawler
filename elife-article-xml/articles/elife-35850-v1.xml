to facilitate evasion of host immune responses. To probe the molecular basis of US28’s unique ligand cross-reactivity, we deep-sequenced CX3CL1 chemokine libraries selected on ‘molecular casts’ of the US28 active-state and find that US28 can engage thousands of distinct chemokine sequences, many of which elicit diverse signaling outcomes. The structure of a G-protein-biased CX3CL1-variant in complex with US28 revealed an entirely unique chemokine amino terminal peptide conformation and remodeled constellation of receptor-ligand interactions. Receptor signaling, however, is remarkably robust to mutational disruption of these interactions. Thus, US28 accommodates and functionally discriminates amongst highly degenerate chemokine sequences by sensing the steric bulk of the ligands, which distort both receptor extracellular loops and the walls of the ligand binding pocket to varying degrees, rather than requiring sequence-specific bonding chemistries for recognition and signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group

act through a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charo and Ransohoff, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Proudfoot, 2002</xref>). More than 40 chemokines and over 20 chemokine receptors are encoded in the human genome, and there is extensive receptor-ligand cross-reactivity, which can manifest as preferential signaling via either G protein or β-arrestin, a process called biased agonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Steen et al., 2014</xref>). Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) has ‘hijacked’ a relatively ligand-specific human GPCR, and repurposed it through evolution to serve as a highly cross-reactive ‘chemokine sink’ as a mechanism to subvert host immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Randolph-Habecker et al., 2002</xref>). US28 binds with high affinity to many CC-type chemokines, in addition to CX3CL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kledal et al., 1998</xref>). The molecular mechanisms for how US28 can engage and respond to such a wide range of chemokines are not understood; indeed, most receptor-ligand interactions are characterized by a high degree of specificity. Furthermore, it remains unclear to what extent, and how, US28 has the capacity to signal differentially in response to these chemokines.</p><p>A crystal structure of CX3CL1 bound to US28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burg et al., 2015</xref>) showed that the chemokine bound through a two-site interaction mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Monteclaro and Charo, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thiele and Rosenkilde, 2014</xref>) that is generally shared by other chemokine GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wescott et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). At Site 1, the receptor N-terminal region binds a groove on the globular body of the chemokine. At Site 2, the chemokine N-terminal peptide binds within a deep pocket formed by the receptor transmembrane helices (TMs) that is believed to function as the receptor activation switch. The structure also revealed extensive contacts with receptor extracellular loops (ECLs), coined Site 1.5, of unknown function. Given that US28 has a unique capacity to bind many diverse chemokines with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kledal et al., 1998</xref>), we sought to determine: 1- the breadth of ligand promiscuity that can be accommodated, 2- how sequence differences impact signaling, and 3- the structural properties of this interaction that enable such cross-reactivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chemokine-induced US28 signaling</title><p>Radioligand studies reveal a complex network of noncompetitive binding by these chemokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Whereas CX3CL1 (Fractalkine) and vMIP-II (a broad-spectrum CC-chemokine antagonist encoded by Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kledal et al., 1997</xref>]), bind US28 competitively, CCL3 (MIP1α) and CCL5 (RANTES) are only competitive with themselves. This manner of ‘orthosteric allostery’ is well established among chemokine receptor antagonists and suggests significant differences in the nature of receptor engagement, with the potential for differences in chemokine modulation of US28 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kufareva et al., 2017</xref>). Although isolated studies have attempted to delineate the signaling effects of individual chemokines at US28, no comprehensive effort has been made to compare chemokine-induced activity among US28’s many ligands or to determine whether they act as biased ligands. US28 signals constitutively via the G protein Gq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casarosa et al., 2001</xref>), and cells expressing US28 exhibit constitutive cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Streblow et al., 1999</xref>), which is thought to principally occur through β-arrestin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeFea, 2007</xref>). We sought to establish the capacity of natural and chimeric chemokine ligands of US28 to modulate this constitutive activity. We tested CX3CL1, CCL5, CCL3, and vMIP-II, as well as N-terminal chimeric chemokines, for their effects on Gq-mediated calcium flux and cell migration, which serves as a proxy for β-arrestin signaling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35850.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Natural and chimeric chemokines are agonists for US28.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Radioligand binding competition experiments with labeled CX3CL1, CCL3, and CCL5.

Comparing Gq-mediated calcium flux and migration responses, we find that US28 is capable of highly plastic but ligand-specific signaling activities that qualitatively suggest capacity for biased signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). vMIP-II binds US28 with high affinity while having no effect on the receptor’s activity, acting as a neutral antagonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). CCL3 increases Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling while migration remains unaffected, thus appearing to be a G-protein-biased agonist. CCL5 and CX3CL1 potentiate both Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and cell migration, with CX3CL1 exhibiting more prominent cell migration. Despite prior reports of Gq inverse agonism by CX3CL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tschammer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waldhoer et al., 2003</xref>), we observe US28-mediated CX3CL1 inverse agonism only in IP3 assays with COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Chimeric chemokines in which the globular body of CX3CL1 was appended to the N-terminus of vMIP-II (NVF) or CCL5 (N5F) displayed weak calcium flux and moderate cell migration, diminishing the effects of CCL5 while converting vMIP-II from an antagonist to an agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and e</xref>). It is unclear whether this signaling behavior arises from direct contacts by the chemokine globular body or indirect contacts that arise from the manner in which the globular body drapes the chemokine N-terminus within the receptor binding pocket. The chemokine N-terminus thus serves an instructive, although not solely determinative, role in dictating signaling through US28. In sum, these studies establish the plasticity of ligand-dependent US28 signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The sequence space of chemokine agonism</title><p>We next explored the structural diversity of chemokine N-terminal sequences compatible with US28 engagement to uncover sequence hallmarks that correlate with particular signaling pathways and downstream functions, such as induction of cell migration. We used a yeast-displayed library of diverse chemokine variants to map the sequence specificity of receptor engagement and activation by the Site 2 N-terminal peptide.

The alpaca nanobodies were raised against the US28/CX3CL1 complex, and, importantly, structures of CX3CL1-bound US28 with and without Nb7 reveal no significant differences in receptor conformation. This confirms that the nanobody does not deform US28 but merely selects a subset of pre-existing, stable, active-like conformations. Thus, these nanobody fusions serve as ‘molecular casts’ with which to screen yeast displayed chemokine libraries using purified recombinant US28. Interestingly, we found that the two nanobodies endow US28 with different chemokine binding pharmacologies: US28Nb7 was permissive for binding of all tested chemokines, whereas US28Nb11 showed impaired binding of CCL5 and CCL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This finding conforms with radioligand competition experiments and suggests that the two nanobodies are stabilizing partially non-overlapping US28 conformational subsets.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35850.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CX3CL1 library reveals chemokine sequence promiscuity and biased agonism.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Illustration of yeast-displayed chemokine and nanobody-stabilized receptors.

This result stands in contrast to analogous experiments in the absence of nanobody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casarosa et al., 2005</xref>) and suggests that nanobody7 selectively potentiates the affinity of CCL5 and CX3CL1 for US28 via Site 2, as has been observed in other GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Staus et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Having seen the importance of Site 2 for US28Nb7 engagement, a CX3CL1 library was constructed in which the seven N-terminal residues of the chemokine were randomized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This library was displayed on the surface of yeast and selected with increasing stringency for affinity to each of the nanobody-stabilized receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Following selection, the remaining pools of yeast were deep-sequenced to identify CX3CL1 sequences compatible with binding either US28Nb7 or US28Nb11. This sequencing data showed that tens of thousands of unique chemokine N-termini are able to bind US28 with high affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). While the US28Nb11 selected chemokines appear slightly more converged, the most abundant unique variants comprise only a small fraction of the total sequence count. To visualize these broad sequence landscapes, pairs of N-termini that differ at only one of the seven randomized residues were clustered; to ensure significance we limited our analysis to sequences that appeared more than 10 times within the pool. 794 unique US28Nb7-selected N-termini met these criteria, with each connected to an average of 2.7 related sequences. Partitioning of these sequences into distinct subpopulations is not observed. After US28Nb11 selection, 11,415 unique N-termini had at least one partner that differed at only one position and each sequence connected to an average of 9.6 relatives.</p><p>A residue-by-residue analysis of the combinatorial chemokine N-termini from the library selections shows that sequence promiscuity extends along the full length of randomized positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Despite this diversity, CX3CL1 with a polyglycine amino terminus shows minimal binding to US28Nb7, confirming the necessity of certain N-terminal contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). While the CX3CL1 wild type amino terminus appears in the sequencing, the wild-type identity rarely emerges among the most abundant amino acids at a given position. For example, hydrophobic amino acids enrich over the wild-type glutamine at position 1, while arginine enriches over the wild-type histidine at position 2. As the same hydrophobic amino acids score the worst in computational signal sequence cleavage site recognition, it is unlikely that this result is simply due to biases in processing or expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nielsen, 2017</xref>).</p><p>A collection of highly diverse sequences was chosen from each of the two different nanobody selections for further signaling characterization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). These chemokines bound US28Nb7 with affinities akin to wild-type CX3CL1 on yeast, yet revealed comparatively weak competition with wild-type CX3CL1 in radioligand binding studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This behavior is reminiscent to that of US28’s natural chemokine repertoire reported above. Because the high basal signaling of US28 results in a narrow dynamic range in which to measure differences between agonists, we can only make qualitative conclusions about signaling bias. Nevertheless, nearly all these chemokines induce some level of cell migration, though none surpass that of wild-type CX3CL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Conversely, G protein activation stronger than wild-type CX3CL1 was elicited by LLPHANY (CX3CL1.35) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). To determine if the LLPHANY sequence contained particular hallmark residues that correlate with G protein signaling, homologous sequences to CX3CL1.35 that emerged from the deep sequencing were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>). These sequences include variants with mutations throughout the CX3CL1.35 N-terminus. Surprisingly, despite the substantial sequence differences of these variants, most induced G protein signaling in a qualitatively similar fashion to CX3CL1.35. Similarly, none of the CX3CL1.35 family members showed significantly decreased cell migration. This result demonstrates that for a given ligand sequence motif, signaling effects are relatively insensitive to individual sequence substitutions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35850.013</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Signaling behavior or selected CX3CL1 library variants.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Calcium and, (<bold>b</bold>) migration responses of diverse chemokines revealed by deep sequencing at 100 nM ligand.

CX3CL1 forms extensive contacts with US28’s minor pocket at TM1, TM2, TM3, and TM7 and ECL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e and g</xref>).

Calcium signaling and migration are robust to disruption of receptor contacts throughout the binding pocket suggesting either that specific side chain contacts are largely unimportant or that significant conformational rearrangements of the chemokine amino terminus are made to preserve contacts. The most prosaic explanation for the relative lack of sequence selectivity imposed by the US28 pocket, yet ability of unrelated chemokine sequences to elicit differential signaling outputs, would be that the steric bulk of the ligand is more important than specific bonding chemistries. If steric bulk, which would apply strain to the walls of the US28 binding pocket, were the principal determinant of signaling output, an almost unlimited number of sequences could elicit similar signaling outputs, which is consistent with our data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Extracellular rearrangements upon chemokine binding</title><p>To assess the impact of ligand binding on the structure and dimensions of the US28 ligand binding pocket, we determined the crystal structure of <italic>apo</italic>-US28Nb7 without an extracellular ligand to 3.5 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

Without apparent sequence patterns, these engineered chemokines induce the full spectrum of signaling bias at US28. Natural chemokine sequences merely represent a subset of local minima in a broad signaling fitness landscape. The combined structural and deep sequencing data suggest that G protein activation is elicited as a consequence of steric bulk distorting the walls the major pocket of the receptor, dilating the receptor’s extracellular face, rather than highly specific and sequence-specific bonding chemistries. This relative sequence-insensitive mechanism, which is highly unusual for protein-protein interactions, is likely enabled by the N-terminal chemokine sequence binding within a capsule-shaped US28 pocket, affording numerous opportunities for adventitious bonding interactions between the walls of the pocket and alternative conformations of the N-terminal peptide. This is as opposed to the generally broad and exposed interfaces seen in protein-protein interactions, which are generally much less tolerant to substitution. The properties exhibited by US28 explain how the virus evolved a human GPCR to be highly promiscuous in order to promote viral survival and offer the broader possibility that GPCR signaling can be activated by surrogate agonists that are unrelated to the natural ligands and activate new signaling pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene <break/>(human cytomegalovirus)</td><td>US28 (unique short region)</td><td>PMID 7961796</td><td/><td>strain TOWNE</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>EBY100</td><td>Gift from Prof. Dane <break/>Wittrup (PMID 17406305)</td><td/><td>Yeast cells</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(Spodoptera frugiperda)</td><td>SF9</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CTL-1711</td><td>Insect cells used for <break/>baculovirus production</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(Trichoplusia ni)</td><td>Hi5</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>BTI-TN-5B1-4</td><td>Insect cells used for <break/>baculovirus expression <break/>of NbB1</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-1573</td><td>Mammalian cells used <break/>for Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling assay</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293-US28 wt</td><td>PMID 23303826</td><td/><td>Mammalian cells used <break/>for Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling assay <break/>and IP3 assays</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293S GnTI-</td><td>Gift from Prof. H. <break/>Gobind Khorana <break/>(PMID 12370423)</td><td/><td>Mammalian cells used for <break/>baculovirus expression <break/>of US28 variants and chemokines</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Flp-In TREx 293</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>R78007</td><td>Hamster cells used for <break/>β-arrestin assay</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(Chinese hamster ovary)</td><td>CHO-K1 EA-arrestin</td><td>DiscoverixRx</td><td>93–0164</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct <break/>(β-arrestin recruitment)</td><td>US28 wt/ProLink/b-galactose</td><td>This report</td><td/><td>Vector provided by DiscoverixRx</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-protein C (mouse IgG1)</td><td>ATCC</td><td>HB-9892</td><td>Antibody used for staining yeast <break/>bound to protein C tagged target <break/>proteins.

The number of cycles for each round of PCR was determined by quantitation on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara CA) to protect against over-amplification. Primers were proximal to the library region of the chemokine to ensure high-quality sequence reads with double coverage. Final PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel and purified via gel extraction (QIAGEN). Purified PCR products were then quantitated, normalized for each barcoded round of selection to be equally represented, doped with 5–50% PhiX DNA to ensure sufficient sequence diversity for high-quality sequence reads and run on an Illumina Miseq with 2 × 150 nt Paired End reads (Illumina, San Diego CA).</p><p>To analyze the sequence data, contigs were generated for each paired end read using PANDAseq software.

Amino acid frequencies were then calculated for those unique sequences that appear with 10 or greater counts as previously described.

The number of cells seeded was determined by the apparent expression of receptors and was aimed at obtaining 5–10% binding of the added radioactive ligand. US28 receptor expression was induced by tetracycline one day after seeding the cells (0.25 µg mL<sup>−1</sup>; Invitrogen). 48 hr post seeding, cells were washed twice in ice-cold binding buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, supplemented with 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) and assayed by competition binding for 3 hr at 4˚C using 10–15 pM <sup>125</sup>I-CX3CL1, <sup>125</sup>I-CCL5, or <sup>125</sup>I-CCL3 as well as unlabeled ligand (10 pM to 100 nM in binding buffer). After incubation, cells were washed twice in ice-cold binding buffer, supplemented with 0.5 M NaCl.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization assay</title><p>US28- and HEK293 cells (as a negative control) were seeded at 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well in poly-D-lysine coated 96-well plates (black, clear bottom, Costar). US28-expression was induced 1 day after seeding by addition of 0.25 µg ml<sup>−1</sup> tetracycline. After 24 hr, cells were loaded for 1 hr at 37˚C (5% CO<sub>2</sub>) in the dark with 0.2% Fluo-4 (Invitrogen) in loading buffer (19.6 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 1.25 mM probenecid, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). After 1 hr incubation, cells were washed in pre-warmed loading buffer and 100 µl of the loading buffer was added to each well as a final volume. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization was monitored upon stimulation with various concentrations of chemokines at 37˚C as fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 520 nm, respectively. The measurements were performed using a FlexStation3 (Molecular Devices, San Jose CA). If used, the antagonist was incubated in 100 µl loading buffer 10 min prior to the addition of the agonist.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>β-arrestin2 recruitment assay</title><p>The recruitment of β-arrestin2 was measured using the PathHunter β-arrestin assay (DiscoverX) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daugvilaite et al., 2017</xref>). Briefy, cDNA encoding US28wt was fused to the ProLink C-terminal protein tag and the small fragment ofβ-galactose and cloned into pcDNA3.1+. Assays were performed using the CHO-K1 EA-arrestin cell line with the stable expression of β-galactosidase coupled to the β-gal large fragment. Cells were seeded at 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well and transfected the next day with 50 ng DNA using Fugene6 reagent (0.15 µl per well, Promega, Madison WI). 48 hr post transfection cells were stimulated with various concentrations of the chemokine for 90 min (as positive control CCR5 transient transfected cells were included, stimulated with CCL5). β-arrestin2 recruitment was detected as β-gal activity using the PathHunter detection kit (DiscoverX). Chemiluminescent substrate composed of Galacton Star Substrate, Emerald II Solution and PathHunter Cell Assay Buffer in a ratio of 1:5:19, respectively, was added to the cells (50 µL per well). The luminescent signal was determined after 60 min incubation at ambient temperature using the EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham MA).</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Cell migration assay</title><p>Migration of serum-starved (2 hr) tetracycline induced (16 hr) US28-HEK293 was assessed using Transwell membranes (Costar; 8 μm pore size). Filters were coated for 30 min at room temperature on the lower side with 10 μg mL<sup>−1</sup> fibronectin (dissolved in PBS; Sigma). The fibronectin solution was removed and the filters rinsed once with PBS before they were allowed to air-dry. The filters were placed in a 24-well dish that contained low serum (0.2%) DMEM supplemented with agonists or control buffer. US28-HEK293 cells suspended in 0.2% serum DMEM (with tetracycline) were added to the upper chamber (1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well). Cells were allowed to migrate for 6 hr at 37˚C. Non-migrated cells were removed from the top filter surface with a damp cotton swab. Migrated cells, attached to the bottom surface, were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde (in PBS) and dyed with crystal violet. Transmigrated cells were counted in five predefined areas on the membrane using a converted light microscope (20x objective; Leica, Wetzlar Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s3-12"><title>Alpaca immunization</title><p>A 3-year-old male alpaca (<italic>Lama pacos</italic>) was maintained in pasture, and immunized following a protocol authorized by the Camelid Immunogenics (Belchertown, MA) and MIT IACUC committees. The alpaca was immunized by subcutaneous injection of a 1:1 mixture of Imject alum (Thermo Scientific, Waltham MA) and 800 μg of recombinant US28Nb7 reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles. After a total of four injections (200 μg each) spaced 2 weeks apart, 50 mL of blood was harvested by venipuncture and collected into heparinized tubes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Alpaca nanobody yeast display library construction</title><p>Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated from total blood by Ficoll-Paque gradients (Ficoll-Paque Plus, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont United Kingdom). Total RNA was isolated from ~2×10<sup>6</sup> fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN), following the manufacturer’s guidelines. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad CA) and a combination of oligo dT, random hexamer or the immunoglobulin-specific primers AlCH2 and AlCH2.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maass et al., 2007</xref>). Nanobody sequences were then amplified by PCR in two steps for the generation of a yeast display library. PCR products were ethanol precipitated, and 160 μg of resulting PCR product and 40 μg linearized pCTCON2 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colby et al., 2004</xref>) were co-transformed into electrocompetent EBY100 yeast (Invitrogen). Following transformation, cells were recovered in 1 L SDCAA at 30˚C. Ten-fold serial dilutions were plated onto SDCAA, grown for 3 days at 30˚C, and colonies were counted to determine library size. The resulting library was determined to contain 4.8 × 10<sup>6</sup> transformants. The library was grown at 30˚C until it reached ten-fold increase over the initial calculated diversity, then pelleted at 3000 x g, and stored in 10% glycerol at −80˚C.</p></sec><sec id="s3-14"><title>Nanobody selection by yeast surface display</title><p>For the first round of selection, 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> yeast displaying the nanobody library were cleared of non-specific binders to Alexa-647 conjugated anti-protein C antibody as described above for the yeast-displayed chemokine library. These cleared yeast were then washed with staining buffer and stained with 1 μM US28Nb7 for 2 hr at 4˚C. Magnetic selection then proceeded as described above for the yeast displayed chemokine library.</p><p>For the second round of selection, two-color FACS was performed. 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> induced yeast were washed with staining buffer and stained with 200 nM US28Nb7ΔN for 2 hr at 4˚C. The yeast were then washed with staining buffer and stained with Alexa-647 conjugated anti-protein C and Alexa-488 conjugated anti-Myc antibodies (Cell Signaling) for 15 min at 4˚C. Yeast were washed again with staining buffer and the Alexa-647 and −488 double-positive cells were purified using a FACS Jazz cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Post-sorted yeast were resuspended in SDCAA medium and cultured at 30˚C.</p><p>The third round of selection also employed two-color FACS. 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> induced yeast were washed with staining buffer and stained with 10 μM US28Nb11 for 2 hr at 4˚C. The yeast were then washed with staining buffer and stained with Alexa-647-conjugated anti-protein C and Alexa-488-conjugated anti-Myc antibodies for 15 min at 4˚C. Yeast were washed again and both double-positive cells and Alexa-488 singly positive cells were purified separately to distinguish nanobodies that bind both US28Nb7 and US28Nb11 from those that are selective. Nanobody cDNA was prepared from each of the post Round three library samples, transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> and sequenced, yielding nanobody B1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-15"><title>Nanobody purification</title><p>Nanobody B1 was cloned into pAcGP67A insect expression vector (BD Biosciences) with a C-terminal 6xHis tag. Baculovirus was added to High Five cells at a density of 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cell ml<sup>−1</sup> and incubated for 60 hr at 28˚C. Collected culture media was conditioned with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM NiCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and the subsequent precipitate was cleared via centrifugation. The media was then incubated with Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN) at room temperature for 3 hr and eluted in HBS with 200 mM imidazole.

Your article has been reviewed favorably by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor and also Reviewing Editor). The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Review:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors explored the interactions of chemokine CX3CL1 and the viral GPCR US28, particularly focused on the N-terminal seven amino acid residues of CX3CL1. This N-terminal segment binds within the receptor transmembrane pocket. The authors explored the influence of the bound N-terminal segment on receptor activation.</p><p>The authors utilized US28 fused with nanobodies that stabilize apo-US28 in active-like conformations, and screened a yeast-displayed library of CX3CL1 in which the N-terminal seven residues are randomized. A large number of chemokine variants that bind to the receptor and signal are identified. These variants have essentially no sequence similarity in the N-terminal segment of CX3CL1, and signal to varying extents.</p><p>A structure of a CX3CL variant complexed to US28 provides a framework to understand the interactions that various sequences can form with different residues in the transmembrane pocket. The structure reveals modest conformational changes in the receptor compared to a previous complex structure and the apo receptor structure, but the chemokine amino terminus itself adopts a highly distinct conformation. Two chimeric chemokines between the globular domain of CX3CL1 and the N-terminus of vMIP-II (NVF) and CCR5 (N5F) have weak Ca<sup>2+</sup> and migration activity. What is novel is the conversion of vMIP-II antagonist to an agonist in the NVF chimera.</p><p>By integrating all these data, the authors conclude that the specific molecular contacts of the amino terminus are largely dispensable for receptor activation in the case of US28. Overall, this is a rigorously-performed and well-written study that is likely to be of considerable interest to the field, particularly those interested in protein ligand-GPCR interactions controlling receptor signaling.</p><p>Essential points to address:</p><p>1) The design of the library allows broad, but non-uniform, sampling of possible amino acids at each position. The analysis of resulting frequencies is difficult to interpret, since the input frequencies of amino acids are not equal. For example, the authors point to the high frequency of hydrophobic residues at position 1 as evidence that signal peptidase cleavage efficiency is not a major factor in sequence enrichment. However, the input frequency expected here is skewed toward hydrophobic residues by library design, with F, I, L, and V collectively expected to occur about four times as often as either D or E. There may be additional bias if mixed bases are not incorporated with equal efficiency, or if library amplification PCR skewed sequence distributions. As a result, comparison of input and output frequencies is necessary to draw conclusions about the relative enrichment for particular features. It would have been straightforward to have sequenced the input libraries as well, and this would allow a direct assessment of what the receptor binding and FACS is really selecting. Are these data available? This would substantially improve the analysis presented. If not, could some calibration experiments be done?</p><p>2) The reviewers feel that single-point signaling assays, like those presented in Figure 3, offer limited information, and a lack of activity may reflect either antagonism or insufficient potency. To properly characterize these new binders the authors should at least perform dose-response signaling analysis, ideally alongside a binding assay to measure the affinities of these clones. To show biased signaling, there should be dose-response curves of two assays – for G protein-coupling pathway (US28-induced IP3 turnover or Ca<sup>2+</sup> response) and β-arrestin pathway (β-arrestin-recruitment or US28-induced migration assay). If these assays cannot be done, then the claims about biased signaling should be removed.</p><p>3) It would be helpful to show the affinities to US28 of different ligands, such as ligands typical of those selected. Indeed, the potency of these variants is not shown in the present manuscript.</p><p>4) In general, binding to the receptor N-terminus (mostly by the globular domain of the cytokine) plays a role in the affinity of the receptor-chemokine interaction. The conversion of antagonist vMIP-II to agonist by exchanging the globular domain with CX3CL1 suggests signaling roles of the globular domain interactions. To what extent is binding determined by the chemokine's amino-terminal peptide vs. the folded C-terminal domain? The authors state that a poly-Gly N-terminus is not sufficient (Results and Discussion, fifth paragraph), which helps argue that the peptide is a key determinant, but they don't show data. Given the fact that the whole paper is about the role of the amino terminal peptide in binding and signaling, it is important to actually show data for this, and the statement &quot;data not shown&quot; in the submitted version of the manuscript implies that they've already done the experiment.</p><p>Less critical points:</p><p>1) The authors provide an excellent description of the differences between variant 1.35 and the wt structure. The difference between 1.35 and wt interactions with the receptor are profound (Figure 4—figure supplement 2), especially in the globular section of the chemokine. Are there crystal contacts of the 1.35 variant or of the previously published wt CX3CL1 complex that could influence the globular portion with respect to the receptor?</p><p>2) The authors conclude that &quot;steric bulk of the ligand is more important than specific bonding chemistries&quot; in the TM cavity. They also should discuss the steric bulk in the context of GPCR dynamics, which is known to also be important in activation and signaling. Although the crystallography is impressive, the authors should be careful of over-interpreting their results as the fusion with Nb will prevent conformational changes to occur and signaling proteins to bind. Unfortunately, although the authors offer a &quot;caveat&quot; about their structures, the over-interpretation occurs.</p><p>3) There is an invariant Pro at position 3 for all of the sequences in Figure 3C and D. It is difficult to see anything about the structural features of a proline vis-à-vis the interaction with the pocket in the figures.</p><p>4) Please explain how &quot;strains on the walls of the binding pocket&quot; results in activation, if the mechanism is similar to Kobilka's mechanism for adrenergic activation.</p><p>5) Should the amino acid possibilities in position 1 shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 include also lysine (codon AAA)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35850.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Essential points to address:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The design of the library allows broad, but non-uniform, sampling of possible amino acids at each position.

The naïve library was deep sequenced after construction and prior to selection. The resulting amino acid distribution by position was used as the baseline against which to measure enrichment or depletion during selections. This data is presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 3. The legend for this figure has been updated and expanded to clarify this point. All conclusions in the text, such as those raised by the reviewers above, are supported by this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers feel that single-point signaling assays, like those presented in Figure 3, offer limited information, and a lack of activity may reflect either antagonism or insufficient potency.

Ca<sup>2+</sup> response and US28-induced migration dose-response analyses been included in Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2 and Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2. There were several confounding factors that hampered our ability to achieve saturation of the dose-response curves. First, negative effects on cell viability preclude data inclusion at concentrations of 1 μM chemokine and greater. Second, the rapid constitutive internalization rates of US28 make it very hard to fully complete the dose-response curves at the highest concentrations. While many of these curves do not reach saturation and allow for precise quantification of bias factors, the data are strongly suggestive of bias in US28’s signaling and we are careful not to make quantitative claims about bias, and only limit our conclusions about bias to qualitative differences. We have indicated the need for caution with regard to these data in the main text (subsection “Chemokine-induced US28 signaling”, second paragraph) but believe the data justify qualitative discussion. We have also inserted the sentence “Because the high basal signaling of US28 results in a narrow dynamic range in which to measure differences between agonists, we can only make qualitative conclusions about signaling bias.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be helpful to show the affinities to US28 of different ligands, such as ligands typical of those selected. Indeed, the potency of these variants is not shown in the present manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Affinities of selected CX3CL1 library variants are now shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 3 and the main text has been modified to address this (subsection “The sequence space of chemokine agonism”, last paragraph). Clones selected from the CX3CL1 library bind equivalently to wild type CX3CL1 when yeast displayed and stained with nanobody-stabilized receptor. Radioligand competition experiments of the CX3CL1 library variants reveal weaker competition with wild type CX3CL1 (i.e. a lower affinity in heterologous competition binding experiments) than the wild type chemokine competes with itself (i.e. in homologous competition binding experiments). This apparent low affinity in the heterologous competition binding setting is precedented by wild type CCL3 and CCL5 (Figure 1A) that are unable to displace radiolabeled CX3CL1. Importantly this impaired competition does not reflect low affinity for the unliganded receptor (as described earlier for US28 in Kledal, Rosenkilde, and Schwartz, 1998 and for the NK1 receptor (Rosenkilde et al., 1994, JBC).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In general, binding to the receptor N-terminus (mostly by the globular domain of the cytokine) plays a role in the affinity of the receptor-chemokine interaction. The conversion of antagonist vMIP-II to agonist by exchanging the globular domain with CX3CL1 suggests signaling roles of the globular domain interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>Additional language has been added to the main text to address this possibility (subsection “Chemokine-induced US28 signaling”, last paragraph). It is possible that the globular domains contribute to signaling only insofar as they align how the chemokine amino terminus is positioned within the receptor binding site. A difference in chemokine N-terminus positioning is likely given the CC to CX3C conversion in NVF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To what extent is binding determined by the chemokine's amino-terminal peptide vs. the folded C-terminal domain?</p></disp-quote><p>The balance of contributions from sites 1 and 2 to chemokine affinity for the nanobody-stabilized receptor are chemokine-specific. When the receptor N-terminus is removed, CX3CL1 affinity for the receptor is largely unchanged. CCL3 on the other hand loses all binding to US28Nb7. We believe that nanobody7 is enhancing US28’s affinity for the amino termini of certain chemokines. We have included a new figure supplement (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) and language in the main text addressing this point (subsection “The sequence space of chemokine agonism”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state that a poly-Gly N-terminus is not sufficient (Results and Discussion, fifth paragraph), which helps argue that the peptide is a key determinant, but they don't show data.

The combination of the loss of CX3CL1 affinity when the chemokine amino terminus is changed with the lack of effect when the receptor N-terminus is completely removed convince us that CX3CL1 affinity for US28Nb7 is largely derived from site 2 interactions.</p><p>Less critical points:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors provide an excellent description of the differences between variant 1.35 and the wt structure.

We have added data (Figure 4—figure supplement 4) and discussion (subsection “Structural basis for US28’s chemokine promiscuity”) of this possibility. This includes arguments that the CX3CL1.35 complex most likely has a unique orientation that is captured, rather than induced, by the crystal lattice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors conclude that &quot;steric bulk of the ligand is more important than specific bonding chemistries&quot; in the TM cavity.

In a system sampling a broad conformational landscape with shallow energetic barriers to interconversion between states, steric obstruction in the binding site may bias the distribution of states sampled by the GPCR.
