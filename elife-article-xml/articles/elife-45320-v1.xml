hyperthermophilic <italic>Archaea</italic>. Here we show that 8-oxodG is formed in the genome of growing cells, with elevated levels following exposure to oxidative stress. Functional characterisation of cell-free extracts and the DNA polymerisation enzymes, PolB, PolD, and the p41/p46 complex, alone or in the presence of accessory factors (PCNA and RPA) indicates that translesion synthesis occurs under replicative conditions. One of the major polymerisation effects was stalling, but each of the individual proteins could insert and extend past 8-oxodG with differing efficiencies. The introduction of RPA and PCNA influenced PolB and PolD in similar ways, yet provided a cumulative enhancement to the polymerisation performance of p41/p46. Overall, 8-oxodG translesion synthesis was seen to be potentially mutagenic leading to errors that are reminiscent of dA:8-oxodG base pairing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Pyrococcus abyssi</kwd><kwd>DNA polymerases</kwd><kwd>8-oxodeoxyguanosine</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>accessory factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-JCJC-1501-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henneke</surname><given-names>Ghislaine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An investigation into 8-oxodeoxguanosine bypass by archaeal DNA polymerases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oxidative stress, arising as a result of a disturbance between the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS), and antioxidant defences, is associated with damage to a wide range of molecular species including lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McCord, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Imlay, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apel and Hirt, 2004</xref>). 8-oxodeoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) is one of the major oxidised bases in DNA or the nucleotide pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kamiya, 2003</xref>). Base damage is caused by highly reactive free radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kasai and Nishimura, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burrows and Muller, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Neeley and Essigmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cadet et al., 2008</xref>) generated exogenously upon exposure to ionising radiation, environmental factors (<italic>e.g.</italic>, transition metals, chemicals, free radicals, etc), or endogenously from metabolic processes in different cellular compartments (<italic>e.g</italic>., peroxisomes, mitochondria, chloroplasts, etc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krumova and Cosa, 2016</xref>).</p><p>To protect against 8-oxodG accumulation and potential mutagenesis, cells evolved enzymatic repair mechanisms that ensure both the removal of the oxidised deoxyribonucleoside (8-oxodG) from genomic DNA and the degradation of the oxidised DNA precursor (8-oxodGTP), thereby preventing its incorporation by DNA polymerases (DNA pols) (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">David et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kamiya, 2010</xref>). Evolutionarily conserved from <italic>Bacteria</italic> to eukaryotes, the repair of 8-oxodG in DNA utilises the base excision repair (BER) pathway, ensuring the removal of dC:8-oxodG and dA:8-oxodG mispairs respectively by OGG1/MutM (Fpg) and MUTYH/MutY BER glycosylases in eukaryotic/<italic>E. coli</italic> cells. While demonstrated only in eukaryotes, other defence mechanisms such as the mismatch repair (MMR), nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription coupled-NER (TC-NER) may function as effective substitutes for 8-oxodG removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tuo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Russo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Macpherson et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Although most 8-oxodG damage is repaired by these preventive systems (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Loon et al., 2010</xref>), 8-oxodG that escapes repair is likely to be encountered by DNA pols during either replicative or repair DNA synthesis. The extent to which 8-oxodG is bypassed depends on the identity of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA pols. The nucleotides dAMP and dCMP are incorporated opposite template 8-oxodG to varying efficiencies, potentially causing dG→dT transversion mutations during subsequent rounds of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hübscher and Maga, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berquist and Wilson, 2012</xref>). The differences in selectivity for nucleotide insertion are dictated by the intrinsic features of DNA pols (active site steric constraints, specific interactions with the backbone of the template 8-oxodG, etc), the sequence context in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zahn et al., 2011</xref>) and the modulating role of accessory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maga et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Locatelli et al., 2010</xref>). The premutagenicity of 8-oxodG in DNA is mainly due to its Hoogsteen base pairing in the <italic>syn</italic> conformation with dA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="C1">Chemical structure 1</xref>) and the ability of DNA pols to extend the resulting mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shibutani et al., 1991</xref>). Mimicking the geometry of a correct base pair, the dA:8-oxodG <italic>anti:syn</italic> mispair thus escapes the proofreading 3’−5’ exonuclease activity in the replicative polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brieba et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hsu et al., 2004</xref>).</p><fig id="C1" position="anchor"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45320.002</object-id><label>Chemical structure 1.</label><caption><title>Base pairing of 8-oxoguanosine.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45320-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>While the oxidation of the deoxyguanosine and its impact on the genome stability of aerobic organisms has been extensively documented in <italic>Bacteria</italic> and eukaryotes, there are limited reports about its occurrence and effect on archaeal cells. <italic>Archaea,</italic> the third domain of life, are represented by aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms that all are equipped with ROS removal systems, indicating their appearance early in the evolution of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wiedenheft et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Halliwell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ramsay et al., 2006</xref>). Thriving in hostile habitats (such as hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, springs and salt lakes) under harsh environmental conditions (such as elevated temperature, high pressure, pH shifts, heavy metals, ionising radiations, etc) it is theorised that <italic>Archaea</italic> face large-scale DNA damage, thereby challenging replication accuracy. Examined in few aerobic euryarchaeal and crenarchaeal strains (two extreme halophiles <italic>Haloferax Volcanii</italic> and <italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic> sp.

Low rates of genomic mutation, such as those observed, suggest that these <italic>Archaea</italic> evolved molecular mechanisms to ensure their genome integrity. Conversely, the thermoacidophile <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> exhibits an elevated rate of spontaneous mutations (one order of magnitude higher) which is mediated by transposition of insertion elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Martusewitsch et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The hyperthermophilic anaerobic <italic>Euryarchaea</italic>, <italic>Pyrococcus abyssi</italic>, has been isolated from hydrothermal vents characterised by elevated temperatures, pH-shifts, radiation and differing metal concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erauso et al., 1993</xref>). It exhibits extreme resistance to ionising radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jolivet et al., 2003</xref>) and can withstand a moderate level of genomic abasic sites damage (25 abasic sites per 100000 bp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Palud et al., 2008</xref>).

Both PolD and PolB contain exonuclease domains and display high nucleotide selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Palud et al., 2008</xref>), with PolB described as one of the most accurate and processive enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dietrich et al., 2002</xref>). These features make them ideally suited for accurate DNA synthesis in DNA replication and repair. Completing the repertoire of DNA polymerisation enzymes is the DNA polymerase/primase complex (p41/p46). Devoid of any proofreading 3’−5’ exonuclease activity, it has been identified as an RNA priming enzyme at the replication fork, and a potential DNA repair enzyme capable of synthesising short-patches of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Le Breton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jozwiakowski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lemor et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies showing the strong resistance of <italic>P. abyssi</italic> to gamma irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jolivet et al., 2003</xref>) which exerts molecular oxidative stress in anoxic conditions makes this strain an ideal model to analyse the response of oxidative attacks from another oxidising agent, in this case, oxygen. In this study, we determine the steady-state level of 8-oxodG in the genome of normal growing cells and after exposure to oxygen. We further analyse the consequence that this damage has on the damage-bypass properties of cell-free extracts, and the individual DNA replication proteins, PolB, PolD and the p41/p46 complex alone, or in the presence of accessory factors (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen and Replication Protein A for PCNA and RPA respectively). Finally, we measure the intrinsic 3’−5’ exonuclease activity of PolD and PolB alone or with accessory proteins of 8-oxodG mispairs. The potential mutagenicity of 8-oxodG in DNA and more generally genomic maintenance in <italic>Archaea</italic> are thus discussed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rate of 8-oxodG in the genome of <italic>P. abyssi</italic></title><p>Before analysing the <italic>in vitro</italic> properties of the DNA pols in the presence of 8-oxodG, we investigated whether this DNA lesion is present in the genome of <italic>P. abyssi</italic>, and how the levels compare to a mesophilic bacterial control, <italic>E. coli</italic>.

As such, the functional interaction that occurs between the three replicative DNA enzymes (PolB, PolD and p41/p46) and two major replication fork proteins, RPA and PCNA was investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Previous studies in <italic>Euryarchaea</italic> have observed a physical interaction between RPA and PolB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Komori and Ishino, 2001</xref>), PolD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Komori and Ishino, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pluchon et al., 2013</xref>), and the p41/p46 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Komori and Ishino, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pluchon et al., 2013</xref>).

However, no interaction has been observed with the p41/p46 complex.</p><p>Here we report that in the presence of RPA primer extension by both PolB and PolD is initially inhibited, leading to an almost universal loss of full-length primer extension and shorter extension products over 15 min, with the same effect observed in the presence of 8-oxodG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Under standing start conditions, with 8-oxodG placed at the +1 position from the primer-template junction, the influence of RPA is more pronounced causing primer utilisation to decrease by over 50% for both PolB and PolD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Although RPA doesn’t enhance primer utilisation by p41/p46, it does result in longer elongation products, partially mitigating the inhibition that the regulatory p46 subunit exhibits on extension activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Le Breton et al., 2007</xref>). The presence of RPA largely alleviates any negative impact that 8-oxodG plays on stalling p41/p46 extension, with the previously observed downstream stalling removed in both running start and standing start extension reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>PCNA also impacts on the primer extension activity all three polymerisation enzymes. Under running start conditions, PolD exhibits a reduction in primer+n formation in the presence of PCNA independently of 8-oxodG in the template strand (27% primer+n formation with PCNA compared to 68% without, for p/t-1 (dG) extension). However, this is offset by an increase in longer extension products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). On the other hand, primer utilisation by PolD does not seem impaired by PCNA in standing start experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results are in agreement with our previous data, showing that dNTP incorporation is less efficient on templates annealed to shorter DNA primers and that PCNA stimulates full-length DNA synthesis rather than primer utilisation by PolD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Henneke et al., 2005</xref>). PolB and p41/p46 exhibit increased primer elongation when reactions are supplemented with PCNA, corresponding to the accumulation of 87nt (PolB) or ~82 nt (p41/p46) products in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In the context of 8-oxodG bypass, all three polymerisation enzymes benefit from the addition of PCNA, with the % of stalled extension product being reduced, most likely due to the enhanced stability and processivity that PCNA provides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These functional interactions are similarly observed under standing start experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>The effect that both accessory proteins have on primer extension is noticeable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). For PolB the combined presence of both PCNA and RPA, while reducing the processivity enhancements that PCNA alone brings to PolB function, actually exacerbate PolB stalling in the presence of 8-oxodG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). For PolD the overall impact of both RPA and PCNA together is negative. This is most apparent in PolD when polymerisation is reduced to unobservable levels at 15 min. For both replicative DNA pols it is possible that additional replisome components are required to successfully mediate interactions with the RPA. Again, in contrast to the results observed with the two replicative DNA Pols, PCNA and RPA enhance the primer extension activity of the p41/p46 complex and remove any 8-oxodG induced downstream stalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Nucleotide insertion and extension at 8-oxodG template site by DNA polymerisation enzymes of <italic>P. abyssi</italic></title><p>As 8-oxodG can be bypassed by each of the three enzymes, its mutagenic base-pairing potential was evaluated by single nucleotide incorporation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Indeed, a reduction in total primer utilisation results in longer degradation product.

This suggests that DNA repair mechanisms, such as BER, might be preferentially solicited over TLS, thus minimising the potential mutagenicity of 8-oxodG. It should be noted that BER has been assumed as a fundamental process in the removal of 8-oxodG in the genome of <italic>Thermoccus gammatolerans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbier et al., 2016</xref>).

Although both polymerases exhibit reduced nucleotide incorporation opposite 8-oxodG, PolB and PolD insert both dAMP and dCMP opposite the lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Similarly, p41/p46 inserts dAMP and dCMP opposite 8-oxodG but with the same efficiency as a canonical base control. Moreover, each of the three polymerisation enzymes extends dA:8-oxodG to a greater extent than dC:8-oxodG paired termini. This preferential extension may be due to the inability of the Pol active site to detect the mispair in the Pol active site since dA:8-oxodG Hoogsteen base pair mimics the geometry of a correct base pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="C1">Chemical structure 1</xref>). The dC:8-oxodG paired termini appears strongly inhibitory to extension by PolD likely due to steric constraints incompatible with the size and flexibility of the polymerase active site cavity. Recent structural determination of PolD indicates that the Pol active site is not comparable to any known DNA polymerases, but rather shares similarities with RNA polymerases, despite DNA synthesising capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sauguet et al., 2016</xref>).

Contrary to studies showing that <italic>E. coli</italic> Pol I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shibutani et al., 1991</xref>), T7 Pol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brieba et al., 2004</xref>), RB69 Pol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhong et al., 2008</xref>) and Pol δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCulloch et al., 2009</xref>) do not efficiently correct dA:8-oxodG mispair, significant exonuclease activity is observed with dA:8-oxodG and dC: 8-oxodG mismatches by PolD and PolB. It is interesting to notice that PolD exonuclease primer degradation is less active than PolB in the conditions tested. The PolD Exo active site exhibits structural dynamics clearly different to those of PolB in the presence of mismatches. This hypothesis is corroborated by the unusual structural exonuclease domain of PolD which looks more similar to the Mre11 nuclease protein than the three characteristic sequence motifs termed Exo I, Exo II and Exo III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanco et al., 1991</xref>). <italic>P. abyssi</italic> HiFi (High Fidelity) enzymes may have evolved acute removal of mutagenic and non mutagenic primer termini due to the lack of appropriate extrinsic correction mechanisms. Not often considered, PCNA appears essential in exonuclease stimulation of mispairs by PolD and PolB, while RPA does not severely affect the activity.</p><p>Each of the three known polymerisation enzymes from <italic>P. abyssi</italic> possesses a unique stalling profile when encountering template strand 8-oxodG <italic>in vitro</italic>. Both PolB and PolD are observed to be sensitive to the presence of oxidative damage, stalling replication before eventually bypassing the lesion, whilst p41/p46 bypasses with high efficiency before stalling immediately downstream, consistent with previously published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jozwiakowski et al., 2015</xref>). However, the functional interactions observed between the polymerisation enzymes, RPA and PCNA enables further elucidation of the mechanism of TLS and the interplay that occurs in the archaeal replisome.</p><p>RPA enhances primer extension by the <italic>P. abyssi</italic> p41/p46 complex, functioning in a similar manner to eukaryotic RPA, which stimulates Pol α activity and processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maga et al., 2008</xref>). The importance of RPA, particularly in the context of TLS, is highlighted by the manner in which it is able to alleviate downstream stalling of p41/p46. The presence of 8-oxodG in ssDNA and dsDNA results in alterations in the phospho-deoxyribose structure, causing variations to vertical base staking in the immediate vicinity of 8-oxodG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Malins et al., 2000</xref>). Such an effect is still present in dsDNA, but the presence of the complementary strand introduces a stiffening and stabilising effect, reducing the impact of 8-oxodG on DNA structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crenshaw et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, RPA introduces rigidity to ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2015</xref>) which in this instances negates the disruptive influence of 8-oxodG on ssDNA, reducing downstream stalling of the p41/p46 complex.</p><p>It is through observing the interactions between key components of the replisome and p41/p46 that we can clarify the nature of this enzyme as both a primase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and a TLS polymerase that can bypass oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The p41/p46 complex is classified as an Archaeo-Eukaryotic Primase (AEP)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guilliam et al., 2015a</xref>). The identification of a second human AEP (PrimPol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">García-Gómez et al., 2013</xref>), has instigated a revival in AEP enzyme research, that has at times resulted in a blurring of the lines amongst AEPs, particularly when discussing the <italic>Archaeal</italic> AEPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guilliam et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guilliam et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, human PrimPol can facilitate replication fork progression through TLS and downstream priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">García-Gómez et al., 2013</xref>). However, more recent studies evaluating the interplay with replisome partners highlight that RPA is able to both recruit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guilliam et al., 2017</xref>) and regulate PrimPol activity, inhibiting replication on short primer-templates or when RPA is present in saturating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guilliam et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guilliam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martínez-Jiménez et al., 2017</xref>). This is in stark contrast to the data generated here, in which RPA enhances processivity of p41/p46, in a manner consistent with that observed for both Pol α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kenny et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 1997</xref>), the Pol α-Primase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dornreiter et al., 1992</xref>) and Pol λ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Krasikova et al., 2008</xref>). In a further, more abrupt contrast, to date, PrimPol has no observable physical or functional interaction with PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guilliam et al., 2015b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45320.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model proposing the dual functionality of p41/p46 complex based on protein function and known interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Priming: p41/46 is recruited at the replication fork and engages in the synthesis of a short RNA primer in a manganese catalysed reaction on both the leading and lagging strand. On the leading strand switching to a catalytic magnesium ion occurs, resulting in incorporation of dNTPs and extension of the RNA primer by p41/p46 until the loading of PCNA and the recruitment of PolB displace it to initiate DNA synthesis. Synthesis of an RNA primer by p41/p46 leads to direct loading of PCNA and recruitment of PolD to initiate DNA synthesis on the lagging strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Henneke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Le Breton et al., 2007</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) TLS: DNA replication stalls upon the HiFi Pol active site encountering oxidative damage. Unable to bypass the damaged nucleobase, polymerase switching occurs, with p41/p46 recruited to the primer-template junction and retained by PCNA. RPA bound to the single stranded region of DNA stabilizes the phosphodiester backbone downstream of the damage, allowing p41/p46 to function as a TLS polymerase, replicating past the damaged nucleobase until it is eventually replaced with a processive HiFi DNA polymerase.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45320-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>It is the interaction with PCNA that cements the duality of p41/p46 as a primase and TLS polymerase, enhancing the notion of divergent roles for the differing AEP clades. While still not fully understood, evidence from the eukaryotes suggests that replication factor C (RFC), the clamp loader, is instrumental in polymerase switching, displacing the low fidelity Pol α complex following primer synthesis and initial elongation and recruiting the high fidelity Pol δ during PCNA loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Waga and Stillman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maga et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mossi et al., 2000</xref>).

If p41/p46 does not interact with PCNA during replication initiation, then when does the interaction occur? Y-family DNA polymerases Pol η, Pol ι and Pol κ, all TLS polymerases, have well-established physical and functional interactions with PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bienko et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Masuda et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, PCNA has been observed to stimulate polymerase activity and recruit the human TLS polymerase Pol ι to the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haracska et al., 2001</xref>), similar to the role observed in this paper.</p><p>In conclusion we have identified that as well as being a capable TLS polymerase that is stimulated by the stabilising presence of RPA, p41/p46 functionally interacts with the replisome ‘scaffold’ protein PCNA. Coupled with data highlighting that PolB and PolD stall upon encountering 8-oxodG in the presence of PCNA, this allows elucidation of the processes that occur when the replisome encounters a lesion such as 8-oxodG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Replicative polymerases stall when encountering a lesion, possibly reversing replication with their exonuclease activity, this allows displacement of the polymerase and recruitment of the p41/p46 complex by the replisome ‘scaffold’ protein PCNA. Stabilised by RPA TLS occurs before p41/p46 is in turn displaced by one of the replicative DNA polymerases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and cell culture techniques for 8-oxodG detection</title><p>The <italic>E. coli</italic> CIP 54.8 strain (Biological Resource Center of Institut Pasteur, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://research.pasteur.fr/fr/team/biological-resources-center/">https://research.pasteur.fr/fr/team/biological-resources-center/</ext-link>) was cultivated in 1 L of LB at 37°C with shaking.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Interplay at the replisome mitigates the impact of oxidative damage on genetic integrity of hyperthermophilic <italic>Archaea</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. A summary below of the work is followed by major revisions and problems that the reviewers found important for final adjudication.</p><p>Killelea and colleagues investigate the ability of DNA polymerases Pol B, Pol D and the polymerase-primase p41/p46 from <italic>Pyrococcus abyssi</italic>, to bypass template 8-oxodG. The authors first conduct measurements to assess the levels (steady state and upon induction by oxidative stress) of 8-oxodG in the <italic>Archaea</italic> genomic DNA. Next the authors attempt to measure bypass in whole cell-free extracts using synthetic primer-templates. But these measurements are complicated, not surprisingly, by what appears to be repair activity in the extract. Therefore, the authors used primer extension and degradation assays with purified polymerases. The authors conclude that even in the presence of accessory proteins PCNA and RPA, Pols B and D are relatively inefficient in 8-oxodG bypass. When the polymerases pause at the lesion their exonuclease activities take over and start degrading the primer strand. The authors argue that the idling at the lesion allows displacement of the replicative pol and recruitment of p41/p46, which bypasses the lesion and in turn is replaced by the replicative polymerase.</p><p>The subject of this work is important, as so far, much less is known about TLS and repair of 8-oxodG lesions in <italic>Archaea</italic> relative to the knowledge of eukaryotes and bacteria. Therefore, this work will be of interest to all studying DNA replication and repair. However, some of the experiments are insufficient to support the models put forward. There are also other issues that must be addressed.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) &quot;Coupled with enhanced exonuclease activity for both Pol B and Pol D when in presence of PCNA, this raises the notion of the stalling seen when encountering 8-oxodG manifesting as prolonged idling [...]&quot; As shown in Figure 5C, exonucleolytic degradation of the primer is stimulated by PCNA. However, these reactions are not in the presence of dNTPs, and therefore no extension or polymerase idling is possible. On the other hand, when synthesis is permitted by addition of dNTPs there is no evidence of primer degradation (Figure 3D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). Hence, these results do not support the authors' model.</p><p>2) There is no description of the 3´&gt;5´ exonuclease assay in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>3) &quot;we have identified that […] p41/p46 physically and functionally interacts with the replisome &quot;scaffold&quot; protein PCNA.&quot; This statement should be modified; the authors did not conduct experiments that show physical interaction between p41/p46 and PCNA.</p><p>4) &quot;Finally, we measure the intrinsic proofreading activities&quot; The authors measured 3´&gt;5´ exonuclease activity and not proofreading activity, which is error correction.</p><p>5) Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, bottom of figure: &quot;87 nt product (%)&quot; According to Supplementary file 1, the template strand in p/t-6 substrate is a 34-mer, not a 87-mer.</p><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, if this is a denaturing gel, as indicated in the Materials and methods, why does the band labeled dsDNA (34bp) migrate differently than the 34 nt marker?</p><p>Figure 2, it would be helpful if the position of the damaged base was indicated in the gels.</p><p>6) &quot;the occurrence of TLS by PabCE can be observed with 1% of primer DNA being fully extended in oxidative damage containing substrates (Figure 2B).&quot; What is the percentage of full-length product with the dG-containing p/t-2 substrate? This is important to assess to what extent synthesis on the p/t-2 template is hampered by the necessity to strand displace.</p><p>7) Figure 2. According to the figure legend, the survival curve is based on values from three replicate culture samples. Standard deviations should be included so that the reproducibility of the data can be evaluated. In the graph, the percentage of surviving cells appears the same or lower at T3 than T2. The authors should use a broken axis.</p><p>8) In the Results section, the statement &quot;The cumulative effect that both accessory proteins have on primer extension is noticeable” is misleading. The results for PolB indicate that on its own, PCNA stimulates synthesis both on the damage-containing and the undamaged templates. PCNA counteracts the inhibitory effect RPA on both damaged and undamaged templates. (Figure 3D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B).</p><p>The results of the two experiments with PolD are not consistent. In Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, the amount of primer extensions on the dG-containing template is the same with and without PCNA, but results in Figure 3D indicate that primer extension on the dG template is over 50% lower in presence of PCNA relative to reactions without PCNA. Due to this inconsistency, these results are difficult to evaluate, and the conclusions do not seem valid.</p><p>9) &quot;Indeed, RPA not only reduces the amount of primer-n, but also the length of the final degradation product.&quot; Reduced amount of primer degradation results in longer, not shorter, degradation products. Please correct.</p><p>10) “In-vivo validation of TLS in the <italic>Archaea</italic> was provided through the use of primer extension by cell-free extract&quot; Cell-free extracts are not the same as in vivo conditions.</p><p>11) A general point to be addressed perhaps in the Discussion: The manuscript starts by making the case that this organism endures the generation of a much higher level of 8-oxoG in the genome than does the mesophile <italic>E. coli</italic>. However, they should be cautious in the in vivo 8-oxoG measurements, which have a notorious history of over-estimation. The in vitro studies give some basic information, but more refined analysis will have to sort that out under conditions where the enzyme and substrate ratios are more realistic.</p><p>12) Introduction, second paragraph: 8-oxodG is not a base, it is a deoxyribonucleoside.</p><p>Introduction, second and third paragraphs: Remove &quot;Ref.&quot;</p><p>13) In the experiments for which oxygen was not added and was assumed not to be present, were all materials purged with nitrogen, helium, etc. so that there was no oxygen present and were all experiments done in a glove box which was similarly purged? If so, this should be noted; if not, they should have been done that way.</p><p>14) Subsection “Genomic DNA isolation and detection of 8-oxodG”, first paragraph and elsewhere: What was the concentration of β-mercaptoethanol?</p><p>15) Subsection “Genomic DNA isolation and detection of 8-oxodG”, first paragraph: This material is not clear-enough to reproduce the procedures. It should be rewritten.</p><p>16) Introduction, third paragraph: Define the units.</p><p>17) Legend to Table 1: there are no error bars shown.</p><p>18) Figure 6: The symbols ought to be specifically defined either on the figure or in its legend. Otherwise is quite difficult to follow.</p><p>19) Supplementary file 1: The conformations are not shown and even base pairing is not shown.</p><p>20) Introduction, second paragraph: This is confusing, as MutT/MTH1 does not act on 8-oxoG in the template – maybe the authors mean 8-oxoG that is incorporated from the triphosphate and then remains in the (new) template for the next round of replication.</p><p>21) Table 1: What is the level of detection for assigning &quot;ND&quot; for the <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA samples? Meanwhile, the numbers reported for <italic>P. abyssi</italic> have an indefensible level of precision. I doubt that the measurements are good to one part in 10,000 (0.01%) as the numbers imply. Finally, since <italic>P. abyssi</italic> was grown anaerobically, it cannot be ruled out that much of the observed 8-oxoG levels are artifactual, with the lesion generated during DNA extraction, which evidently was not done under anaerobic conditions (subsection “Strains and cell culture techniques for 8-oxodG detection”).</p><p>22) Figure 2 is strange: it appears that the cells were exposed to oxygen for only the 5 minutes of treatment (but this is not clear from the figure legend or the Materials and methods section), so why, after reaching near zero at T2, do the 8-oxoG levels rise again at T3 and T4?</p><p>23) Figure 3—figure supplement 1: Probably the U residue is rapidly converted to an AP site, even (or especially) in single-stranded DNA.</p><p>24) Subsection “Bypass of 8-oxoguanine by <italic>P. abyssi</italic> cell extracts”: Most DNA repair enzymes act much more rapidly on lesions in double-stranded DNA than in a single-stranded context (the typical uracil glycosylase is an exception). So the explanation that the lesion is &quot;protected&quot; in dsDNA doesn't make sense.</p><p>25) Figure 3D/Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and associated text, and other figures and text: PCNA does not stably associate with linear DNA – it tends to slide off an end. The results would be more solid with a circular DNA substrate or one blocked at the ends; the PCNA-loading enzyme would then also be needed.</p><p>26) Figure 5: It is hard to make any conclusions about PolD, since its 3' exonuclease appears inherently very weak, despite its being present at (apparently) 100 times the PolB level and in a 5-fold excess over the amount of substrate present (assuming that the same conditions as for primer extension were used for the exonuclease assays; the Materials and methods do not seem to specify the conditions).</p><p>27) Figure 5 quantification: to determine the percentage of primer shortening shown, presumably products shorter than n-1 are included; that's the only way to account for some of the values shown. However, it is very important to correct for the extra background that comes with every band; the Materials and methods do not specify that, and some of the results look as though they might be inflated by such an artifact.</p><p>28) Discussion: In view of the foregoing concerns, some places in this section might be toned down where activities are stated to be &quot;proficient&quot; or &quot;efficient&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45320.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) &quot;Coupled with enhanced exonuclease activity for both Pol B and Pol D when in presence of PCNA, this raises the notion of the stalling seen when encountering 8-oxodG manifesting as prolonged idling […]&quot; As shown in Figure 5C, exonucleolytic degradation of the primer is stimulated by PCNA.

Unfortunately, fluorophores such as the positively charged Cy5 that was used in this study reduce the effectiveness of denaturing gels for denaturing fluorescently labelled dsDNA. As shown in the Materials and methods section an excess of oligonucleotide complimentary to the unlabelled template strand is added after quenching the reaction to ensure that the labelled ssDNA is unable to re-anneal. However, this strategy is less effective when using a double fluorophore substrate. To produce a decipherable image of the Cy5 labelled primer an excess of oligo complimentary to the FAM labelled template was added. To mitigate these suitable controls were added in the form of single stranded DNA size markers and a 34bp FAM labelled duplex. The figure legend of Figure 3—figure supplement 1C has been altered to explain this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2, it would be helpful if the position of the damaged base was indicated in the gels.</p></disp-quote><p>The location of the damaged base has been highlighted and the legend adjusted accordingly</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) &quot;the occurrence of TLS by PabCE can be observed with 1% of primer DNA being fully extended in oxidative damage containing substrates (Figure 2B).&quot; What is the percentage of full-length product with the dG-containing p/t-2 substrate?

Due to this inconsistency, these results are difficult to evaluate, and the conclusions do not seem valid.</p></disp-quote><p>The results of the two experiments with PolD are not inconsistent. Instead, they clearly matched our previous results (Henneke, 2005) showing that PolD incorporates less dNTPs in the presence of a shorter DNA primer and that PCNA stimulates full-length synthesis by PolD rather than primer utilization. (primer length of the two DNA primers used in standing and starting start reactions in this current study are exactly the same length than those in the paper of Henneke, 2005). Thus, the influence of the primer-length on primer extension again demonstrates that PolD behaves differently in the presence of primer-template with diverse length of DNA primer. This was stated in the subsection “Role of replication fork accessory proteins in replication bypass of template strand 8-oxodG“. Nevertheless, for reinforcing this peculiar behaviour, we added this comment in the text and cited our previous paper.</p><p>Accordingly to these overall comments, subsection “Role of replication fork accessory proteins in replication bypass of template strand 8-oxodG “is now modified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) &quot;Indeed, RPA not only reduces the amount of primer-n, but also the length of the final degradation product.&quot; Reduced amount of primer degradation results in longer, not shorter, degradation products.

Cells have been collected under anaerobic conditions and genomic extraction has been performed according to protocols which minimise the generation of artifactual 8-oxoG such as including deferoxamine mesylate (Hofer T, et al., 2006, iol. Chem) in solutions and by avoiding the use of standard phenol/chrolorfom procedure known to provoke accidental oxidation of DNA (Claycamp HG, 1992, Carcinogenesis). This information is available in the Materials and methods section and is now better explained in the text as required in point 15.</p><p>In a very recent paper cited at the beginning of the Discussion (Barbier et al., 2016), the level of OxoG in the genome of Thermococcus gammatolerans (9.2 +/- 0.9 8-oxoG per 10exp6 dG) which thrives at 85°C under anaerobic conditions is higher than that in the genome (2.6 +/- 0.9 8-oxoG per 10exp6 dG) of the mesophile <italic>E. coli</italic>. Here, we also found a higher level of 8-oxoG in the genome of <italic>Pyrococcus abyssi</italic> compared to that in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Moreover, we demonstrate that the level of 8-oxoG in the genome of <italic>P. abyssi</italic> is higher than that in T. gammatolerans, confirming that increased temperature of growth favours DNA oxidation (95°C compared with 85°C, respectively).</p><p>Consistent with these results (our whole study) and those published previously, TLS (damage tolerance) and repair mechanisms are proposed to be active in response to DNA oxidation in the archaeal genomes.</p><p>According to these explanations and the comment of the reviewer, the first and second paragraphs of the Discussion have been modified.

Since it is not essential and has confused one reviewer, the sentence has been deleted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) Table 1: What is the level of detection for assigning &quot;ND&quot; for the E. coli DNA samples?</p></disp-quote><p>The limit of detection of the HPLC/EC/UV is 0.01 pmol of 8-oxodG which corresponds to one 8-oxodG lesion per 10<sup>6</sup> dG. To facilitate a simpler comparison between <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>P. abyssi</italic>, it has now also been included directly in the text of the Materials and methods and in the legend of Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Meanwhile, the numbers reported for P. abyssi have an indefensible level of precision. I doubt that the measurements are good to one part in 10,000 (0.01%) as the numbers imply.</p></disp-quote><p>All data are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD), with <italic>n</italic>=3. <italic>n</italic>=3 refers to three independent DNA extraction from either exponentially or stationary phase cells. In addition, two different biological samples for each phase cells have been measured. Bases on this set of measurements, the mean and standard deviation have the same unit (0.01) of precision which does not seem to be unusual according to the literature. Indeed, there are several publications in which the levels of 8-oxo-dG lesion per 10<sup>6</sup> dG reached the same level of precision (Speina, E. et al., 2005, Journal of the National Cancer Institute; Roszkowski, K., 2012, Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev.; Guindon-Kezis, K.A., 2014, Toxicology).</p><p>Nevertheless, to avoid any astonishment and confusion by the readers, the precision of reported data now corresponds to one digit after the decimal point (0.1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, since P. abyssi was grown anaerobically, it cannot be ruled out that much of the observed 8-oxoG levels are artifactual, with the lesion generated during DNA extraction, which evidently was not done under anaerobic conditions (subsection “Strains and cell culture techniques for 8-oxodG detection”).</p></disp-quote><p>This comment overlaps point 11. As explained, genomic extraction and preparation have been performed according to protocols which minimise the generation of artifactual 8-oxoG such as including deferoxamine mesylate (Hofer T, et al. 2006, iol. Chem) in solutions and by avoiding the use of standard phenol/chrolorfom procedure known to provoke accidental oxidation of DNA (Claycamp HG, 1992, Carcinogenesis). Besides, our methodology is consistent with a recent paper (Chepelev, NL., 2015 J. Vis. Exp) describing a detailed protocol for the detection of 8-oxo-dG by HPLC-EC-UV in DNA from cell cultures. This methods paper illustrates how DNA sample preparation should be achieved to minimize undesirable DNA oxidation that can occur during sample preparation (Chepelev, NL., 2015 J. Vis. Exp).</p><p>On the other hand, the values of 8-oxodG in the genome of <italic>P. abyssi</italic> are clearly consistent with those determined recently in the genome of a closely related specie <italic>T. gammatolerans</italic> (Barbier et al., 2016). Interestingly, upon exposure to oxidative stress a two-fold increase of 8-oxodG is measured in the genome of <italic>T. gammatolerans</italic> and <italic>P. abyssi</italic>, respectively.</p><p>Thus, our employed method successfully analyses DNA samples by minimizing the introduction of artifactual DNA oxidation. It provides reliable detection and quantification of 8-oxodG in the genome of <italic>P. abyssi</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22) Figure 2 is strange: it appears that the cells were exposed to oxygen for only the 5 minutes of treatment (but this is not clear from the figure legend or the Materials and methods section), so why, after reaching near zero at T2, do the 8-oxoG levels rise again at T3 and T4?</p></disp-quote><p>The time of exposure to oxygen followed by recovery of anaerobic cultivation is now clearly reported in the graph and the text. Time of oxygen exposure was 5 minutes followed by recovery of anaerobic cultivation by nitrogen sparging to the cultivation. Nevertheless, the complete anaerobic recovery is not immediate and requires 20 minutes upon nitrogen sparging. It is now better explained and illustrated in the legend of Figure 2 but also in the corresponding Results section entitled (Rate of 8-oxodG in the genome of <italic>P. abyssi</italic>).</p><p>At T3 and T4, the level of 8-oxodG has been determined from the genome of cells which survived the oxidative stress. This demonstrates the recovery of cells by increased cell densities along with the recovery of the basal level of 8-oxodG in their genome (respectively, 65.1 and 77.11 8-oxoxdG per 10exp6dG at T3 and T4). These values are consistent with those found at T0 and in Table 1 (60.1+/-15.9 and 63.2+/-4.6 of 8-oxoxdG per 10exp6dG, respectively). According to the mean+/-standard deviation found at T0 and Table 1, the values obtained at T3 and T4 are considered similar and consistent with the basal level.</p><p>At T2, the level of 8-oxodG was not measurable because of very low cell densities, thus preventing a sufficient amount of extracted genomic DNA for the detection by HPLC-EC-UV. It is now better explained in the corresponding Results section entitled (Rate of 8-oxodG in the genome of <italic>P. abyssi</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23) Figure 3—figure supplement 1: Probably the U residue is rapidly converted to an AP site, even (or especially) in single-stranded DNA.</p></disp-quote><p>This may well have occurred, but it is impossible to verify from the available data. Moreover, part C of the figure clearly shows that cleavage of both dU and 8-oxodG containing templates producing FAM labelled products &lt;10 nt in length, thus highlighting phosphodiester cleavage. As such this is the focus of the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>24) Subsection “Bypass of 8-oxoguanine by P. abyssi cell extracts”: Most DNA repair enzymes act much more rapidly on lesions in double-stranded DNA than in a single-stranded context (the typical uracil glycosylase is an exception). So the explanation that the lesion is &quot;protected&quot; in dsDNA doesn't make sense.</p></disp-quote><p>The word “protected” has been removed and the text adjusted accordingly</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>25) Figure 3D/Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and associated text, and other figures and text: PCNA does not stably associate with linear DNA – it tends to slide off an end. The results would be more solid with a circular DNA substrate or one blocked at the ends; the PCNA-loading enzyme would then also be needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The use of linear DNA substrates to study the impact of PCNA:DNA polymerase interactions has previously been used in a number of peer reviewed publications by not only our research group, but also others (Crespan,E., ACS Chem Biol., 2013; Yan, J., Nature Comm, 2017; Narita, T.Genes to cell, 2010). For instances where data shows the impact of PCNA on 8-oxodG bypass by the DNA polymerases a control containing just dG in the place of 8-oxodG is also included so that any “sliding off” can be taken into account. Moreover, the data present here is fairly conclusive in regard to PCNA impacting on the DNA polymerase performance, suggesting that “falling off” is less problematic than implied in this comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>26) Figure 5: It is hard to make any conclusions about PolD, since its 3' exonuclease appears inherently very weak, despite its being present at (apparently) 100 times the PolB level and in a 5-fold excess over the amount of substrate present (assuming that the same conditions as for primer extension were used for the exonuclease assays; the Materials and methods do not seem to specify the conditions).</p></disp-quote><p>The Materials and methods have been modified to include the exonuclease assay conditions as also asked in Point 2. Enzyme concentrations used to produce this data were chosen after assaying polymerisation over 30 minutes, with concentrations of Pol B, PolD and P41/P46 used that exhibit comparable levels of polymerase activity when extending dG containing p/t-1. This strategy was chosen to avoid any discrepancies that could arise in protein purifications and to ensure that the results were not biased by the inherent differences in polymerase activity of what are three very different DNA polymerising enzymes. While it is true that the data highlights that PolD is for the most part a weaker exonuclease than PolB it can clearly be seen from Figure 5 (now Figure 6) that the exonuclease activity of PolD on a dT:dG mismatch is effective, suggesting that the substrate is important to its specific activity. As such we don’t believe that it is accurate to describe the activity as inherently weak.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>27) Figure 5 quantification: to determine the percentage of primer shortening shown, presumably products shorter than n-1 are included; that's the only way to account for some of the values shown. However, it is very important to correct for the extra background that comes with every band; the Materials and methods do not specify that, and some of the results look as though they might be inflated by such an artifact.</p></disp-quote><p>The Materials and methods have been modified to include exonuclease quantification.</p><p>When quantifying the data all care was taken to correct for background interference. Considering the reviewers concern about this particular figure the quantification has been repeated with the new quantification values included in the figure (Figure 5 is now Figure 6). The re-quantification shows no significant variation (+/- 5%) from that originally shown with the exception of result for PolD +PCNA acting on p/t-4 (dT:dG) Figure 5C, which has been altered from 62% primer-n to 45%.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>28) Discussion: In view of the foregoing concerns, some places in this section might be toned down where activities are stated to be &quot;proficient&quot; or &quot;efficient&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Accordingly, the text has been modified in the third paragraph (“proficient” deleted in the fourth sentence) and in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion (“proficient” and “efficient” have been toned down).</p></body></sub-article></article>
