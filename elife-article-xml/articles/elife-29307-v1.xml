However, whether these traits protect herbivores against their enemies is poorly understood. We demonstrate that the western corn rootworm <italic>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</italic>, the most damaging maize pest on the planet, specifically accumulates the root-derived benzoxazinoid glucosides HDMBOA-Glc and MBOA-Glc. MBOA-Glc is produced by <italic>D. virgifera</italic> through stabilization of the benzoxazinoid breakdown product MBOA by N-glycosylation. The larvae can hydrolyze HDMBOA-Glc, but not MBOA-Glc, to produce toxic MBOA upon predator attack. Accumulation of benzoxazinoids renders <italic>D. virgifera</italic> highly resistant to nematodes which inject and feed on entomopathogenic symbiotic bacteria. While HDMBOA-Glc and MBOA reduce the growth and infectivity of both the nematodes and the bacteria, MBOA-Glc repels infective juvenile nematodes. Our results illustrate how herbivores combine stabilized and reactivated plant toxins to defend themselves against a deadly symbiosis between the third and the fourth trophic level enemies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29307.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The western corn rootworm is the most damaging pest of maize plants. Out of sight, the larvae of this beetle feed on maize roots, and cause billions of dollars worth of losses each year. One of the reasons why this pest remains such a problem is it can adapt and resist many crop protection strategies.</p><p>Biological control refers to combating a pest using its own natural enemies – for example, its predators. Biological control of the western corn rootworm has been attempted using nematode worms. Normally, the nematodes locate and enter an insect larvae, release bacteria that kill it, and then feed and multiply within the dead larvae. Yet, the western corn rootworm seems at least partly able to resist these nematodes, and the success of biological control in the field has been variable.</p><p>Several insect herbivores are known to accumulate, or sequester, plant toxins in their own body for self-defense. Previously, in 2012, researchers reported that the western corn rootworm is resistant and attracted to the major toxins in maize roots, the benzoxazinoids. The blood-like fluid of the western corn rootworm also repels many predators. Could the western corn rootworm be sequestering maize benzoxazinoids to resist the biological control of nematodes and their bacterial partners?</p><p>Plants store benzoxazinoids in a non-toxic form. If herbivores damage the plant, these molecules quickly break down into compounds that are toxic to most insects. Now Robert et al. – who include two of the researchers involved in the 2012 study – show that the western corn rootworm uses a similar defense system to protect itself against biological control nematodes and their bacterial partners. First, the larvae convert a benzoxazinoid breakdown product by adding a glucose molecule. They then release large amounts of this modified molecule to repel young nematodes. Second, via an unknown mechanism, the larvae stabilize a second plant-derived benzoxazinoid, sequester its non-toxic form in their bodies, and activate it upon nematode attack. The resulting toxins can kill both nematodes and their bacterial partners. By combining different chemical strategies to stabilize and activate plant toxins, the western corn rootworm is able to resist the nematodes used for biological control.</p><p>These findings can help to explain why biological control has had limited success against the western corn rootworm. In the long run, they may lead to more effective biological control programs, for instance by stopping the western corn rootworm from sequestering benzoxazinoids or by using natural enemies that are resistant to the insect’s toxins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>benzoxazinoid sequestration</kwd><kwd>benzoxazinoid detoxification</kwd><kwd>tritrophic interactions</kwd><kwd><italic>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Heterorhabditis bacteriophora</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>140196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robert</surname><given-names>Christelle AM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>160786</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robert</surname><given-names>Christelle AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Erb</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>155781</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erb</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>157884</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erb</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The western corn rootworm escapes biological control by entomopathogenic nematodes by partitioning and phenocopying the plant defense system for self-protection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The growth and reproduction of herbivores is constrained by both plant quality and predation by higher trophic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hunter et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ode, 2006</xref>). Certain herbivores have found a way out of this quandary by redirecting plant defenses against their own predators: By ingesting and accumulating plant toxins, a phenomenon referred to as sequestration, herbivores may make themselves unattractive or toxic to natural enemies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nishida, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petschenka and Agrawal, 2016</xref>). The resulting transfer of plant toxins across three trophic levels is increasingly recognized as a powerful force that shapes the distribution and abundance of plants, herbivores and predators in natural and agricultural ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hopkins et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Many plants store non-toxic forms of plant defenses (so called protoxins) separately from the enzymes that activate them and only form the toxins upon tissue disruption when protoxin and activating enzyme come together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hopkins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wouters et al., 2016</xref>). Some sequestering herbivores in turn have evolved the ability to phenocopy these two-component defense systems by stabilizing and sequestering the protoxins and producing their own activating enzymes to release the toxins in a controlled fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zagrobelny and Møller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kazana et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Francis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Opitz and Müller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Müller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pontoppidan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones et al., 2002</xref>). Although much progress has been made in the identification of the molecular mechanisms involved in phenocopying such two-component defense systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Opitz and Müller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bridges et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hartmann et al., 1997</xref>), we know surprisingly little about their actual function in defense. It remains for instance unclear whether re-activation is required for herbivore protection and which predators are targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zagrobelny and Møller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kazana et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bridges et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hartmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zagrobelny et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pratt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agrawal et al., 2012</xref>). Testing whether two-component systems indeed protect herbivores against predators is necessary to place them in an adequate ecological and evolutionary context.</p><p>After being taken up by herbivores, plant defense metabolites may not only influence herbivore predators and parasitoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ode, 2006</xref>), but also higher trophic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Nouhuys et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harvey et al., 2007</xref>). Effects extending to four trophic levels may be particularly likely in systems where the third and the fourth trophic level are intimately linked. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) for instance feed on insect-killing symbiotic bacteria which they inject into their herbivore hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaya and Gaugler, 1993</xref>). So far, the specific effects of sequestered plant defenses on the fourth trophic level remain unknown.</p><p>In contrast to aboveground herbivores, very little is known about plant toxin sequestration and the prevalence of two-component defense systems in belowground herbivores. Root feeders are among the most important agricultural pests and can have significant impacts on the abundance and distribution of other species, including leaf feeders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blossey and Hunt-Joshi, 2003</xref>). The two milkweed beetle larvae <italic>Tetraopes tetraophthalmus</italic> and <italic>T. texanus</italic> were recently found to accumulate cardenolides from their host plants. Sequestered cardenolide concentrations did not correlate with resistance to EPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ali and Agrawal, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the larvae and adults of the spotted cucumber beetle <italic>Diabrotica undecimpunctata</italic> accumulate cucurbitacin triterpenes from their host plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tallamy et al., 1998</xref>). Cucurbitacins are passed on to the eggs and can protect the latter against pathogenic fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tallamy et al., 1998</xref>). Whether cucurbitacins protect <italic>D. undecimpunctata</italic> larvae against predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gould and Massey, 1984</xref>) and EPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbercheck et al., 1995</xref>) is unclear.</p><p>In this study, we investigated how the western corn rootworm <italic>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</italic> (<italic>D. virgifera</italic>) deals with the major defensive metabolites of maize. <italic>Diabrotica virgifera</italic> is among the most damaging pest insects on this planet. Its larvae develop exclusively on maize roots and cause over $2 billion worth of damage every year in the United States alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray et al., 2009</xref>). Earlier studies found that the hemolymph of the larvae is repellent to a wide variety of predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lundgren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Welch and Lundgren, 2014</xref>), which may contribute to the limited success of biological control programs against <italic>D. virgifera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray et al., 2009</xref>). Our own work revealed that the larvae of the western corn rootworm are fully tolerant to benzoxazinoids (BXs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robert et al., 2012a</xref>), a dominant class of secondary metabolites in maize that provides broad spectrum resistance against a variety of other pests and diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wouters et al., 2016</xref>). We also found that the larvae are attracted by BXs and use them to navigate the rhizosphere and locate the most nutritious maize roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robert et al., 2012a</xref>). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that <italic>D. virgifera</italic> may be able to sequester BXs, and that these compounds may be the elusive repellent factor that renders <italic>D. virgifera</italic> repellent to predators. BXs function as classical two-component defenses, with the pro-toxins being stored in glycosylated form in the vacuoles of maize cells, the activating β-glucosidases being present in the cytosol and BX hydrolysis occurring upon tissue disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jonczyk et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore also focused on understanding if and how the western corn rootworm stabilizes and re-activates these compounds for self-defense. EPNs are among the major natural enemies of western corn rootworm larvae and have been proposed as promising biocontrol agents to control the pest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kurtz et al., 2007</xref>). Because of the intricate relationship between EPNs and their symbiotic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaya and Gaugler, 1993</xref>), we studied the impact of BX accumulation on both organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sequestration of maize benzoxazinoids by the western corn rootworm</title><p>Metabolite analysis revealed that maize-fed <italic>D. virgifera</italic> larvae accumulated significant amounts of BXs in their body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Fifty <italic>D. virgifera</italic> larvae were placed in a petri dish containing moist filter paper and 10,000 EPNs for 24 hr. Control larvae were placed in similar conditions, but without EPNs. <italic>Diabrotica. virgifera</italic> larvae were collected 40 hr after EPN exposure as a preliminary experiment had shown that the EPN endobiont starts growing at around that time. Three larvae of the same treatment were pooled together and ground in MeOH: H<sub>2</sub>O: FA (50:50:0.5%; 100 µL buffer per mg of collected larval tissue; n <sub>control</sub>=8, n <sub>EPNexposed</sub>=13). The obtained extracts were vortexed and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C.

Supernatants were collected for HPLC-MS analyses as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Effects of BXs on EPN survival and infectivity</title><p>The effects of BX exposure on EPN survival were evaluated by incubating 1000 live EPNs in 1 mL of tap water containing either 50 µg MBOA-Glc, 150 µg HDMBOA-Glc or 25 µg MBOA (n = 10 per treatment, each biological replicate being the average of three technical replicates), and counting dead and living EPNs after 7 days. BX exposure effects on EPN infectivity were assessed by collecting living EPNs from the above solutions and placing them with non-sequestering <italic>D. balteata</italic> larvae. Briefly, a hundred EPNs in 500 µL tap water were added into petri dishes (9 cm diameter, Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, DE) containing a filter paper and five third instar <italic>D. balteata</italic> larvae (n = 6 per treatment). All petri dishes were sealed with parafilm (Bemis Company Inc., Oshkosh, WI) to prevent the larvae from escaping. After 24 hr, <italic>D. balteata</italic> larvae were collected and placed into solo cups containing fresh crown root pieces. Five days later, all larvae were collected and dissected to determine their infection status. <italic>In vivo</italic> BX-mediated resistance to EPN infection was tested by exposing WT- and mutant fed <italic>D. virgifera</italic> larvae to EPNs in petri dishes as described above. The added roots after EPN exposure corresponded to the genotype the larvae had fed on prior to the experiment (mutant or WT). In a first experiment, <italic>D. virgifera</italic> larvae were grown on the <italic>bx1</italic> mutant (n = 9) and the near isogenic WT (B73; n = 8). In a second experiment, <italic>D. virgifera</italic> larvae were grown on the <italic>bx1</italic> (n = 9) and <italic>bx2</italic> (n = 7) <italic>Ds</italic> insertion mutants and their corresponding WT (W22; n = 8).</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Effects of BXs on bacterial growth</title><p>Inoculums of <italic>P. luminescens</italic> (initial optical density at 600 nm: OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.01) were grown in 70 µL of Luria Broth (LB) media (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, DE) containing either water, MBOA, MBOA-Glc or HDMBOA-Glc at concentrations that ranged from 13 to 360 µg/mL (n = 4). Bacteria samples were incubated at 27 ± 0.02°C and analyzed over 30 hr using a Tecan Infinite M200 multimode microplate reader equipped with monochromator optics (Tecan Group Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland). During incubation, the plate was shaken using orbital shaking (4.5 mm amplitude and 5 s shaking cycles) and the OD<sub>660nm</sub> was measured every 30 min. Data were analyzed using the Excel add-in DMfit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baranyi and Roberts, 1994</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>EPN preference</title><p> To characterize the foraging behavior of EPNs, we designed a two choice assay in petri dishes. A 5 mm layer of 1% agar (Frontier Scientific Inc.) was poured in petri dishes (Greiner Bio-One). In a first experiment, one larva fed on B73 and one larva fed on the <italic>bx1</italic> mutant were pinned with a needle (Prym, DE) on each side of the dish (n = 10). Pinning the last segment of their abdomen did not kill the larvae but allowed them to move around the needle. In a second experiment, exudates of third instar <italic>D. virgifera</italic> larvae fed on B73 and on <italic>bx1</italic> mutant were collected by rinsing the larvae with 50 µL tap water of which 45 µL were added into two 5 mm diameter holes on each side of the petri dishes (n = 23). In a third experiment, the effect of BXs on EPN foraging behavior was tested by offering BX-complemented and control exudate extracts to the petri dishes. Exudates of larvae fed on the double <italic>bx1-igl</italic> mutant were collected as described above. HDMBOA-Glc (3.3 µg/mL; n = 23), MBOA-Glc (6.6 µg/mL; n = 18) or a mix of both (3.3 and 6.6 µg/mL HDMBOA-Glc and MBOA-Glc, respectively; n = 26) were added to 45 µL larval exudates. The final concentrations corresponded to natural concentrations found on third instar WT larval skin. Tap water was added to the exudates. A hundred <italic>H. bacteriophora</italic> in 50 µL tap water were added in a 5 mm diameter hole in the center of the agar plate. The number of EPNs in the four quarters of the plates were counted after 24 hr. EPNs located in the quarters containing the treatment hole in their center were counted as choosing EPNs. Plates were no nematode moved from the center were excluded from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>BX profiling</title><p>Plant samples were flash frozen and ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen. One milliliter extraction buffer (EB: MeOH: H<sub>2</sub>O: formic acid (FA); 50: 50: 0.5%) was added to 100 mg sample. Larval samples were weighed (five larvae pooled per biological replicate) and directly ground in the extraction buffer (1 mL EB per 100 mg tissue) with a pellet pestle motor (n<sub>D.balteata</sub> = 3, n<sub>D.undecimpunctata</sub> = 8, n<sub>D.virgifera</sub> = 5). Larval exudates were extracted by rinsing third instar larvae with 25 µL distilled water and adding 25 µL MeOH: FA (99: 1%) to the solution (n = 6). Larval frass were collected by placing 20 starved larvae on maize roots for 2 hr before transferring them in 1.5 mL pre-weighed tubes for 1 hr (n = 7). BXs processed by EPNs (n = 6–9) and bacteria (n<sub>control</sub> = 3, n<sub>bacteria</sub> = 6) were extracted by adding MeOH: FA (99: 1%) to the EPN or bacteria solution (v/v) and ground using a pellet pestle motor for 30 s. All extracts were vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, at 4°C. Supernatants were collected for HPLC-MS analyses. BX profiling of larvae of the three insect species and of <italic>D. virgifera</italic> larvae following disruption was conducted using an Agilent 1200 infinity system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) coupled to an API 3200 tandem spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, DE) equipped with a Turbospray ion source following the method described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Handrick et al., 2016</xref>). BXs in plants, infected larvae, larval tissue and exudates were quantified using an Acquity UHPLC system coupled to a G2-XS QTOF mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray source (Waters). Gradient elution was performed on an Acquity BEH C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm i.d., 1.7 μm particle size) at 99–72.5% A over 3.5 min, 100% B over 2 min, holding at 99% A for 1 min, where A = 0.1% formic acid/water and B = 0.1% formic acid/acetonitrile. The ﬂow rate was 0.4 mL/min. The temperature of the column was maintained at 40°C, and the injection volume was 1 μL. The QTOF MS was operated in negative mode. The data were acquired over an m/z range of 50–1200 with scans of 0.15 s at collision energy of 4 V and 0.2 s with a collision energy ramp from 10 to 40 V. The capillary and cone voltages were set to 2 kV and 20 V, respectively. The source temperature was maintained at 140°C, the desolvation was 400°C at 1000 L h-1 and cone gas ﬂows was 50 L/hr. Accurate mass measurements (&lt;2 ppm) were obtained by infusing a solution of leucin encephalin at 200 ng/mL at a ﬂow rate of 10 μL/min through the Lock Spray probe (Waters).</p><p>BXs processed by EPNs and their endobiontic bacteria were analyzed with an Acquity UHPLC-MS system equipped with an electrospray source (Waters i-Class UHPLC-QDA, USA). Compounds were separated on an Acquity BEH C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm i.d., 1.7 μm particle size). Water (0.1% FA) and acetonitrile (0.1% FA) were employed as mobile phases A and B. The elution proﬁle was: 0–9.65 min, 97–83.6% A in B; 9.65–13 min, 100% B; 13.1–15 min 97% A in B. The mobile phase ﬂow rate was 0.4 mL/min. The column temperature was maintained at 40°C, and the injection volume was 5 μL. The MS was operated in negative mode, and data were acquired in scan range (m/z 150–650) using a cone voltage of 10V. HDMBOA-Glc and DIMBOA-Glc were quantified in positive mode using single ion monitoring (SIM) at m/z 194 with cone voltage of 20V. All other MS parameters were left at their default values as suggested by the manufacturer. Absolute BX concentrations were determined using standard curves obtained from puriﬁed DIMBOA, MBOA, DIMBOA-Glc, HDMBOA-Glc and synthetized MBOA-Glc.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaPlot 13. Data were first tested for the heteroscedasticity of error variance and normality using Brown-Forsythe and Shapiro-Wilk tests. Data that did not fulfill the above assumptions were transformed or rank-transformed. Student t-tests and analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed to assess differences between treatments. Repeated measures over time were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVAs (RM-ANOVA). Preference data were analyzed by comparing the average difference of the proportions of EPNs choosing control and treatment sides to the null Hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> = 0 using a one tailed t-test. Details on the data transformation, statistical tests and their outcome are available in the Summary Statistics.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Michael Reichelt for analytical support, Mareike Schirmer, Virginia Hill, Romain Daveu, Carla Arce, Liyong Zhang, Baptiste Biet, Lena Kurz, Amélie Tourat and Estelle Chassin for their technical help.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Sequestration and activation of plant toxins protects the western corn rootworm from enemies at multiple trophic levels&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes how western corn rootworms accumulate specific root-derived benzoxazinoid-glucosides to produce MBOA upon predator attack. MBOA not only makes the corn rootworm more resistant to nematodes but also repels them. This work provides a nice example of how a two-component defense system of a herbivore, using the prototoxins from the plant, is used.</p><p>More specifically, Robert et al. show that <italic>Diabrotica virgifera</italic> sequesters benzoxazinoid glucosides from maize roots. The larvae glycosylate the reactive breakdown product MBOA and thus convert it into a stable, supposedly non-toxic storage form (MBOA-glucoside). In addition, HDMBOA-glucoside is stored but the mechanism how its integrity as a glucoside is maintained remains unclear (although rigorous experiments were carried out trying to resolve this). <italic>Diabrotica</italic> larvae are able to hydrolyze HDMBOA-Glucoside to release MBOA upon mechanical disturbance (mimicking predation with forceps). Toxic MBOA is also released when <italic>Diabrotica</italic> larvae are actually infected with entomopathogenic nematodes. Both, nematodes as well as symbiontic bacteria (which degrade the beetle larvae and are later fed upon by nematodes), are also capable of hydrolyzing HDMBOA-glucoside and MBOA-glucoside (bacteria only). Sequestered benzoxazinoids reduce nematode infection rates in <italic>Diabrotica</italic> larvae and purified benzoxazinoids applied to nematodes reduce their infectivity. Furthermore, HDMBOA-glucoside and MBOA (but not MBOA-glucoside) decrease survival in nematodes and increase mortality in bacteria. Although not hydrolyzed by the beetle larvae, MBOA-glucoside repels nematodes.</p><p>The study is highly integrative and carried out in a very detailed manner which is reflected by a broad array of techniques including biochemical assays (gut extractions), chemical analyses based on LC-MS, and pharmacological as well as behavioral assays involving nematodes and bacteria. The study focusses on interactions mediated by sequestered plant compounds across four trophic levels in probably unprecedented detail. All the experiments were designed very rigorously and elegantly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>No major changes are required. Please address all the minor points listed below.</p><p>1) To further place this work in the context of the field, consider citing other studies showing that toxic compounds can have effects on the fourth trophic level, such as Harvey et al., 2007, which demonstrates negative effects of dietary nicotine on hyperparasitoids in Manduca sexta, and/or studies showing the activation of activated-defenses such as references in Beran et al., 2014 or Franzl et al. 1989, Experientia.</p><p>2) Introduction, third paragraph: remains = remain.</p><p>3) Introduction, fourth paragraph: &quot;To the best of our knowledge, the only root feeder known to sequester plant secondary metabolites is the spotted cucumber beetle <italic>Diabrotica undecimpunctata</italic>.&quot; -&gt; I don't think this is correct.
