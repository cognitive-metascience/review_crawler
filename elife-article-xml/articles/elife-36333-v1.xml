inability to stably deliver large multiplexed DNA libraries to cultured cells allowing barcoded pooled screens. Here, we developed a site-specific integration strategy for library delivery and performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2R+ cells. Under basal growth conditions, 1235 genes were essential for cell fitness at a false-discovery rate of 5%, representing the highest-resolution fitness gene set yet assembled for <italic>Drosophila</italic>, including 407 genes which likely duplicated along the vertebrate lineage and whose orthologs were underrepresented in human CRISPR screens. We additionally performed context-specific fitness screens for resistance to or synergy with trametinib, a Ras/ERK/ETS inhibitor, or rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, and identified key regulators of each pathway. The results present a novel, scalable, and versatile platform for functional genomic screens in invertebrate cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36333.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes are made up of DNA and carry the instructions necessary to build an organism. Humans have over 20,000 genes, while other animals, such as fruit flies, have about 14,000. An ongoing challenge in biology is to identify the role of every gene in the human body. Since most of them are conserved in the fruit fly, this insect is one of the most extensively studied organisms.</p><p>Scientists often use a technique called CRISPR to edit genes. It enables researchers to modify DNA sequences to selectively alter the purpose of a gene or even turn it off to find out what it does. CRISPR requires a guide molecule (for example, sgRNAs), which leads the system to a particular DNA sequence to start the process. Often, researchers create many sgRNAs and deliver them to a large pool of cells with the help of viruses, so that each cell gets a different sgRNA that mutates a different gene. When the cells are then treated with a specific drug, the composition of the sgRNAs in the pool changes, depending on which genes are needed to withstand the drug, and which genes – when turned-off – create cells that are resistant to the drug.</p><p>Although thousands of mutant flies have been created to investigate how a deactivated or faulty gene can affect the health and behavior of the fly, we still lack meaningful information on about half of their genes. This is partly because the viruses used to deliver sgRNAs in mammals do not work in fly cells. Here, Viswanatha et al. developed a simple protocol to generate cell pools of CRISPR mutants, which uses a new strategy that uses bacteria to deliver DNA to fly cells.</p><p>This allowed to identify over 1,000 genes necessary for cells to multiply properly, many of which had not been studied before. The technique was also used in combination with drugs to examine the interactions between genes and drugs – an approach that could be further adapted to examine interactions between genes and nutrients, or between genes.</p><p>This new approach will open doors to systematically uncover the purpose of every gene in the fly. A better understanding of what genes do could help to identify potential genetic weaknesses in certain types of cancer or other diseases, which may lead to the development of more effective treatments. Moreover, the method is likely to work in other insects, for example, mosquitos, where it may uncover new genes involved in mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria or Zika virus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic> cell lines</kwd><kwd>CRISPR-cas systems</kwd><kwd>mTOR</kwd><kwd>MAPK</kwd><kwd>fitness essentiality</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005963</institution-id><institution>LAM Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LAM0122P01-17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perrimon</surname><given-names>Norbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-16-1-0127</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perrimon</surname><given-names>Norbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32GM007748-39</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Viswanatha</surname><given-names>Raghuvir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perrimon</surname><given-names>Norbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM067761</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perrimon</surname><given-names>Norbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pooled CRISPR knockout screening in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells enables high-resolution, genome-wide functional genomic comparisons in cell-lines across vast evolutionary distance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Systematic perturbation of gene function in eukaryotic cells using arrayed (well-by-well) reagents is a powerful technique that has been used to successfully assay many fundamental biological questions such as proliferation, protein secretion, morphology, organelle maintenance, viral entry, synthetic lethality, and other topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mohr et al., 2014</xref>). An alternative approach, widely used in mammalian cells, is pooled screening that uses limited titers of integrating lentiviral vectors carrying a perturbative DNA sequence such that each cell receives one integrating virus. In pooled screens, the perturbing DNA reagent serves as the tag in subsequent sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berns et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moffat et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brummelkamp and Bernards, 2003</xref>). A key benefit of this approach is that pool size can be extremely large, allowing high reagent multiplicity and thus increased screen quality. The pooled approach in mammalian cells has been used extensively to perform RNAi and more recently single guide RNA (sgRNA) screens using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hart et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Genetic loss-of-function arrayed RNAi screens in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell lines have provided insight into genes regulating various biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutros et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Björklund et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kiger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">D'Ambrosio and Vale, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Housden et al., 2015</xref>). However, this approach has drawbacks that limit resolution, including off-target effects and incomplete loss-of-function due to RNAi, and the high cost of reagent multiplicity and replication due to the arrayed format. Pooled CRISPR may address the major drawbacks: CRISPR generates complete loss-of-function alleles and causes fewer off-target effects on average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morgens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evers et al., 2016</xref>), and the pooled format allows greater multiplicity and replication for unit cost. Approximately half of the genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, arguably the best characterized multicellular genetic model system, lack functional characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ewen-Campen et al., 2017</xref>), so the need to develop orthogonal screening approaches is clear.</p><p>By comparing the abundance of guides present in actively growing populations of cells at different time points during growth, CRISPR screens provide a relative measurement of cell doubling, but because the cause of proliferation reduction is unclear from the screen alone, the screens are said to identify genes necessary for optimal fitness rather than essential genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hart et al., 2015</xref>). Essential genes, those absolutely required for cell doubling, are, by definition, a subset of fitness genes.</p><p>Here, we introduce a new method to deliver pooled DNA libraries stably into cell lines. We use this technology to conduct a genome-wide CRISPR screen for optimal fitness in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells and identify 1235 genes essential for fitness, 303 of which are uncharacterized in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Moreover, we show that the system can be used in combination with drug perturbation to identify genes that when knocked out buffer cells against the drug or act synergistically with it. The method should be amenable to adapting any pooled DNA library screening approach to <italic>Drosophila</italic> or other invertebrate cell lines, such as shRNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berns et al., 2004</xref>) or CRISPR activation/inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development of a pooled library delivery method for <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell-lines</title><p>Pooled mammalian cell-line screens use lentiviral vectors to deliver highly complex libraries of DNA reagents. However, the use of lentiviral vectors in insect cells is extremely inefficient (unpublished observations) possibly due to toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qin et al., 2010</xref>). An important advantage of library delivery using lentiviral transduction is that each sequence integrates into a transcriptionally active site in the host chromosome where it is expressed and remains in the genome as a detectable barcode such that enrichment or depletion of each sequence can be monitored by massively parallel (next-generation) sequencing. As an alternative strategy, we assessed the efficiency of phiC31 site-specific recombination mediated by plasmid transfection. Methods for recombination in cell lines were recently developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Manivannan and Simcox, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Neumüller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cherbas et al., 2015</xref>), but the quantitative efficiency of integration has not been reported. Efficiency is critical for pooled screening applications as it must reach a threshold above which generating and maintaining &gt;1000X representation of a library of tens of thousands of elements becomes technically and cost-feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kampmann et al., 2014</xref>). We note that a previous study attempted to use pooled transient transfection for barcoded delivery of a DNA library in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells but failed to identify any essential genes using the system, most likely due to the lack of a mechanism for retention of the DNA reagents in the cells through extended passaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bassett et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To test phiC31 integration efficiency in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2R + cell line derivative, PT5, harboring a mobilized MiMIC transposon containing <italic>attP</italic> sites flanking mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Neumüller et al., 2012</xref>) was transfected with a plasmid containing <italic>attB</italic> flanking a GFP-2A-Puro(res) cassette, which we termed ‘pLib6.4’, along with a phiC31 helper plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The population was then passaged for two months to dilute unintegrated DNA. Importantly, no selection reagent was added during these passages in order to monitor the efficiency of integration rather than the added efficiencies of integration and selection. Integration efficiency, inferred through flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggested that phiC31-mediated cassette exchange occurred in ~20% of the cells (even without accounting for incomplete transfection), 123-fold more than the background illegitimate recombination rate observed without phiC31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, pLib6.4, which contains separated <italic>attB</italic> sites flanking the DNA sequence to be integrated, allowed ~40 fold greater integration efficiency than traditional <italic>Drosophila</italic> attB40 vectors such as pCa4B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Markstein et al., 2008</xref>), in which the <italic>attB</italic> sites are adjacent and require integration of the entire plasmid (data not shown).

First, we generated PT5 S2R + cells stably expressing metallothionein-driven SpCas9 (‘PT5/Cas9’). In combination with an sgRNA targeting the nonessential gene <italic>Dredd</italic>, PT5/Cas9 cells without induction were capable of editing nearly 50% of <italic>Dredd</italic> alleles, which was higher than that achieved by repeated rounds of transient transfection with a SpCas9 expression plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and not improved by copper induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In a pilot test of a pooled screening system, we transfected cells with a pool of sgRNAs in pLib6.4 and monitored sgRNA abundance following passaging, reasoning that sgRNAs targeting genes required for optimal fitness would be lost while genes whose presence or absence has no effect on cell growth would be retained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). After 60 days (roughly 60 cell doublings), the pools were significantly depleted of some sgRNAs targeting the essential genes <italic>Rho1</italic> and <italic>Diap1</italic> relative to those targeting genes predicted to have non-essential functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Monitoring <italic>Rho1</italic> or <italic>Diap1</italic>-targeted sgRNAs in the screen pools 30, 45, or 60 days post-transfection showed that 45 days of passaging is optimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). A principle concern of transfection-mediated pooled screening is the potential for low signal-to-noise due to multiple sgRNA delivery to the same cell shortly after transfection, but the subsequent loss of all but one sgRNA at the end of the assay. To determine whether the signal-to-noise ratio could be improved by reducing transfection multiplicity, we developed in parallel an inducible Cas9 expression system in S2R+/PT5 cells using intein-Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2015</xref>) coupled with inducible expression in order to withhold Cas9 activity until sgRNAs have integrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Surprisingly, a comparison of dropout efficiencies between the inducible and constitutive Cas9 platforms showed more selective reduction of <italic>Rho1</italic> or <italic>Diap1</italic> sgRNAs with constitutive rather than inducible Cas9, most likely due to the lower overall editing efficiency from intein-Cas9 as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>).

By ranking genes by fitness score, we calculated a rank-wise false-discovery rate (FDR, defined as cumulative distribution of false-positive/[true positive + false positive]) and set a cutoff at 5%, identifying 1235 fitness genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>The current state-of-the-art for <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell-based screens is arrayed RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mohr et al., 2014</xref>). We re-analyzed a genome-wide RNAi viability screen in S2R+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutros et al., 2004</xref>) and removed double-stranded RNA designs with predicted off-targets, which significantly lowered the FDR of the RNAi screen (see Materials and methods). Nevertheless, compared with pooled CRISPR screen results, the re-analyzed RNAi-based fitness gene set still had a far higher FDR, allowing the discovery of only 145 fitness genes at an FDR of 5% or incurring 44% FDR with a fitness gene set of 1235 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Among genes with an RPKM &gt; 1, RNAi was more likely to identify highly expressed genes, whereas this bias was less prominent in the CRISPR screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We used receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves to determine screen sensitivity for conserved, large macromolecular complexes. Whereas CRISPR and RNAi were both able to detect cytoplasmic ribosomal or proteasomal genes, CRISPR was better able than RNAi to identify significant fractions of the mitochondrial ribosome, aminoacyl-tRNA ligases, RNA polymerase II, basal transcription factors, RNA exosome, or the replication fork at low FDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). As a control, neither method detected peroxisome genes, consistent with the observation that cell lines lacking peroxisomes grow normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goldfischer et al., 1973</xref>) (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Interestingly, a human CRISPR-RNAi screen comparison also found a similar inability of RNAi to detect genes of the mitochondrial ribosome whereas it exceeded CRISPR sensitivity in detecting genes of the cytoplasmic ribosome, possibly due to differences in mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hart et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A technical comparison of CRISPR screens in humans and fly cells indicated that the method performs similarly in both systems. First, the fly screen had similar sensitivity (true-positive rate at 5% FDR) to genome-wide screens in human cell-lines performed with similar reagent number (GeCKO v2 screens) when compared against top RNAi hits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sanjana et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). By comparing sgRNAs that dropped out versus those that failed to dropout for known essential genes, we were able to compute a probability-based position matrix for optimal sgRNA design in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). The position matrix shows complementary nucleotide biases at 15/21 positions and is broadly consistent with human CRISPR screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doench et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, out of the first position of the PAM sequence and the 8 bp seed region before the PAM sequence, 5 of 9 positions are fully consistent while 2 of 9 position are partially consistent with the Doench score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doench et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

The fly fitness gene set partially but significantly overlaps with characterized fitness gene sets from yeast and human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Moreover, an unbiased comparison of gene ontology terms between fly and human fitness genes displays a high degree of correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; Pearson’s r = 0.56). Despite significant overlap between fly and human cell-line fitness genes and conservation of gene ontology terms enriched in both screens, many fly fitness genes map to human genes that were not identified in human CRISPR screens. We hypothesized that fly CRISPR screens identify essential genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells but not in human cells due to paralog redundancy. To test this hypothesis, we inferred putative paralog relationships for moderately or highly conserved orthologs using the DRSC Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool (DIOPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2011</xref>) and retrieved fitness scores for the corresponding human gene using genome-wide human cell-line CRISPR data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lenoir et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Further, to account for the possibility that paralogs may not be expressed, we only analyzed genes that were expressed as mRNA in the human cell-line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lenoir et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Using this framework, 35% of conserved human genes contain a fly-to-human paralog, and 407 fly fitness genes (at 5% FDR) are the orthologs of human genes containing at least one paralog. In the human cell-line CRISPR screen, we noted a significant bias against detecting genes that are conserved in flies and have a paralog in the human genome, and this bias was dramatically elevated for the human orthologs of fly fitness genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Furthermore, this paralog effect extended to a larger dataset generated by the cancer Dependency Map project, in which CRISPR screens were conducted in 436 human cell-lines. By defining a fitness gene as any gene with a CERES score less than 0.8, we sorted human orthologs of fly fitness by the number of cell-lines out of 436 in which they displayed a fitness defect and according to their paralog relationship between flies and humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The result again showed a bias against detecting genes with fly-to-human paralogs in the panel of CRISPR screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

Thus, further studies of these conserved genes are likely to provide new insights into conserved, cell essential processes not yet studied in flies.

For instance, a network involved in photoreceptor cell differentiation scored most strongly as synergistically lethal with tra, possibly because photoreceptor differentiation has been a workhorse phenotype for the characterization of mutants in the Ras/ERK/ETS pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nagaraj and Banerjee, 2004</xref>). Similarly, the top scoring PPI network for RAP-synergy was one involved in the positive regulation of cell-size, a key morphological consequence of upgregulating the PI3K/mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fingar and Blenis, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, similar PPI networks involved in mitosis was identified in both screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that CRISPR screening in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells can reveal context-specific compensatory mechanisms or synergy relevant to major signaling pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>CRISPR screening technologies have illuminated the functions of uncharacterized genes and provided a straightforward, cost-effective pipeline to evaluate gene function in different contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doench, 2018</xref>). However, the benefits of this approach have been inaccessible for <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other insects because the delivery of highly multiplexed DNA libraries has thus far required lentiviral transduction, a process that fails to produce transformed cells (unpublished). Here, we show that multiplexed DNA delivery by transfection followed by site-specific recombination is an effective alternative strategy. We use this technique to deliver a genome-wide library of sgRNA expression cassettes and perform CRISPR knockout fitness screens in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2R+ cells, identifying 1235 fitness genes at 5% FDR. Of note, our CRISPR screens were conducted after approximately 45 doublings (basal essentiality) or 30 doublings (context-specific screens), while most mammalian screens have been conducted with fewer than 30 doublings. This could possibly due to efficiency differences of the CRISPR systems encoded in the two systems or because of the high ploidy of S2R+ cells. Since our timing optimization data used only two sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), we do not know how the set of fitness genes would change in screens conducted with fewer doublings. A practical use for viability screens is examining context-specific growth requirements. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRIPSR knockout system identified mutants conferring drug resistance or synergy, and should thus be suitable for many future context-specific fitness experiments examining gene-drug/nutrient or gene-gene interactions.</p><p>The introduction of systematic knockdown and knockout approaches have greatly reduced false-positive assertions in human cell-line loss-of-function studies, but equally important is knowing what genes are missed by these approaches and providing alternative screening strategies that can target them. Of critical importance are paralogous genes with redundant functions, i.e., the presence of one paralog buffers against the loss of another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ewen-Campen et al., 2017</xref>). Although relevant to human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dickerson and Robertson, 2012</xref>), these genes are ‘invisible’ in singe-gene screens and dramatically reduce search space in gene-by-gene screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ewen-Campen et al., 2017</xref>). When we compared human and fly CRISPR screens, human CRISPR screens were less able to detect the fly orthologs of fitness essential genes when those genes had paralogs relative to the fly genome. This supports the use of parallel <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human screens as one approach to offset genetic redundancy.</p><p>In addition to CRISPR knockout, the strategy we report can be used with numerous other high-throughput screening modalities which were previously not possible in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, including CRISPR activation, CRIPSR inhibition, CRISPR base-editing, shRNA knockdown, cDNA overexpression, perturb-SEQ, and combinatorial approaches for multigene suppression/activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doench, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Najm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, the methods and constructs we employ are likely to be directly transferable to the large number of existing cultured cell-lines derived from other insects such as mosquitos, where they could be used to characterize viral propagation mechanisms in the vectors of human pathogens such as Dengue or Zika.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Vectors and cell lines</title><p>pBS130, phiC31 integrase under control of the HSP70 promoter, was obtained from Addgene.

For minipool experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, sgRNAs were cloned individually using standard methods into the BpiI/BbsI site of pLib6.4 and verified by Sanger sequencing and then mixed. Sequencing reactions were carried out with an ABI3730xl DNA analyzer at the DNA Resource Core of Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (funded in part by NCI Cancer Center support grant 2P30CA006516-48). S2R+ derivative PT5 (NPT005) was obtained from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNAi Screening Center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Neumüller et al., 2012</xref>) and grown in Schneider’s medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS.

For gene-targeted sgRNAs, Group 1 targets kinases and phosphatases as assigned using GLAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2015</xref>) and FDA-approved drug-targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Housden et al., 2017</xref>). Group 2 targets fly-to-human paralogs, identified by using ‘moderate’ or ‘high’ orthology assignment according to DIOPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2011</xref>), not already present in Group 1. Group 3 targets all other remaining genes. Library synthesis was performed by CustomArray using published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, CRISPR sgRNAs were encoded within a 110-nt single-stranded DNA oligo containing unique library-specific barcode sequences and flanked by BpiI/BbsI sites. 15-cycles of PCR using Phusion Polymerase (New England Biolabs) were used to amplify each sub-library, and then BpiI (Fermentas) was added to the amplicons. A non-denaturing 20% TBE gel (Thermo) was used to purify the resulting 23-mer fragment and eluted overnight using the crush-soak method. The concentration of ligatable fragments in each preparation was empirically optimized by test ligations in pLib6.4. Optimized concentrations were used in ligations with BpiI-digested pLib6.4 and then electroporated into Ecloni 10GF’ electrocompetent cells (Lucigen) at a yield of 20–50 times diversity for each library, generating dense colonies on ~60,150 mm LB-carbenicillin plates, which were grown for 18 hr at 37°C and harvested by scraping into LB medium followed by mixing suspended colonies by extensive vortexing. Glycerol was added to 50% and the libraries were flash frozen in 1 mL aliquots. Each sublibrary was prepared by pooled minipreps and eluted in buffer EB (Qiagen). Libraries are available at DRSC/TRiP Functional Genomics Resources (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fgr.hms.harvard.edu/crispr-cell-screening-reagents">https://fgr.hms.harvard.edu/crispr-cell-screening-reagents</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Transfection, pool maintenance, and drug addition</title><p>pBS130 and pLib6.4 containing CRISPR sublibraries were mixed and co-transfected 1:1 into PT5/Cas9 cells using Effectene with the manufacturer’s recommended protocol (Qiagen). For each transfection, cells were first grown until just confluent on T75 flasks for 2–3 days. Doubling was monitored at this passage and determined to be approximately 1/day. Then cells were removed by forceful tapping and replated at 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> per well into 6-well dishes. The number of dishes required reflected the library size and accounted for incomplete transfection efficiency to give at least 1500 cells/sgRNA (for reference, a full-genome screen required all wells of eight 6-well dishes). t = 0 used plasmid readcount values. Transfection efficiency and integration efficiency were monitored periodically after transfection for the first twelve days using flow cytometry (BD LSRII). Flow cytometry was performed at the Harvard Medical School Department of Immunology Flow Core. Each 1.5 wells of cells was transferred to one 10 cm dish and passaged in the presence of 5 ug/mL puromycin and cells were allowed to become confluent over 4–6 days. Next, the pool was contracted by two-fold, and 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells from each of two plates was combined into a single 10 cm dish. 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells were passaged every 5 days until downstream processing at the indicated time. These steps during early phases of selection ensured no loss of diversity due to variable transfection efficiency. To determine partially inhibitory dose of trametinib (Selleck) or rapamycin (Tocris), the effect of varying doses of each drug was first measured in a 4 day treatment to PT5/Cas9 cells by Cell Titer Glo assay (Promega), using manufacturer’s recommended protocol (not shown). From this data, 50 nM trametinib or 2 nM rapamycin was chosen as partially perturbative concentrations for focused library screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). To verify that drug treatment decreased doubling rate during the screen, cell counts were performed periodically using a hemocytometer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Library sequencing and CRISPR screen data analysis</title><p>Genomic DNA was prepared using the Zymo miniprep kit. Assuming DNA content in S2R + cells was 4N, each cell contains ~0.6 pg of DNA. To maintain diversity, all PCRs were conducted from ~5,000 cells per sgRNA per condition. Library amplification was performed using a two-step procedure (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). First, in-line barcoded inside primers (PCR1F x PCR1R) were used to amplify the library in 23 cycles such that the resulting amplicon had the following sequence: 1/2Read1-(N)<sub>n</sub>ANNEALINGSEQUENCE-sgRNA-tracrRNA.

Sequencing was performed at the CCIB DNA Core Facility at Massachusetts General Hospital (Cambridge, MA) or the Harvard Medical School Biopolymers Facility (Boston, MA). De-multiplexing of the library was performed using TagDust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lassmann et al., 2009</xref>) and all downstream analysis was performed within MAGeCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2014</xref>) with the following experiment-specific changes: 1) Readcount files were stripped of sgRNAs below the 10th percentile lowest initial readcounts for each sublibrary before processing in MAGeCK MLE; 2) we performed 1000 iterations for all Z-score assignments.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor.

The T7E1 assay (Figure 1C) is known for lack of sensitivity and therefore it would be worthwhile to address this in a different way e.g. by gRNA mixing experiments followed by targeted sequencing in a heterogenous population.

This platform allows for a pooled screening approach with NGS as a read-out, well established in mammalian cells. They have performed a genome-wide lethality screen in S2R+ cells and identify 1235 essential genes. They find depletion of sgRNAs targeting genes in crucial cellular processes analogous to mammalian cell viability CRISPR screen results. Interestingly, but not unexpected, genes with paralogs in human cells are more prevalent in the S2R+ screens than in human cell screens. Finally, the authors provide a proof-of-principle screen for modulators of pathway inhibition in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells using a MAPK pathway inhibitor Trametinib (MEK) and a PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitor Rapamycin, identifying several components of the respective pathways.</p><p>The establishment of the technology and proof-of-principle examples are well presented and show that large-scale CRISPR screens can be performed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. The identification of lethal genes is relatively easy compared to drug response modifiers, but the examples shown here also illustrate the ability to do so in the S2R+ cells with different treatments. The platform described in this manuscript seems suitable for several types of large scale screens previously performed in mammalian cells and represents a valuable contribution to the scientific community.</p><p>I do have some points that need clarification before publication of this work. In Figure 1B it seems that a large fraction of the cells becomes both mCherry and GFP positive in the presence of the donor and integrase. Would one not expect to lose mCherry expression upon integration of the gRNA cassette containing GFP? This seems a minor fraction of the GFP positive population.</p><p>I am also not convinced that during the transient transfection of the pLib6.4 donor plasmid and before the integration, no gene editing occurs.

The targeted sequencing should also be applied on different time-points to get a better insight in the dynamics, which seems rather slow. This could also provide a more satisfying explanation for the observed difference between stable and transient expression of CAS9.</p><p>The authors claim that <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells &quot;do not have detectable copy-number bias&quot; but do not provide an explanation. It could be that the genome editing is inefficient and not resulting in multiple double strand breaks, preventing a lethal DNA damage mediated cellular response. It would be informative to show the increased numbers of DNA damage foci in cells expressing gRNAs targeting copy-number-amplified loci and study the response to double strand breaks in SR2+ cells.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the submitted manuscript, Viswanatha and colleagues established the methodology and for the first time performed pooled CRISPR-knock out screens in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell line. So far, pooled CRISPR-Cas9 in insect cells was not possible because of lack of a suitable methodology for efficient integration of sgRNA plasmids. To circumvent the inefficiency of lentiviral delivery to <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, the authors established a site-specific library integration strategy and first confirmed its suitability using a limited number of target sgRNAs. They then designed and performed a genome-wide CRISPR knock-out screen in S2R+ cells and identified approx. 1200 essential genes at a 5% FDR. The benchmarked this data set against previous RNAi screens and CRISPR screens in human cells. An important finding is that they could identify a significant number of genes (approx. 400) that are possibly not lethal in human cells because of gene duplication. They further demonstrate that this screening platform is suitable for chemical-genetic screens and show data on MEK and mTOR inhibitor screens using a sub library of 3974 genes.</p><p>Overall, this is a well executed and written study. It is the first time that a pooled screening approach has been (successfully) used in insect cells, opening new avenues for genetic screening. The site-specific integration strategy is elegant and circumvents problems with viral or other types of delivery – this is also an important methodological advance that will open new experimental avenues to perform other types of over expression and silencing studies in a pooled format in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. The part on the comparison with human essential genes is interesting but could be explained and illustrated in more detail. In general, the manuscript would gain from a longer discussion on the definition of &quot;essentiality&quot; or &quot;fitness&quot; in the context of their experimental system to illustrate differences in experimental systems (both yeast/human/<italic>Drosophila</italic> as well as RNAi-screening and CRISPR screening).

Because sgRNAs mix randomly, we suspect that a low level of initial editing will not result in detectable loss of signal-to-noise. We do not believe that there is a practical way to resolve this by sequencing clonal isolates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 1C the annotation of the FACS plots is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include annotations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1C – 'stable' versus 'transient' should be better explained in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We now phrase this differently: “Cells stably or transiently transfected to express Cas9 or control vector were each additionally transfected with an sgRNA targeting the Dredd allele followed by editing efficiency assay</p><p>(T7E1) at the Dredd locus.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2C should indicate correlation of the replicates (e.g. Pearson correlation coefficient of gene-level fold-changes).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a Pearson’s correlation coefficient, which is 0.65, indicating a strong correlation between replicates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– A statistical quantification on the connection between expression and essentiality scoring would be helpful (Figure 2D).</p></disp-quote><p>We performed false-discovery rate assessment according based on rank.

We located a paper in which Qi is a middle author, Chen et al., 2013, which does discuss alterations to the guide scaffold that improve CRISPRi, but we cannot locate a reference that suggests that it removes sequence motif preferences in the context of CRISPR KO screens. As we note in Figure 2H, our position matrix analysis for high performing sgRNAs identified 5/9 positions in common with human CRISPR screens analyzed less than two years ago (Doench et al., 2016). The high degree of overlap between the methods suggests that our screens have similar biases compared with up-to-date mammalian CRISPR screening methods. It would be an interesting point to compare the altered guide scaffold, and we are considering potential improvements along these lines for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3C – if the green set are the fly essential genes, then the red set should read &quot;yeast essentials&quot; (top) or &quot;human essentials&quot; (bottom), and not &quot;fly-to-yeast essentials&quot; (which presumably is the yellow overlap?)</p></disp-quote><p>Accepted and revised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3C shows the overlap between Dmel, human and Drosophila essential genes.

In the previous version of the manuscript, we did not show data to support this. We now include the enrichment of GO terms using Pather DB, which allows us to directly compare terms between fly and human gene sets (Figure 3D), and find high overlap between the terms (Pearson’s r = 0.56). We note that for the analysis, we only include GO terms that have greater than 50 members as this excludes statistical noise due to small gene sets, leading to stochastic variation. With all GO terms, the Pearson’s correlation is still &gt;0.50, suggesting that there is a strikingly robust relationship between GO terms enriched from fitness screens in human and fly cell-lines.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to compare DepMap human cell-line CRISPR screen data, which was released in raw form just last month. This more extensive comparison illustrates the paralog redundancy effect for the human orthologs of our <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell-line essential genes using a larger panel of 436 human cell-lines (Figure 3F).

However, genes that are synergistic with the treatment were listed selectively, so we agree that a more extensive analysis is worthwhile. We now address this by 1) performing GO enrichment for the synergistic candidates (Figure 4E), 2) protein complex enrichment for the candidates using COMPLEAT (flyrnia.org/COMPLEAT) (Figure 4F). The most striking conclusions were from protein complex enrichment: genes linked to photoreceptor cell proliferation (where many Ras pathway components were first identified genetically in flies) were top hits for synergistic lethality with trametinib, whereas genes linked to positive regulation of cell-size (a well-studied consequence of Tor activity) were the top hit for rapamycin synergy. We believe that these analyses greatly strengthen the conclusion that <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRISPR screens can be used to identify genes whose perturbation may function synergistically with drugs targeting cell proliferation pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It should also be explained in the text in more detail how the 3974 genes were chosen.</p></disp-quote><p>The genes used in the context-dependent screens were from the group1 and group2 sublibraries. We have now included more details in the Materials and methods section regarding gene selection. We write: “For gene-targeted sgRNAs, Group 1 targets kinases and phosphatases as assigned using GLAD (Hu et al., 2015) and FDA-approved drug-targets (Housden et al., 2017). Group 2 targets fly-to-human paralogs, identified by using “moderate” or “high” orthology assignment according to DIOPT (Hu et al., 2011), not already present in Group 1. Group 3 targets all other remaining genes.” We also include a statement about Group1 and Group2 gene selection in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure labels are often very small and difficult to read.</p></disp-quote><p>We have increased the font sizes where possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The Materials and methods should contain more details regarding library design and construction so that others in the community will be able to implement the screening setup.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include all primer sequences in Supplementary File 1, and we added a new Figure 1—figure supplement 3, which diagrams the library vector and sequencing procedure and should make it possible for others in the community to perform these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors write, &quot;CRISPR sgRNAs were encoded within a 110-nt single stranded DNA oligo containing unique library-specific barcode sequences and flanked by BpiI/BbsI sites.&quot; The common sequence of the oligos (5' and 3' to the sgRNA) should be given, including the barcode sequences.</p><p>– The sequences of the oligos used for amplifying the sub-libraries should be given.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include all primer sequences in Supplementary File 1 including those used to prepare the library and sequence the integrated library from cell pools, and we have added a figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 3) which includes a map of the library vector and outlines the sequencing procedure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Sequencing results of libraries should be made publicly available to allow re-analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We will coordinate with <italic>eLife</italic> to make these files available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors claim that Drosophila cells &quot;do not have detectable copy-number bias&quot; but do not provide an explanation. It could be that the genome editing is inefficient and not resulting in multiple double strand breaks preventing a lethal DNA damage mediated cellular response. It would be informative to show the increased numbers of DNA damage foci in cells expressing gRNAs targeting copy-number-amplified loci and study the response to double strand breaks in SR2+ cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the kinetics of creating the double-strand breaks in our system may limit the DNA damage response and therefore the effect of copy number bias in these screens, and this may be a mechanism for why we cannot detect the bias. However, we do not believe monitoring the response to DNA damage is within the scope of the aims of the study. Interestingly, the reviewer’s hypothesis that human cell line CRIPSR is more sensitive to double-strand breaks is supported by a new analysis we present in Figure 3D. Here, we show that while most GO terms between fly and human CRISPR fitness screens are similar, one outlier is “double-strand break repair (GO:0006302),” which is captured by the human fitness genes to a greater extent than the fly fitness genes. This may hint that human cell-lines treated with CRISPR-induced breaks are more sensitive to the loss of DNA repair machinery than the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell-line, and this may have to do with overall cutting efficiency or kinetic differences in the two systems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Overall, this is a well executed and written study. It is the first time that a pooled screening approach has been (successfully) used in insect cells, opening new avenues for genetic screening. The site-specific integration strategy is elegant and circumvents problems with viral or other types of delivery – this is also an important methodological advance that will open new experimental avenues to perform other types of over expression and silencing studies in a pooled format in Drosophila cells. The part on the comparison with human essential genes is interesting but could be explained and illustrated in more detail. In general, the manuscript would gain from a longer discussion on the definition of &quot;essentiality&quot; or &quot;fitness&quot; in the context of their experimental system to illustrate differences in experimental systems (both yeast/human/Drosophila as well as RNAi-screening and CRISPR screening). For example, published screens in human cells span a max. incubation time of 30 doublings, whereas the data discussed in this manuscript refers to 45 to 60 cell doublings and more genes are likely to be found to have growth defects within a longer experimental time-frame. The presentation of the differences between human and Drosophila cell essentials could also be extended.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point.
