Two alternative mechanisms have been discussed in the literature so far: preferred direction enhancement, by which responses are amplified when stimuli move along the preferred direction of the cell, and null direction suppression, where one signal inhibits the response to the subsequent one when stimuli move along the opposite, i.e. null direction. Along the processing chain in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> optic lobe, directional responses first appear in T4 and T5 cells. Visually stimulating sequences of individual columns in the optic lobe with a telescope while recording from single T4 neurons, we find both mechanisms at work implemented in different sub-regions of the receptive field. This finding explains the high degree of directional selectivity found already in the fly’s primary motion-sensing neurons and marks an important step in our understanding of elementary motion detection.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17421.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17421.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17421.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain extracts information from signals delivered from the eyes and other sensory organs in order to direct behavior. Understanding how the interactions and wiring of a multitude of individual nerve cells process and transmit this critical information to the brain is a fundamental goal in the field of neuroscience.</p><p>One question many neuroscientists have tried to understand is how nerve cells in an animal’s brain detect direction when an animal sees movement of some kind – so-called motion vision. The raw signal from the light receptors in the eye does not discriminate whether the light moves in one direction or the other. So, the nerve cells in the brain must somehow compute the direction of movement based on the information relayed by the eye.</p><p>For more than half a century, major debates have revolved around two rival models that could explain how motion vision works. Both models could in principle lead to neurons that prefer images moving in one direction over images moving in the opposite direction – so-called direction selectivity. In both models, the information about the changing light levels hitting two light-sensitive cells at two points on the eye are compared across time. In one model, signals from images moving in a cell’s preferred direction become amplified. In the other model, signals moving in the unfavored direction become canceled out. However, neither model perfectly explains motion vision.</p><p>Now, Haag, Arenz et al. show that both models are partially correct and that the two mechanisms work together to detect motion across the field of vision more accurately. In the experiments, both models were tested in tiny fruit flies by measuring the activity of the first nerve cells that respond to the direction of visual motion. While each mechanism alone only produces a fairly weak and error-prone signal of direction, together the two mechanisms produce a stronger and more precise directional signal. Further research is now needed to determine which individual neurons amplify or cancel the signals to achieve such a high degree of direction selectivity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17421.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17421.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>motion vision</kwd><kwd>Neurogenetics</kwd><kwd>computer model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haag</surname><given-names>Juergen</given-names></name><name><surname>Arenz</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Serbe</surname><given-names>Etienne</given-names></name><name><surname>Borst</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gabbiani</surname><given-names>Fabrizio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 870</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borst</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Uniting two principles that have been thought of being mutually exclusive in the past can explain how neurons become sensitive to the direction of motion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Flies see the world through a hexagonal array of facets each equipped with its own small lens focusing the light onto 8 photoreceptors. Photoreceptors send their axons into the optic lobe, which consists of four consecutive layers of neuropil called lamina, medulla, lobula and lobula plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Each neuropil layer is made up of retinotopically organized columns together containing roughly 100 different neurons per column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989</xref>). Within the optic lobe, visual motion information is extracted in parallel pathways encoding light increments (ON) and decrements (OFF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Joesch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eichner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joesch et al., 2013</xref>). Both pathways bifurcate in the lamina and lead, via a set of specific medulla interneurons, onto the dendrites of T4 and T5 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shinomiya et al., 2014</xref>). Both T4 and T5 cells exist in 4 subgroups tuned to one of the four cardinal directions of motion and project into four layers of the lobula plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). There, they form monosynaptic cholinergic excitatory connections with the dendrites of the large-field lobula plate tangential cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mauss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schnell et al., 2012</xref>) as well as with lobula plate intrinsic neurons. These intrinsic neurons, in turn, inhibit tangential cells in the adjacent layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mauss et al., 2015</xref>). Since none of the neurons upstream from T4 and T5 respond to visual motion in a direction-selective way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behnia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Strother et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Meier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ammer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Serbe et al., 2016</xref>), T4 and T5 cells are the first neurons in the processing chain where directional information is represented explicitly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fisher et al., 2015</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17421.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fly optic lobe and visual stimulation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Circuit diagram of the ON and the OFF pathway of fly motion vision.

In each model, the signal from one photoreceptor is delayed by a temporal filter (τ) and fed, together with the direct signal from the neighboring photoreceptor, into a nonlinearity. In case of preferred direction enhancement (left), the delayed signal (E) enhances the direct signal (D), e.g. by a multiplication (E x D), in case of the null direction suppression (right), the delayed signal (S) suppresses the direct signal (D), e.g. by a division (D/S).

These stimuli lend themselves well to discriminate between preferred direction (‘PD’) enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hassenstein and Reichardt, 1956</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, left) and null direction (‘ND’) suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlow and Levick, 1965</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, right) as the response to the sequence can be compared with the sum of the responses to the luminance pulses given in isolation (‘linear expectation’): in case of preferred direction enhancement, the response to the sequence along the preferred direction is larger than the linear sum of responses to the isolated pulses and identical if the sequence is along the null direction; In case of null direction suppression, the response to the sequence along the preferred direction is identical to the linear sum of responses to the isolated pulses and smaller if the sequence is along the null direction.</p><p>The columnar organization of the optic lobes stretches from the laminar cartridges through the medulla and into the lobula and lobula plate. Individual T4 and T5 neurons extend their dendrites across multiple columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) and receive synaptic inputs from different medulla cell types located in different columns relative to the home columns of the T4 or T5 neuron and to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shinomiya et al.; 2014</xref>). To understand the particular contribution of those inputs it seemed necessary to precisely place the stimuli onto the columnar raster of the fly’s optic lobe.</p><p>The structure of the optical system and of the neuronal wiring in flies obeys the neural superposition principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kirschfeld, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braitenberg, 1967</xref>). Those photoreceptors R1-6 from 6 neighboring ommatidia that share the same optical axis converge on the same lamina cartridge, thus forming an optical column that represents the unit of spatial resolution (‘neuro-ommatidium’). To visually stimulate these neuro-ommatidia precisely and in isolation, stimulation must consist of parallel rays at angles along the optical axes of those photoreceptors and aligned to the columnar raster. For this, we adopted a telescopic stimulation device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franceschini, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schuling et al., 1989</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). As the fly rhabdomeric photoreceptors work as light guides, the raster of optical columns can be visualized by shining light from within the head capsule (antidromic illumination) to align the raster of neuro-ommatidia to the stimulation locations on a micro-display with the help of a CMOS camera.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>As a proof of principle, we first expressed the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">al., 2013</xref>) in lamina cells L2, recorded from their terminals in the medulla by 2-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Denk et</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">al., 1990</xref>) and stimulated them with light spots of 1176 ms duration covering a single optical column at various positions. L2 cells responded maximally to stimuli at a certain column, with less than 30% response amplitude to stimuli positioned on surrounding columns, and negligible responses (&lt;12%) to stimuli positioned on columns in the next outer ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The slight activation of neighboring columns results directly from the optics of the fly’s eye, where the visual fields of single ommatidia have Gaussian sensitivity profiles with an acceptance angle roughly matching the inter-ommatidial separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Götz, 1965</xref>).

We recorded from single T4 cells by selecting individual processes in layer three of the lobula plate and confirmed their preference for luminance increments. Repeating the above experiment with T4 cells, we again found maximal responses to the stimulus placed in a single column. Compared to L2, however, the receptive field was found to be larger, with about 50% amplitude to the stimuli onto the six surrounding columns, and roughly 25% to the next outer ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This indicates that T4 neurons pool excitatory synaptic input from more than one column, consistent with their morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) and expected from a motion detector that is required to integrate information from spatially offset input.</p><p>In order to discriminate between preferred direction enhancement and null direction suppression, we tested T4 cells with three light pulses of 472 ms duration positioned along the dorso-ventral axis of the eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, left).

When the stimulation of the central column was preceded by the stimulation of one directly adjacent column on the ‘preferred side’, the response to the central pulse was strongly suppressed as before (red trace). This suppression led to a response to the sequence that on average not only falls below the sum of both individual stimulations, but even below the flicker response to the central column (black trace), indicating inhibition. When this null-direction sequence was extended from two to three columns, the resulting response was even smaller (green trace).</p><p>The experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> also revealed that for zero onset time differences, i.e. simultaneous stimulation of two columns, the response was suppressed as compared to stimulation of just one column. We tested the receptive field of this suppression of the central column systematically by simultaneously stimulating the central column together with one of the columns in the 2 rings surrounding it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). We normalized the response to the two stimulated columns with respect to the response to the isolated stimulation of the central column. The resulting response in the T4 neuron was found to be suppressed in comparison to the isolated central column response for simultaneous stimulation of the central column together with another one in the dorsal part of the receptive field.</p><p>This suggests that employing apparent motion with flicker stimuli of larger bars should only lead to small flicker responses, possibly occluding null-direction suppression. We tested this prediction by presenting bright horizontal bars of different spatial extent at different locations within the receptive field of individual T4 cells on an LED arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,c</xref>). Using a bar size of 180° × 4.5°, indeed, flicker responses of T4 cells were almost undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Apparent motion stimuli along the preferred direction led to pronounced responses, larger than the linear prediction, while null direction sequences did not suppress the negligible sum of flicker responses by a significant amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). This was much different when repeating the same stimuli using bars of only 4.5° × 3° instead: now, as in the experiments employing telescopic stimulation of individual columns, strong flicker responses appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Furthermore, in addition to the preferred direction enhancement, pronounced null direction suppression was observed with peak sensitivity within the dorsal part of the receptive field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17421.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Apparent motion stimulation on a LED arena.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Flicker responses of T4 cells to the presentation of a large horizontal bar (180˚ × 4.5˚) at different elevations on a LED arena, aligned to the elevation evoking the maximum response (n = 17 cells from 5 flies).

To address this question, we constructed a simple algorithmic model of a motion detector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). In this model, the motion detector receives 3 inputs. A central direct input (D) is flanked by two low-pass filtered inputs: one enhancing input (E) implementing a multiplicative and one suppressing input (S) implementing a divisive non-linearity. This way, the detector is designed to combine a preferred direction enhancement on one and a null direction suppression on the other side within a single motion-sensing unit. Testing the model with single pulses, responses were only detected for positions −1 and 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, left). Stimulating the model with 2-pulse-sequences at positions −1 and 0 led to pronounced preferred direction enhancement but no null direction suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, top 2 rows). When the 2-pulse-sequences were delivered at positions 0 and 1, no pronounced preferred direction enhancement occurred, but null direction suppression was substantial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, bottom 2 rows). Thus, these simulation results qualitatively match the respective experimental data (compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>). We next simulated an array of such units and calculated its responses to grating motion at different speeds and directions. We found that the model exhibits a high degree of directional selectivity over a broad range of velocities, with little responses to null direction motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, middle left). In contrast, the model without null direction suppression revealed substantial null direction responses almost as large as its preferred direction responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, middle center). The same was true for a model with no preferred direction enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, middle right). Interestingly, no such qualitative differences were observed at the level of a model tangential cell, i.e. after subtraction of opponent units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, bottom). When we simulated the responses of the model to grating motion into different directions, we found the full model T4 cell to be more sharply tuned to its preferred direction than the one without preferred direction enhancement or the one without null direction suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). We conclude that combining preferred direction enhancement with null direction suppression leads to a strong direction selectivity of the primary motion-sensing unit.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17421.007</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Computer simulations.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Model T4 cell combining preferred direction enhancement and null direction suppression (compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).

Over a wide range of velocities spanning more than two orders of magnitude, T4/T5 cells responded almost exclusively to upward motion, i.e. along their preferred direction, with little or no responses at all to motion along their null direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). When stimulating the cells with 1 Hz grating motion at various directions, we found a rather sharp directional tuning with about 90° half-width around its preferred direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>). To rule out that the highest degree of directional selectivity in T4/T5 cells is achieved by a hitherto unknown reciprocal inhibition between T4/T5 cells with opposite preferred direction, e.g. via inhibitory lobula plate interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mauss et al., 2015</xref>) we blocked the synaptic output from all T4 and T5 cells by expression of tetanus toxin light-chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sweeney et al., 1995</xref>).

T4/T5 cells revealed the same high degree of directional selectivity as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c,d</xref>).

Both models lead to weakly direction-selective signals in the first place, which, in the Hassenstein-Reichardt model, are improved downstream by subtraction of oppositely tuned components (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borst and Helmstaedter, 2015</xref>. Surprisingly, however, a high degree of directional selectivity is found already at the first stage where directional responses are observed, i.e. in T4 and T5 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This can now be explained by the fact that both preferred direction enhancement and null direction suppression are implemented in T4 cells. While the output of the full Hassenstein-Reichardt-correlator after the subtraction stage shows a high degree of directional selectivity in the absence of null-direction suppression, the relatively small differences between large, but poorly tuned signals (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, middle panel) would be highly prone to noise. Improving the direction-tuning already at the level of the half-detectors by the additional null-direction suppression increases robustness to noise and might in addition be energetically less costly.</p><p>A recent study addressing the mechanisms underlying the elementary motion detectors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> concluded preferred direction enhancement as the sole mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fisher et al. 2015</xref>). However, we find that their stimulation paradigm consisting of flashes at 2 positions simultaneously does not allow to discriminate between different mechanisms including lateral inhibition, adaptation and null direction suppression.</p><p>Since the operations of preferred direction enhancement and null direction suppression have offset receptive fields, it requires the cells to collect their input from more than two adjacent image points, in line with anatomical observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shinomiya et al., 2014</xref>) . In contrast to the cellular implementation of the motion detector proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behnia et al, 2014</xref> our findings also require that T4 cells receive input from more than two cell types. This again is in agreement with recent connectomic data (for T4 cells: Louis Scheffer, Janelia Research Campus, personal communication; for T5 cells: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shinomiya et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, functional studies where the synaptic input elements onto T4 and T5 neurons were blocked also suggested the involvement of more than two input elements in the ON- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ammer et al., 2015</xref>) as well as in the OFF-pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Serbe et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Considering the columnar nature of the input elements and the structure of the T4 dendrites covering multiple columns, we predict, that the inputs representing the enhancing, direct and suppressing input segregate on different sub-regions of the T4 dendrite, with enhancing inputs on the ‘null-side’ and the suppressing inputs on the ‘preferred side’ of the dendrite. Future experiments will have to map the different cell types of the medulla onto the proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) as well as to identify the transmitter receptors, responsible for enhancing, exciting and inhibiting the dendrites of T4 and T5 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Flies</title><p>(<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) were raised at 25°C and 60% humidity on a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle on standard cornmeal agar medium.

Briefly, the local luminance signal was high-pass-filtered (1st order, τ = 250 ms), and 10% of the DC value was added with subsequent rectification. The T4 cell was then modeled as receiving input from three adjacent columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>): an enhancing signal E at position −1, representing the low-pass filtered signal of L1 (1st order, τ = 250 ms), a direct signal D at position 0 which is identical to L1, and a suppressing signal S again representing the low-pass filtered signal of L1 (1st order, τ = 250 ms). The response was calculated as the product of E and D, divided by S. Signals had the following weights k: k<sub>E</sub> = 5, k<sub>D</sub> = 5, k<sub>S</sub> = 10. To avoid division by zero and to account for flicker responses, a DC term of 1.0 was added to each signal. To simulate flicker and apparent motion stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), light pulses of 450 ms length and amplitude 1.0 were delivered to selected columns and the response of an individual model T4 cell was evaluated. To simulate the responses to sine-gratings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c,d</xref>), responses were calculated either as the summed responses of an array of such units (‘T4 response’) or after subtracting the signals of oppositely tuned T4 cells (‘VS response’). Simulations without null direction suppression or preferred direction enhancement were performed by setting either k<sub>E</sub> or k<sub>S</sub> to zero.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Fred Rieke, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by David Van Essen as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Tom Baden (Reviewer #2); Vivek Jayaraman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an interesting and timely paper investigating the mechanisms underlying motion detection in the fly visual system. The paper uses a powerful combination of two-photon calcium imaging and telescopic stimulus delivery, allowing greater spatial control of stimuli than more conventional approaches. All of the reviewers found the work of interest and the experiments generally well done. Several issues came up in the review process: (1) some cases in which the text stated results too strongly given a lack of direct experimental evidence; (2) a need to improve the clarity of the writing and figures. Four specific examples follow, agreed upon as most critical by all three reviewers; others examples are in the individual reviewers comments below.</p><p>1) The paper concludes that distinct regions of the T4 dendrites implement different motion detection mechanisms. But there are no direct measures of dendritic signaling in the paper; without such measures, this conclusion should be stated less strongly.</p><p>2) The paper suggests a role of inhibition in canceling signals for null direction motion. The evidence for this is based on sublinear summation of signals in the null direction – but this does not uniquely identify inhibition as the underlying mechanism. Was it possible to directly observe inhibition – e.g. to see a decrease in calcium when stimulating a single location in the T4 receptive field with flickering stimuli? Without a direct observation about inhibition this conclusion should also be stated less strongly.</p><p>3) The telescopic illumination should be described in more detail. Particularly how effective is it in restricting input spatially? If there is spread beyond the single column targeted, how much could such spread impact the conclusions of the paper? Part of the confusion on this point originates because <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> is difficult to interpret in present form (see point 4 and individual reviewer comments).</p><p>4) The figures should be modified to specify exactly what is measured, particularly the optical configuration for each experiment. Specific examples are in the individual reviews below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper describes the origin of directional selectivity in the first cells in the fly visual system that exhibit directional responses. The combination of a telescopic stimulus delivery system to activate specific elements of the motion computation with functional calcium imaging is quite powerful. The results are clear and interesting. However, I found several aspects of the paper difficult to follow. Some specific suggestions to improve clarity follow.</p><p>1) Manipulations of stimuli to specific spatial regions are crucial to the paper. But it is often hard to discern exactly what stimulus is used in a given experiment. This could be improved greatly by adding simple schematics to the figures, showing which specific columns are being activated. When those are present (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) they help quite a bit. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b, e and f</xref> are specific examples in which this could help.</p><p>2) The description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref> is quite minimal and hard to follow. Those figures made much more sense to me after I had read most of the paper, but when they first come up it is not clear what is important about the data, or even how the data was collected. The larger receptive field size of the T4 cells is important; that should get mentioned in the text where this data is described.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> models. It was not clear to me what the modified models were. Specifically, do the models lacking null direction suppression or preferred direction enhancement still consist of three inputs (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) just with one arm disabled? Or are they models with two inputs only (in a more classic Reichardt configuration)? A schematic of these models added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> could be helpful.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>. I am confused by the description of this figure. The legend does not have a panel d, but the legend for panel e suggests it is describing an array of model units, not a full T4 cell. That appears to make sense from comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> and d. But the main text describes a full model T4 cell. Because of these inconsistencies I could not evaluate that part of the paper.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In their MS &quot;Complemetary Mechanisms Create Direction Selectivity in the Fly&quot;, Haag et al. use a spatially precise optical setup capable of delivering single-ommatidial stimulation and with 2-photon calcium imaging to probe mechanisms driving selection selectivity in the visual system of the fruit fly. Focussing on T4 cells, the fly-visual system's &quot;ON-DS cells&quot;, the authors show that both null-suppression as well as preferred direction enhancement appear to drive directionality in these neurons, computations that likely take place in different dendritic regions of T4s. They follow up their findings in a simple model, which in addition predicts that the 2 mechanisms in tandem yield a sharper spatial tuning than any one mechanism alone. They also demonstrate the &quot;sharp&quot; tuning in T4 cells experimentally (though they do no isolate the 2 mechansims in these experiments – something that I suspect would be quite difficult to do).</p><p>Overall, the MS is timely and reports important and to my knowledge novel findings about direction selective visual circuits of the fly. The data is of high quality and the writing is clear and succinct. I only have minor comments</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this tantalizing manuscript, Haag, Borst and colleagues explore the underlying basis of visual motion direction computations in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> optic lobe. In both the vertebrate retina and in the early visual system of flies, this computation has been studied in the framework of two classic models of visual motion direction: the Hassenstein-Reichardt (H-R) model and the Barlow-Levick (B-L) model. Mechanistically, both rely on combining input from spatially offset pathways, with input from an adjacent location temporally delayed relative to the central pathway. One (H-R) produces an excitatory &quot;preferred-direction&quot; (PD) response by multiplication with temporally delayed input from a preceding location, while the other (B-L) uses division by input from a temporally delayed location in the &quot;null direction&quot; (ND). Direct evidence for the latter has been obtained in direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSRGCs), where starburst amacrine cells provide the appropriate ND inhibition. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> optic lobe, the H-R model has thus far been the mechanism most often proposed for direction selectivity for large field motion, with information from &quot;ON&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot; motion pathways represented by so-called T4 and T5 cells respectively being combined in vertical system (VS) and horizontal system (HS) lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs). Recent anatomical and electron microscopy (EM) evidence has suggested a more complex picture at the level of the input to T4 and T5 neurons – their inputs comprise more cell types than previously believed. In this study, the authors use precise optical stimulation that takes into account the fly's neural superposition eye (Franceschini, 1975) along with two-photon calcium imaging to suggest that B-L-like inhibition may combine with H-R like excitation to shape the responses of T4 neurons. The results are interesting but the evidence provided is indirect and the picture still somewhat murky. Detailed comments follow.</p><p>The major claim of the paper is that precise stimulation of single lamina columns reveals PD and ND responses that localize to different sub-regions of the T4 neuron dendrites. However, this claim, which is highlighted in the abstract, goes beyond the evidence presented, which is entirely based on recordings in T4 axons. Unless the authors can present direct anatomical and physiological evidence for such localized dendritic input, I would suggest that this claim be removed or significantly tempered and moved to Discussion.</p><p>Similarly, the B-L model proposes inhibition of one signal by another for ND motion, but the authors present no direct evidence for such inhibition. What is shown instead is supra- or sub-linear summation upon sequential (PD vs ND) excitation of successive lamina columns. Why does this have to necessarily result from inhibition in T4 dendrites rather than have presynaptic origins? While it is true that medulla neurons are not known to be sensitive to motion-direction, such neurons are known to have suppressed responses to bars wider than their receptive field (T5 input neurons for OFF pathway; Serbe et al., 2016 from the Borst lab), so might a skewed sampling of such inputs by T4 perhaps confer the observed ND suppression?</p><p>Related to the above point, the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) predicts that we should be able to directly observe inhibition (not just suppression of a strong excitatory response), even if it is not large, when the 'wrong' lamina column is illuminated in a flicker experiment. This seems never to be observed in the experiments shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). What is seen instead is sub-linearity (or supra-linearity), which the authors call a non-linear response component. Is this a calcium indicator limitation even with the higher-baseline GCaMP6m? If there is inhibition, might it be easier to pick up directly in the dendrites of single T4 neuron or do the authors find this experimentally infeasible?</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, the authors state that their telescopic illumination allows them to illuminate only a single lamina column, but the lamina responses suggest that neighboring columns are also stimulated. In the manuscript (introduction section), these responses are described as 'negligible', but they seem to reach 50% of peak responses. This requires further discussion, because the study's results rely heavily on the high precision of optical illumination. If the responses reflect the limits of the illumination system, it would be useful to discuss how that might affect the interpretation of results. Also, on the same note, it would be great to see what a 'standard' localized stimulus presentation (i.e., targeting single ommatidia and sequences of ommatidia without using the telescopic refinement) would evoke in T4 neurons. This would highlight the importance of telescopic stimulus presentation for visual motion studies, which would be useful to the field.</p><p>Although perhaps this is beyond the scope of this study, it would be very interesting to know what T5 neuron responses look like with telescopic stimulation. Do they also show B-L like ND suppression in the OFF pathway? Given that the authors have access to all the T5 inputs (Serbe et al., 2016), this could also provide an easier path to a more complete explanation in these neurons as opposed to T4, where the authors do not say much about what the potential inputs to these neurons might be and do not explore how they might act together to produce the observed response properties.</p><p>Lastly, it is still left unclear why T4 (and, perhaps T5) might need a potential B-L like mechanism in addition to H-R if there is no difference between the combination and pure H-R for LPTCs. Perhaps the authors could speculate on this in Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17421.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The paper concludes that distinct regions of the T4 dendrites implement different motion detection mechanisms.

As far as we can see, this can only be explained by inhibition, not by adaptation or similar phenomena.

Stimulation with larger bars or not in perfect register (see sharpness of the central peak for small stimuli) leads to a strongly reduced flicker response.

We included an additional figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) illustrating that the suppression not just leads to smaller-than-the-sum-responses, but reduces the responses below the level of isolated center stimulation. The figure also shows that this suppression builds up along sequences of steps in the null direction. We do not think it likely that it would be possible to directly observe an inhibition/decrease in the calcium signal in specific subregions of the dendrite that is not visible in the axon terminal or in the neuron close to the lobula plate.

When the first lens after the stimulation objective is taken out, the device changes from a telescope to a microscope. By putting a scale slide in the focal plane of the stimulation objective, we can image the micrometer scale with the CMOS-camera and position light at different positions on the scale. By using the objective used for 2-photon microscopy the positioning of the stimuli on the scale can be visualized with the CCD-camera included in the 2-photon setup. We then aligned the beam path of the stimulation device so that the position of the light stimuli on the CMOS-camera and the CCD-camera coincide.</p><p>We now also increased the number of recordings from L2 neurons and show that the stimulation is restricted to single columns, in the limits of the optics of the fly’s eye (below 30%). The responses to the outer ring of neuro-ommatidia around the central column are below 12% and indeed negligible, as stated in the manuscript. A comparison to classical stimulation is given by the LED arena experiments (former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e &amp; f</xref>, now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Here we used large and small bars, at different positions limited by the resolution of the LED arena. Presumably inhibitory surrounds of the input elements lead to a strong reduction in the flicker responses of large bars as compared to small bars. With small bars, both a preferred direction enhancement and a null direction suppression could be revealed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). However, in contrast to the telescopic stimulation, the register of the stimulus to the columnar raster has to be indirectly inferred from the flicker amplitude.</p><p><italic>Although perhaps this is beyond the scope of this study, it would be very interesting to know what T5 neuron responses look like with telescopic stimulation. Do they also show B-L like ND suppression in the OFF pathway? Given that the authors have access to all the T5 inputs (Serbe et al., 2016), this could also provide an easier path to a more complete explanation in these neurons as opposed to T4, where the authors do not say much about what the potential inputs to these neurons might be and do not explore how they might act together to produce the observed response properties.</italic></p><p>We are indeed planning to repeat this study on T5 cells and block their known input neurons in order to find out which neuron is doing what. This, however, will for sure take quite a long time to be completed.</p><p> <italic>Lastly, it is still left unclear why T4 (and, perhaps T5) might need a potential B-L like mechanism in addition to H-R if there is no difference between the combination and pure H-R for LPTCs. Perhaps the authors could speculate on this in Discussion.</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent point. We added the following text in the Discussion to address the potential functional consequences: &quot;While the output of the full Hassenstein-Reichardt-correlator after the subtraction stage shows a high degree of direction-selectivity in the absence of null-direction suppression, the relatively small differences between poorly tuned signals would be very sensitive to noise. Improving the direction-tuning already at the level of the half-detectors by the additional null-direction suppression increases robustness to noise and might in addition be energetically less costly. “</p></body></sub-article></article>
