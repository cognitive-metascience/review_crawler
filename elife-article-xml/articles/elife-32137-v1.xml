The cellular mechanisms that generate diversity are critical for the development of these highly organized structures and their maintenance during homeostasis. Asymmetric division is a common mechanism for generating cellular diversity, as it produces daughter cells that assume distinct fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knoblich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roubinet and Cabernard, 2014</xref>). A critical aspect of the molecular mechanism underlying this process is the segregation of unique fate determinants into the resulting daughter cells. As the asymmetrically dividing cell proceeds through mitosis, unique sets of fate determinants become polarized into discrete cortical domains that are bisected by the cleavage furrow as mitosis is completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gönczy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nance and Zallen, 2011</xref>). Thus, a key step in asymmetric cell division is the coordination of the polarity axis with the processes that position the cleavage furrow. Because furrow position is controlled by the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barr and Gruneberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fededa and Gerlich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glotzer, 2005</xref>), segregation of fate determinants during asymmetric cell division requires precise coupling between cell polarity and spindle orientation machinery. Here, we use an induced polarity cultured cell system and <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts to uncover a mechanism for linking polarity and spindle position during asymmetric cell division.</p><p>Neuroblasts populate the fly central nervous system by undergoing repeated asymmetric divisions during embryonic and larval developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gallaud et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knoblich, 2010</xref>). At the completion of a typical division, one daughter cell retains the neuroblast fate (i.e. self-renewal), whereas the other assumes a differentiated fate (e.g. neuron). The molecular components that specify distinct daughter cell fates form domains opposite one another on the cell cortex. The basal cortical domain contains molecules important for specifying neuronal fate, such as Miranda, Brat, and Prospero. The apical cortical domain contains a number of regulatory proteins including the Par polarity complex, which restricts the neuronal fate determinants to the basal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atwood and Prehoda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey and Prehoda, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wirtz-Peitz et al., 2008</xref>). This domain also contains proteins that align the spindle along the apical-basal polarity axis, such as Partner of Inscuteable (Pins) and the tumor suppressor Discs large (Dlg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu and Johnston, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roubinet and Cabernard, 2014</xref>). However, Dlg is also found at non-apical cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertson and Doe, 2003</xref>) suggesting that other mechanisms besides polarization are likely to be necessary to ensure its activity is restricted to the apical cortex. Here, we investigate how polarity is coupled to Dlg’s spindle orientation activity.</p><p>Dlg is a member of the Membrane Associated Guanylate Kinase (MAGUK) family of proteins that regulate diverse cellular processes including adhesion and neuronal synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oliva et al., 2012</xref>). Like other MAGUKs, Dlg contains a GK protein interaction module that binds downstream effector proteins, such as the kinesin Khc73 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertson and Doe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu and Prehoda, 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Newman and Prehoda, 2009</xref>). The Dlg GK domain is required for neuroblast spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Siegrist and Doe, 2005</xref>), presumably because of its role in recruiting these effectors. Binding of certain GK targets can be blocked, however, by an autoinhibitory intramolecular interaction between the GK and an adjacent SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marcette et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McGee et al., 2001</xref>). Analysis of Dlg function in spindle orientation suggests that autoinhibition plays a critical, albeit paradoxical, role in the process. In cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, polarized Dlg GK induces spindle alignment, but polarized SH3GK does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marcette et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that the intramolecular interaction inhibits Dlg’s spindle orientation activity. However, the intramolecular interaction is required for Dlg function in vivo as neuroblasts containing a <italic>dlg</italic> allele that lacks the interaction (<italic>dlg<sup>sw</sup></italic>) is non-functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Newman and Prehoda, 2009</xref>). Thus, autoinhibition prevents Dlg’s spindle orientation activity but is required for spindle positioning in vivo, suggesting that regulation of Dlg’s GK by its SH3 domain is critically important for Dlg function. How this regulatory interaction might be modulated to activate Dlg is unknown, as are the Dlg spindle orientation effectors regulated by the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As coupling of polarity and spindle orientation is a key aspect of asymmetric cell division, we sought to identify the mechanism by which the Dlg intramolecular interaction is regulated and how its regulation might influence these important cellular processes.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32137.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Discs large localizes uniformly to the neuroblast cortex and is phosphorylated by atypical Protein Kinase C.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dlg domain structure.

We reasoned that Dlg may be autoinhibited at non-apical regions but its spindle orienting function activated at the apical cortex. Neuroblasts are polarized by the Par polarity complex whose primary output is the activity of the atypical Protein Kinase C (aPKC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atwood and Prehoda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knoblich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prehoda, 2009</xref>).

Canonical PKC has been shown to phosphorylate Dlg during cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Neill et al., 2011</xref>), so we reasoned that aPKC phosphorylation of Dlg might be responsible for activating apical Dlg. To test this hypothesis, we first sought to determine if Dlg is an aPKC substrate and, if so, whether phosphorylation by aPKC might influence Dlg’s spindle orientation activity.</p><p>We incubated purified Dlg with the kinase domain of aPKC in an in vitro kinase phosphorylation assay. To identify possible modification sites, we subjected the resulting Dlg protein to mass spectrometry analysis following incubation with aPKC. This analysis revealed two primary modified residues, S662 located within the SH3 domain, and S676 located just COOH-terminal to the SH3 (sometimes called the ‘HOOK’ motif) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>aPKC phosphorylation regulates Dlg SH3GK-mediated spindle orientation activity</title><p>To determine if Dlg phosphorylation by aPKC activates its spindle orientation activity, we used the cultured S2-cell-induced polarity spindle orientation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>).

While S2 cells expressing Ed:SH3GK alone fail to orient their spindles, coexpression with aPKC induced alignment to SH3GK indistinguishable from that of cells expressing Ed:GK alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>). Spindle alignment to SH3GK is dependent upon aPKC’s catalytic activity, as expression of a kinase dead aPKC<sup>K293W</sup> mutant failed to result in spindle alignment to Ed:SH3GK contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Furthermore, aPKC expression with the non-phosphorylatable Ed:SH3GK<sup>2A</sup> (S662A, S676A) Dlg variant also failed to result in aligned spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) indicating that modification of these sites is necessary for SH3GK-mediated spindle orientation. Furthermore, phosphorylation at either site is sufficient for this activity as S2 spindles aligned to crescents of Ed:SH3GK variants containing mutations meant to mimic phosphorylation (S662D or S676D) in a manner independent of aPKC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E-G</xref>). Together, these data support a model in which aPKC phosphorylation induces spindle alignment to the SH3GK, presumably by releasing the GK from autoinhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>aPKC regulates Dlg spindle orientation activity in vivo</title><p>Loss of aPKC causes the spindle to become misaligned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guilgur et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2009</xref>), although how aPKC activity is linked to spindle positioning has been unknown. To test whether modification of the aPKC sites within Dlg contributes to spindle orientation in vivo, we assessed the effects of mutations at these sites on neuroblast asymmetric cell division. Previously, we found that constitutive activation of Dlg using the <italic>dlg<sup>sw</sup></italic> allele disrupts the interaction between the SH3 and GK domains and results in decoupling of spindle orientation from cortical polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Newman and Prehoda, 2009</xref>), indicating that autoinhibition of Dlg is required for its role during mitotic spindle orientation in vivo. Since Dlg is localized both at apical and non-apical cortical regions, we hypothesized that misregulation of Dlg by introducing a phosphomimetic mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), would result in ectopic Dlg activity and concomitant loss of spindle orientation as observed with <italic>dlg<sup>sw</sup></italic>.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we generated transgenic fly lines harboring Dlg<sup>WT</sup> and Dlg<sup>S662D</sup> transgenes under control of the UAS promoter (the Dlg<sup>2A</sup> variant was toxic, precluding its analysis) and examined their ability to rescue the spindle orientation defect of the <italic>dlg<sup>m52</sup></italic> null allele. Loss of Dlg results in a moderate spindle orientation phenotype in neuroblasts because of redundancy with the Inscuteable pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Siegrist and Doe, 2005</xref>). We assayed for rescue of the <italic>dlg<sup>m52</sup></italic> spindle orientation defect in third instar larval neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), using <italic>worniu</italic>-Gal4-driven expression of UAS-Dlg<sup>WT</sup> and UAS-Dlg<sup>S662D</sup>. We confirm that the <italic>dlg<sup>m52</sup></italic> allele lacks endogenous Dlg in third instar larval neuroblasts based on immunostaining, which resulted in a reduced precision of spindle alignment with cortical polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertson and Doe, 2003</xref>). Exogenous expression of Dlg<sup>WT</sup> fully rescued this defect; however, neuroblasts expressing Dlg containing the phosphomimetic S662D mutation exhibited a spindle orientation defect indistinguishable from <italic>dlg<sup>m52</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). This effect is consistent with a requirement for Dlg regulation via modification at this site as the S662D mutation activates Dlg such that its activity is no longer restricted to the apical cortex. We did however observe partial rescue by Dlg<sup>S662D</sup> of the polarity defect that results from the loss of Dlg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E’,F</xref>), suggesting that the SH3-mediated regulation of the GK domain is not part of Dlg’s role in regulating cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohshiro et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peng et al., 2000</xref>).

We surveyed known GK ligands to determine if their binding is repressed by the SH3 domain (i.e. binds to GK but not SH3GK) and, if so, whether activation by aPKC induces binding to SH3GK.

The first step in aligning the spindle to the cortex is selecting the cortical site followed by recruitment of protein complexes such as microtubule interacting proteins that will bind to and exert force on astral microtubules. Although the cellular signaling pathways that control cortical site selection ultimately determine where the spindle will be located, we are just beginning to understand the mechanisms that couple signaling systems to spindle orientation complexes. We have identified a mechanism that links the polarity kinase aPKC to an essential spindle orientation factor, GukH via the tumor suppressor Dlg. In previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Newman and Prehoda, 2009</xref>), we found that autoinhibition of Dlg is required for spindle orientation during neuroblast asymmetric cell division, but the precise role of autoinhibition has been unclear. Here, we show that autoinhibition allows Dlg to function as a regulated adaptor that only recruits GukH when it is phosphorylated by aPKC. Regulation takes advantage of an intramolecular interaction between the Dlg SH3 and GK domains, a common feature of MAGUK proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Funke et al., 2005</xref>). This mechanism allows Dlg to be recruited to the cortex uniformly, but to only be activated at cortical sites containing aPKC, which may have implications for both spatial and temporal control of spindle orientation. Altogether, these findings suggest that aPKC promotes spindle alignment through Dlg by: (1) phosphorylating Dlg at the apical cell cortex, (2) which prevents SH3-mediated inhibition of GK ligand binding and (3) recruits the downstream spindle orientation protein GukH which (4) establishes a connection to the mitotic spindle by directly binding to microtubules exclusively at the apical cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). It is important to note that while our work highlights Dlg’s role in connecting aPKC and GukH, it does not exclude a role for other Dlg effectors such as Khc73 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu and Prehoda, 2013b</xref>) or Banderuola (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mauri et al., 2014</xref>) in spindle orientation.</p><p>An important implication of our findings is the identification of a new molecular connection between the cortically polarized Par complex and the mitotic spindle. Currently, the best-characterized link between the Par complex and spindle orientation is the scaffolding protein Inscuteable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knoblich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schober et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wodarz et al., 1999</xref>). As Inscuteable binds directly to the Par complex member Bazooka (Baz; aka Par-3) and Partner of Inscuteable (Pins; aka LGN), expression of Inscuteable in epithelia and neural stem cells redirects spindle orientation toward the Par complex by directly recruiting Pins and associated spindle orientation proteins such as Mushroom Body Defect (Mud; aka NuMA). Our data demonstrate that aPKC provides an additional link between the Par complex and spindle orientation complexes through phosphorylation and activation of Dlg. In light of biochemical and structural data that Inscuteable and Mud form mutually exclusive complexes with Pins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mauser and Prehoda, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>), we propose that aPKC-Dlg signaling provides an essential cue from the apical cortex to promote alignment of the mitotic spindle along the apical-basal axis.</p><p>An important prediction of this model is the requirement of aPKC for spindle orientation. In epithelial tissues, such as MDCK epithelial cells, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal wing disc epithelium, and Caco-2 epithelial 3D cysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Durgan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guilgur et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hao et al., 2010</xref>), aPKC is required for spindle alignment within the plane of the epithelium, although it does not appear to be essential for spindle orientation in chick neuroepithelial cells or the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle cell epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergstralh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peyre et al., 2011</xref>) but is in neuroblasts and the embryonic epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guilgur et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). These results suggest that the aPKC function in spindle orientation may be cell specific. Dlg is required for planar spindle alignment in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle cell epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergstralh et al., 2013</xref>), but the requirement of Dlg in other tissues has not been investigated.</p><p>In addition to unveiling a new link between the Par complex and mitotic spindle orientation proteins, we also identified a regulatory function for Dlg interdomain interactions in mitotic spindle orientation. The SH3GK interaction allosterically regulates GK ligand binding of Dlg and other members of the MAGUK family, although the precise function of this regulatory interaction has not been known. Our work highlights the importance of modulating Dlg interdomain interactions through phosphoregulation and is consistent with previous work showing a cellular role for aPKC-Dlg signaling. A mammalian PKC isoform, PKCα, phosphorylates human Dlg1 (hDlg1) at a threonine residue within the Hook domain (T656) and regulates primary astrocyte migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Neill et al., 2011</xref>). The homologous residue to human Dlg T656 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dlg is S676 that we show is phosphorylated by aPKC, suggesting that phosphorylation of Dlg within the Hook domain by aPKC is an evolutionarily conserved event. Furthermore, the mammalian aPKC homolog, PKCζ, is required for Dlg1 localization to the primary astrocyte leading edge where it binds to the GK-ligand GKAP, which recruits dynein and regulates centrosome positioning during migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Etienne-Manneville et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Manneville et al., 2010</xref>). Similar to how aPKC-Dlg signaling restricts GK-binding capacity to the apical cortex in mitotic neuroblasts, PKC phosphorylation of hDlg1 could restrict GK-binding capacity to the leading edge of primary astrocytes, which suggests that Dlg domain allostery can be spatially controlled by phosphoregulation to produce a specific cellular response in diverse cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, protein expression and purification</title><p>Dlg PDZSH3GK (residues 474–975) and SH3GK (residues 598–975) fragments were cloned into the pGEX vector for N-terminal GST fusions and the pBH vector for an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag. pGEX and pBH vectors were transformed into BL21 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells and protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mM IPTG at 16°C overnight.

Microtubule binding and pelleting assay was performed as directed in Cytoskeleton Inc. Microtubule Binding Protein Spin Down Assay, Catalog Number: BK029, Lot number 121. Microtubule binding was assessed by diagnostic SDS-PAGE gel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>S2 cell culture, transfection, and staining</title><p>S2 cells were cultured, transfected, stained and visualized as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wee et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, Dlg fragments and mutants or aPKC were cloned downstream of Ed:GFP or Ed:tdTom in the pMT vector. Flag-tagged Dlg fragments and aPKC were cloned with an N-terminal Flag tag into the pMT vector. <italic>Drosophila</italic> Schneider’s (S2) cells were maintained in Schneider’s medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Cellgro; Mediatech, Manassas VA) at room temperature. For transfection of S2 cells, approximately 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were plated per well and transfected with 1 µg total DNA according to the Effectene manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands). Transfection complexes were incubated overnight and protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> for 24 hr. For RNAi experiments, 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were transferred to serum-free media before addition of dsRNA, allowed to incubate for 1 hr, and serum-containing media was added to the cells to induce growth. RNAi was performed for 72 hr. Cells were then collected, resuspended in fresh growth medium, and shaken at 175 rpm for 2–3 hr to induce localized clustering of Ed transfected cells. 200 µL of clustered cells were plated on 12 mm diameter coverslips in 24-well plates, allowed to adhere for 1 hr, followed by addition of 300 µL of fresh growth medium for 3–4 hr. Coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS, washed three times in washing buffer (0.1% saponin in PBS), and blocked in blocking buffer (0.1% saponin, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS). Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-αtubulin (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-HA (1:1000; Covance, Denver PA), rat anti-tubulin (1:1000; Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford IL), mouse anti-Lamin (1:1000; DSHB), rabbit anti-pH3 (1:7500; Millipore, Billerica MA), mouse anti-myc (1:1000; Sigma Aldrich), and mouse anti-Flag (1:1000; Sigma Aldrich). Coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, washed in washing buffer, incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500; Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove PA) in blocking buffer for 2 hr at room temperature, rinsed three times with washing buffer, and mounted on microscope slides using Vectashield Hardset. S2 cell images were acquired using either a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal microscope using a 1.4NA 60x oil objective, or an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope using a 1.42NA 60x oil immersion objective. All images were quantified and processed using FIJI (ImageJ), and figures were assembled in GraphPad PRISM 5.0 and Adobe Illustrator CS6.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics and brain dissections</title><p>Stocks used were as follows: w1118 (Bloomington Stock Center) was used as WT; y,v;;UAS-Gukh<sup>RNAi</sup>, homozygous short hairpin insertion on chromosome III was generated by ligating a F/R primer cassette with the sequence: 5’ctagcagtTCCAGCGATCACGAAGTTCTAtagttatattcaagcataTAGAACTTCGTGATCGCTGGAgcg 3’ into pVALIUM20 (TRiP protocol) and injecting plasmid into y,v;;attP2 flies (Genetic Services); y,v;;attP2 was used as the control RNAi; dlg<sup>m52</sup>/FM7i,B,Act:GFP;Wor-Gal4/Cyo,Act:GFP (gift from Chris Doe lab); FM7i,B,Act:GFP/Y, hemizygous males containing Act:GFP labeled X chromosome for Ctrl rescue selection; FM7i,B,Act:GFP/Y;;UAS-emGFP:Dlg<sup>WT</sup>, homozygous transgene insertion on chromosome III; FM7i,B,Act:GFP;;UAS-emGFP:Dlg<sup>S662D</sup>, homozygous transgene insertion on chromosome III. Gukh RNAi was performed by driving UAS-shRNA expression with the Wor-Gal4 driver at 29°C. Brains were harvested in third instar larval stages. Dlg deficient third instar larvae were obtained by crossing dlg<sup>m52</sup>/FM7i,B,Act:GFP; Wor-Gal4/Cyo,Act:GFP females with FM7i,B,Act:GFP males and screening against Act:GFP. The resulting larvae were all GFP<sup>-</sup> males of genotype dlg<sup>m52</sup>/Y;Wor-Gal4/+;+/+. Note: dlg<sup>m52</sup> hemizygous male larvae die at the larval-pupal transition and exhibit small testes that render them indistinguishable from females. Rescue crosses were performed by crossing dlg<sup>m52</sup>/FM7i,B,Act:GFP; Wor-Gal4/Cyo,Act:GFP females with transgenic FM7i,B,Act:GFP/Y;;UAS-emGFP:Dlg homozygous males and screening against Act:GFP. The resulting larvae were all GFP<sup>-</sup> males of genotype dlg<sup>m52</sup>/Y;Wor-Gal4/+;UAS/+.</p><p>All neuroblasts shown are from 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larval stage when maternal Dlg load is diminished in neuroblasts. Larval brains were dissected in Schneider’s Media without serum, followed by a 20-min fixation in PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X100 in PBS for 30 min, then blocked in 0.3% Triton-X100% and 1% BSA for 1 hr at room temperature.

All secondary antibodies were highly cross-adsorbed against other species in order to minimize cross-reactivity and false-positive signal. Samples were thoroughly washed in PBS then stored and mounted in SlowFade Diamond with DAPI solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p><p>Brain scans were performed using either an Olympus FV1000 laser scanning confocal using a 1.3NA 40x oil objective, or a Zeiss LSM880 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a S.1 super resolution structured illumination module using a 1.4NA 40x oil objective.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Activation of Discs large by aPKC couples cell polarity and the mitotic spindle during asymmetric cell division&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Yukiko M Yamashita (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes a mechanism by which spindle orientation is connected to cortical polarity. Specifically, the authors show that Dlg (cortical polarity) is connected to microtubule via GukH, and their interaction is regulated by aPKC-mediated phosphorylation. The study is conducted to a high standard, and the manuscript was reviewed favorably.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Whereas the study is conducted to a highest standard, one of the reviewers raised a question as to whether the study provides sufficient progress compared to the existing knowledge in the field, in particular in the light of the authors' own study concerning Dlg and GukH (Newman and Prehoda 2009). (We understand that the previous study did not show GukH's direct interaction with microtubule and thus the present study represents a good advancement in showing directness of the interaction.) With that said, it is important that the manuscript precisely conveys what is the major advancement of the present study, and we ask the authors to revise the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>In addition, the reviewers felt that the manuscript can benefit by addressing some outstanding questions. For example:</p><p>1) Can the authors delete the Guk domain and see if it recapitulates the dlg[M52] mutant phenotype? If Guk domain is essential for Dlg function, such experiments will reveal the key mechanism by which Dlg regulates asymmetric neuroblast division.</p><p>2) Why over-expressing Dlg[S662D] only rescued mis-alignment of the spindle in ~60% of neuroblasts whereas the full-length completely rescued this phenotype?</p><p>3) Mauri et al., proposed Bnd functions in parallel to Dlg. 'They probably should take this paper into consideration, and somehow integrate it into their work to broaden the scope of this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Prehoda and colleagues study how spindle orientation is linked to cell polarity, a critically important question in understanding the mechanism of asymmetric cell divisions. They provide an elegant mechanism by which Dlg is regulated by the activity of aPKC to anchor (or not) GukH, which in turn orients spindle.</p><p>This is a very careful and thorough study that provides a critical new link between cell polarity and spindle orientation. This is an important study that adds to our knowledge in spindle orientation, and I am in favor of publishing this manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) GukH localization in neuroblast? Especially because its localization in S2 cells is not so convincing, I'd love to see its localization in neuroblasts.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>: why does Miranda mislocalize upon GukH RNAi? I might be missing some well-established relationship between apical and basal crescent in neuroblasts, but I thought that disruption of spindle orientation pathway (instead of 'apical polarity pathway') wouldn't cause basal crescent disruption. Even if it's a well-known phenomenon, elaborating it would help accessibility of general readers. Also, in this figure, aPKC is the only apical protein that was examined. It may help understanding of GukH-mediated spindle orientation mechanism if they check other apical proteins.</p><p>3) Spindle orientation phenotype of dlg and GukH mutants/RNAi seems to be somewhat weak. Certainly, it can be redundancy with other pathways, such as Insc – it might be helpful at least to discuss about this point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Golub et al. explores how spindle orientation is coupled with cortical cell polarity, and insights into how these two processes are precisely coordinated are directly relevant to virtually all biological contexts involving asymmetric cell divisions. Disc large (Dlg) is a classical neoplastic tumor suppressor gene that was initially identified in flies and was subsequently characterized in other vertebrate contexts. A role for Dlg in regulating spindle orientation is well established, but the mechanisms are not understood. Furthermore, how Dlg functions coordinately with cortical polarity cues mainly the Par complex to regulate asymmetric cell division was also poorly understood. This study offers new insights indicating that phosphorylation by aPKC contributes to the activation of Dlg functions in orienting the mitotic spindle.

(We understand that the previous study did not show GukH's direct interaction with microtubule and thus the present study represents a good advancement in showing directness of the interaction.) With that said, it is important that the manuscript precisely conveys what is the major advancement of the present study, and we ask the authors to revise the manuscript accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion to more clearly convey the advance our work represents, and we have modified the text accordingly. In addition to those revisions, we provide a more specific explanation of how the current manuscript advances our understanding over our previous publication (Newman and Prehoda 2009) below. To summarize:</p><p>The previous work did not provide a connection between polarity and Dlg-mediated spindle orientation. Our current work demonstrates that the Par polarity kinase aPKC directly modifies Dlg and activates its spindle orientation activity;</p><p>The previous work did not provide a connection to a downstream effector that was known to mediate spindle orientation. There are two key points here: 1) other Dlg effectors (such as the kinesin Khc73) were thought to be the key mediators of Dlg spindle orientation and 2) GukHolder was not known to mediate spindle orientation during asymmetric cell division;</p><p>The previous work did not provide a function for GukHolder (it wasn’t even known to be a spindle orientation protein and wasn’t known to bind microtubules).</p><p>Our current work addresses the fundamental question of how polarity and Dlg-mediated spindle orientation are linked. Newman and Prehoda 2009 did not answer this question. It only showed that Dlg autoinhibition is required for spindle orientation and to repress GukHolder binding, but did not show why autoinhibition is required. It did not provide any mechanism for activating Dlg (which is important because that’s the physical link between polarity and Dlg-mediated spindle orientation), nor did it show that GukHolder was itself involved in spindle orientation. By raising the question as to why Dlg autoinhibition is required for spindle orientation, this previous work did lead us to our current study that provides a complete connection between polarity (Par complex kinase aPKC) and microtubule interactor (discovered in our current manuscript). Thus, our previous work did not answer how polarity and Dlg-mediated spindle orientation are connected – an essential part of asymmetric cell division and the key advance of our current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the reviewers felt that the manuscript can benefit by addressing some outstanding questions. For example:</p><p>1) Can the authors delete the Guk domain and see if it recapitulates the dlg[M52] mutant phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>Siegriest and Doe 2005 found that the Guk domain is require for neuroblast spindle orientation and we have revised the text to highlight this fact.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If Guk domain is essential for Dlg function, such experiments will reveal the key mechanism by which Dlg regulates asymmetric neuroblast division.</p><p>2) Why over-expressing Dlg[S662D] only rescued mis-alignment of the spindle in ~60% of neuroblasts whereas the full-length completely rescued this phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>Since Dlg is localized uniformly cortically, the S662D mutation leads to ectopic Dlg activity. In other words, wild type neuroblasts only have active Dlg at the apical cortex because that is where it is phosphorylated by aPKC. Neuroblasts expressing Dlg[S662D], however, have Dlg activity all over the cortex, even at sites lacking aPKC, leading to the spindle misalignment phenotype we observed. We have revised the text to make this phenotype and interpretation more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Mauri et al., proposed Bnd functions in parallel to Dlg. 'They probably should take this paper into consideration, and somehow integrate it into their work to broaden the scope of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>Our work demonstrates that aPKC phosphorylation of Dlg relieves Dlg autoinhibition, allowing it to bind GukHolder, a spindle orientation protein. Several other Dlg-binding proteins are known to be involved in spindle orientation, including Khc73 and Bnd, and we did not mean to imply that the pathway we have discovered operates at the expense of these other proteins. We have added text to the discussion to clarify this point and thank the reviewer for raising it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, Prehoda and colleagues study how spindle orientation is linked to cell polarity, a critically important question in understanding the mechanism of asymmetric cell divisions. They provide an elegant mechanism by which Dlg is regulated by the activity of aPKC to anchor (or not) GukH, which in turn orients spindle.</p><p>This is a very careful and thorough study that provides a critical new link between cell polarity and spindle orientation. This is an important study that adds to our knowledge in spindle orientation, and I am in favor of publishing this manuscript in eLife.</p><p>1) GukH localization in neuroblast? Especially because its localization in S2 cells is not so convincing, I'd love to see its localization in neuroblasts.</p></disp-quote><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q</xref> in Albertson and Doe (2003) shows clear apical localization of Gukholder in neuroblasts, consistent with our model, but we agree with the reviewer that our own staining of GukHolder would be useful. Unfortunately our attempts to do so have not been successful – we have not been able to obtain any of the antibody used in that original study (reported in Mathew et al. 2002) and our efforts to generate an anti-GukH antibody have not yielded one that works for immunohistochemistry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>: why does Miranda mislocalize upon GukH RNAi? I might be missing some well-established relationship between apical and basal crescent in neuroblasts, but I thought that disruption of spindle orientation pathway (instead of 'apical polarity pathway') wouldn't cause basal crescent disruption. Even if it's a well-known phenomenon, elaborating it would help accessibility of general readers. Also, in this figure, aPKC is the only apical protein that was examined. It may help understanding of GukH-mediated spindle orientation mechanism if they check other apical proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>Besides its role in spindle orientation, Dlg is also known to regulate neuroblast polarity (Ohshiro et al. 2000; Peng et al. 2000; Newman and Prehoda 2009) and our results indicate that GukH is likely to be involved in both functions. To gain additional insight into GukH function we stained GukH RNAi neuroblasts for the tumor suppressor Scribble, a known polarity regulator and</p><p>GukH interactor. We found that Scrib localization is unaffected suggesting that it is upstream of GukH’s function. In the revised text we more thoroughly explain the polarity defect and include the new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Spindle orientation phenotype of dlg and GukH mutants/RNAi seems to be somewhat weak. Certainly, it can be redundancy with other pathways, such as Insc – it might be helpful at least to discuss about this point.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer notes, Dlg is known to have a mild spindle orientation defect in neuroblasts because of redundancy with the Inscuteable pathway. We emphasize this point in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Golub et al. explores how spindle orientation is coupled with cortical cell polarity, and insights into how these two processes are precisely coordinated are directly relevant to virtually all biological contexts involving asymmetric cell divisions. Disc large (Dlg) is a classical neoplastic tumor suppressor gene that was initially identified in flies and was subsequently characterized in other vertebrate contexts. A role for Dlg in regulating spindle orientation is well established, but the mechanisms are not understood. Furthermore, how Dlg functions coordinately with cortical polarity cues mainly the Par complex to regulate asymmetric cell division was also poorly understood. This study offers new insights indicating that phosphorylation by aPKC contributes to the activation of Dlg functions in orienting the mitotic spindle.
