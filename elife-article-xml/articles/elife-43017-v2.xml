functions with the core clock factors for expression of clock-controlled genes in skeletal muscle. We demonstrate that MYOD1 directly regulates the expression and circadian amplitude of the positive core clock factor <italic>Bmal1</italic>. We identify a non-canonical E-box element in <italic>Bmal1</italic> and demonstrate that is required for full MYOD1-responsiveness. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays demonstrate that MYOD1 colocalizes with both BMAL1 and CLOCK throughout myonuclei. We demonstrate that MYOD1 and BMAL1:CLOCK work in a synergistic fashion through a tandem E-box to regulate the expression and amplitude of the muscle specific clock-controlled gene, Titin-cap (<italic>Tcap</italic>). In conclusion, these findings reveal mechanistic roles for the muscle specific transcription factor MYOD1 in the regulation of molecular clock amplitude as well as synergistic regulation of clock-controlled genes in skeletal muscle.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Bmal1</kwd><kwd>clock</kwd><kwd>muscle transcription</kwd><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR066082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esser</surname><given-names>Karyn A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007698</institution-id><institution>University of Florida</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esser</surname><given-names>Karyn A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The myogenic lineage transcription factor, MYOD1, amplifies and works with the core clock factors to support a daily muscle gene expression program.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Circadian rhythms are repetitive ~24 hr cycles that allow organisms to temporally align behavioral, biochemical and physiological processes with daily environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vitaterna et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Panda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhadra et al., 2017</xref>). These rhythms exist in virtually all mammalian cells and are generated by transcriptional/translational feedback loops referred to as the molecular-clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Partch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tataroglu and Emery, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takahashi, 2016</xref>). The positive limb of the core clock is comprised of the PAS domain containing basic-Helix-Loop-Helix factors (PAS-bHLH) core clock factors Brain and Muscle Arnt-Like 1 (<italic>Bmal1</italic>) and Circadian Locomotor Output Clocks Kaput (<italic>CLOCK</italic>). These factors heterodimerize and bind to the DNA at E-box elements where they generate circadian transcription oscillations through rhythmic recruitment of histone acetylases, co-factors, and components of the transcriptional complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">King et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bunger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Partch et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to keeping time, the core molecular clock factors regulate the expression of downstream clock-controlled genes (CCGs), many of which encode master transcriptional regulators and rate-limiting enzymes in key biochemical pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bozek et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bozek et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Although the core molecular clock components are expressed in the majority of cell-types throughout the body, CCGs are expressed in a very tissue-specific fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Storch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mure et al., 2018</xref>). This temporal regulation of tissue-specific gene programs allows for the timing of organ and cell-type specific processes that help maintain physiological homeostasis within each tissue and across multiple organ systems throughout the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bozek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korenčič et al., 2015</xref>). The transcriptional mechanisms by which the core clock factors regulate tissue-specific genes are not fully understood. Recent studies have begun to identify lineage-specific transcriptional regulators that co-localize with molecular clock components at cis-regulatory elements located within tissue-specific promoter and enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bozek et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dufour et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Korenčič et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perelis et al., 2015</xref>). To date, factors within the liver, hippocampus, pancreas have previously been reported, however a muscle-specific transcriptional regulator has yet to be defined.</p><p>In skeletal muscle the bHLH transcription factor MYOD1 drives myogenic gene expression by recruiting co-factors and the transcriptional machinery to muscle-specific gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rudnicki et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Polesskaya et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fong and Tapscott, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buckingham and Rigby, 2014</xref>). MYOD1 is often referred to as the ‘master myogenic switch’ as it is required for muscle cell differentiation and is capable of converting non-muscle cells into a muscle lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tapscott et al., 1988</xref>). In adult skeletal muscle, BMAL1:CLOCK target the core-enhancer element (CE) located 20 kb upstream of the <italic>Myod1</italic> start site to promote the circadian expression of MYOD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). We previously reported that MYOD1-CE mice, that only lack the upstream CE region, display significant declines in the circadian amplitude of the core clock genes <italic>Bmal1</italic> and <italic>Per2 (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting MYOD1 may modulate core clock gene expression in skeletal muscle.</p><p>Herein, we sought to address two questions: 1) Does MYOD1 transcriptionally regulate core molecular clock genes? And 2) Does MYOD1 work with the core clock components to regulate the circadian expression of muscle specific genes? We found that MYOD1 binds to an intronic enhancer within the <italic>Bmal1</italic> promoter and functions to transcriptionally regulate <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression. Using both In vivo and In vitro approaches we determined that MYOD1 serves to enhance the amplitude of <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression creating a feed-forward regulatory loop between <italic>MyoD1</italic> and the core clock gene, <italic>Bmal1</italic> in skeletal muscle. We also found that MYOD1 works in a synergistic fashion with BMAL1:CLOCK to amplify the circadian expression of a muscle-specific, clock-controlled gene, <italic>Titin-cap</italic> (<italic>Tcap)</italic>. Co-localization studies demonstrated that MYOD1, BMAL1, and CLOCK are in close proximity within myonuclei. <italic>Tcap</italic> promoter analysis uncovered that MYOD1 and BMAL1 target a tandem E-box and that both Eboxes are required for the circadian regulation. These findings identify a novel role for MYOD1 as a clock amplifier and highlight synergistic interactions among core the clock factors, BMAL1:CLOCK and MYOD1 in regulating downstream clock-controlled gene expression in skeletal muscle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of MYOD1 binding sites in adult skeletal muscle</title><p>We first noted that expression of the core clock genes <italic>Bmal1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> were dampened in skeletal muscle of mice in which circadian expression of <italic>MyoD1</italic> was abolished (MYOD1-CE mice), which suggested that MYOD1 may function as an upstream transcriptional regulator of the molecular clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). To address these findings we performed a MYOD1 ChIP-Seq experiment with adult skeletal muscle from male C57BL/6J mice. We identified 12,343 MYOD1 binding sites on 7751 genes using very stringent statistics for calling peaks to minimize false positives due to our lack of a preimmune serum control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We compared the list of genes bound by MYOD1 to a list of circadian genes identified from a high resolution time-series collection in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Of the 1454 circadian mRNA transcripts in skeletal muscle (JTK_CYCLE p-value &lt; 0.03: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) we found that approximately 30% (536 genes, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) are directly targeted by MYOD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of these 536 circadian MYOD1 target genes revealed a significant enrichment for genes involved in muscle structure and development consistent with MYOD1’s known function as a myogenic transcription factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43017.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MYOD1 binding coverage on skeletal muscle circadian genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overlap of genes bound by MYOD1 (red) and circadian genes (grey) in adult skeletal muscle (JTK_CYCLE p-value &lt; 0.03).

We indentified target genes for our analysis by querying a publically available MYOD1-CE expression dataset for circadian genes that are also MYOD1 targets to test if they were down-regulated in MYOD1-CE muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). The genes included in this analysis were the muscle-growth regulator <italic>Asb2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davey et al., 2016</xref>), the clock-output gene <italic>Nrip1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Poliandri et al., 2011</xref>), a glycogen synthase regulator <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Montori-Grau et al., 2011</xref>), and the angiogenesis factor <italic>Vegfa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arsic et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, in muscle from MYOD1-CE mice these genes displayed altered temporal expression over time of day with a significant reduction in average expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>). When we analyzed the temporal gene expression profiles with the circadian statistical program, JTK_CYCLE, we found that <italic>Vegfa</italic> and <italic>Nrip1</italic> mRNAs were no longer circadian, and for <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic> and <italic>Asb2</italic> the p-values were notably higher. These findings are consistent with a model in which MYOD1 levels influence molecular clock transcriptional output in skeletal muscle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MYOD1 transcriptionally regulates the expression and circadian amplitude of <italic>Bmal1</italic></title><p>Within the subset of MYOD1 bound circadian genes we found a significant enrichment for the biological process of ‘circadian rhythm’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and observed MYOD1 binding within gene-regulatory regions of multiple core clock genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) including a large binding peak within the <italic>Bmal1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). MYOD1 over-expression significantly elevated endogenous BMAL1 protein levels by approximately 50% in C2C12 myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Bmal1</italic> is under transcriptional regulation by MYOD1.

The mechanisms that direct tissue-specific circadian gene signatures are not fully understood; however, interactions between lineage specific factors and the core clock components have previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dufour et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perelis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trott and Menet, 2018</xref>).

Therefore, we asked whether MYOD1 and BMAL1:CLOCK co-localize within nuclei of the C2C12 muscle cell line by performing a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay.</p><p>We used a <italic>Venus</italic> based system with constructs tagged with either non-fluorescent <italic>Venus</italic> C- terminal fragments (VC) or with the non-fluorescent <italic>Venus</italic> N-terminal fragment (VN). With this design, <italic>Venus</italic> fluorescence signals are generated only when VC- and VN-tagged proteins co-localize and bring the two domains into physical association. We observed fluorescence signals within myonuclei when we co-expressed the known binding partners VN-HDAC5 with VC-MEF2c which served as a positive control and demonstrated that the BiFC assay was functional in our hands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In agreement with BMAL1 and CLOCK forming heterodimers, we observed nuclear fluorescent signals when we co-expressed VN-CLOCK with VC-BMAL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We performed a series of negative control experiments by co-expressing VN-BMAL1 with the VC-control vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>), or VN-CLOCK with the VC-control vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>) and failed to observe fluorescent signals. As an additional negative control, we could not detect a fluorescent signal when we co-expressed VN-BMAL1 with VC-BMAL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), consistent with reports that these isoforms do not heterodimerize. Interestingly, we observed nuclear fluorescent signals when we co-expressed VC-MYOD1 with VN-CLOCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) or VN-BMAL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating that MYOD1 co-localizes with both BMAL and CLOCK within myonuclei. We also observed fluorescent signals when we co-express VC-CLOCK or VC-BMAL1 with VN-MYOD1 (data not shown). It was interesting to note that MYOD1 was localized with either BMAL1 or CLOCK in multiple foci within the myonucleus indicating the role of MYOD1 and the clock factors across several genomic loci. However, the pattern of MYOD1:CLOCK factor binding was more discrete when compared to the diffuse binding of BMAL:CLOCK throughout the nucleus. This suggests that MYOD1 is interacting with only a subset of the BMAL1:CLOCK heterodimers within the nucleus. However, these images provide one snapshot in time and these transcription factors have a temporal component to their function that cannot be extrapolated from these images. Future studies will focus on the temporal interactions between MYOD1 and the clock factors as well as the fundamental molecular links and likely co-factors that modulate these interactions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43017.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>MYOD1 colocalizes with BMAL1 and CLOCK in C2C12 myonuclei.</title><p>Representative images from the BiFC assay performed in C2C12 myoblasts co-transfected with (<bold>A</bold>) VN-CLOCK and VC-BMAL1, (<bold>B</bold>) VN-BMAL1 and VC-BMAL2, (<bold>C</bold>) VN-CLOCK and VC-MYOD1, and (<bold>D</bold>) VN-BMAL1 and VC-MYOD1. mCherry expression plasmids (red fluorescence signal) were co-transfected in each experiment to visualize the myoblasts and ensure successful transfection.

Herein we demonstrate that MYOD1 strengthens molecular clock amplitude in skeletal muscle by functioning as a direct transcriptional activator of <italic>Bmal1</italic>. We show that MYOD1 co-localizes with BMAL1:CLOCK in myonuclei and works in a synergistic fashion to drive the circadian expression of the muscle specific gene, <italic>Tcap</italic>. This study is the first to demonstrate functional roles for MYOD1 as an upstream, positive regulator of the core molecular clock, as well as a direct modulator of clock output in skeletal muscle.</p><p>Our lab previously reported that BMAL1:CLOCK rhythmically bind to the <italic>MyoD1</italic> promoter at the distal core-enhancer region resulting in its robust circadian expression in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). One of the main findings of our current study is that MYOD1 regulates circadian amplitude through direct transcriptional control of <italic>Bmal1</italic>, thus indicating that MYOD1 forms a transcriptional feed-forward loop with the molecular clock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The temporal expression profile of MYOD1 correlates with its predictive role as an upstream regulator of <italic>Bmal1</italic>, as MYOD1 protein peaks in the mid-to-late active phase in adult skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2010</xref>) in anticipation of the upward rise in <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression which occurs during the early inactive phase. Our findings are also supported by a recent study that utilized an inducible MYOD1 expression system in human fibroblasts to define the genome architecture of human myogenic reprograming. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al. (2018)</xref>, found that MYOD1 activation in fibroblasts was sufficient to synchronize core circadian genes, and the authors conclude that MYOD1 may serve to communicate exogenous entrainment cues to the clock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Our results provide mechanistic insights to Liu et al’s findings by demonstrating that MYOD1 may sychronize the molecular clock through direct transcriptional regulation of an enhancer within the core clock gene, <italic>Bmal1</italic>. This transcriptional feed-forward loop between MYOD1 and the clock shares mechanistic similarities with previously identified tissue-specific, peripheral modulators of clock amplitude which A) display diurnal variations in expression and B) regulate circadian amplitude via direct transcriptional control of the <italic>Bmal1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Onishi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirota et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Poliandri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Valnegri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wible et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The accessory core clock transcription factors Reverbα and RORα are responsible for stabilizing period length and modulating circadian amplitude in a ubiquitous fashion across all tissues and cell-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Preitner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guillaumond et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jetten, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Solt et al., 2011</xref>). Both Reverbα and RORα are direct BMAL1:CLOCK target genes that compete for binding at the Rev-Erb Response element (RORE) within the <italic>Bmal1</italic> promoter thus forming a feedback loop where Rev-Erbα represses while RORα activates the expression of <italic>Bmal1</italic>. Interestingly, a number of peripheral modulators of circadian amplitude regulate <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression through RORα and/or REV-ERBα dependent mechanisms. For example, in liver tissue <italic>Nrip1</italic> promotes circadian amplitude through interacting with RORα at the <italic>Bmal1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Poliandri et al., 2011</xref>). Conversely, the glucose responsive factor <italic>Tieg1</italic> decreases circadian amplitude by repressing <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression in a REV-ERBα dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirota et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Poliandri et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, RORα has been shown to physically interact with MYOD1 at its N-terminal activation domain to promote myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lau et al., 1999</xref>). Although we did not test this potential interaction in our current study, it is possible that MYOD1 regulates <italic>Bmal1</italic> in a RORα-dependent fashion which may help explain why the MYOD1mut vector, which lacks the transactivation domain, failed to activate the <italic>Bmal1P</italic>-Luc reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E,H</xref>) to the same degree as the wildtype MYOD1 vector. Future studies will be aimed at investigating whether MYOD1 works alongside the accessory limb factors, Rev-erbα and/or RORα, to regulate <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression and circadian amplitude.</p><p>To investigate the potential mechanistic interactions between MYOD1 and BMAL1:CLOCK we decided to characterize their roles (both individually and together) in regulating a muscle specific circadian gene. Our bioinformatics approach led us to identify <italic>Tcap</italic> as a model gene for studying the interaction between MYOD1 and BMAL1:CLOCK. The novelty of these studies lie in the observations that MYOD1 and BMAL1:CLOCK work together to synergistically regulate the <italic>Tcap</italic> promoter. The transcriptional regulation of <italic>Tcap</italic> by MYOD1 appears to require a functional clock, as MYOD1-mediated activation of <italic>TcapP</italic>-Luc was dampened with over-expression of mutant forms of BMAL1 or CLOCK. Taken together with our findings that MYOD1 co-localizes with BMAL1:CLOCK and targets ~ 30% of the skeletal muscle circadian transcriptome, we propose a model by which MYOD1 regulates downstream circadian genes through forming cooperative interactions with BMAL1:CLOCK at cis-regulatory regions. In support of this model, a recent BMAL1 ChIP-Seq in mouse skeletal muscle revealed an enrichment for the canonical MYOD1 motif (5’-CAGCTG-3’) within BMAL1 binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dyar et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although the canonical BMAL1:CLOCK E-box binding sequence is CACGTG, recent studies have identified the presence of tandem E-box elements (2 E-boxes separated by six nucleotides) within a majority of core clock genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakahata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tokuda et al., 2017</xref>). Our functional characterization <italic>Tcap</italic>’s tandem E-box site provides a deeper understanding into the mechanisms of circadian gene regulation by MYOD1 and the clock factors. We found that the tandem E-box within the <italic>Tcap</italic> promoter is directly targeted by MYOD1 and BMAL1 in adult skeletal muscle and is functionally required for <italic>Tcap</italic>’s circadian regulation and synergistic activation by MYOD1 and BMAL1:CLOCK. In support of the BMAL1 binding enrichment within <italic>Tcap</italic>’s tandem E-box, we observed a loss in the circadian oscillation with either the 3’ or 5’ <italic>TcapP</italic>-Luc mutants. Furthermore, the 3’, but not the 5’, E-box mutant was unresponsive to BMAL1:CLOCK over-expression indicating a potential preference for BMAL1:CLOCK binding at the distal E-box. The observation that all three E-box mutants were responsive to MYOD1 over-expression, but were arrhythmic argues that <italic>Tcap</italic>’s circadian expression pattern is set primarily by BMAL1:CLOCK and not by MYOD1. This interpretation is in agreement with previous reports that <italic>Tcap</italic> oscillates and is bound by BMAL1 at the tandem E-box in heart tissue, where MYOD1 expression/activity is non-existent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Podobed et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together these findings argue that <italic>Tcap</italic>’s rhythmic oscillation is set primarily by BMAL1:CLOCK, while MYOD1 functions as a peripheral rheostat that controls the amplitude (i.e. gain) of the core clock mechanism and downstream clock-driven transcripts in skeletal muscle.</p><p>MYOD1’s regulation of circadian amplitude may have evolved as a means for communicating muscle specific time-cues to the clock. It is well established that molecular clocks sense and respond to environmental time-cues in a tissue-specific fashion (i.e. light vs. nutrient entrainment) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Podobed et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tokuda et al., 2017</xref>). For instance, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells signal light information to the SCN, while peripheral clocks, which are incapable of sensing light directly, are more responsive to feeding cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Podobed et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is not fully understood how clocks in different tissues sense specific time-cues, but recent studies have begun to identify factors that communicate environmental signals to the clock. For instance, Oligophrenin-1 which is activated by synaptic firing, modulates the expression of <italic>Bmal1</italic> by sequestering REV-ERBα within the cytosol of hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Poliandri et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, Hif1α which is activated during hypoxic conditions has been shown to influence clock gene expression within a number of cell types including skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trott and Menet, 2018</xref>). Ourselves and others have demonstrated that muscle contractions and nutrient cues serve as time cues for the clock mechnism within skeletal muscle, as forced exercise or meal timing phase shifts core clock rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wolff and Esser, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shavlakadze et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). MYOD1 is a likely candidate for communicating these environmental time-cues to the clock, as its expression and activity is strongly influenced by nutrient signals (repressed during fasting conditions) and muscle contraction (elevated with denervated muscle tissue), both of which are strong time-cues for the skeletal muscle molecular clock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wolff and Esser, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shavlakadze et al., 2013</xref>). MYOD1 activity may also mediate information for the timing or phase of the clock rhythms as we observed phase delays in <italic>Bmal1P</italic>-Luc rhythms with over-expression of MYOD1 in C2C12 myotubes.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that MYOD1 is a critical transcription factor in the regulation of circadian amplitude and downstream rhythmic gene expression in skeletal muscle. Given the vital role clocks play in the daily maintenance of skeletal muscle physiology and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schroder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harfmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schiaffino et al., 2016</xref>), these findings provide potential therapeutic avenues for enhancing clock function in skeletal muscle through targeting MYOD1.

The immune-complex was incubated with protein A/G beads slurry for 4 hr and the beads will be washed with RIPA buffer five times and TE buffer twice. DNA was then eluted twice with 250 µl of elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) for 20 min and supernatant was collected after 5 min centrifugation at high speed. 25 µl of 4 M NaCl was mixed with the 500 µl of elutant and incubated at 65°C overnight. Then 10 µl of 0.5 M EDTA, 20 µl of 1 M Tris pH 6.5 and 2 µl 10 mg/ml proteinase K was added to each sample and incubated at 55°C for 1.5 hr. DNA was recovered with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen). ChIP DNA samples from the MYOD1 pull-down were prepared for Solexa sequencing according to the Illumina protocol using methods described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al.

We next aligned the trimmed reads to the mouse mm10 genome (provided by UCSC database) with the bowtie2 package. Samtools was utilized to convert between sam format to bam format, and then bamToBed was utilized to convert the reads into Bed format. We then utilized the HOMER software package for the remainder of our ChIP-seq processes. Briefly, we utilized the Homer package ‘makeTagDirectory’ to create tag directories. Due to the the lack of an pre-immune serum control for these studies we used stringent criteria for peak identification. To identify MYOD1 binding sites we utilized the ‘findPeaks’ package with the following parameters: style –factor –o auto with local background filtering set to 6-fold higher than the average surrounding 10kbp (-L 6). To identify peaks associated with gene promoters we utilized the ‘annotatePeaks.pl’ package with the mm10 mouse genome. The package ‘makeUCSCfile’ was used to create a bedgraph formatted file to visualize MYOD1 binding peaks with the UCSC genome browser (mm10 genome). To identify MYOD1 binding sites that are assocated with known circadian genes in skeletal muscle, we queried the skeletal muscle circadian transcriptome data downloaded from Circadb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://circadb.hogeneschlab.org/">http://circadb.hogeneschlab.org/</ext-link>). We utilized a JTK_CYCLE circadian p-value cutoff of 0.03 for identifying circadian transcripts in skeletal muscle.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: James Ryall (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript from Hodge et al. addresses the exciting field of circadian rhythms. Specifically asking how the clock is regulated in a tissue specific manner. To date, numerous manuscripts have shown an important role for circadian rhythms, however few have addressed the regulators of the rhythm itself. In this manuscript the authors demonstrate that <italic>MyoD1</italic> regulates the amplitude of the clock and that <italic>MyoD1</italic> regulates a muscle specific gene, <italic>Tcap</italic> in a clock dependent manner. This work is exciting and timely. In addition, the experiments are performed to a high standard with appropriate conclusions. There two major concerns that the authors need to address; 1) the overreliance of C2C12 cells, 2) the binding/recruitment between BMAL1, MYOD1 and <italic>TCap</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The major limitations of this study are related to the sole use of C2C12 cell line and overexpression of MYOD1 and clock regulators. In addition the effects of MYOD1 and BMAL1:CLOCK are evaluated on transfected luciferase reporters. Performing any of the in vitro experiments in primary myogenic cells would suffice.</p><p>2) Primary myoblasts derived from MYOD1 knock-out experiments could be employed to validate some of the findings reported here. Do the 536 clock genes identified as MYOD1 lose circadian regulation in MYOD1<sup>-/-</sup> primary myoblasts? Does reconstitution with MYOD1 restore their circadian expression? Expression of a small subset of the 536 genes could be evaluated by RT-qPCR.</p><p>3) My major query for the authors is why the <italic>MyoD1</italic> ChIPseq did not identify <italic>Tcap</italic> as a direct target and yet in vitro luciferase experiments demonstrated a clear response to <italic>MyoD1</italic> alone? This is worrisome as it could suggest that the in vitro studies utilizing an immortalized cell line do not represent the in vivo condition, especially as <italic>Tcap</italic> has only previously been found to be regulated by <italic>MyoD1</italic> in vitro (Zhang et al., 2011). Another possible explanation for this discrepancy could be due to the use of proliferating cells (versus terminally differentiated muscle for the ChIPseq). It would be useful for the investigators to determine whether their model holds true in differentiated C2C12 cells and/or primary cells. Alternatively, evidence of circadian <italic>Bmal1</italic> binding to the Ebox regions of <italic>Tcap</italic> in skeletal muscle (via ChIP-PCR) would provide strong support for the hypothesis.</p><p>4) Is BMAL1 co-recruited at a subset of the 536 MYOD1-target circadian genes by <italic>Bmal1</italic> ChIP assay? Does MYOD1 interact with the non-canonical E-box at the <italic>Bmal1</italic> and tandem E-box <italic>Tcap</italic> regions? These data should already be available to the authors.</p><p>5) Electroporation of <italic>Bmal1-Luc</italic> and <italic>Tcap-Luc</italic> (WT and mutant constructs) in skeletal muscle of control and MYOD1 knock-out mice would allow to convincingly address the role of MYOD1 in regulating circadian regulation of BMAL1 and <italic>Tcap</italic> via the identified E-boxes in a physiological setting.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43017.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The major limitations of this study are related to the sole use of C2C12 cell line and overexpression of MYOD1 and clock regulators.

This new data has been added to Figures 2, 3 and 6 and compliments our initial findings in C2C12 myotubes. We performed a dual-luciferase reporter assay in a similar fashion to the experiments performed in C2C12 myotubes (Figure 2C) and found that cotransfection with the wildtype MYOD1 expression vector, but not the MYOD1 mutant vector, was sufficient to significantly transactivate the <italic>Bmal1</italic>-Luc reporter in primary myotubes (Figure 2D). Also in Figure 2 we include new data in which we used in vivo electroporation to demonstrate that the <italic>Bmal1</italic> promoter is strongly transactivated by MYOD1 in tibialis anterior muscles of mice. We also performed real-time bioluminescence recordings in synchronized myotubes generated from primary muscles cells. In Figure 3F we demonstrate that the wildtype <italic>Bmal1P</italic>-Luc reporter oscillated in a circadian fashion, while the <italic>Bmal1Pmut</italic>-Luc reporter failed to oscillate with the same amplitude. In Figure 6G we show that synchronized primary myotubes co-transfected with wildtype <italic>TcapP</italic>-Luc display a greater bioluminescence amplitude than those transfected with the mutant <italic>TcapP-E2-5’</italic>-Luc reporter. Taken together these data with the use of primary cells and in vivo electroporation all consistently reinforce our findings originally obtained in C2C12 myotubes.</p><p>The second concern in this point was about reliance on overexpression strategies and we agree that our initial submission relied heavily on the use of over-expression plasmids for gain/loss of function analysis and promoter-reporter luciferase reporters to assay gene regulation. In our revised submission we have provided additional in vivo data to complement our promoter:reporter findings. Firstly, we have evaluated circadian gene expression via RT-PCR analysis in adult muscle tissue from MYOD1-CE mice and wildtype controls. MYOD1CE mice were chosen for our study given that they have constitutively low levels of <italic>MyoD1</italic> expression and could therefore serve as an in vivomodel of <italic>MyoD1</italic> knockdown. The MYOD1-CE mice been used by my lab in our paper Zhang et al., 2012, and the original reference for the mice is: Chen and Goldhamer, 2004.</p><p>From these analyses we found that circadian genes that are targeted by MYOD1 in our ChIP-seq analysis (<italic>Ppp1R3c, Asb2, Nrip1</italic>, and <italic>Vegfa</italic>) displayed significant reductions in expression with marked alterations to their circadian gene expression profile (Figure 1). Additionally, we found that circadian expression of <italic>Tcap</italic> mRNAis lost in MYOD1-CE muscle and this adds to the data in Figure 5. We also performed siRNA mediated knockdown of <italic>Bmal1</italic> in C2C12 myotubes and found a significant decrease in expression of endogenous <italic>Tcap</italic> and <italic>MyoD1</italic> mRNA levels (these data are now Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Primary myoblasts derived from MYOD1 knock-out experiments could be employed to validate some of the findings reported here. Do the 536 clock genes identified as MYOD1 lose circadian regulation in MYOD1<sup>-/-</sup> primary myoblasts? Does reconstitution with MYOD1 restore their circadian expression? Expression of a small subset of the 536 genes could be evaluated by RT-qPCR.</p></disp-quote><p>Our MYOD1 ChIP-seq allowed us to identify 536 circadian genes that are direct targets of MYOD1 in skeletal muscle. We agree with the reviewers that MYOD1 loss of function experiments would help to validate our claim that MYOD1 regulates the circadian expression of these genes. To address this issue we decided to utilize the MYOD1-CE mice for two reasons. Scientifically these mice have been previously characterized as having low <italic>Myod1</italic> expression in adult skeletal muscle compared to wildtype control mice. Pragmatically, we have the MYOD1-CE mice in our breeding facility at UF but we do not maintain the MyoD<sup>-/-</sup> mice. To obtain the mice, get through quarantine and breed them up would have pushed these experiments well beyond the 2 month deadline provided by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>For this manuscript we collected gastrocnemius muscles over a circadian timecourse from wildtype and MYOD1-CE mice. We chose a subset of potential candidate genes from the list of the 536 circadian genes targeted by MYOD1 in our ChIPseq experiment. The genes we chose to analyze included robust circadian genes and are the following: <italic>Ppp1r3c, Vegfa, Asb2</italic>, and <italic>Nrip1</italic>. We performed RT-qPCR on the RNA to determine if their circadian pattern and/or magnitude of expression were altered in the muscle of the MYOD1 knockdown mouse (MYOD1-CD). We found that all 4 genes displayed significant alterations in circadian mRNA expression patterns as indicated by JTK_CYCLE analysis (data now in Figures 1C-G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) My major query for the authors is why the MyoD1 ChIPseq did not identify Tcap as a direct target and yet in vitro luciferase experiments demonstrated a clear response to MyoD1 alone? This is worrisome as it could suggest that the in vitro studies utilizing an immortalized cell line do not represent the in vivo condition, especially as Tcap has only previously been found to be regulated by MyoD1 in vitro (Zhang et al., 2011). Another possible explanation for this discrepancy could be due to the use of proliferating cells (versus terminally differentiated muscle for the ChIPseq). It would be useful for the investigators to determine whether their model holds true in differentiated C2C12 cells and/or primary cells. Alternatively, evidence of circadian Bmal1 binding to the Ebox regions of Tcap in skeletal muscle (via ChIP-PCR) would provide strong support for the hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this reviewer’s concern about use of proliferating vs. differentiated cells but one thing we need to clarify is that all the transfection data in this manuscript come from experiments performed on differentiated myotubes or muscle tissue and not myoblasts. We have gone through the manuscript to make sure that point is very clear as we agree that what is detected in myoblasts does not always correspond to the differentiated myotube/muscle tissue. In addition, as noted above we now include a number of new experiments in which we used primary muscle cells differentiated into myotubes as well as in vivo muscle tissue to strengthen the study.</p><p>The other concern noted is that we did not detect MYOD1 binding on the Tcap promoter in our ChIPseq data set. This was perplexing to us but between our transfection outcomes coupled with our BiFC data and the results from a different lab that showed MYOD1 binding within the <italic>Tcap</italic> promoter via ChIP-PCR during embryonic muscle development we felt that maybe MYOD1 might be more functioning as part of a complex that could get disrupted in the ChIP preparation. For the revisions, we went back to muscle tissue and worked on the crosslinking conditions and performed targeted ChIP-PCR to directly test if MYOD1 does indeed target the <italic>Tcap</italic> promoter. We included primers for both the Tandem E-box element as well as the E1 E-box element. With this approach we found a significant enrichment for MYOD1 binding within the tandem E-box (Figure 6C) but no significant enrichment of MYOD1 for the E1 E-box (Figure 6A). Additionally, we also have included data showing strong BMAL1 binding enrichment for the tandem E-box (Figure 6D) and the E1 E-box (Figure 6B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Is BMAL1 co-recruited at a subset of the 536 MYOD1-target circadian genes by Bmal1 ChIP assay? Does MYOD1 interact with the non-canonical E-box at the Bmal1 and tandem E-box Tcap regions? These data should already be available to the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that demonstrating that BMAL1 also targets the subset of 536 MYOD1-target circadian genes would greatly strengthen the interpretation that BMAL1 is co-recruited to these genes by MYOD1 but it is beyond the scope of our time to do <italic>Bmal1</italic> ChIPseq within a 2 month window. However, we did query a recently published BMAL1 ChIP-seq dataset also performed in adult skeletal muscle (Dyar et al., 2018). Of the two BMAL1 ChIP-seq biological replicates we found that there was overlap of approximately 48% to 78% of the 536 MYOD1-target circadian genes. While the range was quite variable between the two Bmal1 ChIPseq replicates there seems to be around 50% or more coverage with both MYOD1 and BMAL1 supporting our concept that this mechanism goes beyond regulation of Tcap.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Electroporation of Bmal1-Luc and Tcap-Luc (WT and mutant constructs) in skeletal muscle of control and MYOD1 knock-out mice would allow to convincingly address the role of MYOD1 in regulating circadian regulation of BMAL1 and Tcap via the identified E-boxes in a physiological setting.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer and we provide new in vivodata showing that the <italic>Bmal1P</italic>-Luc reporter is transactivated by MYOD1 in adult skeletal muscle. For these experiments we electroporated the tibialis anterior muscle with <italic>Bmal1P</italic>-Luc with MYOD1 or +pGEM(control). The magnitude of <italic>Bmal1</italic> activation is similar to what we found with our in vitro studies (new data are included in Figure 2E).</p><p>To address <italic>Tcap</italic> regulation in vivo, we quantified <italic>Tcap</italic> mRNA levels over a circadian time-course in MYOD1CE skeletal muscle, and found a complete loss of circadian expression (Figure 6G, H). These data indicate that MYOD1 expression influences the expression and amplitude of both the core molecular clock as well as downstream circadian genes in skeletal muscle.</p></body></sub-article></article>
