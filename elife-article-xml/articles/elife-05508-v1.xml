complexes to regulate BMP gradient formation during embryonic dorsal-ventral axis patterning. Here, we determine mechanistically how Tolloid activity is regulated by its non-catalytic CUB domains in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. We show that Tolloid, via its N-terminal CUB domains, interacts with Collagen IV, which enhances Tolloid activity towards its substrate Sog, and facilitates Tsg-dependent stimulation of cleavage. In contrast, the two most C-terminal Tld CUB domains mediate Sog interaction to facilitate its processing as, based on our structural data, Tolloid curvature positions bound Sog in proximity to the protease domain. Having ascribed functions to the Tolloid non-catalytic domains, we recapitulate embryonic BMP gradient formation in their absence, by artificially tethering the Tld protease domain to Sog. Our studies highlight how the bipartite function of Tolloid CUB domains, in substrate and ECM interactions, fine-tune protease activity to a particular developmental context.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05508.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05508.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05508.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The body of an animal is a highly organised structure of tissues and organs that contain cells with specialised roles. To achieve this level of organisation, it is important that the cells in the embryo know their location and receive the correct instructions on how to develop, when to divide or move. Many animals are roughly symmetrical about an imaginary line that runs from their head to their tail; a developing embryo can provide its cells with information about their position along this head-to-tail axis and the axis that runs from its front to its back.</p><p>Setting up the front-to-back axis in the embryo involves a family of proteins called the bone morphogenetic proteins (or BMPs). These proteins can bind to other proteins that act as signals to provide instructions to cells. However, many of the BMPs are unable to perform this job because they are trapped by inhibitory molecules that bind to them instead.</p><p>Enzymes belonging to the Tolloid family can break down these inhibitors to release the BMPs. Together, the inhibitors and Tolloid enzymes create a gradient of BMP activity across the embryo. The side of the embryo with the highest levels of active BMPs sets the position of the back of the body, while the opposite side—which has the lowest levels of active BMPs—becomes the front. However, it is not clear how Tolloid is controlled to create the BMP gradient.</p><p>Different parts of the Tolloid enzyme have different roles; one portion of the enzyme breaks down the inhibitory molecules, and there are also several so-called ‘non-catalytic domains’. Winstanley et al. used a combination of approaches to study how Tolloid is controlled in fruit fly embryos. The experiments show that two non-catalytic domains at one end of Tolloid help the enzyme to bind to the inhibitory molecules. At the other end of the Tolloid enzyme, another non-catalytic domain can bind to a structural protein called Collagen IV. This enhances the ability of the enzyme to break down the inhibitory molecules and release the BMPs.</p><p>These findings reveal how Tolloid's non-catalytic domains can fine-tune the activity of this enzyme to create the gradient of BMP activity that is needed to set the front-to-back direction in animal embryos. Future studies will focus on identifying other proteins that bind to the non-catalytic domains of Tolloid in order to further control its activity during development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05508.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05508.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>BMP</kwd><kwd>gradient formation</kwd><kwd>Tolloid</kwd><kwd>Sog/Chordin</kwd><kwd>Collagen IV</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>092005/Z/10/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ashe</surname><given-names>Hilary L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/I019286/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldock</surname><given-names>Clair</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winstanley</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>083271/Z/07/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sawala</surname><given-names>Annick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>088785/Z/09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winstanley</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name><name><surname>Baldock</surname><given-names>Clair</given-names></name><name><surname>Ashe</surname><given-names>Hilary L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The in vivo activity of Tolloid during <italic>Drosophila</italic> dorsal-ventral patterning is regulated by the differential specificity of its non-catalytic domains in mediating substrate and Collagen IV interaction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) represent a conserved family of secreted signalling proteins that regulate diverse processes during development and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu and Hill, 2009</xref>). Multiple tiers of regulation within the BMP signalling pathway exist, including extracellular modulators that form inhibitory complexes with BMPs to prevent ligand interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wharton and Serpe, 2013</xref>). These extracellular BMP inhibitors are crucial during dorsal-ventral axis patterning of the early embryo, where they act to redistribute broadly expressed BMP ligands to form a gradient of BMP activity.</p><p>The mechanism of BMP gradient formation has been extensively studied in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, where a heterodimer of the BMP ligands, Dpp and Scw, acts as the most potent BMP signalling species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shimmi et al., 2005</xref>). In dorsolateral regions, an inhibitory complex is formed, with the Dpp-Scw heterodimer bound by the extracellular antagonists Sog and Tsg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wharton and Serpe, 2013</xref>), aided by the scaffold protein Collagen IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sawala et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wharton and Serpe, 2013</xref>). In this inhibitory complex, the Dpp-Scw heterodimer is unable to bind to receptors or Collagen IV, but is free to diffuse dorsally. The secreted Tld metalloproteinase cleaves Sog to release active BMP ligand, however in dorsolateral regions due to the high concentration of Sog, the ligand dimer is rebound. Thus it is through a cycle of complex formation, diffusion and cleavage that the ligands accumulate at the dorsal midline where, upon cleavage by Tld, Dpp-Scw is free to signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wharton and Serpe, 2013</xref>). A second phase of gradient formation involving intracellular positive feedback then refines this initial broad Dpp-Scw gradient into a peak of BMP receptor activation at the dorsal midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang and Ferguson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gavin-Smyth et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Enzymes within the Tld family have a well-characterised domain structure in which the N-terminal protease domain is followed by a series of non-catalytic CUB (Complement-Uegf-BMP1) and EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor-like) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Muir and Greenspan, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Structural analysis of mammalian Tolloids has revealed that both mammalian Tolloid (mTld) and Tolloid-like-1 (Tll-1) form dimers in which the most C-terminal EGF and CUB domains act in a substrate exclusion mechanism to restrict enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2010</xref>). In contrast, the highly active, shorter BMP1 protease is monomeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2009</xref>). Although <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tld possesses a similar domain structure to mTld, previous studies suggest that removing the three most C-terminal domains, to mimic a shorter BMP1-like form, results in a loss of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canty et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, a substrate exclusion mechanism may not exist for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tld. In addition, despite single amino acid mutations in four out of the five CUB domains resulting in some degree of ventralisation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, the requirement for these domains in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tld function is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferguson and Anderson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Childs and O'Connor, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finelli et al., 1994</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05508.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tld.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tld domain organisation.

We propose that the role of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tld CUB domains can be segregated; the most C-terminal domains are necessary for Sog interaction whilst the N-terminal domains manage a novel interaction with Collagen IV that acts to enhance Tld activity. In addition, the Tld-Collagen IV interaction is important for the Tsg enhancement of Sog processing by Tld. We also demonstrate that the need for Tld CUB domains can be bypassed by engineering the Tld–Sog interaction in a highly efficient manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The monomeric structure of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tld</title><p>We investigated the structure of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tld purified from tissue culture cells using Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tld has a maximal particle dimension (D<sub>max</sub>) of 17.7 nm and a radius of gyration (Rg) of 4.6 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>Ab inito</italic> modelling of the most probable shape of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tld gives an elongated monomer with the approximate dimensions 18 × 6.5 × 6.8 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Further detail was extrapolated from the SAXS data on the location of the CUB and EGF domains of Tld by rigid body modelling (RBM). The model retains similar characteristics to the SAXS bead model with the approximate dimensions of 16.6 × 7 × 9.2 nm. An overlay of the <italic>ab inito</italic> model and rigid body model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) shows that Tld displays an elongated conformation with protein curvature around the C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This brings the most C-terminal CUB domains into close proximity to the N-terminal protease domain. Single particle analysis TEM demonstrates that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tld is a monomer, with the overall shape of the 3D reconstruction in agreement with the SAXS model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition to being relatively elongated, the curvature of the EM model mimics that seen in the RBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). However, it is evident that the TEM model is shorter; this suggests flexibility of the most C-terminal regions that is likely to result in loss of information on this region during the averaging procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CUB4 and CUB5 are necessary for substrate interaction</title><p>We investigated the role of individual CUB domains, with particular interest in the most C-terminal CUB domains, CUB4 and CUB5, due to their position within the rigid body model structure. Each domain was independently deleted in full-length Tld and the ability of these variants, as well as the isolated metalloprotease (MP) domain, to cleave Sog substrate was tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Cleavage of Sog by Tld relies on the presence of Dpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marques et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), as such Dpp was added to all in vitro assays. Only ΔCUB2 retained the ability to cleave Sog, although the level of cleavage by ΔCUB2 is lower than full-length Tld (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Additionally, whilst increasing levels of Tsg enhances Tld cleavage of the Sog 50 and 33 kDa fragments, especially the 33 kDa fragment as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shimmi and O'Connor, 2003</xref>), ΔCUB2 mediated cleavage is not enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, while CUB2 is not required for Tld activity, its presence is necessary for Tsg enhancement of cleavage.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05508.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Tld CUB4/5 domains mediate Sog binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of Sog showing the CR domains and the position of the Tld cleavage sites.

Analysis of Sog–Tld interactions reveals that, similar to the isolated protease domain, the CUB4 and CUB5 deletions are unable to interact with Sog, suggesting that these domains mediate Sog interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To determine whether the loss of activity for the ΔCUB4 and ΔCUB5 forms is due to a specific requirement for both CUB4 and CUB5 domains in Sog interaction rather than an issue of protein length, full-length variants of Tld were generated with CUB4 or CUB5 domain duplications at the C-terminus. However, these enzymes are also inactive, demonstrating a specific requirement for the CUB4–CUB5 domain pair at the C-terminus of Tld (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). For the other single CUB deletions, ΔCUB2 interacts with Sog to a similar extent as wildtype Tld even though its activity is reduced and, despite being inactive, the ΔCUB1 and ΔCUB3 forms can bind Sog, albeit at reduced levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These data suggest that a correct protein conformation is important for Tld activity, or that CUB1 and CUB3 mediate a different protein interaction that is important for Sog binding (see later).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Previously identified Tld point mutants affect Sog binding</title><p>Four single amino acid mutations situated within CUB4 or CUB5 have previously been isolated from genetic screens and described in terms of the cuticle phenotype and the strength of genetic interactions with <italic>dpp</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferguson and Anderson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Childs and O'Connor, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finelli et al., 1994</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), yet the molecular basis for the decrease in Tld activity is unclear.

To both validate a direct interaction between Tld and Collagen IV, and determine which domains in Tld are responsible for this interaction, we tested the ability of full-length Tld and the individual CUB domain deletion variants to bind to the NC1 domain of the Viking (Vkg) Collagen IV protein fused to GST. The Collagen IV NC1 domain is a highly conserved globular domain that has been shown to bind Dpp and Sog previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sawala et al., 2012</xref>).

However, removal of the Sog interacting domains, CUB4 and CUB5, has little effect on the Tld-Collagen IV interaction. No interaction with the control GST protein was observed for any of the Tld-HA proteins (data not shown). To test the effect of Collagen IV on Tld and Sog interaction, their binding was investigated in the presence of an increased amount of Collagen IV.

It is likely that soluble Collagen IV, or its cleavage fragments following matrix turnover, are present in the media from transfected cells along with the test proteins. Therefore, to limit Collagen IV levels, test proteins were obtained from transfected cells that were also treated with <italic>vkg</italic> RNAi. Despite this, we expect that the ‘−Collagen IV’ condition will still contain some Collagen IV, and compare this low level to a ‘+Collagen IV’ condition in which the Vkg and Dcg1 NC1 domains were added. The addition of Collagen IV enhances Tld cleavage at both the 50 and 33 kDa sites of Sog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), consistent with increased Sog–Tld interaction in the presence of Collagen IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The addition of Tsg increases Sog cleavage, especially at the 33 kDa site in the presence of Collagen IV. However, the Collagen IV enhancement of Sog processing is reduced in the presence of high levels of Tsg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, little enhancement at either the 50 or 33 kDa site is observed in the presence of Collagen IV when the ΔCUB2 mutant, that is defective in Collagen IV interaction, is tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), Tsg fails to enhance Sog processing by the ΔCUB2 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that Tsg function may depend on a Tld-Collagen IV interaction. These data show that Tld binding to Collagen IV enhances the Sog-Tld interaction and Sog cleavage.</p><p>To extend these findings, we investigated whether the Collagen IV-Sog interaction is also important for Sog processing by Tld. To this end, we made use of a mutant form of Sog, SogCR14*, we have described previously that harbours mutations in the CR1 and CR4 domains of Sog, resulting in very weak binding to Collagen IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sawala et al., 2012</xref>). This mutant Sog is a much poorer substrate for Tld cleavage compared to wildtype Sog, and no enhancement of cleavage in the presence of added Collagen IV is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), contrary to that observed with wildtype Sog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In addition, there is very little of the 33 kDa cleavage fragment, even when Tsg is added in increasing amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that Tsg function requires a Sog-Collagen IV interaction, in addition to a Tld-Collagen IV interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Consistent with SogCR14* being a poorer Tld substrate in vitro, analysis of embryos expressing either wildtype Sog or the SogCR14* double mutant under the control of the <italic>sog</italic> lateral stripe (ls) enhancer reveals that the SogCR14* mutant accumulates to a greater level than the wildtype Sog in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together these data show that binding of both Sog and Tld to Collagen IV is necessary for efficient Sog processing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Tld binding to Collagen IV is important in vivo</title><p>We hypothesised that the role of CUB2 and CUB3 in Collagen IV interaction can be used to explain classical mutations situated in these domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The surface position of these mutations in the CUB2 and CUB3 domains is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>. The mutations were engineered into Tld-HA and we first tested for Collagen IV binding, which is reduced by at least two-fold in all CUB2/3 point mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We next tested the effect of these point mutations on Sog interaction. All Tld mutants show reduced Sog interaction, with the same severity profile as that observed for the defects in Collagen IV binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Di,iii</xref>, cf with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Cii</xref>), consistent with the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> that Collagen IV promotes the Tld–Sog interaction. To show that the effects on Sog interaction are an indirect effect of the Tld mutant proteins being unable to bind Collagen IV, which promotes Sog–Tld binding, we uncoupled the assay from Collagen IV, again using the mutant form of Sog that is defective in Collagen IV binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sawala et al., 2012</xref>). As predicted, Tld binding to this mutant form of Sog is weaker as the Collagen IV enhancement is lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Dii</xref>). However, the four mutant Tld proteins all show equivalent levels of binding to this form of Sog, as that observed for wildtype Tld (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Dii,iii</xref>). These data reveal that the CUB2/3 mutations do not affect Sog interaction per se, but rather disrupt the stimulatory effect observed through Collagen IV. In terms of cleavage activity, the four mutant Tld proteins show reduced cleavage of Sog, especially of the 33 kDa fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), consistent with their reduced ability to bind Sog and the requirement for Collagen IV for Tsg enhancement of processing at the 33 kDa site. Together, these data suggest that the molecular defect underlying the phenotypes associated with the CUB2/3 point mutations is a weak ability to bind Collagen IV.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05508.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Point mutations affect Collagen IV binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of previous data relating to classical <italic>tld</italic> alleles carrying point mutations in the CUB2 and CUB3 domains detailing the single amino acid change, extent of ventralisation and genetic interaction with <italic>dpp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Childs and O'Connor 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finelli et al. 1994</xref>).

To test whether the interaction induced by the leucine zippers is sufficient to rescue the activity of the isolated protease domain, cleavage assays were carried out in cell culture.

Thus, Tld represents the first five CUB domain family member that exists as a monomer, as Tll-1 and mTld have previously been shown to be dimers that exclude Chordin substrate resulting in low catalytic activity towards it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2010</xref>). Thus, whereas the dimeric Tolloids require the affinity of substrate interaction to be higher than the intramolecular affinity within the dimer for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hintze et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2009</xref>), this is not a limitation for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tld. We show that the Tld CUB1-3 domains bind Collagen IV. Consistent with this, recently an interaction has been identified between Collagen IV and the CUB domains of PCPE-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34a">Salza et al., 2014</xref>), and Collagen IV binds the zebrafish G-protein coupled receptor GPR126, via a region containing the CUB domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30a">Paavola et al., 2014</xref>). We also show that Tsg enhancement of Sog processing by Tld is dependent on the Tld-Collagen IV interaction. Finally, we identify a strategy for artificially tethering the Tld MP domain to Sog in vivo, which can rescue BMP gradient formation.</p><p>Based on our findings, we revise the model of BMP gradient formation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holley et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marques et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashe and Levine, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sawala et al., 2012</xref>), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. In addition to Sog and Dpp-Scw, which have been previously shown to bind independently to Collagen IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sawala et al., 2012</xref>), the data presented here show that Tld, via its CUB1-3 domains, also binds to Collagen IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 1). In the model, we suggest that initially there is no interaction between Sog, Dpp-Scw or Tld bound to Collagen IV. However, in the next step, when Dpp-Scw is transferred to Sog from Collagen IV, as has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sawala et al., 2012</xref>), we suggest that Tld is transferred at the same time, interacting with Sog via the Tld CUB4 and CUB5 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 2). Tsg has previously been shown to release Dpp-Scw/Sog from Collagen IV as a Dpp-Scw/Tsg complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), with Tsg recruitment or interaction potentially stabilised by the BMP binding capacity of Tsg's N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oelgeschlager et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, based on the data obtained here, we suggest that in addition Tld is released from Collagen IV at the same time, pre-bound to the shuttling complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 3), and is then able to fully process Sog (step 4).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05508.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of Dpp gradient formation showing the Tld-ECM interaction.</title><p>See text for details.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05508.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05508.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05508-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>The model predicts that the enhancement of Tld cleavage of Sog that we observe in the presence of Collagen IV is due to Collagen IV acting as a scaffold to promote Tld interaction with Sog. We show reduced Collagen IV enhancement of Sog processing in vitro in the presence of high Tsg levels, relative to that detected with lower Tsg levels. As Tsg has been suggested previously to compete with Collagen IV for binding to the SogCR1 domain to release the Sog-BMP complex from Collagen IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sawala et al., 2012</xref>), it is possible that there is little Sog binding to Collagen IV when Tsg is in excess, so the positive effect of Collagen IV is reduced.</p><p>In the model presented, the BMP dependency for Sog cleavage by Tld arises from the requirement for Dpp-Scw to disrupt the SogCR4-Collagen IV interaction as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sawala et al., 2012</xref>), resulting in an ‘opening’ of Sog that facilitates Tld binding. In support of this, we find that Tld is unable to bind to Sog in the absence of Dpp (data not shown). In addition, our mechanism of gradient formation puts the emphasis on a balance between the distance that the Tld-BMP-Sog-Tsg complex diffuses and the rate with which Tld cleavage occurs, rather than on a limitation in terms of Tld recruitment. Although Tld levels are not limiting in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eldar et al., 2002</xref>), it is possible that Tld activity is suboptimal in order to allow sufficient diffusion required for peak gradient formation. Consistent with this idea, mathematical modelling has revealed that lowering Tld processing activity favours a more defined BMP peak, due to an increase in BMP shuttling to the dorsal midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peluso et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, a recent model of BMP shuttling in the sea urchin embryo finds Tld to be a dominant determinant of the system, with reduced levels of Tld relative to the fly system necessary for the best fit to the spatial extent of the BMP signalling peak in sea urchins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van Heijster et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Complete Tld processing of Sog and the role of Tsg</title><p>In the absence of Collagen IV, or the binding of Sog or Tld to it, we observe little Tsg enhancement of Sog cleavage and liberation of the 33 kDa fragment. For example, all of the CUB2/3 point mutants are more severely compromised in their ability to cleave the 33 kDa site, compared to the 50 kDa site. Similarly, we also show that Tld cleavage of a mutant form of Sog, which is defective in Collagen IV interaction, does not release the 33 kDa fragment. As Tsg releases the BMP-Sog-Tld complex from Collagen IV in our model, we suggest that this release involves a remodelling of protein interactions that alters the interaction of Tld with Sog allowing better access to all Sog cleavage sites, but especially the 33 kDa site, which is Tsg-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shimmi and O'Connor, 2003</xref>). Moreover, we speculate that Tld can cleave the 50 kDa Sog site, that does not require Tsg, when the BMP-Sog-Tld complex is bound to Collagen IV, although the dual binding of Tld to Collagen IV and Sog holds Tld in a conformation that prevents both processing at the 33 kDa site and inactivation of Sog, prior to Tsg release. If these assumptions are correct, it follows that cleavage at the 33 kDa site within Sog is necessary for complete loss of Sog inhibition of Dpp-Scw. In support of this, the Sog C-terminal fragments generated by cleavage at the other two sites retain some BMP inhibitory activity when assayed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, complete cleavage of Chordin, the mammalian Sog ortholog, is required for relief of BMP inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Troilo et al., 2014</xref>). We also note that although our zipper system can rescue BMP signalling thresholds in the embryo, cleavage at the 33 kDa equivalent cleavage fragment of the Sog-zipper fusion protein is the preferred site, consistent with cleavage at this site being key to full release of the Sog inhibitory effect.</p><p>In addition, if in <italic>tsg</italic> mutants Tld is unable to completely release the BMP inhibition of Sog, this may explain the only partial rescue of <italic>tsg</italic> mutants by overexpression of Supersog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yu et al., 2000</xref>). Supersog consists mainly of the Sog CR1 domain and has been suggested, like Tsg, to compete with full-length Sog for binding to Collagen IV to release the shuttling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sawala et al., 2012</xref>). However, it may be that incomplete processing of Sog by Tld in the absence of Tsg does not relieve full inhibition of the BMP ligands. Such a role for Tsg would be in addition to the Sog-independent positive role with respect to BMP signalling that has also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang and Ferguson, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Tld domain roles and classical <italic>tld</italic> mutant phenotypes</title><p>The hypothesised roles of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tld CUB domains in both Collagen IV and Sog interaction provide molecular insight into the phenotypes of classical <italic>tld</italic> alleles arising from point mutations in these domains. Mutations in CUB1-2 and CUB4-5 reduce Collagen IV and Sog binding, respectively, resulting in lower levels of Sog cleavage. As the shuttle-transport mechanism relies on cycles of complex diffusion, destruction and reformation, decreased Sog cleavage disrupts formation of the Dpp activity gradient resulting in ventralisation. Our in vitro data show that the CUB2 deletion behaves differently from the CUB2 point mutants in that, although the ΔCUB2 and point mutants all show reduced binding to Collagen IV, unlike the point mutants, the ΔCUB2 mutant remains able to bind Sog, although it cleaves very poorly. We suggest that the ΔCUB2 mutant is conformationally different so it can bind to Sog without prior presentation by Collagen IV, but cleavage is affected, especially of the 33 kDa fragment, and not enhanced by Tsg, which may reflect perturbation of the Tld–Sog interaction, as proposed above.</p><p>The CUB2 point mutant <italic>tld</italic> alleles have been shown to be antimorphic when transheterozygous with either weak <italic>tld</italic> or <italic>dpp</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferguson and Anderson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finelli et al., 1994</xref>). Revertants of these antimorphic mutations have also been identified within the CUB1, 2 and 5 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Childs and O'Connor, 1994</xref>), but as they reduce secretion of the mutant Tld proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), they provide only limited insight into the molecular mechanism of the antimorphic mutants. Nevertheless, based on the finding that <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrate Tld CUB1/2 or CUB4/5 domain pairs can bind BMP4 and BMP7, and inhibit BMP signalling when injected into <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos (with reciprocal inhibition of Tld by BMP interaction), it was proposed that the antimorphic effect of <italic>tld</italic> alleles may be due to an inhibition of Dpp activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). However, the role of the Tld-BMP interaction in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo is not fully understood and only point mutants in the CUB2 or protease domains behave in an antimorphic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferguson and Anderson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finelli et al., 1994</xref>). One possibility is that Tld and Dpp binding to Collagen IV largely prevents a direct Tld–Dpp interaction, but instead favours shuttling complex assembly in the presence of Sog and Tsg. In the absence of Collagen IV binding, the CUB2 point mutants could inhibit Dpp to some extent, further reducing Dpp activity that is already compromised in a background heterozygous for a weak <italic>tld</italic> or <italic>dpp</italic> allele.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Relevance to other Tolloid family members</title><p>The differential specificity of Tolloid non-catalytic domains, and in particular ECM interaction, may be relevant to the fine tuning of Tolloid activity not only during BMP gradient formation in other organisms, but also in a wide range of developmental contexts in general. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, the Chordin/BMP ligand gradient diffuses within the Fibronectin-rich Brachet's cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plouhinec et al., 2013</xref>), and Fibronectin has also been shown to bind to Chordin and BMP1, to enhance the processing of Chordin during DV patterning of vertebrate embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, ONT1, a secreted Olfactomedin-class protein, facilitates Chordin-BMP1 interaction by independently recruiting both proteins, resulting in robust BMP gradient formation during embryonic DV patterning. In addition, for procollagen III processing by BMP1 in the presence of PCPE-1, heparin-like sulphated glycosaminoglycans may act as a scaffold for BMP1 processing of procollagen III in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bekhouche et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, Tld family members may generally rely on a scaffold to facilitate substrate interaction, as proposed here for Collagen IV.</p><p>Using a leucine zipper based interaction system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luan et al., 2006</xref>) we were able to show that artificially tethering the Tld MP domain to Sog is sufficient to support BMP gradient formation. It would be interesting to determine whether tethering the BMP1 protease domain to Chordin can circumvent the requirement for the BMP1 non-catalytic domains in vertebrates. Perhaps this would allow too much turnover of Chordin in vivo given that BMP1 cleavage of Chordin is independent of BMPs. In addition, BMP1 MP domain tethering would prevent interaction with secreted Frizzled-related proteins, which are recruited via the non-catalytic domains of mammalian Tolloids to mediate important further positive and negative control of activity in specific regions of vertebrate embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Muraoka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kobayashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ploper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Robertis and Colozza, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Inomata et al., 2013</xref>). It is interesting that <italic>Drosophila</italic> lacks secreted Frizzled-related proteins, suggesting that ECM control of the Tld-substrate interaction is sufficient for fine control of Tld activity and the resulting Sog and BMP levels in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. This may stem from Tld processing of Sog being BMP-dependent in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a situation that has already been shown to favour the steep BMP gradient required in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peluso et al., 2011</xref>). Given that the leucine zipper system mediates an interaction between two different proteins synthesised in distinct regions of the embryo, we suggest that it will be useful for not only determining sufficiency of other interactions, but also for determining the effect of mediating ectopic or prolonged interactions between other test proteins in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA plasmids</title><p>The Cu-inducible SogCR14*-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sawala et al., 2012</xref>) and Sog-Myc plasmids and pGEX4T1-VkgC have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2008</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. </p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. </p><p>There was a consensus that the data are of high quality, that the problem is important, and that the results are largely convincing. For these reasons, the reviewers believe this paper to be broadly suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. </p><p>The concerns raised are mostly quite minor and/or matters of interpretation to be addressed in the text. Perhaps the two most substantial are the role of Dpp in promoting Sog cleavage, and the explanation of some of the classical mutants. </p><p>Firstly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, in contrast to <italic>Xenopus</italic>, ligand-bound Sog is cleaved more efficiently than free Sog, and this feature is essential for establishing the Dpp activation gradient. When the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are first presented, it is important to emphasize this point, and that Dpp is present in the in vitro assays. It would also be good to demonstrate in their assays that, in the absence of Dpp, the cleavage of Sog by Tld is indeed inefficient. This would lend more credibility to the biological relevance of the assay. </p><p>Secondly, one of the unusual genetic aspects of certain <italic>tld</italic> alleles is that they behave antimorphically with respect to certain <italic>dpp</italic> alleles. The classical interpretation of these antimorphs is that they titrate Dpp into a non-functional complex. This makes sense for the <italic>tld</italic> antimorphic alleles that map to the protease domain since these might still be assembled via Col IV interaction into a non-cleavable complex but the CUB2 antimorphs are a bit more difficult to explain since these should not interact well with Col IV and might be expected not to allow complex formation. The authors appear to argue that for these antimorphic mutations, the complex does not form, and as a result Dpp will remain bound to collagen and thereby be hindered in its movement towards the dorsal most region. It is not clear how this fits with the behavior of the cis-acting revertants of the 10E 95 antimorphic mutations that where isolated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferguson and Anderson (1992)</xref>. Some of these revertants mapped to CUBs1 and2 while others where in CUB5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Childs and O'Connor, 1994</xref>). These all might also be expected to leave Dpp bound to collagen, yet they revert the antimorphic behavior of the 10E95 allele. Some comment about these alleles with respect to the model seems warranted. </p><p>Other issues:</p><p>1) When discussing the possibility of limiting levels of Tld in vivo, the 2002 Eldar et al. paper (which is also authored by Ashe) should be mentioned, where Tld heterozygous backgrounds gave rise to a wt pattern of pMad.</p><p>2) The paper mentions the difference between monomeric <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tld and the dimeric form of Tld in other species, which excludes the substrate. It would be interesting to speculate in the Discussion on how dimeric Tld molecules may be activated and induced to associate with their substrate.</p><p>3) In discussing the (quite complex) overall model, it would be good to make explicit for which aspects there is good evidence, and which elements are more speculative. It is important for a non-specialist reader to be clear about this distinction. </p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05508.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Firstly, in</italic> Drosophila<italic>, in contrast to</italic> Xenopus<italic>, ligand-bound Sog is cleaved more efficiently than free Sog, and this feature is essential for establishing the Dpp activation gradient.
