clinically established to influence male reproductive health, but the impact of normal cellular metabolism on sperm quality is less well-defined. Here we show that impaired mitochondrial proline catabolism, reduces energy-storing flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) levels, alters mitochondrial dynamics toward fusion, and leads to age-related loss of sperm quality (size and activity), which diminishes competitive fitness of the animal. Loss of the 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase enzyme <italic>alh-6</italic> that catalyzes the second step in mitochondrial proline catabolism leads to premature male reproductive senescence. Reducing the expression of the proline catabolism enzyme <italic>alh-6</italic> or FAD biosynthesis pathway genes in the germline is sufficient to recapitulate the sperm-related phenotypes observed in <italic>alh-6</italic> loss-of-function mutants. These sperm-specific defects are suppressed by feeding diets that restore FAD levels. Our results define a cell autonomous role for mitochondrial proline catabolism and FAD homeostasis on sperm function and specify strategies to pharmacologically reverse these defects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>reproduction</kwd><kwd>FAD</kwd><kwd>riboflavin</kwd><kwd>alh-6/ALDH4A1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM109028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Curran</surname><given-names>Sean P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG058610</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Curran</surname><given-names>Sean P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG063947</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Curran</surname><given-names>Sean P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG000037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruter</surname><given-names>Dana L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM118289</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Christian D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000965</institution-id><institution>American Federation for Aging Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yen</surname><given-names>Chia-An</given-names></name><name><surname>Curran</surname><given-names>Sean P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Loss of FAD stemming from cell autonomous defects in mitochondrial proline catabolism impairs sperm quality male reproductive advantage in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As individuals wait longer to have families, reproductive senescence has become an increasingly prudent topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mills et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">LemaÃ®tre and Gaillard, 2017</xref>). Decline in oocyte quality is well-documented with age and can result in fertility issues when older couples try to conceive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baird et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, pregnancies at an older age pose risks for higher incidences of birth defects and miscarriages. In humans, female reproduction ceases at an average age of 41â60, with the onset of menopause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Treloar, 1981</xref>). The <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> âwild typeâ is hermaphroditic and self-fertilizing; however, they are capable of making and maintaining Mendelian ratios of male (sperm-only) animals in their populations. Like humans, <italic>C. elegans</italic> experience a decline in fecundity with age by halting oocyte production at roughly one-third of their lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kadandale and Singson, 2004</xref>). In addition, regulators of reproductive aging, such as insulin/IGF-1 and <italic>sma-</italic>2/TGF-Î² signaling, are conserved regulators of reproductive aging from worms to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luo et al., 2010</xref>). While the majority of studies in reproductive senescence have focused on maternal effects, male factors contribute to a large portion of fertility complications with increasing evidence of an inverse relationship between paternal age and sperm health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">LemaÃ®tre and Gaillard, 2017</xref>). In fact, studies in mammals have shown an age-related decline in sperm quality with increased incidences of DNA damage, reduced motility, abnormal morphology, and decreased semen volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cocuzza et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kidd et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ozkosem et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is an important cofactor that participates in enzymatic redox reactions that are used in cellular metabolism and homeostasis. FAD is synthesized from riboflavin by the concerted actions of FAD synthetase and riboflavin kinase. Like humans, <italic>C. elegans</italic> cannot synthesize riboflavin, and therefore requires dietary intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braeckman, 2009</xref>). Disruption of flavin homeostasis in humans and animal models has been associated with several diseases, including: cardiovascular diseases, cancer, anemia, abnormal fetal development, and neuromuscular and neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barile et al., 2013</xref>); however, the link between FAD homeostasis and fertility is undefined.</p><p>We demonstrate that, although reproductive senescence is generally studied only from the female viewpoint, age-speciï¬c female reproductive success strongly depends on maleâfemale interactions. Thus, a reduction in male fertilization efï¬ciency with increasing age has detrimental consequences for female ï¬tness. Lastly, we call for investigations of the role of environmental conditions on reproductive senescence, which could provide salient insights into the underlying sex-speciï¬c mechanisms of reproductive success.</p><p>Several studies have documented fertility defects in <italic>C. elegans</italic> mitochondrial mutants. Mutation in <italic>nuo-1</italic>, a complex I component of the mitochondria respiratory chain, results in reduced brood size caused by impaired germline development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grad and Lemire, 2004</xref>). Similarly, <italic>clk-1</italic> mutation affects the timing of egg laying, resulting in reduced brood size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jonassen et al., 2002</xref>). Both of these mitochondrial mutations impact fertility, but their role(s) in spermatogenesis are unclear. <italic>alh-6</italic>, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of human <italic>ALDH4A1</italic>, is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial enzyme that functions in the second step of the proline metabolism pathway, converting 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) to glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Frank, 1980</xref>). We previously revealed that <italic>alh-6(lax105)</italic> loss-of-function mutants display altered mitochondrial structure in the muscle accompanied by increased level of ROS in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pang and Curran, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, mutation in <italic>alh-6</italic> results in the activation of SKN-1/NRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pang et al., 2014</xref>), an established regulator of oxidative stress response, likely through the accumulation of toxic P5C disrupting mitochondrial homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pang and Curran, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deuschle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nomura and Takagi, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, SKN-1 was recently shown to respond to accumulation of damaged mitochondria by inducing their biogenesis and degradation through autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palikaras et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we identify a genetic pathway that regulates male reproductive decline stemming from the perturbation of mitochondrial proline metabolism leading to redox imbalance, cofactor depletion, and altered mitochondria dynamics; all of which play a role in sperm dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mutation in mitochondrial <italic>alh-6</italic> results in diet-independent reduction in fertility</title><p>Altered mitochondrial structure and activity have been correlated with sperm dysfunction across different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amaral et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ramalho-Santos and Amaral, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakada et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, proper sperm function requires low levels of ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Lamirande and Gagnon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kodama et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leclerc et al., 1997</xref>), although a specific role for endogenous mitochondrial derived ROS is undefined. ALH-6/ALDH4A1, is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial enzyme that functions in the second step of proline catabolism, converting 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) to glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We anticipated that mutation of <italic>alh-6</italic> may affect the germline, based on our previous assessment of the premature aging phenotypes in somatic cells of <italic>alh-6</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pang and Curran, 2014</xref>). Using an UV-integrated <italic>alh-6::gfp</italic> strain under its endogenous promoter, we saw that ALH-6 localizes to the mitochondria in the germline of both hermaphrodites and males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We then assessed progeny output of <italic>alh-6(lax105)</italic> hermaphrodites fed the standard OP50/<italic>E. coli</italic> B strain diet and found a reduction in self-fertility brood size (â12.9%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since the somatic phenotypes of <italic>alh-6(lax105)</italic> mutants are known to be diet-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pang and Curran, 2014</xref>), we examined self-fertility of animals fed the HT115/<italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 strain diet to determine if the reduced reproductive output is also dependent on the type of bacterial diet ingested. Surprisingly, we found that the self-fertility of <italic>alh-6</italic> animals was markedly reduced (â20.7%), when animals were fed the HT115 diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). <italic>alh-6</italic> mutants have similar timing in their progeny output as compared to wild type animals on both diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Since <italic>alh-6</italic> mutants display normal development and reproductive timing, the progeny deficit is not a result of an attenuated reproductive span which reveals the differential impact of <italic>alh-6</italic> loss in the soma (diet-dependent) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pang and Curran, 2014</xref>) and the germline (diet-independent).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>alh-6</italic> fertility defects are sperm-specific.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Proline catabolism pathway.

It is notable that <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant hermaphrodites lay very few, if any, dead eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that the loss of ALH-6 activity is not lethal. To determine whether the reduced brood size of <italic>alh-6</italic> mutants are due to a general loss of germ cells or a specific defect in oocytes or sperm, we examined the mated-fertility of these animals by mating wild type young adult (day 0â1) males to either wildtype or <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant virgin hermaphrodites (in wild type <italic>C. elegans</italic>, male sperm outcompetes hermaphrodite spermÂ &gt;99% of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ward and Carrel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LaMunyon and Ward, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We found that the reduced fertility in <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant hermaphrodites is fully rescued by wild type sperm, which confirmed that oocyte quality is not impaired but rather, <italic>alh-6</italic> hermaphrodite sperm appears to be dysfunctional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>To better assess the quality of <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant sperm, we compared the ability of <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant male sperm to compete against wild type hermaphrodite sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Singson et al., 1999</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic> wild type animals, male sperm are larger and faster than hermaphrodite sperm, which affords a competitive advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">LaMunyon and Ward, 1998</xref>). To differentiate between progeny resulting from mating and progeny that arise from hermaphrodite self-fertilization, we made use of male animals harboring a GFP transgene such that any cross-progeny will express GFP while progeny that arise from hermaphrodite self-sperm will not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We found that wild type hermaphrodites when mated to <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant males have significantly more self-sperm-derived progeny as compared to those mated to wild type males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This finding indicates a competition deficit of <italic>alh-6</italic> male sperm resulting in this increased proportion of progeny derived from hermaphrodite sperm, which is uncommon after mating has occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ward and Carrel, 1979</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites produce a set amount of sperm exclusively at the L4 developmental stage, before switching exclusively to oogenesis.

To assess whether <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant sperm are generally dysfunctional, we mated older hermaphrodites that had depleted their complement of self-sperm and found that <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant males are able to produce equal numbers of progeny as wild type males when the need for competition with hermaphrodite sperm is abated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>); thus, although <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant sperm are impaired for competition, they remain viable for reproduction. Similarly, older sperm-depleted <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant hermaphrodites produced similar brood sizes when mated to young wild type or <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant males, which further supports a model where sperm, but not oocytes, are defective in <italic>alh-6</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B</xref>).

We reasoned that the temporally controlled phenotypes in the <italic>alh-6</italic> mutants could be leveraged to identify potential mechanisms by which <italic>alh-6</italic> loss drives cellular dysfunction. As SKN-1 is activated in <italic>alh-6</italic> mutants after day 2 of adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pang and Curran, 2014</xref>), we defined genes that display differentially altered expression in the L4 developmental stage, when spermatogenesis occurs, as compared to day three adults (post SKN-1 activation).

Notably, the gene expression changes at these two life periods had distinct transcriptional signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâB</xref>). Because the loss of <italic>alh-6</italic> drives compensatory changes in normal cellular metabolism, which later in life results in the activation of SKN-1, we expected to identify significant changes in both metabolic genes and SKN-1 target genes. Supporting this hypothesis, the Gene Ontology (GO) terms most enriched include oxidoreductases and metabolic enzymes in L4 stage animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and SKN-1-dependent targets such as glutathione metabolism pathway genes in day three adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

In fact, the proline catabolism pathway utilizes multiple cofactors to generate glutamate from proline; PRDH-1 uses FAD as a co-factor to convert proline to P5C while ALH-6 utilizes the reduction of NAD+ to convert P5C to glutamate. Additionally, in the absence of ALH-6, accumulation of P5C, the toxic metabolic intermediate of proline catabolism, drives the expression of pathways to detoxify P5C (oxidoreductases, P5C reductase, etc.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Although enzymes in the proline catabolism pathway utilize FAD as a cofactor, the transcriptional signature of the <italic>alh-6</italic> mutants includes the activation of multiple enzymes that utilize FAD, which drove the hypothesis that FAD levels might be altered in <italic>alh-6</italic> mutants.

The accumulation of sufficient JC-1 molecules required for red emission is abolished by treatment with Carbonyl cyanide <italic>m</italic>-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), a chemical inhibitor of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, a higher red-to-green fluorescence ratio in cells is indicative of healthier mitochondria species and as such, we characterized mitochondria with red JC-1 emission in our analyses of connectivity in spermatids. <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant spermatids have reduced red:green JC-1 fluorescence that indicates a lower mitochondrial membrane potential and an accumulation of unhealthy mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smiley et al., 1991</xref>). Moreover, <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant spermatids have mitochondria that were more interconnected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5CâE</xref>) as compared to wild type spermatids and a similar increase in connectivity was observed when mitochondria were visualized with the membrane potential-dependent mitochondrial dye Mitotracker Red CMXRos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The increase in fused mitochondria in spermatids was also present in animals fed the HT115 diet, which further supports a diet-independent role for <italic>alh-6</italic> in the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>A connection between mitochondrial dynamics (fusion and fission) and FAD homeostasis has not been previously described. To understand this, we perturbed FAD biosynthesis pathway and then examined mitochondrial connectivity in spermatids. We first reduced FAD biosynthesis with RNAi targeting <italic>R10H10.6</italic> or <italic>flad-1</italic>, which resulted in more connected mitochondria that resembles the increased fusion in <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant spermatids that are under metabolic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5GâH</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1EâF</xref>). In addition, increasing FAD levels by dietary supplementation of riboflavin, restored mitochondria in spermatids of <italic>alh-6</italic> animals to more wild-type-like distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), but did not change mitochondrial morphology in WT male spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, the reduction of FAD in <italic>alh-6</italic> mutants, alters mitochondrial dynamics to a more fused and less punctate state. Therefore, the homeostatic control of FAD level is critical to maintain proper mitochondrial dynamics in sperm.</p><p>The role of mitochondrial dynamics in the maturation of sperm has not been studied; however recent work has revealed that the mitochondrial fusion and fission machinery are important for the elimination of paternal mitochondria post-fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). FZO-1 is required for proper fusion of the mitochondrial outer membrane while EAT-3/OPA1 regulates inner membrane fusion. In opposition to the activities of FZO-1 and EAT-3, DRP-1 is required for mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smirnova et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lima et al., 2018</xref>). The balance of this fusion and fission machinery in the upkeep of mitochondrial homeostasis allows cells to respond to changes in metabolic needs and external stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van der Bliek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shaw and Nunnari, 2002</xref>). RNAi of <italic>fzo-1</italic> or <italic>eat-3</italic> reduced mitochondrial fusion in wild-type male sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1E</xref>) and suppressed the enhanced fusion observed in <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant spermatid mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>); indicating mitochondrial fusion of both membranes is active in spermatids with impaired proline catabolism. We next examined spermatids from <italic>drp-1</italic> mutant animals and observed a greater level of mitochondrial fusion as compared to wild type and <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). We also observed a synergistic level of mitochondrial fusion in spermatids derived from <italic>alh-6; drp-1</italic> double mutants. This finding is consistent with previous studies in yeast which reveal that defects in fusion can be compensated for by changes in the rates of fission and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shaw and Nunnari, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van der Bliek et al., 2017</xref>). In support of our model where mitochondrial dynamics act as a major driver of the sperm-specific defects in <italic>alh-6</italic> mutants, we discovered that loss of <italic>drp-1</italic>, which results in increased mitochondrial fusion (like that observed in <italic>alh-6</italic> mutants), also reduces sperm activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>). Moreover, reducing <italic>fzo-1</italic> or <italic>eat-3</italic> does not alter activation in wild type sperm, while <italic>fzo-1</italic> but not <italic>eat-3</italic> RNAi restores activation in <italic>alh-6</italic> sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5NâO</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting increased fusion mediated predominantly by <italic>fzo-1</italic> in <italic>alh-6</italic> sperm mitochondria is impairing proper function. We noted that <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant animals have an increased expression of <italic>fzo-1</italic> transcripts that is suggestive of a retrograde signaling response from the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Taken together, these data support a model where loss of mitochondrial proline catabolism induces mitochondrial stress, activating mitochondrial fusion, in order to dilute damage to preserve functional mitochondria at the cost of sperm function. These data also reveal a functional role for mitochondrial fusion and fission in spermatid development and sperm function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title><italic>alh-6</italic> and FAD are cell autonomous regulators of sperm function</title><p>Signaling between germ and somatic cells can alter function in each cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghazi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curtis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greenwald, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berman and Kenyon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Libina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsin and Kenyon, 1999</xref>).

We found that <italic>alh-6</italic> mutants show a reduction in brood size that is sexually dimorphic; defects in sperm function but not oocytes contribute to reduced hermaphrodite fertility. As societal factors continue to push individuals to wait longer to have children, the increase in paternal age is inversely correlated with proper sperm function and can give rise to fertility issues. Consequently, it is incumbent on future studies to elucidate how restoring and maintaining functional amino acid catabolism during aging in order to promote reproductive success.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of <italic>alh-6</italic> and FAD mediated male reproductive senescence.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52899-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Although <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a well-established organism for studying aging and reproduction, with several studies describing hermaphrodite reproductive senescence, many questions regarding the basis of male reproductive decline remain unanswered. Decades of work have shown that exposure to pollution, toxins, xenobiotics, and other ROS-inducing compounds can prematurely drive the loss of sperm function across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agarwal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wagner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cocuzza et al., 2007</xref>), but the impact that normal cellular metabolism plays on sperm function and the identification of specific molecules that can mediate sperm quality are not well-defined. In this study we characterized a new role for mitochondrial proline catabolism and FAD homeostasis in the maintenance of proper sperm function. Perturbation of this pathway, through mutation of <italic>alh-6/ALDH4A1</italic>, causes metabolic stress. Consequently, this perturbation leads to reduction of cellular FAD level and increases mitochondrial fusion in spermatids, which results in impaired sperm function and premature reproductive senescence.</p><p>Mutation in proline dehydrogenase (<italic>PRODH</italic>) in humans results in hyperprolinemia type I (HPI), while mutation in delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (<italic>ALDH4A1/P5CDH</italic>) results in hyperprolinemia type II (HPII). This study reveals that in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, proline catabolism impacts several functional qualities of male sperm. Loss of proline catabolism results in smaller sperm with impaired activation, two qualities that directly impact competitive advantage. As such, proline biosynthesis, catabolism, and steady state concentrations must be tightly regulated, and the importance of proline in cellular homeostasis may help explain the transcriptional responses measured in animals with dysfunctional <italic>alh-6</italic>. Our data support a cell autonomous role for proline catabolism in sperm. However, although whole animal RNAi of <italic>alh-6</italic> closely phenocopies the <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant including reduced spermatid size, germline specific RNAi of <italic>alh-6</italic> did not significantly reduce the size of spermatids; perhaps suggesting a partial role for ALH-6 in somatic tissues for spermatid development, which is in line with recent studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> describing soma to germline signaling in sperm activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chavez et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, the impact of loss of <italic>alh-6</italic> is mostly independent of diet source, unlike the somatic phenotypes which are diet-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pang and Curran, 2014</xref>). The exception is sperm number in <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant animals on the HT115 diet, which appears to be diet-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). WT males have more spermatids when fed the HT115 diet, as compared to WT animals fed OP50 diet, while <italic>alh-6</italic> mutants have the same number of spermatids on both diets.</p><p>Our previous work defined the age-dependent decline in function of somatic tissues, particularly muscle in animals lacking functional ALH-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pang and Curran, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pang et al., 2014</xref>), which does not manifest until day 3 of adulthood. Our current study reveals that although somatic phenotypes in <italic>alh-6</italic> mutants are observed post-developmentally, the germline, or more specifically spermatids, are sensitive to loss of <italic>alh-6</italic> much earlier in development (phenotypes assayed at L4 or Day 1 of adulthood). Reproductive senescence is a field of growing significance as the number of couples that choose to delay having children increases. Importantly, although <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant sperm are impaired for competition, they remain viable for reproduction. This is similar to recent study on <italic>comp-1,</italic> a mutation which results in context-dependent competition deficit in <italic>C. elegans</italic> sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hansen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have focused on the role of NAD+ metabolism in cellular health, while the impact of FAD has received less attention. FAD levels are diminished in <italic>alh-6</italic> animals specifically at the L4 stage when spermatogenesis is occurring. Riboflavin (Vitamin B<sub>2</sub>) is a precursor to the FAD and FMN cofactors that are needed for metabolic reactions in order to maintain proper cellular function, like proline catabolism and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Despite its importance, humans, like <italic>C. elegans</italic>, lack a riboflavin biosynthetic pathway and therefore require riboflavin from exogenous sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Powers, 2003</xref>). Insufficient intake can lead to impairment of flavin homeostasis, which is associated with cancer, cardiovascular diseases, anemia, neurological disorders, impaired fetal development, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Powers, 2003</xref>). Our study suggests that riboflavin and FAD play critical roles in reproduction, specifically in germ cell development, as loss of FAD biosynthesis or loss of <italic>alh-6</italic> specifically in the germline recapitulates the sperm defects observed in whole animal knockdown or <italic>alh-6</italic> mutation. Importantly, these sperm-specific defects can be corrected by dietary supplementation of vitamin B<sub>2</sub>, which in light of the exceptional conservation of mitochondrial homeostatic pathways, suggest the nutraceutical role vitamin B<sub>2</sub> could play in sperm health across species.</p><p>Our study also demonstrates that spermatids lacking <italic>alh-6</italic> have increased mitochondrial fusion; a perturbation at the mitochondrial organelle structure-level that contributes to the sperm-specific phenotypes observed. In addition to prior work showing <italic>fzo-1/MFN1/MFN2</italic> and <italic>drp-1</italic>/<italic>DRP-1</italic> to be important for mitochondrial elimination post-fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), our work reveals that mitochondrial fission and fusion machinery are present and active in spermatids and that perturbation of these dynamics can affect sperm maturation and competitive fitness. Future work to define how <italic>alh-6</italic> spermatids use mitophagy, which can clear damaged mitochondria, will be of interest. In conclusion, our work identifies proline metabolism as a major metabolic pathway that can impact sperm maturation and male reproductive success. Moreover, these studies identify specific interventions to reverse the redox imbalance, cofactor depletion, and altered mitochondria dynamics, all of which play a part in sperm dysfunction resulting from proline metabolism defects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">N2</td><td><italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center (CGG)</td><td/><td>Laboratory reference strain (wild type)</td></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">SPC321</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440036">24440036</ext-link></td><td/><td>Genotype: <italic>alh-6(lax105)</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">SPC326</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440036">24440036</ext-link></td><td/><td><italic>alh-6p::alh-6::gfp</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">SPC447</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Genotype: <italic>alh-6(lax105);laxEx025(pie-1p::alh-6;myo-2p::rfp;myo-3p::rfp;rab-3p::rfp)</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">SPC455</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Genotype: <italic>alh-6(lax105);laxEx033</italic>(<italic>pie-1p::alh-6;myo-2p::rfp;myo-3p::rfp;rab-3p::rfp)</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">SPC473</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Genotype: <italic>alh-6(lax105);laxEx051</italic>(<italic>pie-1p::alh-6;myo-2p::rfp;myo-3p::rfp;rab-3p::rfp)</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">CL2166</td><td><italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center (CGG)</td><td/><td>Genotype: <italic>gst4-p::gfp</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">SPC223</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440036">24440036</ext-link></td><td/><td>Genotype: <italic>alh-6(lax105);gst-4p::gfp</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">DCL569</td><td><italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center (CGG)</td><td/><td>Genotype: [<italic>mkcSi13</italic>(<italic>sun-1p::rde-1::sun-1</italic> 3'UTR + <italic>unc-119</italic>(+)) II;

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the findings of this study, namely that a perturbation of mitochondrial proline catabolism impairs sperm quality and competitive fitness, are novel and interesting. However, this study falls short of providing mechanistic information to meet the standards for <italic>eLife</italic>. A substantial amount of work needs be conducted to address the concerns raised by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Yen et al. found that perturbation of mitochondrial proline catabolism impairs sperm quality and competitive fitness. The authors showed that loss of function of <italic>alh-6</italic>, encoding a mitochondrial enzyme involved in proline metabolism, leads to oxidative stress, FAD depletion and excess mitochondrial fusion. These pleiotropic defects reduce sperm quality. This study defines a role of mitochondria proline catabolism and FAD homeostasis in sperm functionality and competitive fitness.

The authors showed that loss of function of alh-6, encoding a mitochondrial enzyme involved in proline metabolism, leads to oxidative stress, FAD depletion and excess mitochondrial fusion. These pleiotropic defects reduce sperm quality. This study defines a role of mitochondria proline catabolism and FAD homeostasis in sperm functionality and competitive fitness. Previous studies have proved the importance of mitochondrial activity and ROS in male sperm function. Altered mitochondrial structure and increased level of ROS in alh-6 loss of function mutants has also been shown by the same group.

Instead, in the <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant background, the accumulation of P5C results in a stress response that includes the upregulation of many FAD binding enzymes as shown in Figure 3. It is this overall transcriptional signature that drives the phenotypes associated with <italic>alh-6</italic> loss. In other words, it is the downstream response to the loss of <italic>alh-6</italic>, not simply the loss of this enzyme, that is causal for this reduction in FAD.

Although expression only in somatic tissues (i.e. germline restricted) is technically challenging (to our knowledge there doesnât exist a âsoma-specificâ promoter), we address the reviewerâs comment by utilizing a germline RNAi deficient strain from Carolyn Philips and Gary Ruvkunâs labs, GR1948 â <italic>mut-14(mg464);smut-1(tm1301)</italic> V.

The crossing data (in vivo sperm activation in Figure 1F) are inconsistent to the rest mutant sperm activation data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting the use of Monensin. We have tested Monensin and similar to previous studies we find if to be a poorer activator of spermatids (Ward et al., 1983). Furthermore, it was also shown that spermatids activated by either treatment produces motile spermatozoa (Shakes and Ward, 1989). Nevertheless, we now include our tests of the <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant spermatids with Monensin treatment, which like our previous results with Pronase, display reduced activation compared to WT spermatids. This data can be found in Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D and in the subsection âDefects in mitochondrial proline catabolism impact sperm qualityâ.</p><p>We now also include the assessment of intermediate stages of spermiogenesis. Our previous assessment was very strict, where the observance of âspikesâ and rounded protrusions (Nelson and Ward, 1980; Shakes and Ward, 1989), were both considered not activated. Only the extension of a pseudopod was considered an activated state, noting that the treatment time of 30 min was sufficient for pseudopod formation in ~80% of WT spermatids. We have now further analyzed our data for <italic>alh-6</italic> mutants compared to WT and document the percent of intermediate activation states for both Pronase and Monensin treatments. Intriguingly, there does seem to be a difference in the type of stalled intermediate observed when either Pronase or Monensin is used. While Pronase treatment results in an increase in intermediates with spikes, Monensin treatment results in an increase of protrusions. These new data can be found in Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B, C, and E and in the subsection âDefects in mitochondrial proline catabolism impact sperm qualityâ.</p><p>We believe that the data in Figure 1G (in vivo sperm activation) are consistent with sperm that are not completely abolished for sperm function, but are partially deficient in activation (note that 60% activate) and are simply smaller. The reduction in sperm activation and smaller size of <italic>alh-6</italic> male sperm may lead to disadvantages in competing against WT hermaphrodite sperm. This impairs, but does not abolish the ability to fertilize the next passing oocyte (increase in WT hermaphrodite self-sperm fertilized progeny in those mated to <italic>alh-6</italic> males) as shown in Figure 1F. However, when not forced to compete against hermaphrodite sperm, <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant sperm are competent for fertilization Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A-B. We better explain these result in the subsection â<italic>alh-6</italic> fertility defects are sperm-specificâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) JC-1 staining (Figure 5A-D) was employed extensively in this study to show the mitochondrial fusion or not. This reviewer suggests confirming that with a GFP-tagged mitochondrial protein such as TOM20 to avoid any bias for imaging collection and analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment as it is an important point, which we now explain in text and include additional controls for specificity. JC-1 is the preferred staining method for spermatid mitochondria for several reasons, including:</p><p>1) JC-1 fluorescence (red) is specific for coupled mitochondria with a strong membrane potential (Smiley et al., 1991; Reers et al., 1995, Methods Enzymol.; Di Lisa et al., 1995, J. Physiol.; Cossarizza et al., 1996, Exp. Cell. Res.; Mathur et al., 2000, Cardiovasc. Res.).</p><p>2) We have tested several protein based mitochondria-targeted reporters (made by us and others in the field), but as the reviewer comments above, the transcriptional and translational quiescence of sperm limits the expression of these constructs thus prohibiting their use in quantitative assessments.</p><p>Nevertheless, to address the reviewers concern we now also show that treatment with the mitochondrial specific uncoupler Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) abolishes the JC-1 fluorescence in the red channel, which confirms the mitochondria specificity of this dye. We better clarify in text that we use mitochondria with red JC-1 emission for assessment of connectivity of the healthiest mitochondria with strong membrane potential (subsection âMitochondrial dynamics regulate spermatid functionâ, second paragraph). In addition, we include our data from earlier preliminary studies assessing mitochondrial connectivity with a different mitochondrial specific dye MitoTracker Red (Chen et al., 2003, J. Cell Bio.; Matsuda et al., 2010, J. Cell Bio.; Cottet-Rousselle et al., 2011, Cytometry A.). Although JC-1 is the preferred vital stain, MitoTracker staining results in a similar observation of increased connectivity in <italic>alh-6</italic> mutant sperm mitochondria as compared to wildtype counterpart. Taken together these data confirm the specificity of these dyes in mitochondrial assays as previously established by the field.
