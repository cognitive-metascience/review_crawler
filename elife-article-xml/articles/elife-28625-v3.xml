To identify critical neural ADAR targets in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we performed an unbiased assessment of the effects of ADR-2, the only A-to-I editing enzyme in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, on the neural transcriptome. Development and implementation of publicly available software, <italic>SAILOR,</italic> identified 7361 A-to-I editing events across the neural transcriptome. Intersecting the neural editome with <italic>adr-2</italic> associated gene expression changes, revealed an edited mRNA, <italic>clec-41</italic>, whose neural expression is dependent on deamination.

It encodes the instructions to make proteins and other molecules. To make a protein, a section of DNA known as a gene is used as a template to make molecules known as messenger ribonucleic acids (or mRNAs for short). The message in RNA consists of a series of individual letters, known as nucleotides, that tell the cell how much of a protein should be produced (referred to as gene expression) as well as the specific activities of each protein.</p><p>The letters in mRNAs can be changed in specific cells and at certain points in development through a process known as RNA editing. This process is essential for animals to grow and develop normally and for the brain to work properly. Errors in RNA editing are found in patients suffering from a variety of neuropathological diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, depression and brain tumors. Humans have millions of editing sites that are predicted to affect gene expression. However, many studies of RNA editing have only focused on the changes that alter protein activity.</p><p>The ADAR proteins carry out a specific type of RNA editing in animals. In a microscopic worm known as <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> the loss of an ADAR protein called ADR-2 reduces the ability of the worm to move in response to chemicals, a process known as chemotaxis. Deffit et al. found that loss of ADR-2 affected the expression of over 150 genes in the nervous system of the worm. To identify which letters in the mRNAs were edited in the nervous system, Deffit et al. developed a new publically available software program called SAILOR (software for accurately identifying locations of RNA editing). This program can be used to detect RNA editing in any cell, tissue or organism.</p><p>By combining the experimental and computational approaches, Deffit et al. were able to identify a gene that was edited in normal worms and expressed at lower levels in the mutant worms. Increasing the expression of just this one of gene in the mutant worms restored the worms’ ability to move towards a chemical “scent”.</p><p>Together, these findings suggest that when studying human neuropathological diseases we should consider the effect of RNA editing on the amount of gene expression as well as protein activity. Future work should investigate the importance of RNA editing in controlling gene expression in other diseases including cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA editing</kwd><kwd>ADAR</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>RNA biology</kwd><kwd>post-transcriptional gene regulation</kwd><kwd>inosine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-15-051-RMC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hundley</surname><given-names>Heather A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006975</institution-id><institution>Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deffit</surname><given-names>Sarah N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wheeler</surname><given-names>Emily C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F32GM119257-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deffit</surname><given-names>Sarah N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM00866</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wheeler</surname><given-names>Emily C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HG004659</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yeo</surname><given-names>Gene W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS075449</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yeo</surname><given-names>Gene W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification of tissue-specific RNA editing using a robust, publicly-available platform (<italic>SAILOR</italic>) reveals noncoding A-to-I editing events required for proper gene expression and neurological function, significantly advancing the understanding of how ADARs function in neural cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The complexity of post-transcriptional gene regulation has exponentially expanded in recent years as the repertoire of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in an organism as well as their binding sites have been uncovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castello et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wessels et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beckmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brannan et al., 2016</xref>). However, connecting this information to how different RBPs alter mRNA splicing, stability, as well as translation is only beginning to be elucidated, and likely varies in different cell- and tissue-types as well as during development. <underline>A</underline>denosine <underline>d</underline>e<underline>a</underline>minases that act on <underline>R</underline>NA (ADAR) are RBPs best known for converting adenosine (A) to inosine (I) within double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), including double-stranded regions of transcripts and small RNA precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nishikura, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodman et al., 2012</xref>). Transcriptome-wide identification of A-to-I editing sites from a number of species has indicated that RNA editing is prevalent in animal transcriptomes both in coding and non-coding regions of the genome, but the genomic distribution of these editing sites vary in different organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Savva et al., 2016</xref>). As inosine is a biological mimic of guanosine, A-to-I editing has the potential to affect gene expression by altering coding potential, splice site selection, and/or small RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deffit and Hundley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nishikura, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tajaddod et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, recent studies have shown mammalian ADARs play editing-independent roles through binding to mRNAs and influencing the association of other RBPs on the same target RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anantharaman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bahn et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>One of the primary biological functions of ADARs is to promote proper neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li and Church, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Behm and Öhman, 2016</xref>). The mammalian brain contains the highest level of inosine, and A-to-I editing within coding regions of specific human transcripts, such as ion channels and receptors, alters the physiological properties of the encoded proteins, a requisite for proper neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Paul and Bass, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tariq and Jantsch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rosenthal and Seeburg, 2012</xref>). Consistent with this important role of ADARs in the mammalian nervous system, alterations in ADAR protein levels and editing activity have been observed in human neuropathological diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many cancers, including brain tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mannion et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bajad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tomaselli et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Studies in model organisms provide additional evidence for a critical role for ADARs within the nervous system. Mice lacking <italic>ADAR2</italic> die of epileptic seizures by postnatal day 20 due to under-editing of one adenosine within the coding region of the glutamate receptor, which results in excessive calcium influx and neuronal excitoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higuchi et al., 2000</xref>). Loss of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster ADAR</italic> (<italic>dADAR</italic>) results in severe behavioral abnormalities, including extreme uncoordination, tremors, and a lack of courtship, as well as age-dependent neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Palladino et al., 2000</xref>). Similar to the mouse and fly model organisms, loss of ADARs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> results in abnormal neuronal function as evidenced by defective chemotaxis to a number of volatile chemicals sensed by the AWA and AWC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tonkin et al., 2002</xref>). Loss of <italic>C. elegans</italic> ADARs likely affects the ability of the neurons to sense these chemicals as the chemotaxis defect is less severe with increasing doses of these volatiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tonkin et al., 2002</xref>). To date, the targets responsible for the chemosensory defects of <italic>C. elegans</italic> ADARs remain unknown.</p><p>In the present study, we sought to understand the neurobiological effects of RNA editing in worms by dissecting the neural gene regulatory role of ADR-2, the only A-to-I editing enzyme in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Though multiple studies have used high-throughput sequencing to assess the editome and the role of ADR-2, these studies have been limited to analyzing RNA isolated from whole worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Whipple et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goldstein et al., 2017</xref>). However, a recently developed method utilized chemomechanical disruption of worms followed by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) to obtain cells of interest from whole worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Spencer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaletsky et al., 2016</xref>). By expressing a fluorescent marker in neural cells, we used this method to isolate and sequence the transcriptome of neural cells from wild-type and <italic>adr-2</italic> deficient worms. We performed the first unbiased tissue-specific assessment of RNA editing in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. High-throughput sequencing combined with detection of A-to-I editing events using our newly developed <italic>SAILOR</italic> software revealed over 7300 editing sites in the neural editome.</p><p>Additionally, a differential expression analysis identified 169 genes whose expression was changed upon loss of <italic>adr-2</italic>. To identify potential ADR-2 targets responsible for defects in chemotaxis, our study further focused on genes known to regulate this biological process. Here, <italic>clec-41,</italic> a gene previously found to be important for proper worm locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Simmer et al., 2003</xref>), was found to be expressed and edited within the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) in neural cells. In addition, <italic>clec-41</italic> mRNA transcripts were differentially expressed in neural cells lacking <italic>adr-2</italic>. Strikingly, transgenic expression of <italic>clec-41</italic> in neural cells of <italic>adr-2</italic> deficient worms was sufficient to rescue the aberrant chemotaxis of these animals. Furthermore, expression of a mutant ADR-2 protein incapable of deamination was not sufficient for proper <italic>clec-41</italic> expression or chemotaxis, indicating deamination is required for both gene regulation and chemotaxis. In sum, this is the first study to link noncoding A-to-I editing and altered expression of a specific transcript with a neurological consequence resulting from loss of ADARs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A-to-I editing in the neural system of worms primarily occurs in non-coding regions</title><p>To determine the role of ADR-2 in neural cells, the neural transcriptome of <italic>C. elegans</italic> was isolated from wild-type and <italic>adr-2</italic> deficient worms. To accomplish this, larvae at the first stage of development (L1 larvae) were subjected to chemomechanical disruption followed by FACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Spencer et al., 2014</xref>). Both wild-type and <italic>adr-2(-)</italic> strains express green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by the pan-neural promoter, <italic>rab-3</italic>, that allows for isolation of neural cells. This technique is robust in dissociating the larvae to single cells, while also resulting in mostly live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The FACS profile indicated that 22% of live cells were GFP positive, consistent with the proportion of neural cells in L1 worms (222/558) and similar to previously published studies using this technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Spencer et al., 2014</xref>).

Briefly, strand-specific RNA-seq reads were aligned to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome (ce11) to identify single nucleotide changes between RNA and DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To eliminate possible genomic mutations that mimic A-to-I editing events, known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) contained within Wormbase (WS254) annotations were eliminated. To measure the accuracy of editing events called, a confidence score was assigned using a beta distribution that considers both read depth and editing site percentage at each site. Only sites with a confidence score greater than 99% were considered for downstream analyses.

Combining neural cell isolation with RNA-sequencing and editing site detection with <italic>SAILOR</italic>, we identified over 7300 A-to-I editing sites in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> neural transcriptome, including 104 novel edited genes. In addition to identifying neural editing events, the neural RNA-seq data revealed 169 genes to be misregulated in worms lacking editing. The intersection of these two datasets lead to the identification of <italic>clec-41</italic>, a gene that was expressed three-fold lower in <italic>adr-2(-)</italic> neural cells and whose transcripts contained multiple 3’ UTR editing events. Importantly, using a combination of transgenic worms and chemotaxis assays, we demonstrated that transgenic expression of <italic>clec-41</italic> in neural cells was sufficient to rescue the aberrant chemotaxis of <italic>adr-2</italic> deficient worms and that editing is required for proper <italic>clec-41</italic> expression and chemotaxis.</p><p>Although ADARs play critical roles in editing codons of neuronal transcripts to generate the proteomic diversity needed for proper neuronal function in mammals, our data indicate the aberrant behavioral phenotypes caused by lack of <italic>C. elegans adr-2</italic> are a result of altered neural gene expression rather than recoding events. Consistent with this idea, previous studies indicated that loss of critical components of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, namely <italic>rde-1</italic> or <italic>rde-4</italic>, can restore proper chemotaxis to <italic>adr</italic> mutant worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tonkin and Bass, 2003</xref>). However, previous attempts to identify genes antagonistically regulated by RNAi and ADARs were unable to pinpoint transcripts that underlie the chemotactic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, previous transcriptome-wide studies of gene expression in RNAi mutant worms identified elevated levels of <italic>clec-41</italic> in <italic>dcr-1</italic>, <italic>rde-4</italic> and <italic>rde-1</italic> mutant worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Welker et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, data from our lab has indicated that neural cells from <italic>rde-4(ne299)</italic> mutant worms have increased levels of <italic>clec-41</italic> compared to wildtype worms (unpublished data). Therefore, despite the conserved role of ADARs in regulating proper neurological function and essential roles for A-to-I editing within codons of neurologically important targets in certain organisms, our data indicate studies addressing the role of ADARs in the nervous system need to focus not only on direct editing targets but also on differentially expressed genes. In this regard, our analysis revealed 169 genes to be misregulated in <italic>adr-2(-)</italic> neural cells; however, A-to-I editing was only detected in the transcripts of four of these genes. At present, it is unclear how ADR-2 is regulating expression of these genes. Several recent studies have identified editing-independent mechanisms by which mammalian ADARs promote gene expression by either promoting or inhibiting binding of other RBPs. Specifically, human ADAR1 was shown to promote binding of the mRNA stabilizing RBP, HuR, while human ADAR2 was shown to inhibit the mRNA degrading RBP, poly(A) specific ribonuclease deadenylase (PARN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anantharaman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Future work will test whether the mRNAs with altered expression in <italic>adr-2(-)</italic> neural cells are directly bound by ADR-2 and if this binding alters other RBPs that influence the expression of these targets.</p><p>Our study identified altered expression of <italic>clec-41</italic> as a critical gene regulatory function of ADR-2. Strikingly, restoring <italic>clec-41</italic> expression in neural cells was sufficient to prevent disruptions in chemotaxis in <italic>adr-2(-)</italic> worms. It is currently unclear how CLEC-41, a predicted C-type lectin protein, functions to regulate proper chemotaxis. However, previous studies have determined that <italic>clec-41</italic> is regulated by the Protein Kinase D pathway, and that the DKF-2 B isoform of Protein Kinase D is expressed in ~20 chemosensory neurons, including the AWA and AWC neurons that are responsible for the aberrant chemotaxis defects observed in <italic>adr-2</italic> deficient worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2009</xref>). Future work aimed at determining whether <italic>clec-41</italic> expression is specifically altered in AWA and AWC neurons lacking <italic>adr-2(-)</italic> will be critical to understanding how CLEC-41 contributes to proper chemotaxis. In addition, experiments aimed at understanding the role of specific editing events and cellular factors, including the Protein Kinase D pathway, to regulate <italic>clec-41</italic> expression in neural cells will broaden our understanding of the gene regulatory functions of ADARs.</p><p>This study utilized novel methodology to assess A-to-I RNA editing in a specific tissue and developed a robust platform for easy identification of editing. The <italic>SAILOR</italic> software is publicly available and designed for ease of use to run with one single command, requiring only a BAM-formatted file of the sequence alignments, a FASTA-formatted reference genome sequence (of any organism or cell-type), and a BED-formatted file of known SNPs. Notably, <italic>SAILOR</italic> allows the user to specify a range of filtering criteria including: Non A-to-I mismatch rate, location of mismatches (to account for biases at the end of reads), and a minimum read coverage required to call variants. Users may relax any of these filtering criteria and/or pursue analysis of A-to-I editing sites with lower confidence scores. However, altering these criteria may result in a higher false discovery rate, therefore it is critical to utilize Sanger sequencing to verify a portion of all predicted sites. Our validation by Sanger sequencing revealed 87 additional editing sites not detected using our stringent SAILOR parameters, but either lowering read coverage requirements or decreasing confidence scores to 90% allowed for recovery of 54 of these sites. The complete environment is defined using Common Workflow Language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amstutz et al., 2016</xref>) and packaged inside a Singularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kurtzer et al., 2017</xref>) container. This allows users the flexibility to run the entire workflow on a wide variety of platforms (workstation, cloud or HPC clusters) immediately after downloading the single executable file.</p><p>In sum, this study is the first of its kind in the RNA editing field to span from developing novel methodology for tissue-specific target identification to organismal behavior, significantly advancing our understanding of ADAR functions in neural cells. Our data indicates the necessity of assessing editing and gene expression at a tissue or cell-type specific level. Identification of the edited target <italic>clec-41</italic> as a critical regulator of chemotaxis in ADAR deficient worms would likely not have been possible without the neural-specific identification of gene expression changes as alterations in <italic>clec-41</italic> editing and gene expression were not observed in RNA isolated from <italic>adr</italic> mutant whole worm extracts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm strains and maintenance</title><p>Worm strains were cultured on NGM plates seeded with <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50.

Samtools (v1.3.1) mpileup [-d 1000 -E -I -p -o -f -t DP,DV,DPR,INFO/DPR,DP4,SP] and bcftools (v1.2.1) call [-O -c -A -i -v] were used to pileup and call variants. Variants were further filtered for read coverage (minimum 5 reads after BAQ filtering from bcftools) and ensured that variants are all A-G (T-C in antisense). Variants sharing positions of SNPs contained within Wormbase (WS254) annotations were removed.

Briefly, after washing with IP buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.4]; 70 mM K-Acetate, 5 mM Mg-Acetate, 0.05% NP-40, and 10% glycerol), worms were subjected to 3 J/cm<sup>2</sup> of UV radiation using the Spectrolinker (Spectronics, Westbury, NY) and stored at −80°C. To obtain cell lysates, frozen worms were ground with a mortar and pestle on dry ice. After thawing, the lysate was centrifuged and protein concentration was measured with Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). Five milligrams of extract was added to anti-FLAG magnetic beads (Sigma-Aldrich) that were washed with wash buffer (WB: 0.5 M NaCl, 160 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5]). After incubation for 1 hr at 4°C, the beads were washed with ice-cold WB, resuspended in low-salt WB (0.11 M NaCl), 1 μl RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), and 0.5 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated at 42°C for 15 min to degrade protein and release bound RNA. Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting with a FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). RNA samples were isolated and qRT-PCR was performed as described above.</p><p>The ADR-2 RNA immunoprecipitation was performed in a similar manner as described for the ADR-1 RNA immunoprecipitation, except that a custom antibody to ADR-2 was incubated anti-Rabbit IgG magnetic Dynabeads (Fisher) before incubating with cell lysates. The ADR-2 antibody was produced by Cocalico Biologicals using partially purified ADR-2, which was tagged at the N-terminus with maltose binding protein (MBP) and purified from Hi5 insect cells using an amylose binding column. The amylose-bound MBP-ADR-2 was injected into rabbits for antibody generation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Chemotaxis assay</title><p>Adult worms were used to assess chemotaxis behavior using a method previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kowalski et al., 2014</xref>). 10 μl of 1 M sodium azide was placed at both ends of the plate (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> for location) and allowed to dry. Once dry, 10 μl of ethanol (control) or the chemoattractant diluted in ethanol were placed at either end and allowed to dry. The adult worms were washed 3x in M9 buffer. After the final wash, worms were resuspended in ~200 μl of M9 and 20 μl (50–200 worms per plate) was pipetted onto the center line of the plate. Chemotaxis to benzaldehyde (1:1000 dilution in ethanol) and trimethylthiazole (1:10,000 dilution) after 1 hr at room temperature was assessed and the chemotaxis index was determined using the formula below.

The approximate editing percentage (Column C) based on the frequency of reads with guanosine at that coordinate within unique reads as well as the number of unique reads covering that position (Column D) is listed. The predicted editing site was assigned (described in detail in the methods section) to a genic region (Column E) and a gene (Column F and G). A list of editing sites identified using Sanger sequencing editing assays from mRNAs identified by the bioinformatics pipeline are listed on the second sheet of the excel document (Sanger-seq Verification). Gene-specific reverse transcription followed by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing was used to examine editing events in the indicated genes (Column A). The chromosome number (Column B) and coordinate in ce11 reference genome (Column C) are given for each adenosine to inosine detected as well as the percent editing as determined using the RNA-seq data (Column D). The methods used to detect the A-to-I change was listed (Column D and E) as well as confirmation (yes), decline (no), or inability to accurately determine (ND) the presence of A-to-I editing at a given adenosine.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Brenda Bass (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary: While the genome-wide identification of ADAR RNA editing sites has been reported for multiple organisms and cell types, a tissue-specific analysis of <italic>C. elegans</italic> ADAR editing sites has not been performed. By adapting a previously described method, the authors isolate neural cells of L1-stage <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and using a novel pipeline they developed, define high confidence A-to-I editing sites in WT neural cells. The authors perform similar analyses on <italic>adr-2</italic> animals, which lack all editing, not only to validate editing sites, but also to determine genes that are differentially expressed. While <italic>C. elegans</italic> lacking ADARs were shown many years ago to have chemotaxis defects, the specific gene(s) responsible for this phenotype remains unknown. The authors go through a number of steps, both bioinformatic and experimental, to narrow their focus on differentially-expressed genes that are candidates for mediating the chemotaxis defects, and in the end, come up with a single candidate, the <italic>clec-41</italic> gene. The paper is well written, and the studies are well performed and nicely validated.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers and reviewing editor agree that a number of straightforward transgenic experiments are required to solidify the results of this study:</p><p>1) Rescue experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) need a bit more detail. Expression of <italic>clec-41</italic> in a non-neuronal tissue would be a good control. The <italic>clec-41</italic> mutant should be included in the chemotaxis assays and rescue plasmids should be introduced into the <italic>clec-41</italic> mutant +/- the edited 3'UTR.</p><p>2) The rescue of the chemotaxis defect by expression of <italic>clec-41</italic> is an exciting result, and if true, would constitute a very significance advance to the field. However, to err on the side of caution, the authors should demonstrate the effect requires the open-reading frame of <italic>clec-41</italic>. Another possibility is that a different component of the <italic>Prab-3::clec-41</italic> array is responsible for the rescue of the <italic>adr-2(-)</italic> chemotaxis defects. For instance, RAB-3 has effects on chemotaxis, and an array carrying many copies of its promoter could influence <italic>rab-3</italic> expression and impact chemotaxis. Similarly, it is possible that the repetitive array produces dsRNA that sequesters RNAi factors. If the RNAi pathway is involved in regulating clec-41 expression as the authors suggest in the Discussion, sequestration of RNAi factors could also lead to rescue of chemotaxis. The authors used non-specific DNA to create their arrays, which should preclude this issue, but their transgene contains the <italic>clec-41</italic> 3' UTR, which presumably is double-stranded, and thus could also sequester RNAi factors. A straightforward experiment that would address these issues would be to replace the clec-41 open-reading frame with GFP, while keeping everything else in the array constant. If this negative control does not rescue chemotaxis, it would be definitive proof that CLEC-41 protein is a specific mediator of <italic>adr-2</italic> chemotaxis defects.</p><p>3) The mechanism by which defects in editing of <italic>clec-41</italic> 3'UTR cause reduced expression of <italic>clec-41</italic> are not explored at all. As it stands, the study is primarily an important gene discovery story (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) with one rescue experiment showing that <italic>clec-41</italic> over-expression rescues the chemotaxis defect in <italic>adr-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Their data suggest that editing stabilizes <italic>clec-41</italic> expression in WT versus <italic>adr-2</italic>. A reporter-based system, where the 3'UTR of <italic>clec-41</italic> (+/- edited sites) is appended to GFP and driven more specifically in AWC neurons (e.g. <italic>ceh-36</italic> promoter) in WT and <italic>adr-2</italic> mutant would more directly address the question of 3'UTR involvement.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28625.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Rescue experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) need a bit more detail.

To directly address this, we generated wild-type transgenic worms that express the <italic>clec-41</italic> transcript in the pharyngeal muscle using a <italic>myo-2</italic> promoter. The transgenic worms were then crossed to an <italic>adr-2</italic> mutant and progeny were screened to identify both wild-type and <italic>adr-2(-)</italic> worms expressing <italic>myo-2</italic> promoter driven <italic>clec-41</italic>. Chemotaxis assays were then performed and indicated that <italic>myo-2</italic> driven expression of <italic>clec-41</italic> was not capable of restoring chemotaxis to the <italic>adr-2(-)</italic> worms, suggesting neural specific expression of <italic>clec-41</italic> is required for proper chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We also agree that a good experiment would be to perform the rescue experiments in a <italic>clec-41</italic> mutant background. We obtained the only currently available <italic>clec-41</italic> mutant strain, <italic>clec-41 (tm6722)</italic>, from the Japanese National Bioresource Project; however, this strain was very slow growing and unable to be backcrossed. As backcrossing is necessary to eliminate any other mutations in the background, it is not possible to conduct experiments or interpret data generated using this mutant worm line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The rescue of the chemotaxis defect by expression of clec-41 is an exciting result, and if true, would constitute a very significance advance to the field.

To directly address this concern, we created a worm line where the <italic>clec-41</italic> open-reading frame was replaced with RFP and all other components are similar to the previous array (use of non-specific DNA and the same <italic>rab3p::GFP::unc-54 3’ UTR</italic> coinjection marker). The wild-type worms carrying this transgene were then crossed to <italic>adr-2</italic>(-) worms and the progeny were screened to identify both wild-type and <italic>adr-2(-)</italic> worms expressing <italic>rab3p::RFP::clec-41 3’ UTR.</italic> These worms were subjected to chemotaxis assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The <italic>adr-2(-)</italic> worms expressing <italic>rab3p::RFP::clec-41 3’ UTR</italic> exhibited similar chemotaxis as the <italic>adr-2(-)</italic> worms, indicating that the <italic>clec-41 3’ UTR</italic> was not sufficient to rescue the <italic>adr-2</italic> chemotaxis defects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The mechanism by which defects in editing of clec-41 3'UTR cause reduced expression of clec-41 are not explored at all. As it stands, the study is primarily an important gene discovery story (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) with one rescue experiment showing that clec-41 over-expression rescues the chemotaxis defect in adr-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Their data suggest that editing stabilizes clec-41 expression in WT versus adr-2. A reporter-based system, where the 3'UTR of clec-41 (+/- edited sites) is appended to GFP and driven more specifically in AWC neurons (e.g. ceh-36 promoter) in WT and adr-2 mutant would more directly address the question of 3'UTR involvement.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting to directly assess the effect of editing in regulating <italic>clec-41</italic> expression. To address this, we utilized a worm line with a genomic mutation (G184R) in the deaminase domain of the <italic>adr-2</italic> gene, which results in a glycine amino acid that is conserved across the ADAR family being converted to an arginine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We demonstrated that this worm line lacks A-to-I editing of <italic>clec-41</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Importantly, this decreased editing is not due to a lack of ADR-2 protein binding the <italic>clec-41</italic> transcript in vivo as an ADR-2 RNA immunoprecipitation assay detected similar amounts of <italic>clec-41</italic> transcript in immunoprecipitates from wildtype worm lysates and those from the ADR-2 G184R mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To directly test whether the regulatory effect of ADR-2 on <italic>clec-41</italic> gene expression could be attributed to lack of RNA editing, we examined <italic>clec-41</italic> neural expression in the ADR-2 G184R mutant worm. Similar to the <italic>adr-2(-)</italic> worm line, <italic>clec-41</italic> expression in neural cells was significantly reduced in the ADR-2 G184R mutant line compared to wildtype worms, indicating that deamination is required for proper <italic>clec-41</italic> expression in neural cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We then assessed chemotaxis in the ADR-2 G184R worms and observed a significant decrease in chemotaxis compared to wildtype worms, similar to that of the <italic>adr-2(-)</italic> worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In sum, these data indicate that A-to-I editing is required for <italic>clec-41</italic> expression, which is important for proper chemotaxis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
