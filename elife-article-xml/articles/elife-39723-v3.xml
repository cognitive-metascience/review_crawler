Previous work has implicated a ParA-like protein (hereafter McdA) as important for spatially organizing carboxysomes along the longitudinal axis of the model cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC 7942. Yet, how self-organization of McdA emerges and contributes to carboxysome positioning is unknown. Here, we identify a small protein, termed McdB that localizes to carboxysomes and drives emergent oscillatory patterning of McdA on the nucleoid. Our results demonstrate that McdB directly stimulates McdA ATPase activity and its release from DNA, driving carboxysome-dependent depletion of McdA locally on the nucleoid and promoting directed motion of carboxysomes towards increased concentrations of McdA. We propose that McdA and McdB are a previously unknown class of self-organizing proteins that utilize a Brownian-ratchet mechanism to position carboxysomes in cyanobacteria, rather than a cytoskeletal system. These results have broader implications for understanding spatial organization of protein mega-complexes and organelles in bacteria.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39723.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cyanobacteria are tiny organisms that can harness the energy of the sun to power their cells. Many of the tools required for this complex photosynthetic process are packaged into small compartments inside the cell, the carboxysomes. In <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic>, a cyanobacterium that is shaped like a rod, the carboxysomes are positioned at regular intervals along the length of the cell. This ensures that, when the bacterium splits itself in half to reproduce, both daughter cells have the same number of carboxysomes.</p><p>Researchers know that, in <italic>S. elongatus</italic>, a protein called McdA can oscillate from one end of the cell to the other. This protein is responsible for the carboxysomes being in the right place, and some scientists believe that it helps to create an internal skeleton that anchors and drags the compartments into position.</p><p>Here, MacCready et al. propose another mechanism and, by combining various approaches, identify a new partner for McdA. This protein, called McdB, is present on the carboxysomes. McdB also binds to McdA, which itself attaches to the nucleoid â the region in the cell that contains the DNA. McdB forces McdA to release itself from DNA, causing the protein to reposition itself along the nucleoid. Because McdB attaches to McdA, the carboxysomes then follow suit, constantly seeking the highest concentrations of McdA bound to nearby DNA. Instead of relying on a cellular skeleton, these two proteins can organize themselves on their own using the nucleoid as a scaffold; in turn, they distribute carboxysomes evenly along the length of a cell.</p><p>Plants also obtain their energy from the sun via photosynthesis, but they do not carry carboxysomes. Scientists have tried to introduce these compartments inside plant cells, hoping that it could generate crops with higher yields. Knowing how carboxysomes are organized so they can be passed down from one generation to the next could be important for these experiments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC 7942</kwd><kwd>cyanobacteria</kwd><kwd>carboxysomes</kwd><kwd>protein self-organization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1517241</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Osteryoung</surname><given-names>Katherine W</given-names></name><name><surname>Ducat</surname><given-names>Daniel C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1817478</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vecchiarelli</surname><given-names>Anthony G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006151</institution-id><institution>Basic Energy Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-FG02-91ER20021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ducat</surname><given-names>Daniel C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Carboxysomes, the carbon-fixation machinery of cyanobacteria, are equidistantly-positioned by dynamic gradients of the protein McdA on the nucleoid that emerge through interaction with a previously unidentified carboxysome factor, McdB.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are protein-based organelles that encapsulate specialized metabolic processes inÂ ~20% of all sequenced bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Axen et al., 2014</xref>). Over 23 different classes of BMC are broadly distributed across bacterial phyla, but perhaps the best characterized class are the large (~175 nm) carbon-fixing carboxysomes of cyanobacteria (reviewed here: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rae et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kerfeld and Melnicki, 2016</xref>). Carboxysomes encapsulate the key Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle enzyme, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), and enhance the carbon fixation efficiency of this enzyme by creating a microenvironment that is enriched for CO<sub>2</sub>. Specifically, carboxysomes consist of an outer âshellâ layer that encapsulates both RuBisCO and carbonic anhydrase: the localized conversion of bicarbonate to CO<sub>2</sub> near RuBisCO is thought to greatly reduce its oxygenase activity, thereby suppressing the energetically-costly process of photorespiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rae et al., 2013</xref>). In the model rod-shaped cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC 7942 (hereafter <italic>S. elongatus</italic>), it has been shown that carboxysomes align along the longitudinal axis of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Savage et al., 2010</xref>). This equidistant positioning is thought to promote equal inheritance of carboxysomes to both daughters of a dividing cell, which has been shown to impact cyanobacterial fitness under ambient CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Savage et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rae et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kerfeld and Melnicki, 2016</xref>). Since cyanobacteria contribute to greater than 25% of global carbon-fixation, how carboxysome organization is maintained is of considerable ecological importance. However, the mechanisms used to position any BMC, including carboxysomes, has remained elusive.</p><p>The most comprehensive study of BMC positioning to date showed that a ParA-type ATPase (hereafter McdA - <underline>M</underline>aintenance of <underline>c</underline>arboxysome <underline>d</underline>istribution <underline>A</underline>) displayed oscillatory dynamics in <italic>S. elongatus</italic> and was required for proper positioning of carboxysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Savage et al., 2010</xref>). ParA family members have been most comprehensively studied as factors important for the segregation of genetic material; bacterial chromosomes and low-copy plasmids (reviewed here: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baxter and Funnell, 2014</xref>). Early hypotheses of ParA function favored a cytoskeletal model in which ParA formed filaments that self-assemble into a larger scaffold capableÂ ofÂ segregating genetic cargo, analogous to a primitive mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ringgaard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ptacin et al., 2010</xref>). These models were supported in part by <italic>in vitro</italic> observations of fibrous, long bundled filaments of purified members of the ParA/MinD family of proteins (Reviewed here: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vecchiarelli et al., 2012</xref>). Such filament-based models, combined with the requirement of McdA for carboxysome positioning, led to the prevailing theory that carboxysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Savage et al., 2010</xref>) and other BMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parsons et al., 2010</xref>) could be tethered to a cryptic cytoskeletal element that traverses the cell length and/or exerts positioning forces.</p><p>More recently, filament-based models of ParA have been challenged by experiments utilizing reconstituted cell-free systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hwang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vecchiarelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vecchiarelli et al., 2014</xref>), super-resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Le Gall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lim et al., 2014</xref>), crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang and Schumacher, 2017</xref>), and mathematical modelling approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Le Gall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Surovtsev et al., 2016</xref>). These new data are consistent with a model whereby asymmetric distributions of ParA dimers on the nucleoid drive directed and persistent movement of DNA cargos (e.g. plasmids) towards increased concentrations of ParA via a Brownian-ratchet mechanism that does not require a cytoskeletal element. ParA-mediated DNA segregation via this proposed mechanism requires only three factors: (i) a ParA-type ATPase that dimerizes and non-specifically binds the nucleoid in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leonard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hester and Lutkenhaus, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castaing et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vecchiarelli et al., 2010</xref>), (ii) a partner protein, ParB, that site-specifically binds DNA and stimulates the ATPase activity of ParA to displace it from the nucleoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouet and Funnell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouet et al., 2000</xref>), and (iii) a centromere-like site on the DNA cargo (<italic>parS</italic>) that ParB loads onto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis and Austin, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Funnell, 1988</xref>). In this model, multiple dimers of ParB form a large protein-DNA complex around the <italic>parS</italic> site, which leads to a break in ParA symmetry across the nucleoid due to the formation of local ParA depletion zones around individual ParB-bound cargos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hatano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hwang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vecchiarelli et al., 2014</xref>). In turn, transient ParA-ParB interactions could translate the asymmetrical distribution of ParA across the nucleoid into a directional cue for processive motion of cargo towards the highest local concentration of ParA.</p><p>Despite extensive research into carboxysome biogenesis and organization, as well as efforts to identify the full complement of proteins associated with many BMC classes, the only evidence for an underlying cytoskeletal-mode of BMC organization is indirect. Brownian ratchet-based models are gaining favor within the ParA field, but there is not yet a broad consensus and there is substantial uncertainty as to whether ParA-type ATPases form functional filaments <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wagstaff and LÃ¶we, 2018</xref>). Additionally, no factors suitable to play a role analogous to ParB or <italic>parS</italic> have been identified for McdA, preventing any direct assessment of a putative Brownian ratchet-based mechanism for carboxysomal organization. Therefore, whether McdA acts as part of a ParA-like system or utilizes a unique mechanism has remained an open question. Indeed, several fundamental questions remain unanswered in relation to carboxysome positioning, including: (i) Does McdA form a cytoskeletal structure or follow a Brownian-ratchet mechanism? (ii) Upon what cellular surface does McdA bind in order to processively oscillate from pole-to-pole? (iii) What factors contribute to the emergence of higher-order McdA patterning? (iv) How do oscillations of McdA contribute to carboxysome distribution?</p><p>Here, we identify a novel factor, we term McdB (<underline>M</underline>aintenance of <underline>c</underline>arboxysome <underline>d</underline>istribution protein <underline>B</underline>) that localizes to carboxysomes via interaction with outer shell proteins and regulates carboxysome positioning within the cytosol. While McdB has no identifiable similarities with any known ParB-family members, we find that McdB can directly interact with McdA to stimulate its ATPase activity and release it from DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, and promote its pole-to-pole oscillation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Changes in McdB expression resulted in loss of McdA oscillatory dynamics, loss of equidistant carboxysome positioning and alteration of carboxysome ultrastructure. Although several features of McdAB differ significantly from those of classic ParAB family members, we find that a Brownian ratchet model of localized concentration gradients of McdA on the nucleoid is consistent with our results and may also reconcile past observations of carboxysome positioning. We discuss our results in light of their implications for BMC positioning and biogenesis, as well as the insights that this carboxysome positioning system can provide for a broader class of self-organizing proteins including the ParAB family.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>McdA dynamically patterns along the nucleoid</title><p>In the DNA partition process, ParA-type ATPases successively bind ATP, dimerize, and bind non-specifically to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leonard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hester and Lutkenhaus, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castaing et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vecchiarelli et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, this mechanism establishes the nucleoid as the biological surface upon which directed DNA cargo motion occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hatano and Niki, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sengupta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castaing et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Le Gall et al., 2016</xref>).

However, the ParA family of ATPases contains MinD proteins, which bind membranes, ParA proteins, which bind DNA, and McdA has been broadly hypothesized to form filaments. Therefore, it remained unclear if McdA uses a biological surface to self-organize in the cell or if it forms a free-standing cytoskeletal network as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Savage et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Since a C-terminal GFP fusion of McdA was previously used to observe McdA oscillation and its involvement in carboxysome positioning <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Savage et al., 2010</xref>), we purified McdA-GFP-His and examined its capacity to bind DNA via an Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA). We observed that McdA-GFP-His significantly shifted non-specific DNA (nsDNA) in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To more directly examine the interaction of McdA with DNA, we used Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM) to visualize McdA-GFP-His dynamics upon a DNA-coated surface; a technique that also has sufficient resolution to resolve oligomeric McdA filaments proposed to be involved in carboxysome positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Savage et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yokoo et al., 2015</xref>).

McdA and McdB were able to self-associate in the B2H analysis. Self-association of C-terminally tagged McdA proteins was faint, but confirmed on X-gal plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). We also observed a reciprocal interaction between N-terminally tagged McdA and N-terminally tagged McdB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). However, C-terminally tagged McdB failed to show an interaction with McdA, while C-terminally tagged McdA association with McdB was dependent upon expression conditions. These results suggest that N-terminally tagged McdA only interacts with N-terminally tagged McdB, while C-terminal fusions of either protein partially disrupts function, consistent with our <italic>in vivo</italic> observation of mNG-McdA dynamics in comparison to McdA-mNG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DE</xref>).</p><p>The ParA/MinD family of ATPases are defined by the presence of two lysine residues within their deviant Walker-A motif (KGGXXGKT) required for dimerization, ATP-binding, and ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lutkenhaus, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>S. elongatus</italic> McdA lacks the signature amino terminal lysine residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), suggesting that McdA might have an activity uncharacteristic of proteins from this family. Therefore, we set out to determine if McdA displayed ATPase activity. His-MBP-McdA displayed strong ATPase activity alone, significantly higher (&gt;200 fold) than that of traditional ParA family ATPases SopA of F plasmid and ParA of P1 plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

Relative to the constant specific activity of F SopA-His and P1 ParA with increasing protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), the specific ATPase activity of His-MBP-McdA declined at higher protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). This decrease in ATPase activity was not due to substrate limitation during the course of the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, as ATP was provided in excess, but could be indicative of a regulatory mechanism or product inhibition that is not characteristic of traditional ParA family members.</p><p>ParB partners stimulate the ATPase activity of their cognate ParA synergistically with nsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouet and Funnell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouet et al., 2000</xref>).

When adding only nsDNA or McdB-His to the reactions, we observed very mild stimulation of His-MBP-McdA ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). When both nsDNA and McdB-His were added simultaneously, the ATPase activity of His-MBP-McdA was further stimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1G</xref>).

As shown previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), with ATP present, non-specific DNA fragments exhibit slowed mobility in the presence of increasing concentrations of purified His-MBP-McdA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Conversely, when the experiment was conducted with a constant concentration of His-MBP-McdA (2.5 ÂµM), the shift in DNA mobility was reversed by addition of increasing amounts of McdB-His (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). This demonstrates that McdB favors the release of McdA from DNA. McdB-His alone did not exhibit any DNA binding activity in our gel shift assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>).

CcmK2 is the dominant shell protein that composes the facets of the shell, and which has been shown to directly interact with CcmN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kinney et al., 2012</xref>). Along with CcmK2, proteins CcmO, CcmL, CcmK3, CcmK4, and CcmP are also recruited to complete compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tanaka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rae et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2013</xref>), although the relative arrangement of these structural components of the shell remains uncertain. We explored if the outer shell proteins of the carboxysome could be involved in recruiting McdB through a bacterial two-hybrid screen. Using N- or C-terminally tagged McdA or McdB as bait, the assay suggested only N-terminally tagged McdB interacts with the shell proteins CcmK2, CcmK3, CcmK4, CcmL, and CcmO, but not CcmP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>).

But in <italic>S. elongatus</italic>, carboxysome copy-number correlates with cell length and ranges between 3 to 15 copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). How multiple carboxysomes are equally spaced along the cell-length by a global oscillation of McdA protein is not intuitively obvious. Therefore, we wished to determine if McdB-bound carboxysomes also cause similar local depletions of McdA on the nucleoid and whether oscillation of McdA was a requirement for carboxysome motion and equidistant positioning, even at low-copy numbers.</p><p>In time-lapse experiments of mNG-McdA and RbcS-mTQ strains, we frequently observed that carboxysomes move towards the highest local concentration of McdA on the nucleoid; this was especially apparent as the wavefront of the oscillating McdA pool approaches carboxysomes (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>). The most rapid directed motions of carboxysomes were visible as the wavefront approaches a carboxysome, and then as the wavefront passes. To explore this observation in more depth, we developed the ability to regulate the initiation of carboxysome formation as well as to modulate the number of carboxysomes per cell. To accomplish this, we replaced the native <italic>ccmK2</italic> promoter with a Ptrc promoter lacking the <italic>lacI</italic> repressor and attached a 5â synthetic riboswitch preceding <italic>ccmK2</italic> (RS::<italic>ccmK2LMNO;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In the absence of inducer, genes regulated by this riboswitch are tightly off, and expression is highly tunable with increasing concentrations of theophylline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nakahira et al., 2013</xref>). In the absence of theophylline, we observed that RbcS-mTQ signal was diffuse and mNG-McdA was distributed homogenously along the nucleoid (â¥99% of cells; nÂ =Â 204 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1H</xref>), consistent with our prior results from â<italic>ccmK2LMNO</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">FigureÂ 3I</xref>). When these strains were induced with either 400 ÂµM or 600 ÂµM theophylline, we were able to generate on average one or two carboxysomes per cell, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6BC</xref>). In the presence of 1 carboxysome, mNG-McdA signal remained evenly distributed except for a depletion zone that correlated with the nucleoid region in the vicinity of the carboxysome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Likewise, with two carboxysomes, mNG-McdA signal again distributed along the nucleoid but was depleted in areas correlating to carboxysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In either case, mNG-McdA signal was highly reduced in areas of RbcS-mTQ signal (â¥99% of cells; PCCÂ =Â 0.20; nÂ =Â 391 cells), indicating McdB-bound carboxysomes have mNG-McdA depleted in their vicinity. In this strain, we performed real-time imaging of mNG-McdA dynamics and RbcS-mTQ motion. In instances where cells contained two, closely spaced carboxysomes, one carboxysome could be clearly observed to move in the direction of the higher McdA concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). When a sufficient distance was reached between the two carboxysomes, mNG-McdA was re-recruited to the depleted nucleoid region between the two carboxysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). As mNG-McdA rebound the nucleoid, movement of the centralized carboxysome halted and slightly regressed back in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

Even at relatively high concentrations of theophylline inducer, our synthetic riboswitch was unable to generate wildtype quantities of carboxysomes.

This promoter is generally capable of driving higher expression levels of gene targets. In the absence of Isopropyl Î²-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), some carboxysome formation was observed due to leaky expression of the Ptrc promoter in cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Similar to prior results, mNG-McdA was depleted in the vicinity of carboxysomes (â¥99% of cells; nÂ =Â 453 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Following induction with IPTG, multiple carboxysomes formed throughout cells and mNG-McdA oscillations emerged (â¥99% of cells; nÂ =Â 439 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Altogether, these experiments strongly indicate that McdB is concentrated upon carboxysomes and that this localized pool of McdB changes the dynamics of McdA bound to neighboring regions of the nucleoid. Under conditions where there are relatively few (1-3) carboxysomes, McdB appears to continuously stimulate the release of nearby McdA. It is only at higher numbers of carboxysomes (4+) when a self-organized oscillation of McdA from end-to-end of the nucleoid emerges. Moreover, we observe multiple instances of directed motion of carboxysomes towards increased McdA concentrations on the nucleoid, consistent with the Brownian-ratchet model of cargo movement.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Carboxysomes are hexagonally arranged when crowded on a nucleoid</title><p>Carboxysomes are frequently described as being linearly arranged along the longitudinal axis of <italic>S. elongatus</italic>.

Instead, carboxysomes displayed a hexagonal packing phenomenon where the linear arrangement along the longitudinal axis looked kinked or displayed a zig-zag pattern. The hexagonal packing arrangement is non-intuitive assuming carboxysome distribution were to be based solely on either an underlying cytoskeleton or McdA oscillations, as these features are oriented longitudinally to the cell. Hexagonal packing was typically correlated with cells that had a high number of carboxysomes relative to the cellâs length. However, it is difficult to ascertain if this different packing arrangement is due solely to carboxysome number, or any number of other factors that could be differentially regulated between distinct cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39723.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>McdAB accounts for linear and hexagonal packing of carboxysomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In a field of <italic>S.Â elongatus</italic> cells, carboxysomes are found in either a linear (yellow arrow) or hexagonal (blue arrow) arrangement.

One targeted method to increase cell length is to overexpress the FtsZ regulatory protein Cdv3, which we have previously reported to cause division arrest and subsequent cell elongation up to 2 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jordan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">MacCready et al., 2017</xref>). In cells elongated by this method, we observed both linear and hexagonal carboxysome packing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), sometimes observing different packing arrangements on neighboring nucleoid clusters within the same cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Carboxysomes in hyperelongated cells always co-localized with a nucleoid cluster, as visualized by DAPI staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), and were never observed in the gaps between clusters, consistent with a role for McdAB in tethering carboxysomes to DNA.

Because cells containing both linear and hexagonal packing arrangements share the same cytosol, it is unlikely that the carboxysome packing is regulated by a global change within a cell (such as a diffusible factor). Instead, we found once again that the hexagonal packing was typically observed when the number of carboxysomes were higher on a given nucleoid cluster. These results suggest that carboxysome packing arrangement may be a self-emergent property related to the density of carboxysomes on a given nucleoid surface area.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>The Brownian-ratchet model is sufficient to explain carboxysome distributions</title><p>To assess if the Brownian-ratchet model of carboxysome positioning could account for both carboxysome spacing and patterning (i.e. linear vs. hexagonal), we turned to an established <italic>in silico</italic> mathematical model that has successfully described several aspects of the Brownian-ratchet mechanism for ParA-mediated partitioning of plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). Since we have yet to determine which biochemical parameters of the Mcd system differ from that of traditional Par systems, in this treatment, we simply increased the number of cargo copies on the nucleoid matrix while keeping all other biochemical parameters as previously described so as to determine if increasing cargo copy number is enough to convert linear positioning into hexagonal packing. We programmed the geometry of the nucleoid surface area (2.5 Âµm by 0.6 Âµm rounded rectangle) and carboxysome cargo (175 nm) based off of previously measured values of wildtype <italic>S. elongatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rae et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murata et al., 2016</xref>). All simulations are initiated with tightly clustered carboxysomes near the center of the nucleoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; left images), but carboxysomes are allowed to travel towards the highest gradient of McdA using the previously-established parameter values.</p><p>With the Brownian-ratchet model, five or less carboxysomes will linearly distribute on a rectangular surface representative of <italic>S. elongatusâ</italic> nucleoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). As cargo number increases the linear arrangement is maintained, but with tighter spacing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7CD</xref>). However, above a certain density threshold (six or more cargos on the same nucleoid under our simulation parameters), cargo positioning switches from a linear arrangement to hexagonal packing, reminiscent of the <italic>in vivo</italic> distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7ABCD</xref>). This change in packing arrangement can be understood if each carboxysome is independently seeking the highest local concentration of McdA on the nucleoid: as carboxysome density increases, a staggered conformation maintains the maximal nearest-neighbor distance. As many other cyanobacterial species exhibit spherical morphology, including the model <italic>Synechocystis sp.

Largely influenced by models for DNA segregation by ParA-type ATPases at the time, the observation that C-terminally tagged McdA (McdA-GFP) oscillated <italic>in vivo</italic> and that carboxysomes were mispositioned following the disruption of McdA or MreB (an actin-related component of the cytoskeleton) led to a widely-adopted hypothesis that carboxysomes were positioned by a cytoskeletal mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Savage et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rae et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yokoo et al., 2015</xref>).

We show multiple lines of evidence indicating that McdA is capable of binding DNA in an ATP-dependent manner, and that the bulk of McdA in <italic>S. elongatus</italic> is concentrated upon the nucleoid. Furthermore, we identify a novel protein, McdB, that interacts with McdA, stimulating its intrinsic ATPase activity and release from the nucleoid. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that McdA does not form independently-standing filaments, but instead attaches to the nucleoid body at the center of the cell, using it as a scaffolding surface to support an oscillating wave from one end of the cell to the other. We provide evidence that carboxysomes are in turn tethered to the nucleoid through interactions with McdB, that in turn can bind McdA. Our results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of McdA, and extend upon the limited characterization in the literature of this unusual ParA-family member. While we confirm that McdA can oscillate <italic>in vivo</italic> as was previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Savage et al., 2010</xref>), we observe oscillatory waves that traverse the cell withinÂ ~10 min, which is significantly faster than that reported for McdA-GFP. The discrepancy may be related to the use of C-terminally tagged McdA reporters, which we find are unable to interact effectively with McdB and was originally over-expressed in a background with an additional endogenous copy of McdA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Savage et al., 2010</xref>). We observe activities for McdA (tagged on either terminus) that are consistent with other ParA family members, including ATP-dependent DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), self-association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), and DNA stimulated ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). However, we also observe key distinctions between McdA and more canonical family members (see below), which may be important in the adaption of this system for the segregation of large protein cargos.</p><p>Importantly, we do not find any direct evidence supporting filament formation by McdA. Using high-resolution imaging techniques, we observe McdA-GFP to coat evenly across DNA in a carpeted flowcell, without any indication of large oligomer formation. While we cannot exclude the possibility that McdA-GFP fusions are disrupted in their capacity to form filaments, we note that this fusion retains many of its characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Furthermore, our data suggests that the morphology of the cyanobacterial nucleoid is important for carboxysome positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2JK</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), which could also explain why Î<italic>mreB</italic> mutants exhibit disorganized carboxysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Savage et al., 2010</xref>). Both cell morphology and nucleoid topology are grossly altered in <italic>ÎmreB</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that the influence of MreB in carboxysome positioning is likely indirect. Instead, our results support an alternative model for McdA in carboxysome positioning that does not require an underlying cytoskeleton and which utilizes a Brownian-ratchet based mechanism (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A unique system for distributing protein-based bacterial organelles</title><p>Our model of self-organized carboxysome positioning is both informed by the ParA-based mechanisms used to segregate low-copy number plasmids, but also provides a novel platform to study the dynamics of self-organized protein segregation systems. Low-copy plasmids often contain DNA regions (e.g. <italic>parS</italic>) that bind ParB, which drives the directed and persistent movement of plasmids towards increased concentrations of ParA on the nucleoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vecchiarelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Le Gall et al., 2016</xref>). In this way, it is proposed that ParA can provide a positional cue allowing plasmid cargo to âsurfâ along the larger bacterial chromosome without a separate cytoskeletal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vecchiarelli et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>While conceptual similarities exist between the better-established systems for plasmid positioning and results we report here for carboxysome positioning, a number of key distinctions separate McdAB from ParAB models. First, <italic>S. elongatus</italic>â McdA lacks the signature lysine residue in the Walker A box that defines the ParA family of ATPases (<bold><underline>K</underline></bold>GGXXGT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The serine substitution in McdA at a position universally conserved in ParA members may underlie the unusually high ATPase activity of McdA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), which displays a maximum specific activity that is roughly two-orders of magnitude greater than that of other well-studied ParA systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vecchiarelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ah-Seng et al., 2009</xref>). McdB is an even more divergent protein, bearing no identifiable sequence similarity to any known ParB proteins; indeed, no homologous proteins have been characterized in other species. This novel protein also recognizes and binds a large protein-based cargo (carboxysomes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 3C,F,H</xref>),Â further distinguishing it from all characterized ParB-like proteins that recognize genetic cargo. Even though McdB and ParB share no similarity, we find that McdB: (i) interacts with McdA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), (ii) stimulates McdA ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) (iii) removes McdA from DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), and (iv) is responsible for emergent dynamics of McdA along the nucleoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>); analogous to the roles played by ParB in well-characterized plasmid partitioning systems. Furthermore, we observe that a pool of McdB enriched at the carboxysome is necessary to locally deplete McdA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6BâD</xref>), suggesting that prolonged McdB activity may stimulate the local release of McdA from the nucleoid. We propose that McdB is therefore acting to interface carboxysomes with nucleoid-bound McdA, processively pulling this protein cargo towards the highest local McdA concentration, and thereupon stimulating McdA ATPase activity and release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>). The parallels between features of the McdAB system and Brownian ratchet ParAB models make it tempting to speculate that McdB has a distinct evolutionary origin from ParB-family members, but that these independent protein families convergently evolved to use nucleoid gradients of ParA-like proteins to segregate entirely different classes of macromolecular structures.</p><p>The colocalization of signal between mNG-McdB and carboxysomes (RbcS-mTQ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), coupled with the carboxysome requirement for providing site-specificity to mNG-McdB <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), provide strong evidence that McdB is associating with carboxysomes and that this interaction is needed for emergent dynamics of McdA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). It is curious that McdB is able to associate with a number of different shell proteins in our B2H assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Taken together with the evidence that a McdB homolog from <italic>G. kilaueensis</italic> JS1 with low sequence-identity still concentrated upon <italic>S. elongatus</italic> carboxysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), the most parsimonious hypothesis is that McdB-carboxysome shell interactions are mediated by structural and/or charge features common to many distinct shell proteins. Indeed, evolutionarily distant hexameric shell proteins of the bacterial microcompartment (BMC-H) family share a number of similarities in structural features and key residues at hexamer interfaces that are largely conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sommer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Young et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests some of these common structural features could be important in mediating interactions with McdB, which might explain why McdB displays an interaction with different shell protein paralogs. Our B2H analysis also indicates that McdB may have a higher affinity to some shell proteins (CcmK2 and CcmK3) than others (CcmK4, CcmL and CcmO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This may be related to the observation of clustered carboxysomes in â<italic>ccmK3-4</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rae et al., 2012</xref>), as this may reduce the amount of McdB recruited to the carboxysome surface. We note however, that given McdBâs poor sequence conservation and without further knowledge of the structure and interaction domains of McdB, we cannot rule out that McdB is a 'sticky' protein by the B2H assay and is instead recruited through an alternative adaptor protein to the vicinity of carboxysomes. Moreover, deleting individual shell components, such as CcmK2, CcmL or CcmO, prevents mature carboxysomes formation and subsequent biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cameron et al., 2013</xref>), preventing <italic>in vivo</italic> testing of McdB/carboxysomes interaction. Additional experiments will be required to identify the domain(s) that mediate McdB-shell interaction, and without aÂ more detailed analysis, it remains possible that McdB can directly integrate within the shell of mature carboxysomes. Some indirect evidence would argue against the possibility that McdB is an integral shell protein, including both our observation that <italic>âmcdB</italic> strains did not possess a high CO2-requiring phenotype and McdB has not been identified in previously-published carboxysome purification studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Faulkner et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>McdA oscillations are a consequence of multiple carboxysomes sharing the same nucleoid in a rod-shaped cell</title><p>One surprising result of our study was that we observed that both McdB and carboxysomes themselves were required for the emergence of McdA oscillations along the nucleoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>,Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3HI</xref>). Furthermore, a critical threshold number of carboxysomes were required to be localized on the same nucleoid in order for McdA oscillation to ensue (generallyÂ &gt;3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This suggests that it is not sufficient for McdB to be merely present, it must be specifically localized, concentrated, and/or activated to promote the McdA oscillations. Furthermore, we note that McdA oscillation per se is not required to segregate one carboxysome from another. In cells where we induced the formation of only two carboxysomes, or in cells were the P<sub>trc</sub> promoter was leaky, these carboxysomes reliably separated from one another despite the fact that no McdA oscillations were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6DF</xref>). Likewise, our Brownian-Rachet simulations were able to recapitulate the separation between carboxysomes <italic>in silico</italic> without any requirement for an oscillating pool of McdA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7CDEF</xref>).</p><p>These results could suggest that âglobalâ McdA oscillations have a secondary role in regulating carboxysome positioning relative to the influence of local gradients of McdA on the nucleoid, and also raise other questions related to how McdA oscillations emerge. One possibility is that McdA oscillation itself might be a byproduct of the motion of multiple carboxysomes removing McdA along the nucleoid. Indeed, such a model has been proposed for plasmid segregation, termed âDNA relayâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Surovtsev et al., 2016</xref>), where the plasmids recruit ParB to form cargo complexes that themselves oscillate from pole-to-pole in the cell, removing nucleoid-bound ParA in their wake. In the DNA relay model, the long-range motion of the cargo itself drives the emergent oscillation of ParA. Our simultaneous imaging of carboxysomes and McdA dynamics precludes such a model that would require long-range cargo movement (carboxysomes move much shorter distances and over longer time scales than the McdA oscillatory wave), but we cannot rule out more subtle carboxysome motions being involved in the emergence of McdA oscillations. The dynamics of carboxysome motion are complex at rapid time scales and are responsive to McdA wavefronts. During McdA oscillation, we observed that some carboxysomes at the wave front paused, and in some cases, were observed to get sucked into the approaching wave (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>). While in the wave, carboxysome diffusion was suppressed. As the wave passed, carboxysome diffusion was anisotropic, drifting in the direction of the wave. Away from the wave, carboxysome diffusion was isotropic. An alternative hypothesis is that the global dynamics of McdA oscillation are dependent upon a balanced level of activities between McdA and McdB. In this case, recruitment of soluble McdB to a defined location (the carboxysome) may concurrently act to remove it from the bulk cytosol, reducing the concentration that McdA perceives when not near a carboxysome. There is precedence for this interpretation in the ParA-like family of proteins, including the oscillatory behaviors of MinD and MinE. MinD binds to the plasma membrane when bound to ATP and exhibits an emergent pole-to-pole localization that is driven by the ATPase-stimulating activities of the partner protein MinE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lutkenhaus, 2007</xref>). The ratio of these activities is important for their higher-order behaviors and when MinD:MinE ratios become severely unbalanced, oscillatory patterns collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fange and Elf, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Loose et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Loose et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zieske and Schwille, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vecchiarelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">MacCready et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>It is intriguing to speculate whether McdA would oscillate in cyanobacteria displaying different morphologies, such as the spherical <italic>Synechocystis sp.</italic> 6803 or the filamentous <italic>Fremyella diplosiphon</italic>. While carboxysomes in these organisms are equidistantly spaced, they display a packing more reminiscent of the hexagonal arrangement rather than a linear distribution (<italic>e.g.,</italic> see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kerfeld et al., 2005</xref>; <italic>e.g.,</italic> see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Montgomery, 2015</xref>). Our modeling suggests that this could be a natural outcome of the McdAB system operating on a nucleoid topology that is more spherical, rather than rod-shaped. While McdA oscillation could still be possible, it is unclear what patterns would be expected. Further analysis of McdAB dynamics in other cyanobacteria is required to elucidate the effects of nucleoid morphology on McdA pattern formation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>McdA and McdB may facilitate biogenesis and regulate carboxysome size</title><p>Our analysis provides a number of lines of evidence to suggest that McdA and McdB activities can also influence the ultrastructure of carboxysomes in <italic>S. elongatus</italic>. Cyanobacterial strains that are genetic knockouts of <italic>mcdB</italic> display carboxysomes that are significantly enlarged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1AD</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of McdB resulted in massive carboxysome globules that sometimes spanned the entire short axis of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1AG</xref>), while overexpression of McdA resulted in irregularly-shaped carboxysomes with rounded edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1AF</xref>). While we cannot rule out the possibility of indirect effects, it is intriguing to speculate that McdA and McdB may act to directly regulate the size or shape of microcompartments as they are formed. In <italic>S. elongatus</italic>, it has been suggested that new carboxysomes bud off from existing carboxysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cameron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Our model for carboxysome positioning requires that the interaction of McdB with McdA provide a pulling force exerted on the carboxysome shell that acts to processively move the protein compartment up an McdA gradient. It is therefore possible that these same molecular forces act during the synthesis of a new carboxysome. The relative ratio between McdA and McdB activities may play a role in the differences in carboxysome sizes observed under different environmental conditions or within different species. Future research will be required to confirm the role of McdAB systems in regulating the size of protein-based organelles.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>The McdAB system in other organisms</title><p>Carboxysomes exist in two distinct forms, Î± and Î², depending on the form of RuBisCO they encapsulate.

The camera settings were digitizer, 3 MHz (14-bit gray scale); preamplifier gain, 5.2; vertical shift speed, 2 MHz; vertical clock range: normal, electron-multiplying gain 40, EM CCD temperature set at â98Â°C, baseline clamp ON, exposure time 100 ms, frame rate 0.5 Hz. The baseline of â¼100 camera units was subtracted from the intensity data. The excitation for McdA-GFP-His was provided by 488 nm diode-pumped solid-state (Sapphire, Coherent) laser. Total internal reflection fluorescence illumination had a Gaussian shape in the field of view with measured horizontal and vertical half maximum widths of â¼65 Î¼mÂ ÃÂ 172 Î¼m at 488 nm. Intensity data for the DNA carpet-bound populations of McdA-GFP were taken from the middle of the illumination profile. The laser power of 488 nm illumination was 15 Î¼W. Metamorph seven software (Molecular Devices) was used for camera control and image acquisition. ImageJ was used for analysis. The display brightness and contrast were set to the same levels for all TIRFM movies. ImageJ was used for conversion of Metamorph movies (.stk) into. avi format and Adobe Premiere was used for added text. Movie accelerations are indicated in the movie and figure legends.</p><p>McdA-GFP (0.5 Î¼M) was preincubated in McdA Buffer [50 mM Hepes (pH 7.6), 100 mM KCl, 10% (vol/vol) glycerol, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/mL Î±-casein, 0.6 mg/mL ascorbic acid] with 1 mM of the indicated nucleotide (or no nucleotide). The sample was incubated for 15 min in a 1 ml syringe connected to one of the two inlets of a Y-shaped flowcell. The sample was infused onto the DNA carpet at a rate of 20 Î¼L/min. The fluorescence intensity of McdA-GFP that bound the DNA carpet was measured over time. At tÂ =Â 3 min, flow from the sample inlet was stopped and immediately switched to the second inlet that was connected to a wash buffer (McdA Buffer without McdA-GFP or nucleotide). Wash buffer was flowed at a rate of 20 Î¼L/min, and the decrease in fluorescence intensity was monitored over time. The two-inlet flowcell had a Y-patterned configuration and imaging took place at the point of flow convergence to minimize the effect of protein rebinding to the DNA carpet during dissociation when flow was switched to the wash buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Theoretical model and computational method</title><p>We find that McdA, McdB, and the carboxysome cargo show <italic>in vivo</italic> dynamics strikingly similar to that found for ParA-mediated DNA partition systems. Therefore, we leveraged our established Brownian ratchet model of ParA/ParB-mediated partition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2017</xref>) to theoretically interrogate the carboxysome positioning process in cyanobacteria.</p><p>Briefly, the model describes the mechanochemical interplay between nucleoid-bound McdA and carboxysome-bound McdB. McdA and McdB in the current model fulfil exactly the same roles of ParA and ParB as in the low-copy plasmid partition case, respectively. While carboxysome alone diffuses randomly, its motility can be greatly modulated when carboxysome-bound McdB interacts with nucleoid-bound McdA. Specifically, carboxysome-bound McdB stimulates the ATPase activity of nucleoid-bound McdA, which triggers the dissociation of McdA from the nucleoid substrate surface. The slow rate of dissociated McdA resetting its DNA-binding capability generates an McdA-depleted zone behind the moving cargo. The resulting asymmetric McdA distribution perpetuates the directed movement of the carboxysome cargo. Transient tethering arising from the McdA-McdB contacts collectively drives forward movement of the cargo and also quenches diffusive motion in orthogonal directions. This way, McdA/McdB interaction â when at proper mechanochemical coupling â drives directed and persistent movement of carboxysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The model treats carboxysomes as circular disks that move on the nucleoid surface, which is modeled as a 2D simulation domain. The simulation domain is bounded by the reflective boundary condition. To study the effects of nucleoid geometry on carboxysome positioning, we constructed the simulation domains to mimic I.) a circular nucleoid and II.) a more elongated rounded rectangle nucleoid, which consists of a rectangle with two spherical caps at the ends of its long axis.</p><p>We simulated the model by the same kinetic Monte Carlo technique as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2017</xref>), which describes the coupling between the stochastic reaction-diffusion processes involving McdA and McdB, and their mechanochemical interplay. Specifically, we investigated the effects of carboxysome number and nucleoid geometry on carboxysome positioning. In each case defined by different carboxysome number and nucleoid geometry, the simulation starts with the initial positions of the carboxysomes that cluster around the center of the simulation domain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7CE</xref> in the main text). For each case, we identify the parameter regime in which the carboxysomes undergo âdirected segregationâ â a motility mode in which the cargoes move away from each other and then become relatively stationary (<italic>e.g.,</italic> see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). That is, the carboxysomes are segregated and then stably positioned with a large inter-spacing. We then tracked the time evolutions of each of the simulated trajectories that are 10 min long, from which the final positions of, and separation distances between, carboxysomes were then calculated and reported in each case (averageÂ Â±Â standard deviation, nÂ =Â 36 trajectories).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the labs of Dr. Matthew Chapman and Dr. Kiyoshi Mizuuchi labs for use of equipment and reagents, as well as Dr. Cheryl Kerfeld and Dr. Beronda Montgomery for helpful conversations and suggestions in preparing this manuscript.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Protein Gradients on the Nucleoid Position the Carbon-fixing Organelles of Cyanobacteria&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Emilia MF Mauriello (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript &quot;Protein Gradients on the Nucleoid Position the Carbon-fixing Organelles of Cyanobacteria&quot; by MacCready et al. addresses the mechanism by which carboxysomes are positioned and segregated in their model organism <italic>Synechococcus elongates</italic>. Particularly, the authors present a detailed study that addresses some important unanswered questions about the mechanism responsible for proper segregation of carboxysomes. They identify a previously uncharacterized protein McdB, which together with its partner protein, the ParA-like ATPase McdA, is required for carboxysome segregation. McdB regulates McdA ATPase activity and the oscillatory behavior of McdA over the nucleoid. Furthermore, their data suggest that McdB is a component of the carboxysome and in this way provides a link between McdA function and carboxysome positioning. Based on their microscopy data and mathematical modelling the authors propose a Brownian ratchet-based mechanism for McdA/McdB function.</p><p>There are however three major points that need to be addressed before the paper is published:</p><p>1) Provide statistical analyses of the imaging (for which they must have all the raw data);</p><p>2) Provide evidence for the functionality of their fusion;</p><p>3) Provide an additional simple in vitro experiment of DNA binding.</p><p>1) Quantification of fluorescence microscopy experiments. The manuscript is highly based on microscopy analysis of protein localization, however, many microscopy experiments are not quantified or presented with statistical analysis. Some experiments are only based on the analysis of a single cell. Proper quantification and statistical analysis is needed. In particular such analyses should address the following points:</p><p>â Figure 1A: Demographic analysis. How many cells show asymmetric localization of McdA?</p><p>â Figure 1C. Have these small mNG-McdA clusters been seen in multiple cells? Have they ever been colocalized with the carboxysomes? Finally, why mNG-McdA would colocalize with the carboxysomes? We would expect it to immediately dissociate upon ATP hydrolysis.</p><p>â Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D: Quantification of RbcS-mTQ localization in wild-type and mNG-McdA backgrounds. What is normal localization of RbcS?</p><p>â How common are the dim McdA foci forming in the wake of McdA oscillation? Quantification is needed. Is this a common phenomenon?</p><p>â Demographic quantification of microscopy data of mNG-McdA in <italic>ÎparB</italic>, <italic>Î1835</italic> and <italic>Î1834</italic> in Figure 2B-D is needed. The images do seem to support the author's conclusion but proper quantification is needed (e.g. by demographs of mNG-McdA signal along the cell length).</p><p>â In Figure 2I, proper quantification of McdB localization is needed. Does the number of McdB foci increase with increasing cell length? Are McdB foci regularly distributed similar to RbcS? Analysis of McdB signal as a function of cell length will tell this.</p><p>â Furthermore, in Figure 2K, proper quantification of mNG-McdB and RbcS-mTQ signal is needed in order to show co-localization of the two proteins in the cell. This is very important, since it is a major conclusion of the manuscript that McdB integrates into the carboxysomes. Proper quantification of McdB recovery is also needed.</p><p>â The authors conclude on the recovery of McdB in a single cell that McdB association with carboxysomes is stable (Supplementary Figure 1L). The average recovery rate of McdB from multiple cells should be performed. Furthermore, photoactivation of e.g. PAmCherry-McdB would be the correct experiment to determine of McdB is stably associated with carboxysomes â this experiment would allow analysis of release of McdB from carboxysomes and hence the stability of its association with them.</p><p>â There is no quantification of RbcS-mTQ, mNG-McdB and mNG-McdA localization in absence of carboxysomes. The McdA signal does not appear uniform like McdB and RbcS. There is no quantification of mNG-McdA signal in respect to RbcS-mTQ signal in Figure 6B and C. Again the conclusion is based on the single cell presented in the figure. Proper analysis of mNG-McdA signal in respect to RbcS-mTQ signal is needed â how general is this observation?</p><p>â Again, in regard to Figure 6D statements as &quot;we frequently observed&quot; is used but no data for frequency is given â how common is this behavior of McdA?</p><p>2) Functionality and integrity of the different protein fusions used in the study: mNG-McdA (vs. McdA-mNG); mNG-McdB (vs. McdB-mNG); Rbcs-mO; RbcsTQ needs to be illustrated by western blots and phenotypic assays. It would be also nice to clearly state the reasons beyond the choice of one tag over another one in the different experiments (McdA-GFP-His over McdA-mNG, for example). This is critically important because a major conclusion of the manuscript that McdA does not form filaments but instead functions via a Brownian ratchet-based mechanism. This is a new model for McdA function, which previous data suggest function via a filament forming-mechanism. However, one of the primary experiments for this conclusion is based on in vitro DNA binding assays using purified McdA-GFP-His. However, there is no experiment testing if this fusion is functional <italic>in vivo</italic> â though the authors do show that it binds DNA. This is particularly concerning since the McdA-mNG fusion is non-functional, which the authors clearly show in Figure 1. It is likely that polymers of McdA-GFP-His are not observed because GFP-His blocks oligomerization of McdA-GFP-His and consequently rendering it non-functional, similar to the McdA-mNG fusion. The functionality of McdA-GFP-His <italic>in vivo</italic> needs to be tested. In case it is non-functional, then <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments ought to be performed with a fusion that is functional <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>3) It would be an important addition to this work to show that the McdA binding to DNA (+/- ATP) is affected by the presence of McdB in both gel shifts and flowcell. Have the authors tried this experiment? From the two hybrid system results, I expect that the McdA-GFP-McdB binding is compromised: could the authors use His-MBP-McdA, which has been shown to hydrolyse ATP in the presence of McdB and DNA, for this experiments instead than McdA-GFP? The authors could not purify mNG-McdA nor McdA because they are insoluble. Have they tried to purify it in the presence of ATP/ADP? Does McbB bind DNA?</p><p>Other comments that would help improve the manuscript:</p><p>â Figure 4C. The authors describe the carboxysomes observed in this figure irregular and randomly distributed, but it is hard to discriminate the difference between these carboxysomes and those observed in wild type. I can even catch some of the hexagonal distribution described later in the manuscript. Anyway, the carboxysomes distribution in the <italic>ÎmcdA ÎmcdB</italic> double mutant is very different from that observed in single mutants. This suggests that the McdA and McdB might also have some independent functions. Could the authors comment on that?</p><p>â It would be nice if the fluorescence micrographs in Figure 6B-D were comparable with those in Figure 6F. In Figure 6B-D we can nicely observe the relocalization of McdA between two carboxysomes and the movement of the one carboxysome towards high McdA concentrations. It would be nice to show the appearance of mNG-McdA oscillations upon the addition of IPTG in the strain bearing <italic>lacI</italic>, in time lapse experiments. The authors should be able to show it even in the absence of a microfluidic device. Conversely, in Figure 6B-D it would be nice to have larger fields showing multiple cells like in Figure 6F.</p><p>â The authors conclude that a pool of McdB enriched at the carboxysome is necessary to locally deplete McdA signal (Figure 4 and Figure 6B-D), suggesting that prolonged McdB activity may stimulate the local release of McdA from the nucleoid. It would significantly improve the author's conclusion if they identified an McdB variant that still localizes to the carboxysome but do not interact with McdA. If the author's conclusion is correct, then McdA should be uniformly distributed on the nucleoid in this McdB background while the McdB variant still colocalized to the carboxysomes. It is a major assumption in their modelling that McdB regulates McdA behavior in such a way.</p><p>Edits:</p><p>â Subsection âMcdA Dynamically Patterns Along the Nucleoidâ, first sentence of last paragraph: Replace McdA with McdA-GFP.</p><p>â The authors could comment on the fact that the shift pattern observed on Figure 1F is typical of ParA (Soj) proteins nucleating on DNA.</p><p>â Figure 1G. What is the 500 bp DNA sequence used in the flowcell?</p><p>â Subsection âCarboxysome Positioning is Disrupted in McdA/McdB Mutantsâ: âIn contrast to other strains that lack a McdA oscillation (see below), we did not observe depleted McdA signal on the nucleoid in the vicinity of carboxysomes within a â<italic>mcdB</italic> backgroundâ. This sentence is not clear to me. Have foci of non-oscillating mNG-McdA been observed near the carboxysomes elsewhere in the manuscript?</p><p>â Figure 5. Do the authors have the DAPI staining for Figures 5A-F. I was wondering what is nucleoid shape in the observed strains. In TEM, have clustered carboxysomes ever been observed in wild type?</p><p>â Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A-B and Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F-K are redundant and can be removed.</p><p>â Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D could become a main figure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39723.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦] There are however three major points that need to be addressed before the paper is published:</p><p>1) Provide statistical analyses of the imaging (for which they must have all the raw data);</p><p>2) Provide evidence for the functionality of their fusion;</p><p>3) Provide an additional simple in vitro experiment of DNA binding.</p><p>1) Quantification of fluorescence microscopy experiments.

How many cells show asymmetric localization of McdA?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not emphasizing the fact that the dynamics described here using our native fluorescent fusions of McdA were essentially fully penetrant in a cell population (â¥99% of cells). We have provided several lines of statistical analyses in the main text and supplementary emphasizing this point. Specifically, we have added the following statements to the main text:</p><p>âInterestingly, our native C-terminally tagged reporter (McdA-mNG) did not show dynamic oscillations and instead formed a uniform distribution of signal along the longitudinal axis (â¥99% of cells; n = 950 cells) (Figure 1D and Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A). Alternatively, a N-terminally tagged reporter (mNG-McdA) displayed robust oscillations (â¥99% of cells; n = 442 cells) (periodicity of 15.3 min per 3.3 Âµm, ~5-6x faster than previously reported using McdA-GFP (Savage et al., 2010)) that formed a bimodal distribution of signal intensity (Figure 1E,G, Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B and Video 2).â</p><p>Similar quantifying statements are found throughout the Results section.</p><p>We have also provided Video 2 showing mNG-McdA oscillations occurring in greater than 99% of cells in the field of view (n = &gt; 500 cells).</p><p>Further, we have added supplementary figure panels that display MicrobeJ heatmap statistical analyses of the fluorescence signals associated with mNG-McdA, which shows asymmetric localization and McdA-mNG, which does not oscillate (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). The results from these statistical treatments are consistent with our interpretation of the data as described in the main text. We have also added heatmap statistical analyses of the fluorescence signals associated with a number of other reporter constructs (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Figure 1C. Have these small mNG-McdA clusters been seen in multiple cells? Have they ever been colocalized with the carboxysomes? Finally, why mNG-McdA would colocalize with the carboxysomes? We would expect it to immediately dissociate upon ATP hydrolysis.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer recognizes a valid point. The signal is weak and is certainly a transient phenomenon that only occurs during the brief time period in which mNG-McdA is traversing the long axis of the cell. As such, examples are few. Therefore, we have decided to remove this image from the main text as we cannot be sure that the signal is due to interaction with carboxysomes, or perhaps an interaction with regions of the nucleoid with higher DNA densities. Also, the finding is cursory and does not significantly add to the conclusions of the paper.</p><p>Despite removing this image, we would like to respond to the reviewerâs query as to why we would expect mNG-McdA to transiently colocalize with carboxysomes. ParA-mediated positioning has largely been studied in the context of moving genetic material; plasmids in particular. The ParB protein from plasmid P1 forms punctate foci in vivo that remain colocalized with plasmids bearing <italic>parS</italic> (Erdmann et al., 1999; Sengupta et al., 2010). P1 ParA uniformly distributes over the nucleoid region of the cell, and also forms foci that colocalize with relatively immobile plasmids bearing <italic>parS</italic> (Hatano and Niki, 2010). But during periods of plasmid movement, the colocalized ParA foci disappear and only reappear once the plasmid has been repositioned. Chromosomal ParAs also have been observed as two discrete populations in vivo. Both ParA from <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> and ParAI from <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> form foci that colocalize with their ParB-<italic>parS</italic> complexes during periods of relative immobility (Fogel and Waldor, 2006; Ptacin, 2010). In both cases, ParA disappears from the mobile ParB-<italic>parS</italic> complex during segregation, and the nucleoid-bound population of ParA redistributes in response to ParB-<italic>parS</italic> motion. Therefore, the transient mNG-McdA association with McdB-bound carboxysomes we observed is consistent with that found for other better studied ParA-type ATPases.</p><p>In the context of carboxysomes, as the reviewer points out, McdB interaction should result in McdA release from the nucleoid but this only occurs after first physically interacting. Indeed the counteracting roles of AB association versus ATPase stimulated release of McdA is a critical feature of our diffusion-ratchet model (Hu et al., 2015, 2017). Directed and persistent positioning requires a sufficient number of McdAâATPâMcdB bonds to transiently tether the carboxysome cargo and quench diffusion while still being able to dissociate rapidly enough to drive carboxysome movement. The proper coordination between the timescales of the mechanical action and the chemistry of the McdAATPâMcdB bonds orchestrates the synchrony between bond tethering and dissociation in driving persistent cargo positioning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D: Quantification of RbcS-mTQ localization in wild-type and mNG-McdA backgrounds.

The average recovery rate of McdB from multiple cells should be performed. Furthermore, photoactivation of e.g. PAmCherry-McdB would be the correct experiment to determine of McdB is stably associated with carboxysomes â this experiment would allow analysis of release of McdB from carboxysomes and hence the stability of its association with them.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that photoactivation would be a more ideal experiment to address the stability of McdB on carboxysomes. Because of a number of problems with quantifying McdB signal in the context of a photosynthetic cell, we have decided to remove our current FRAP quantification. First, because there are many photosynthetic pigments in cyanobacteria, the autofluorescence is high â especially in the red wavelengths. This precludes the use of pAmCherry and many other photoactivable dyes/fusions. Secondly, when performing FRAP, if the laser power is too low, fluorescence in the ROI does not significantly decline. If itâs too high, the autofluorescence significantly increases, due to saturation of the light harvesting machinery in the electron transport chain and a corresponding increase in the quantum yield of chlorophyll fluorescence (Campbell et al., 1998). Finally, because recovery is on the scale of minutes (which is also on the scale of McdA oscillations) carboxysomes frequently move during the recovery period. For example, non-irradiated carboxysomes often diffuse into the FRAP ROI, or irradiated carboxysomes move within the Z-plane. Therefore, quantification across multiple cells is currently difficult. Since we are only able to provide representative data, and this result is not directly related to the central conclusions of this paper, we have removed the FRAP data and its associated text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is no quantification of RbcS-mTQ, mNG-McdB and mNG-McdA localization in absence of carboxysomes.

With regard to McdA and McdB, we show that the reporter fusions are sufficient to recapitulate all of the known functions of these proteins, to date. Because all of our reporter lines are the result of âknock-insâ to the endogenous loci, there is no other pool of untagged proteins that could rescue functions. For example, the endogenous mNG-McdA fusion oscillates within the cell and is sufficient for carboxysome positioning (Figures 1E-H, Figure 2B,C, Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B,D-F). Likewise, endogenous mNG-McdB localizes to carboxysomes and is sufficient to drive McdA emergent oscillations, and is sufficient for ordered carboxysome positioning in the absence of any additional pool of untagged McdB in the cell (Figure 3C, Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B,C). We go to lengths to show that the C-terminal fusions that have different localization patterns in vivoalso do not compliment the known functions of McdA and McdB and also behave differently in some in vitro experiments: for McdA (see Figure 2F and Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A,F), for McdB (see Figure 2F and Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A). With regard to the functionality of RbcS-fluorophore fusions, we cannot tag the endogenous copy of the protein. Moreover, RbcS antibodies that recognize <italic>S. elongatus</italic> RbcS are not commercially available. However, we note that the reaction carried out by RuBisCO is essential for growth in <italic>S. elongatus</italic>, which is a strict photoautotroph. If RbcS-fusions acted as a dominant negative mutant, this construct would be lethal. Additionally, if RbcS-fusions compromised the integrity of the carboxysome, a high CO<sub>2</sub>-requiring phenotype would result, as intact carboxysomes are an essential component of the carbon concentrating mechanism (e.g., Cameron et al., 2013). We do not observe a high CO<sub>2</sub>-requiring phenotype in any of our lines aside from the carboxysome deletion strain.</p><p>The authors are somewhat uncertain what is meant by the reviewerâs request to show âintegrityâ of the various protein fusions. We interpret this statement to mean that the fluorophore reporters are not partially degraded in a way that separates the fluorophore from the tagged protein. However, if this were the case, the results of the striking localization patterns (i.e., oscillating waves, ordered puncta) would be highly unlikely â if separated from their tagged protein, fluorophores should adopt a diffuse localization pattern (or at worst, be concentrated to polar inclusion bodies). We note that even in the cases of the C-terminally tagged McdA and McdB which we suspect interferes with McdA-McdB interactions (for which we provide multiple in vitro that suggest impaired functionality â Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A, Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F, and Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D), the fluorescent signal for these expressed proteins is not diffuse. McdA-mNG concentrates in the cell near the nucleoid (Figure 1D), and McdB-mNG displays an irregular punctate pattern (Figure 3A). Carboxysomes have been routinely visualized by tagging components of the shell and/or RuBisCO subunits and the localization patterns we observe for RbcS are consistent with other carboxysome reporter lines (e.g., Savage et al., 2010, Cameron et al., 2013, Sun et al., 2016, Niederhuber et al., 2017). We note that commercially-available antibodies are not available for many of the proteins in this study, precluding an exhaustive Western analysis.</p><p>However, a commercial antibody is available for mNeonGreen, therefore we present a Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) of increasing concentrations of purified mNG (~27 kD), and mNG-McdB (~44 kD), mNG-McdA (~54 kD) and mNG-Ftn2 (~98 kD control) cell lysate.

This is critically important because a major conclusion of the manuscript that McdA does not form filaments but instead functions via a Brownian ratchet-based mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed used a number of McdA fusions and we agree with the reviewer that the explanations as to why we used them when we did was not completely clear in the previous version of the manuscript. In the current version, we have made a number of changes in the text both in the Results and Discussion explaining why a particular fusion of McdA was used. Briefly, we would like to highlight that McdA-GFP was initially chosen because this was the fluorescent fusion first used by the Savage et al. Science paper that first unveiled the genetic requirement for a ParA-type ATPase for carboxysome positioning. A cytoskeletal model was proposed without any direct evidence for a such a filament-based mechanism. We moved on to N-terminal fusions after finding McdA-GFP was as functional as mNG-McdA in a number of assays that we show here (in vivo oscillation, B2H with McdB, ATPase assays). To clarify this distinction in the main manuscript we have modified text in a few sections â for example we have added the following:</p><p>â âSince a C-terminal GFP fusion of McdA was previously used to observe McdA oscillation and its involvement in carboxysome positioning in vivo (Savage et al., 2010), we purified McdA-GFP-His and examined its capacity to bind DNA via an Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA).â</p><p>â âWe then sought to examine endogenous localization and dynamics of McdA, therefore we generated N- and C-terminal fluorescent fusions of mNeonGreen (mNG) to McdA using the native mcdA promoter and chromosomal location. [â¦] Alternatively, a N-terminally tagged reporter (mNG-McdA) displayed robust oscillations (â¥99% of cells; n = 442 cells) (periodicity of 15.3 min per 3.3 Âµm, ~5-6x faster than previously reported using McdA-GFP (Savage et al., 2010)) that formed a bimodal distribution of signal intensity (Figure 1E,G, Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B and Video 2).â</p><p>â âSince an N-terminal fusion of McdA was more functional in vivo, we performed an EMSA with an N-terminal fusion of McdA. [â¦] Together, our results demonstrate that ATP-bound N- or C-terminally tagged McdA binds DNA and McdA-GFP-His does not display indications of polymer formation at the resolution limits of our microscope.â</p><p>Additionally, we chose mNG for our in vivo analysis over the original GFP for microscopy reasons. First, fluorescent signal from many GFP-related proteins are too weak in cyanobacterial cells due to native background autofluorescence from their photosynthetic pigments. Indeed, the original Savage et al. paper overexpressed McdA-GFP using a constitutive promoter, thereby bypassing this issue. However, ParA/B stoichiometry is incredibly important for their emergent dynamics and since we were tagging the native genes and expressing them using their native promoter, we chose mNG because it is currently the brightest fluorescent protein, is yellowshifted so we can avoid autofluorescence imaging under YFP and is highly monomeric to prevent unintended self-interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a new model for McdA function, which previous data suggest function via a filament forming-mechanism. However, one of the primary experiments for this conclusion is based on in vitro DNA binding assays using purified McdA-GFP-His. However, there is no experiment testing if this fusion is functional in vivo â though the authors do show that it binds DNA. This is particularly concerning since the McdA-mNG fusion is non-functional, which the authors clearly show in Figure 1. It is likely that polymers of McdA-GFP-His are not observed because GFP-His blocks oligomerization of McdA-GFP-His and consequently rendering it non-functional, similar to the McdA-mNG fusion. The functionality of McdA-GFP-His in vivo needs to be tested. In case it is non-functional, then in vitro experiments ought to be performed with a fusion that is functional in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize the importance of using functional reporter proteins and it is because of these concerns that we have taken pains to characterize multiple different reporter fusions in this work (e.g., C-terminal vs. N-terminal), and to express reporter fusions off of their endogenous promoters, where possible. In responding to this critique about the C-terminal fusion of McdA, it is important to stress that there is currently no direct evidence in support of the current cytoskeletal model for McdA-based positioning of carboxysomes. Savage et al.used only a C-terminal GFP fusion of McdA in their experiments, and for this reason, we start this manuscript by showing in a number of assays that McdA-GFP, to which the cytoskeletal model is predicated (without direct data) is not fully functional in its association with McdB. Since there is no direct data for a filament model here or in the Savage paper, the suggestion that McdA-GFP is not functioning as a polymer due to blocking an oligomerization domain, which there is also no evidence for among all ParAs studied, is an assertion that the polymer model is true because it has not yet been proven false. Formally, speaking some higher order oligomer of McdA (higher than a dimer) may still be possible, but again there is currently no evidence towards this model. We would also like to highlight that this is an ongoing debate in the Min and Par fields. Additionally, we have made a number of attempts to purify a variant of McdA that is tagged on the N-terminus with a fluorophore, and these proteins were unfortunately insoluble or prone to degradation in vitro (see below). Therefore, because we cannot repeat the TIRF experiments using an N-terminal McdA variant, we have restructured portions of our manuscript (especially see Results, subsection âMcdA Dynamically Patterns Along the Nucleoidâ, and Discussion, subsection âMcdA is Not Cytoskeletal and Utilizes the Nucleoid to Position Carboxysomesâ) to better highlight the context of the literature and the lack of direct evidence for the filament model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be an important addition to this work to show that the McdA binding to DNA (+/- ATP) is affected by the presence of McdB in both gel shifts and flowcell. Have the authors tried this experiment? From the two hybrid system results, I expect that the McdA-GFP-McdB binding is compromised: could the authors use His-MBP-McdA, which has been shown to hydrolyse ATP in the presence of McdB and DNA, for this experiments instead than McdA-GFP? Have they tried to purify it in the presence of ATP/ADP? Does McbB bind DNA?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and performed all requested experiments. We now show that N-terminally fused His-MBP-McdA can shift nsDNA in an EMSA in the presence of ATP (Figure 1I and Figure 2I). We also performed an McdB titration with a fixed concentration of His-MBP-McdA to show that increasing concentrations of McdB resolves this shift (Figure 2J). We also performed an McdB titration without McdA to show that McdB does not bind nsDNA directly (Figure 2K). We thank the reviewer for the suggestion as it has significantly strengthened the conclusions of this paper that the nucleoid plays a key role in the positioning of carboxysomes via the McdAB system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors could not purify mNG-McdA nor McdA because they are insoluble.</p></disp-quote><p>McdA shows poor solubility despite the addition of hydrotropic agents such as ATP or ADP.

Our construct for in vivo imaging (His-mNG-GSGSGS-McdA) was highly prone to cleavage during multiple purification attempts.

We will continue to search for a purification protocol for McdA either from <italic>S. elongatus</italic> or from another cyanobacterial species harboring the McdAB system. But for the purposes of introducing the McdAB system, the McdA fusions used here support all expected functions of a ParA-type ATPase â in vivo oscillation, self-association, partner-stimulated ATPase activity and DNA release in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments that would help improve the manuscript:</p><p>â Figure 4C. The authors describe the carboxysomes observed in this figure irregular and randomly distributed, but it is hard to discriminate the difference between these carboxysomes and those observed in wild type. I can even catch some of the hexagonal distribution described later in the manuscript. Anyway, the carboxysomes distribution in the ÎmcdA ÎmcdB double mutant is very different from that observed in single mutants. This suggests that the McdA and McdB might also have some independent functions. Could the authors comment on that?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and for the reason stated it was critical for us to perform the Microbe J analysis of carboxysome distribution, and carboxysome foci size in a population of cells for each mutant line (see Figure 5A-G).</p><p>âCarboxysome distribution displayed some variation even in wildtype strains, therefore we quantified carboxysome distributions in hundreds of cells utilizing MicrobeJ to automatically detect and characterize fluorescent carboxysome foci.â</p><p>To address the reviewers query regarding the McdAB mutant, carboxysomes are indeed irregular and randomly distributed at a population level. We would like to note that carboxysomes were significantly weaker in fluorescence intensity in the McdAB double mutant. In order to see carboxysomes in Figure 4C, the illumination intensity was increased 4-fold, and this partially accounts for the increased background signal observed in these strains. We speculate that the decreased RbcS-mO signal in the double mutant is due to a change in the promoter genomic context, and/or reduced transcriptional read-through (see construct schematics, Figure 4A-C and subsection âCarboxysome Positioning is Disrupted in McdA/McdB Mutantsâ, second paragraph). We do suggest in the paper that McdAB may also be involved in the regulation of carboxysome biogenesis, size, and shape. These are potential functions we look forward to addressing in a future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â It would be nice if the fluorescence micrographs in Figure 6B-D were comparable with those in Figure 6F. In Figure 6B-D we can nicely observe the relocalization of McdA between two carboxysomes and the movement of the one carboxysome towards high McdA concentrations. It would be nice to show the appearance of mNG-McdA oscillations upon the addition of IPTG in the strain bearing lacI, in time lapse experiments. The authors should be able to show it even in the absence of a microfluidic device. Conversely, in Figure 6B-D it would be nice to have larger fields showing multiple cells like in Figure 6F.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer(s) that capturing the emergence of mNG-McdA oscillation upon induction of the carboxysome operon would be a nice addition to our manuscript. However, this type of experiment would need to be performed over 12 hours (Cameron et al., 2010) and we currently lack the appropriate equipment for prolonged cyanobacterial growth on our microscope (2% CO<sub>2</sub> and a light source capable of minimal elimination in the photosynthetically active range).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The authors conclude that a pool of McdB enriched at the carboxysome is necessary to locally deplete McdA signal (Figure 4 and Figure 6B-D), suggesting that prolonged McdB activity may stimulate the local release of McdA from the nucleoid. It would significantly improve the author's conclusion if they identified an McdB variant that still localizes to the carboxysome but do not interact with McdA. If the author's conclusion is correct, then McdA should be uniformly distributed on the nucleoid in this McdB background while the McdB variant still colocalized to the carboxysomes. It is a major assumption in their modelling that McdB regulates McdA behavior in such a way.</p></disp-quote><p>The new data included in Figure 2J significantly strengthens our claim that McdB regulates McdA attachment to nucleoid DNA. In these gel shift assays, we show that McdB leads to the release of McdA from DNA in a concentration-dependent manner. While we agree that a McdB mutant like that mentioned by the reviewer could allow us to test this in vivo, we regard identification of such a mutant as beyond the scope of this work. This is especially the case because McdB is a novel protein with no structural information or precedence.</p><p>Current efforts to identify McdB diversity across cyanobacteria has revealed that McdB is largely a disordered protein with minimal conservation from one species to another (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Given this, it is not yet obvious which domains/residues would be important for McdB/McdA and McdB/Carboxysome interaction. Therefore, we agree with the reviewer(s) that this effort is important for understanding the system, but currently with this type of analysis it is not yet obvious which residues are critical and will be the focus of future study.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39723.030</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-39723-resp-fig2-v3"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Edits:</p><p>â Subsection âMcdA Dynamically Patterns Along the Nucleoidâ, first sentence of last paragraph: Replace McdA with McdA-GFP.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The authors could comment on the fact that the shift pattern observed on Figure 1F is typical of ParA (Soj) proteins nucleating on DNA.</p></disp-quote><p>The titration of McdA-GFP and His-MBP-McdA show a fairly linear shift of DNA with an increased concentration of ATPase.

Also, our McdA-GFP experiments on a DNA carpet, show slow and homogeneous binding, with no evidence towards a nucleation activity.
