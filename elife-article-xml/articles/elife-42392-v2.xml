it is first observed. However, here we demonstrate that direction selectivity in downstream ganglion cells remains remarkably unaffected when starburst dendrites are rendered non-directional, using a novel strategy combining a conditional GABA<sub>A</sub> α2 receptor knockout mouse with optogenetics. We show that temporal asymmetries between excitation/inhibition, arising from the differential connectivity patterns of starburst cholinergic and GABAergic synapses to ganglion cells, form the basis for a parallel mechanism generating direction selectivity. We further demonstrate that these distinct mechanisms work in a coordinated way to refine direction selectivity as the stimulus crosses the ganglion cell’s receptive field. Thus, precise spatiotemporal patterns of inhibition and excitation that determine directional responses in ganglion cells are shaped by two ‘core’ mechanisms, both arising from distinct specializations of the starburst network.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retinal circuitry</kwd><kwd>starburst amacrine cells</kwd><kwd>co-transmission</kwd><kwd>direction selectivity</kwd><kwd>ganglion cells</kwd><kwd>E/I balance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>159444</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Awatramani</surname><given-names>Gautam B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experimental and computational models reveal how parallel 'core' mechanisms shape direction selectivity at the dendrites of starburst amacrine cells and ganglion cells in the mouse retina.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The direction-selective (DS) circuit in the retina is arguably one of the most well-defined circuits in the mammalian brain (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mauss et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vaney et al., 2012</xref>). In this circuit, direction is encoded by output DS ganglion cells (DSGCs), whose response properties are shaped by DS inputs arising from GABAergic/cholinergic starburst amacrine cells (starbursts) and non-DS inputs from glutamatergic bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, despite comprehensive connectomic analysis of the circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2016</xref>) and many decades of physiological investigations, the fundamental mechanisms underlying direction selectivity, both at the level of starbursts and DSGCs remain to be fully elucidated.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42392.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Parallel ‘core’ mechanisms generating direction selectivity in DSGCs</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A cross section of the functional circuitry underlying direction selectivity in ON-OFF DSGCs. DSGCs receive glutamatergic inputs from ON and OFF bipolar cells, and inputs from mirror symmetric populations of ON and OFF GABAergic/cholinergic starburst amacrine cells. In this study, the stimuli used emphasized the ON responses. Preferred-side starbursts (p-starburst) provide mainly cholinergic excitation, while null-side starbursts (n-starburst) provide cholinergic excitation and a dominant GABAergic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yonehara et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, GABAergic/cholinergic signals mediated by starbursts are differentially transmitted to the DSGC. (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic depicting the asymmetric anatomical connectivity between starbursts and DSGCs (top view). <italic>Bona fide</italic> ‘wrap-around’ synaptic connections (circled in red) are made largely by null-side starbursts, enabling DS dendrites of starbursts to mediate a ‘null’ inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>). This contrasts with the symmetrical functional cholinergic connectivity depicted in (<bold>A</bold>). Paracrine or ‘volume’ transmission could make cholinergic signals agnostic to the specific synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brombas et al., 2017</xref>). (<bold>C</bold>) In conventional models, direction selectivity in DSGCs is largely shaped by asymmetric postsynaptic GABAergic inhibition. Asymmetric inhibition is contingent on the DS release of GABA from dendrites of starbursts; and on the asymmetric wiring (<bold>B</bold>). By contrast, excitation is non-directional, mainly mediated by glutamate released from bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yonehara et al., 2013</xref>). In this model, the cholinergic receptive field is co-extensive with the glutamatergic receptive field. ACh is usually thought to play a non-directional role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariel and Daw, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amthor et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiao and Masland, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2014</xref>), although some studies note amplitude differences between preferred and null-evoked cholinergic currents (as shown here) suggesting that ACh may directly contribute to direction selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pei et al., 2015</xref>). (<bold>D</bold>) In the revised model proposed here, cholinergic excitation is directional by virtue of its timing with GABAergic inhibition rather than by its response amplitude (<bold>C</bold>). The differences in the functional connectivity of GABA and ACh (<bold>A</bold>) predict that for preferred-direction motion, excitation would lead inhibition; and for null-direction motion, E/I would be activated together. In this study, the central hypothesis is that E/I offsets contribute to a parallel DS mechanism, which does not necessarily rely on the modulation of the peak amplitude of GABA or ACh inputs (in contrast to the model shown in <bold>C</bold>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-42392-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The first points in the visual system where direction selectivity is observed are the radiating dendrites of starbursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Euler et al., 2002</xref>), which release GABA and acetylcholine (ACh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">O'Malley and Masland, 1989</xref>). To explain direction selectivity, initial studies emphasized mechanisms that were based on intrinsic properties of starburst dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gavrikov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hausselt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tukker et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, more recent studies have proposed two distinct network mechanisms. The first relies on inhibition within the dense array of starburst cells, where dendrites of neighboring starbursts with opposite directional preferences mutually inhibit each other. This ensures that dendrites pointing in a particular direction are maximally activated as the moving stimulus sequentially activates the starbursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee and Zhou, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Münch and Werblin, 2006</xref>). The second network mechanism relies on the specific wiring of temporally distinct bipolar cells along the proximal-distal axis of the starburst dendrite. This arrangement results in an optimal summation of inputs when the stimulus moves centrifugally (from soma-to dendrite) along the starbursts dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fransen and Borghuis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). When tested experimentally, however, neither of these mechanisms appears to be critically required for generating DS, at least in the context of simple spot/grating stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sethuramanujam et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Starbursts play an obligatory role in generating direction selectivity in downstream DSGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vlasits et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>). They provide the neural substrate for a powerful GABAergic ‘null’ inhibition that is required for the generation of DS responses in ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Null inhibition relies on both the DS properties of starburst dendrites and also a specific ‘anti-parallel’ wiring scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Only starbursts with somas displaced to the null-side of the DSGC’s receptive field (i.e. the side from which null-stimuli enter the receptive field) make synaptic connections with DSGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brombas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fried et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yonehara et al., 2011</xref>). By contrast, excitatory inputs to DSGCs arising from bipolar cells are non-DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yonehara et al., 2013</xref>). Together, these findings have given rise to a well-accepted model in which direction selectivity in DSGCs is largely inherited from starburst dendrites, contingent on the DS release of GABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mauss et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vaney et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>However, in addition to GABA, starbursts also co-release ACh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">O'Malley and Masland, 1989</xref>), which mediates fast excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in DSGCs via the activation of nicotinic ACh (nACh) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brombas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sethuramanujam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taylor and Smith, 2012</xref>). Unlike GABA, however, cholinergic signals appear to be more symmetrical at the level of DSGCs, giving rise to the notion it modulates the amplitude of DSGC responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariel and Daw, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amthor et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiao and Masland, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2014</xref>). Recent voltage-clamp recordings on the other hand, reveal amplitude differences between preferred and null-evoked cholinergic currents (Figure 1C), suggesting that ACh may directly contribute to direction selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pei et al., 2015</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying DS cholinergic excitation remain unknown.</p><p>Elegant starburst/DSGC paired recordings demonstrate that cholinergic inputs arise from starbursts surrounding DSGCs from all directions, in sharp contrast to GABA inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brombas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yonehara et al., 2011</xref>). Given the asymmetric anatomical wiring of the starbursts and DSGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), it is presumed that cholinergic excitation is mediated by paracrine mechanisms that are agnostic to the specific connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brombas et al., 2017</xref>). Building on these findings, in this study we hypothesized that the differential functional connectivity of spatially offset GABA and ACh signals produces excitation-inhibition (E/I) timing differences that generate direction selectivity, as originally envisioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koch et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Torre and Poggio, 1978</xref>). This could serve as a parallel ‘hard-wired’ DS mechanisms that does not necessarily require DS starburst output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that temporal E/I asymmetries have often been noted in the literature, but their impact has been difficult to assess, as they are always associated with changes in E/I amplitude ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fried et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kostadinov and Sanes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sethuramanujam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taylor and Vaney, 2002</xref>). Further, blocking cholinergic inputs, which is expected to decrease E/I timing differences arising from the above-mentioned specific wiring of starburst ACh/GABA synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), does not appear to affect the ability of DSGCs to encode direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariel and Daw, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kittila and Massey, 1997</xref>). It has also been shown that robust direction selectivity is observed in instances where E/I temporal offsets are not apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taylor and Vaney, 2002</xref>). Additionally, modeling studies suggest that E/I temporal offsets play a negligible role in this computation in the context of the E/I amplitude modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schachter et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the contribution of E/I temporal offsets to direction coding by DSGCs are generally neglected.</p><p>Here, we describe two major advancements that better our understanding of the DS circuitry in the mouse retina. First, using a novel combination of optogenetics/mouse KO technology/pharmacology, we render starburst output non-DS for the first time. This provides valuable insights into the biophysical mechanisms underlying direction selectivity in starburst dendrites. Second, we found that blocking starburst DS had a surprisingly weak effect on direction selectivity in ganglion cells. This demonstrates the existence of a second ‘core’ DS mechanism, which we demonstrate relies on E/I temporal offsets. Interestingly, while changes in E/I ratios or timing differences are each sufficient to drive robust DS responses in ganglion cells, these mechanisms contribute to distinct phases of the DSGC response, ensuring that direction is computed rapidly and with high fidelity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rendering starburst dendrites non-directional</title><p>We first sought to develop ways to abolish direction selectivity in starburst dendrites to test its contribution to direction selectivity in the postsynaptic DSGCs. Previous attempts to perturb DS in starburst dendrites have been met with little success. For example, selectively eliminating mutual inhibition between anti-parallel starburst dendrites using the GABA<sub>A</sub> α2 receptor KO mouse line (<italic>Gabra2</italic> KO) leaves starburst DS largely intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>).

While there was considerable variability in the amplitude of IPSCs, which may have arisen from variable expression of ChR2 and/or run down of optogenetic responses over the course of the recording session (which could last up to 8 hr), within a given cell the responses and their direction selectivity remained reliable between trials.

Similar to the optogenetic experiments, the magnitude of the E/I temporal offsets measured under physiological conditions (i.e. photoreceptor mediated) was greatest for preferred-direction motion and progressively decreased as the stimulus direction approached the DSGC’s null-direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In these experiments, superior coding DSGCs were excluded from the analysis, since in these ganglion cells gap junctions are known to drive early excitatory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trenholm et al., 2013</xref>). The E/I temporal offset tuning was significantly sharper when compared to the tuning of the spiking responses, as indicated by the DSI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In a later section, we use modeling to show that this difference arises because the DS spiking responses are shaped by two distinct mechanisms with different tuning properties (Figure 7). By contrast, the predicted direction based on offsets were almost perfectly aligned with the direction encoded based on the spiking responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the notion that E/I temporal offsets arise from a differential transmission of ACh/GABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), blocking nicotinic ACh (nACh) receptors using a specific antagonist (100 µM hexamethonium) increased the onset latency for excitation evoked by motion in the preferred-direction, and largely abolished the E/I temporal offsets in this direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). For null-direction motion, blocking these receptors resulted in a negative offset, as the GABAergic inhibition arising from null-side starbursts was no longer balanced by cholinergic inputs but continued to arrive before glutamate inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Further blocking GABAergic inhibition did not alter the delay induced by blocking nACh receptors, indicating that the E/I temporal offset estimates were not confounded by voltage-clamp errors associated with large inhibitory conductances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poleg-Polsky and Diamond, 2011</xref>). Plotting the E/I temporal offsets for all stimulus directions reveals that hexamethonium uniformly reduces the E/I temporal offsets by ~25 ms (average delay = 26 ± 2 ms; n = 8) regardless of direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>), consistent with the idea that starbursts make cholinergic connections from all around the DSGC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Given the stimulus moved at 1000 μm/s, this corresponds to a spatial offset of ~25 μm (see Discussion). It is also worth noting that, both ACh and GABA signals arising from starburst dendrites are spatially offset relative to glutamate inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>), unlike the co-extensive glutamatergic/cholinergic receptive fields observed in rabbit retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brombas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fried et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>).

In real DSGC this does not appear to be an issue, indicating that GABAergic inhibition must be slower and more powerful than that implemented in our model.

When the spiking responses were averaged over the entire trial, the direction selectivity generated with or without DS inhibition was similar, and thus the DS mechanisms appear redundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, when the DS tuning was examined on a finer time-scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), it showed distinct characteristics in the early and peak phases of the response, raising the possibility that the two mechanisms operate on distinct time-scales.

It is important to note that both DS mechanisms rely on transmitter release from starbursts and thus operate on roughly the same spatial scales. Next, we tested these ideas in our model DS circuit, where we could easily control the timing and amplitude of E/I, independently (see Materials and methods for details).</p><p>Indeed, the characteristic properties of the DSGC’s direction tuning were reproduced in a model DSGC driven with both temporal and amplitude asymmetries in E/I that arise from the specific arrangement of GABA, ACh and glutamate inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref> illustrates the synaptic inputs/spiking response of the model DSGC). When starbursts were rendered non-DS in the model DSGC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>), temporal asymmetries alone were sufficient to generate DS responses with sharp tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), as observed in the ChR2-<italic>Gabra2</italic> KO mouse. When E/I temporal offsets were removed, modulating the peak amplitude of inhibition generated robust DS responses, but with wider tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, in this model lacking offsets, the early responses were lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Thus, the DS mechanisms based on temporal and amplitude asymmetries appear to be complementary, each conferring distinct advantages: the former enables DSGCs to respond in a direction-selective manner sooner than they would have done otherwise, while the latter enables DSGCs to encode direction with higher fidelity albeit on a slower time scale.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Parallel ‘core’ mechanisms generating direction selectivity in the retina</title><p>In the mammalian retina, direction selectivity is observed at the level of starburst dendrites as well as in downstream DSGCs. Our experiments using various pharmacological, optogenetic and cell-specific KO strategies to analyse synaptic inputs to DSGCs, suggest that multiple circuit mechanisms serve to generate direction-selectivity at both these points in the DS circuit.</p><p>At the level of starburst dendrites, three distinct mechanisms have been proposed to underlie direction selectivity. These include excitatory and inhibitory network mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fransen and Borghuis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee and Zhou, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Münch and Werblin, 2006</xref>), and cell intrinsic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Euler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hausselt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tukker et al., 2004</xref>). However, pinpointing the ‘core’ mechanism has been complicated because blocking these mechanisms individually, leaves starburst DS output relatively intact. Our result, using ChR2 to stimulate starburst output in a mouse line where inhibitory network mechanisms have been inactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), demonstrate for the first time a condition where starburst release of GABA is non-directional. These results highlight the apparently redundant roles for excitatory and inhibitory network mechanisms and help amalgamate divergent views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fransen and Borghuis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee and Zhou, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Münch and Werblin, 2006</xref>).</p><p>While intrinsic DS mechanisms in starburst dendrites may be important for DS computations, the current results do not appear to reveal them in an obvious manner. This could be for several reasons. First, it is possible that the artificial activation of starbursts using optogenetics does not recruit dendritic voltage-gated channels that may underlie direction selectivity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taylor and Smith, 2012</xref>). Second, the removal of GABAergic inhibition between starbursts may hinder or occlude intrinsic DS mechanisms. Third, it is also possible that the limited set of stimuli (moving spots) which we utilized were not optimally designed to recruit cell intrinsic mechanisms. Thus, although DS is suppressed under conditions in which inhibitory and excitatory network mechanisms are blocked, we do not exclude the possibility that intrinsic mechanisms could serve as a third ‘core’ DS mechanism. A challenge for future experiments is to determine if and how each of these mechanisms work to maintain starburst DS output under different stimulus conditions.</p><p>At the level of DSGCs too, multiple DS mechanisms appear to be in play. Here, two fundamental mechanisms appear to originate from unique specializations of the starburst network. The first mechanism, which relies on amplitude asymmetries arising from the DS starburst dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and asymmetric starburst-DSGC wiring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), is well established (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mauss et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vaney et al., 2012</xref>). The second mechanism relies on temporal asymmetries in excitation and inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). While E/I temporal offsets have often been noted in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fried et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kostadinov and Sanes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sethuramanujam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sivyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taylor and Vaney, 2002</xref>), our results demonstrate for the first time that they are tuned precisely to the DSGC’s preferred direction, and are alone sufficient to generate direction selective responses in ganglion cells.</p><p>Recent studies using voltage-clamp techniques have also shown the amplitude of the cholinergic signal to vary according to direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sethuramanujam et al., 2016</xref>). However, these results need to be interpreted with caution. Dynamic changes in the inhibitory conductance could lead to serious voltage-clamp errors and estimates of the relative peak amplitude of cholinergic input in the preferred and null direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poleg-Polsky and Diamond, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the development of alternate methods, such as functional imaging, is required to fully resolve this issue. Importantly, the E/I offset mechanisms generating DS described here do not require amplitude changes in cholinergic inputs.</p><p>It is also worth noting that cholinergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses are made relatively uniformly throughout the DSGC receptive field and are thought to constitute repeating dendritic DS subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlow and Levick, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, although the temporal asymmetries are most apparent at response onset in our recordings made from the DSGC soma, they are likely present throughout the dendritic tree. Local E/I amplitude and timing differences are expected to shape dendritic responses, which may be further refined by dendritic non-linearities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oesch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sivyer and Williams, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Trenholm et al., 2014</xref>). This is one reason why the spikes generated by E/I temporal offset mechanisms alone often outlast the E/I temporal offsets measured macroscopically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). The precise degree to which timing and amplitude differences in local inputs influence the DSGC’s response directly depends on the extent to which dendrites operate independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schachter et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The network of starburst amacrine cells produces temporal E/I asymmetries in DSGCs</title><p>Before the discovery of DS in starburst dendrites, classic models suggested that DS responses in ganglion cells were based on E/I timing differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koch et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Torre and Poggio, 1978</xref>). Previous studies have speculated that an intermediary cell in the inner and/or outer retina may control E/I timing differences at DSGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rivlin-Etzion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taylor and Vaney, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vlasits et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, another study found that perturbing starburst cell morphology led to parallel changes in E/I amplitude ratio and E/I temporal offsets suggesting that these processes may be inextricably linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kostadinov and Sanes, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our combined results from optogenetic, pharmacological and modelling experiments indicate that the temporal asymmetries in E/I are a natural consequence of the asymmetric/symmetric GABAergic/cholinergic connectivity of starburst cells to DSGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yonehara et al., 2011</xref>). In this scheme, null-side starbursts extend the inhibitory receptive fields of DSGCs during null motion, producing a more powerful inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fried et al., 2002</xref>). Conversely, cholinergic excitation provided by preferred-side starbursts enable DSGCs to respond sooner to the moving edge than they would otherwise. We found that the degree to which cholinergic inputs advance the response is proportional to stimulus velocity, corresponding to a fixed spatial offset ~30 µm. In mouse retina, starbursts receive excitatory and inhibitory inputs on proximal dendrites but release transmitter from varicosities located on their distal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vlasits et al., 2016</xref>). Mapping the receptive fields of individual starburst varicosities using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging shows them to be displaced by ~25 µm towards the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poleg-Polsky et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the extent to which cholinergic inputs expand the receptive field of the DSGC is well predicted by the input/output properties of starburst dendrites. The dimensions of the cholinergic receptive fields also indicate that despite being generated by paracrine mechanisms (which loosens the constraints set by the asymmetrical starburst-DSGC ‘hard-wiring’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brombas et al., 2017</xref>), the distance over which ACh spreads appears relatively limited.</p><p>In contrast to our findings, in rabbit retina, cholinergic excitation is co-extensive with the glutamatergic receptive field and does not appear to extend the DSGC’s receptive field beyond the dendritic field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brombas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fried et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang and Masland, 1992</xref>). One reason for this could be that static stimuli employed in previous studies to measure the receptive field properties of DSGCs do not optimally stimulate starbursts, and therefore fail to reveal cholinergic excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fried et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang and Masland, 1992</xref>). Alternatively, in rabbit retina, the release of ACh may require a stronger stimulation of the starbursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). This causes a delay in the release of ACh, making it co-extensive with glutamate input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, under conditions where inhibition is blocked and starburst dendrites are more strongly stimulated, cholinergic inputs do provide lateral excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fried et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vaney et al., 2012</xref>). Together, these findings have given rise to the notion that the role of ACh is modulatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariel and Daw, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amthor et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiao and Masland, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pei et al., 2015</xref>), in contrast to what we observed in mouse retina.</p><p>The demonstration that the parallel circuit mechanisms driving direction selectivity in ganglion cells are individually dispensable necessitates a re-evaluation of the conclusions drawn from a multitude of studies carried out over the last several decades that considered a single ‘core’ DS mechanism. For example, numerous studies over the last forty years have found that blocking cholinergic receptors does not affect direction selectivity in DSGCs and have taken this to mean that ACh does not play an integral role in DS (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mauss et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vaney et al., 2012</xref>), but rather provides an additional source of non-directional excitation to boost DSGC responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brombas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), that is especially important under limiting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sethuramanujam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sethuramanujam et al., 2017</xref>). In sharp contrast, our results here indicate that in fact ACh signals (unlike glutamate signals) are highly directional, not so much in their amplitudes as previously envisioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grzywacz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grzywacz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pei et al., 2015</xref>), but rather by virtue of their relative timing with inhibition. Cholinergic excitation and GABAergic inhibition are relatively imbalanced (or out of phase) during preferred-direction motion, but extremely well-balanced (or in phase) during null-direction motion, which is important for the computation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Spatiotemporal dynamics of ACh, GABA and glutamate inputs</title><p>Traditional models of DS raised questions regarding the role of cholinergic excitation in driving direction selectivity. In the revised model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), the role of canonical bipolar cell glutamate pathways becomes questionable. Previously, we have shown that under low contrast conditions, glutamate appears to be mediated by NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sethuramanujam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sethuramanujam et al., 2017</xref>) and play an important role modulating cholinergic excitation. Under high contrast conditions, as we have used here, glutamate signaling is mediated by both AMPA and NMDA receptors. Glutamate input is relatively delayed and therefore makes the DSGC’s preferred response more sustained. This contributes to changes of the DS tuning over time.</p><p>Moreover, since AMPA inputs are non-directional they are expected to broaden the DS tuning curve, by changing the E/I ratio across direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poleg-Polsky and Diamond, 2016</xref>). Indeed, a measurable broadening of the real DSGC tuning curves is noted at higher contrasts, although these effects are relatively small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sethuramanujam et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, given the difference in receptive fields between bipolar and starburst inputs to DSGCs, the E/I ratio is predicted to change over the duration of directional light responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Our model indicates that this effect is most pronounced during slow stimulus velocities, as temporal offsets caused by spatial differences are exacerbated as more time is spent between activations of each input to the DSGC, leading to a deterioration of DS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). However, in real DSGCs, DS is stable across velocities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brombas et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that there must be additional mechanisms that compensate for these effects (e.g. inhibition from non-DS sources).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here we have shown how E/I amplitude and timing differences are orchestrated by parallel circuit mechanisms.

In contrast, the suggestion of a central role for starburst ACh in driving E/I temporal offsets, necessitates re-enquiry into previous results which indicated a modulatory role.</p><p>Given the multiple DS mechanisms in the retina, it is interesting to speculate that DS neurons in higher visual areas are also created using a variety of circuit mechanisms. This may help explain conflicting results from recent studies regarding the origin of DS in cortex. For example, thalamocortical inputs to the visual cortex exhibit strong DS properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun et al., 2016</xref>), apparently with retinal origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cruz-Martín et al., 2014</xref>). Yet, abolishing retinal direction selectivity has modest effects on cortical DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hillier et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that direction selectivity must also arise de novo through alternate parallel mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lien and Scanziani, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saul et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilson et al., 2018</xref>). Strikingly, in primate visual cortex, distinct mechanisms appear to shape early and late response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pack and Born, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thiele et al., 2004</xref>) similar to what we have observed here for DSGCs, suggestive of a common organizational principle. It is also interesting to note that direction selectivity in other sensory areas including the auditory and somatosensory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuo and Wu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilent and Contreras, 2005</xref>) may also rely on temporal and amplitude E/I asymmetries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ye et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>).

This model was based on a morphological reconstruction of a real DSGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poleg-Polsky and Diamond, 2016</xref>), with membrane capacitance and axial resistance set to 1 µF/cm2 and 100 Ωcm respectively. Membrane channels and noise were modelled using a stochastic Hodgkin and Huxley distributed mechanism (NEURON MOD file) as previously described. Non-voltage-gated leak conductances were set to reverse at −60 mV. Active membrane conductances were placed at the soma, primary dendrites and dendrites with the following densities (mS/cm<sup>2</sup>) for soma, primary and terminal dendrites respectively: sodium (150/150/30), potassium rectifier (70/70/35), delayed rectifier (3/0.8/0.4). Sodium and potassium conductances were blocked for voltage-clamp recordings. This enabled the model DSGC to process inputs actively i.e. via dendritic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sivyer and Williams, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In our model DSGC, synapses were placed on terminal dendrites throughout the dendritic arbor. Synapses housed glutamatergic (AMPA receptor), cholinergic (nicotinic receptor) and GABAergic (GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor) synaptic inputs, whose kinetic properties were based on experimentally measured miniature events. Synaptic inputs were activated by a simulated bar moving over the model DSGC in 8 directions at 1 mm/s. Cholinergic inputs were symmetrical across the simulated directions, with their probabilities of release (Pr) set at 0.5. Cholinergic inputs were also spatially offset by ~50 µm (corresponding to an E/I temporal offset of 50 ms for preferred stimuli moving at 1 mm/s), and for simplicity modeled based on fast modes of transmission, (similar to AMPA) rather paracrine transmission (see Discussion). AMPA receptor-mediated inputs were modelled to occur without any offset relative to their position on the DSGC’s dendritic arbor. Thus they were simply activated on average (Pr ~0.5) when the simulated light stimulus passed over their synapse location. By contrast, GABAergic inhibitory inputs were made highly asymmetric, their Pr scaling down from ~0.5 in the null to ~0.012 in the preferred direction to simulate control conditions; or Pr was set constant at 0.5 to simulate conditions in which the starburst dendrites were non-DS. Their spatial offset ranged from ~50 µm in the null to ~0 µm in the preferred direction. The precise values across direction were estimated using sigmoidal fits to the tuning curves of the IPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sethuramanujam et al., 2017</xref>) and E/I temporal offsets measured experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.0</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.98</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.0</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>91.0</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>25.0</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.0</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.98</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.0</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>74.69</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>24.36</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Where, pPr, nPr refer to the probabilities of release in preferred and null directions, respectively. pOFF, nOFF refer to the spatial offsets in preferred and null directions, respectively; and angle refers to the direction of stimulated bar stimulus motion (0° is preferred, and 180° is null). Spatial offsets were then divided by the stimulus velocity to arrive at the final temporal offset. Importantly, the sequential activation of synapses by a moving bar stimulus, produced macroscopic inhibitory and excitatory currents which were well-matched to those measured experimentally using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>DSI was calculated as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taylor and Vaney, 2002</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula>where v<sub>i</sub> are vectors pointing in the direction of the stimulus and having length r<sub>i</sub>, equal to the number of spikes recorded during that stimulus.

The angle was calculated from the direction of the resultant of Σv<sub>i</sub>.</p><p>The E/I temporal offset window was calculated with the following protocol. First, the 20–80% rise time of the synaptic currents (EPSCs or IPSCs) was fit by a straight line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The response onset latency was measured as the point at which the extrapolated linear fit crossed the x axis (time axis). The E/I temporal offsets were calculated as difference in the excitatory and inhibitory onsets. Positive offsets indicate that excitation leads inhibition and vice versa. For the purposes of estimating DSI, negative offsets were set to 0.</p><p>In order to determine the early and peak spike responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), the spike trains in control conditions were aligned to the edge of the glutamate receptive field, measured either by the spike activity or EPSCs in glutamate isolation i.e. in cholinergic and GABA receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). After alignment, the number of spikes occurring before the stimulus entered the glutamate receptive field (~50 ms in the preferred direction) was considered as the early phase responses. These spikes were completely blocked by cholinergic receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The peak phase was estimated as a ~ 50 ms region close to the peak firing rate in the preferred direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>Population data have been expressed as mean ± SEM and are indicated in the figure legend along with the number of samples.

A compelling explanation for directional selectivity has emerged from work from several laboratories over the past 15 years. This picture is based on spatial asymmetries in excitatory and inhibitory inputs to DSGCs, and the recruitment of stronger inhibitory input for null direction compared to preferred direction motion. The current paper suggests that this picture is incomplete, and that a second mechanism also contributes to directional selectivity. The new proposed mechanism is based on differences in the timing of excitatory and inhibitory input in preferred and null directions. The paper is clearly written and the conclusions generally are well supported. There are several issues, however, that I think need to be strengthened:</p><p>1) Timing of excitatory and inhibitory input (Figure 3). The similarity of the relative timing of excitatory and inhibitory input in the absence of ACh signaling and the corresponding slowing of excitatory input are important parts of the paper. Yet the data for these points is not presented in a particularly convincing way. First, it would be helpful to see the excitatory inputs in the same cell before and after applying HEX. Second, the relative timing of excitatory and inhibitory inputs is difficult to appreciate given the differences in scale (particularly true in Figure 3G, but also to a lesser extent in Figure 3A and D). Can you add a normalized version of those traces to facilitate a temporal comparison?</p><p>2) Variability in magnitude of inhibitory input. The measured inhibitory inputs vary widely in amplitude (e.g. Figure 1E) – even when recorded for similar stimuli. This raises concerns about experiments in which comparisons are made across recording conditions or across mice. Do you have an explanation for the variability in inhibitory input? Some discussion of that would be helpful.</p><p>3) Ch2R activation. It is not clear from the main text how Ch2R activation was used to produce motion signals in the SACs. This is slightly clearer from reading the methods, but only filling in some retina-specific details about the orderly spatial arrangement of SACs. This should get described clearly in the Results with a non-retina reader in mind.</p><p>4) Details of modeling. The model of Figure 4 needs to be described in considerably more detail. One specific issue is that it is not clear how much of the model is constrained from experiment. A second issue is how spikes are generated in the model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Hanson et al. reports a major refinement of the well-studied model of the direction-selectivity (DS) circuit in the mammalian retina. The key insight is that the temporal asymmetry between excitation (both ACh and gluamate-driven) and inhibition <italic>alone</italic> can drive DS in RGCs, even without a contribution from the DS computation of the starburst dendrites, which causes null direction inhibition to be larger than that in the preferred direction.</p><p>Despite a huge amount of previous work on this circuit and hints of this phenomenon in previous work (which the authors cite), this is an important contribution. In general, the manuscript is well written, and the data are clear and compelling.</p><p>My major concern is that the authors need to do a better job connecting the spatial offset that underlies this phenomenon to its description as a temporal offset. The experiments presented in Figure 2B explore a large range of speeds and show that the temporal offset DS computation is robust. How is this the case? This deserves more exploration. If the E vs. I RFs are spatially offset, as suggested, and that is the whole story, the mechanism should only work over a reasonably small range of speeds. Do some speeds depend on the ACh to GABA offset and others depend on the glutamate to GABA offset? Since the ACh RF is larger, it should be tuned to higher speeds.</p><p>A nice experiment to clear this up would be a careful measurement of the RF of each of the 3 synaptic components (ACh, glutamate, and GABA) with small spots of light. The authors have the genetic and pharamacological tools to make these measurements. With these spatial RFs, one could construct a simple linear model of how they could give you a temporal offset and over what speeds the temporal offset would be effective in preventing null direction spikes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The paper by Hanson and colleagues investigates, and answers, two central questions concerning direction selectivity in the mammalian retina: a) what is the mechanism underlying direction selectivity in starburst amacrine cells?, and b) what is the mechanism underlying direction selectivity in the direction selective ganglion cells? In brief, knowledge about the first question allows the authors to make starburst amacrine cells non-directional and to investigate the source of direction selectivity in ganglion cells. Surprisingly, they find ganglion cells to remain directionally selective when fed with non-directional signals from amacrine cells. As demonstrated by further analysis, the relative timing of excitatory and inhibitory input from amacrine cells is sufficient for direction selectivity, even when the amplitudes of these signals are the same for preferred and null direction motion.</p><p>To me, this is an extremely important piece of work, which will have a strong impact on the field. My only concern is the way the data are presented: here I see room for improvement.</p><p>Quite in general, the two questions mentioned above need to be better separated and presented as such. For someone not in the field, the discovery about the origin of direction selectivity in amacrine cells is almost invisible. The authors should clearly mark their findings as such and discuss what kind of model for amacrine cell direction selectivity they favor and which can be firmly excluded. As an example, the way I understand the data, one can now exclude a pure electrotonic summation of postsynaptic excitation as a source for direction selectivity: without inhibitory amacrine-amacrine synapses, no direction selectivity remains in response to channelrhodopsin-stimulation. Along the same line, the authors need to discuss the source of the timing difference between the excitatory and the inhibitory inputs to ganglion cells and present a network model, at least a scheme, which explains their findings. Lastly, the role of cholinergic transmission is only explicitly mentioned at the end of the manuscript: I would put the mysterious role of acetylcholine in this circuit right in the beginning and get back to it at the end.</p><p>As another general comment, the manuscript in its current form is rather inaccessible to non-specialists: the circuit needs to be introduced and current hypotheses need to be explained. Only then can the reader fully appreciate the astonishing results. The current manuscript seems to be written as a short report, but there is no need for that: it should have full length with more figures.</p><p>Once the manuscript is structured and extended in the way outlined above, this should make a beautiful publication and a major contribution to our understanding of the mechanism underlying direction selectivity in the retina. Congratulations!</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Retinal direction selectivity in the absence of asymmetric starburst amacrine cell responses&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

I think this could be further improved in two ways. First, it would be nice to include a simple anatomical diagram in the figure showing connections between starburst amacrines and DS ganglion cells. This could include the paracrine nature of ACh release and the asymmetric GABAergic synapses. Second, there are several places in the text in which referring back to the figure could be helpful to remind a reader of the basic model.</p><p>Subsection “Retinal direction selectivity in the absence of asymmetric starburst amacrine cell responses”, second paragraph: the transition here is abrupt.

Second, the relative timing of excitatory and inhibitory inputs is difficult to appreciate given the differences in scale (particularly true in Figure 3G, but also to a lesser extent in Figure 3A and D). Can you add a normalized version of those traces to facilitate a temporal comparison?</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken several steps to better characterize and more clearly present E/I timing differences, as described below:</p><p>– We have now described how onsets of excitation and inhibition were measured and marked the onsets on current traces, and shaded E/I windows (Figure 4)</p><p>– As suggested, we now show EPSCs/IPSCs recorded from the same DSGC, before and after application of HEX (now Figure 5)</p><p>– We also quantify the effect of HEX on E/I offsets across 8 stimulus directions, and demonstrate that excitation is consistently delayed by ~25ms (Figure 5)</p><p>– We performed new control experiments to ensure that delays observed in HEX do not arise from voltage-clamp errors associated with large inhibitory conductances (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>– We also measured E/I offsets in the presence of HEX across a range of velocities (Figure 6B)</p><p>– To facilitate comparison of the EPSC timing differences in control and HEX, we have added the normalized versions of the EPSCs in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Variability in magnitude of inhibitory input. The measured inhibitory inputs vary widely in amplitude (e.g. Figure 1E) – even when recorded for similar stimuli. This raises concerns about experiments in which comparisons are made across recording conditions or across mice. Do you have an explanation for the variability in inhibitory input? Some discussion of that would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>The variability in the IPSCs (now in Figure 2E) could arise from differences in ChR2 expression levels and/or run down of ChR2 responses over the course of the recording session (which could last up to 8 hours). However, within a single cell we found that the responses and the directional tuning was stable across trials and hence we chose to include the weaker responses in our dataset. These points have been included in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Ch2R activation. It is not clear from the main text how Ch2R activation was used to produce motion signals in the SACs. This is slightly clearer from reading the methods, but only filling in some retina-specific details about the orderly spatial arrangement of SACs. This should get described clearly in the Results with a non-retina reader in mind.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we better describe the DS circuit in the Introduction, highlighting the inhibitory connections between anti-parallel SAC dendrites.</p><p>We have also included details in the Results section regarding the methods used for ChR2 activation and how this technique was used to manipulate the starburst mechanisms of direction selectivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Details of modeling. The model of Figure 4 needs to be described in considerably more detail. One specific issue is that it is not clear how much of the model is constrained from experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised methods, the computational model has been presented in greater detail. In the model, the kinetics of the synaptic inputs were modeled based on experimentally measured miniature events, and as such produce macroscopic inhibitory and excitatory currents that are well-matched to those measured experimentally at the soma. These are illustrated in Figure 7—figure supplement 2. The code for the model has also been made publicly available (<underline>https://github.com/geoffder/Spatial-Offset-DSGC-NEURON-Model</underline>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second issue is how spikes are generated in the model.</p></disp-quote><p>In our model, spikes originate in the active dendritic arbours of the DSGC. Dendrites and the soma were endowed with voltage-gated sodium and potassium conductances. This enabled local synaptic inputs to generate dendritic spikes, which forward propagate and generate full-blown somatic action potentials with high fidelity, as observed experimentally (Sivyer et al., 2013). This information has been included in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] In general, the manuscript is well written, and the data are clear and compelling.</p><p>My major concern is that the authors need to do a better job connecting the spatial offset that underlies this phenomenon to its description as a temporal offset. The experiments presented in Figure 2B explore a large range of speeds and show that the temporal offset DS computation is robust. How is this the case? This deserves more exploration. If the E vs. I RFs are spatially offset, as suggested, and that is the whole story, the mechanism should only work over a reasonably small range of speeds. Do some speeds depend on the ACh to GABA offset and others depend on the glutamate to GABA offset? Since the ACh RF is larger, it should be tuned to higher speeds.</p></disp-quote><p>We took several steps to do a better job of relating spatial and temporal offsets:</p><p>– We examined E/I offsets at different velocities (new Figure 6B)</p><p>– We tested the role of cholinergic excitation in mediating offsets at different velocities using pharmacology (new Figure 6B)</p><p>– In the insets in Figure 6B, we plot the spatial offsets (estimated as velocity * temporal offset) and show it to be relatively constant across velocity</p><p>– We constructed a computer model DSGC, which was driven with a fixed E/I ratio but variable timing offsets (according to our experimental results mentioned above). As the reviewer suspects, the direction selectivity was stable for most velocities, except the slowest velocity tested (Figure 6). However, in real DSGCs, DSI was stable across velocity indicating additional mechanisms may exist to compensate for the expected deterioration of DS arising from spatial offsets. We have added these points to the Discussion section. (Also see the response to reviewer 1’s first question.)</p><p>– Also, while it is true that ACh RF is larger, it is dynamic. Only one half is activated for every direction, since the release of ACh is presumably directional.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A nice experiment to clear this up would be a careful measurement of the RF of each of the 3 synaptic components (ACh, glutamate, and GABA) with small spots of light. The authors have the genetic and pharamacological tools to make these measurements. With these spatial RFs, one could construct a simple linear model of how they could give you a temporal offset and over what speeds the temporal offset would be effective in preventing null direction spikes.</p></disp-quote><p>RF measurements using small spots might not reveal the spatial extent of cholinergic excitation accurately, as static stimuli do not optimally stimulate starburst dendrites. In fact, such RF measurements made in the rabbit DSGCs failed to reveal offset cholinergic inputs (Fried et al., 2005; Yang and Masland, 1994). Thus, we felt the simple mapping technique was not likely to be fruitful. We have included these points in the Discussion. On the other hand, our biophysical model using experimentally driven synaptic inputs (in response to moving stimuli) nicely recapitulates the DSGC’s response properties, including the temporal evolution of the DS tuning (Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] To me, this is an extremely important piece of work, which will have a strong impact on the field. My only concern is the way the data are presented: here I see room for improvement.</p><p>Quite in general, the two questions mentioned above need to be better separated and presented as such. For someone not in the field, the discovery about the origin of direction selectivity in amacrine cells is almost invisible. The authors should clearly mark their findings as such and discuss what kind of model for amacrine cell direction selectivity they favor and which can be firmly excluded. As an example, the way I understand the data, one can now exclude a pure electrotonic summation of postsynaptic excitation as a source for direction selectivity: without inhibitory amacrine-amacrine synapses, no direction selectivity remains in response to channelrhodopsin-stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we now make it clear in the Introduction that this study makes two major advancements; one relating to DS in amacrine cell dendrites, the other to DS in ganglion cells</p><p>The reviewer is correct in stating that dendritic filtering is unlikely to play an important role. However, we choose to interpret the data conservatively for the following reasons. First, it is not clear how ChR2 stimulates starburst release. It is possible that the artificial activation of starbursts using optogenetics does not recruit dendritic voltage-gated channels that may underlie direction selectivity. Second, the removal of GABAergic inhibition between starbursts may hinder or occlude intrinsic DS mechanisms. Third, it is also possible that the limited set of stimuli (moving spots) which we utilized were not optimally designed to recruit cell intrinsic mechanisms. These points are made in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along the same line, the authors need to discuss the source of the timing difference between the excitatory and the inhibitory inputs to ganglion cells and present a network model, at least a scheme, which explains their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned previously, we now present schematics of the different possible configurations of the DS circuit and highlight how offset cholinergic excitation might generate E/I timing differences (Figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, the role of cholinergic transmission is only explicitly mentioned at the end of the manuscript: I would put the mysterious role of acetyl choline in this circuit right in the beginning and get back to it at the end.</p><p>As another general comment, the manuscript in its current form is rather inaccessible to non-specialists: the circuit needs to be introduced and current hypotheses need to be explained. Only then can the reader fully appreciate the astonishing results. The current manuscript seems to be written as a short report, but there is no need for that: it should have full length with more figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for these suggestions. We have now introduced the role of ACh earlier and reformatted the manuscript to a full-length form with 7 figures (instead of the original 4). We hope in the revised form it is more accessible to the non-specialist.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a revision of a paper describing a new mechanism for direction selectivity in the retina. The authors did a good job responding to the first set of reviews, and the paper has improved considerably. I think there are a few additional changes that could help improve the clarity of the paper for a general audience, as detailed below.</p><p>Figure 1: This figure sets up the paper nicely and helps clarify the issues to be tested. I think this could be further improved in two ways. First, it would be nice to include a simple anatomical diagram in the figure showing connections between starburst amacrines and DS ganglion cells. This could include the paracrine nature of ACh release and the asymmetric GABAergic synapses. Second, there are several places in the text in which referring back to the figure could be helpful to remind a reader of the basic model.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added two new diagrams to illustrate the DSGC circuitry (Figure 1A) and the starburst-DSGC connectivity (Figure 1B), to better understand why paracrine ACh has been postulated. We have referred to these diagrams wherever appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Retinal direction selectivity in the absence of asymmetric starburst amacrine cell responses”, second paragraph: the transition here is abrupt. It would also help to refer back to Figure 1B here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following statement to smooth the transition: “We hypothesized that asymmetries in the timing of E and I arising from the differential functional starburst-DSGC connectivity gives rise to a parallel DS mechanism (Figure 1D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Differential transmission of ACh/GABA under physiological conditions”, second paragraph: the different spatial offsets that are important could get laid out more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-worked this section and moved it to the Discussion. It now reads:</p><p>“We found that the degree which cholinergic inputs advance the response is proportional to stimulus velocity, corresponding to a fixed spatial offset ~ 30 µm.

[…] It is also important to note that the broadening of the tuning curve did not arise simply from a thresholding effect (i.e. an iceberg effect), as the last spikes at the tail end of the response were not sharply tuned (data not shown).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
