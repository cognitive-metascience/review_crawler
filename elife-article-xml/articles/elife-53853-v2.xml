(OAD) is a unique primary-active transporter that utilizes the free energy derived from oxaloacetate decarboxylation for sodium transport across the cell membrane. It is composed of 3 subunits: the α subunit catalyzes carboxyl-transfer from oxaloacetate to biotin, the membrane integrated β subunit catalyzes the subsequent carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation and the coupled sodium transport, the γ subunit interacts with the α and β subunits and stabilizes the OAD complex. We present here structure of the <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> OAD βγ sub-complex. The structure revealed that the β and γ subunits form a β<sub>3</sub>γ<sub>3</sub> hetero-hexamer with extensive interactions between the subunits and shed light on the OAD holo-enzyme assembly.

The oxaloacetate decarboxylase sodium pump (OAD) is the first identified sodium pump responsible for maintaining the sodium gradient in microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dimroth, 1980</xref>). It is found in many bacteria and archaea including the human pathogens <italic>Klebsiella aerogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dimroth, 1980</xref>), <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwarz et al., 1988</xref>), <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wifling and Dimroth, 1989</xref>) and <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jain et al., 1996</xref>). It plays a critical role in the anaerobic citrate fermentation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dimroth et al., 2001</xref>), and has been shown to be important for the pathogenicity of certain pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jain et al., 1996</xref>). OAD utilizes the free energy derived from oxaloacetate decarboxylation to drive sodium transport across the cell membrane. It is composed of α, β and γ subunits. Biotin serves as the carrier for the carboxyl group in its reaction and is covalently linked to the biotin-carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domain in the α subunit C terminus. The carboxyltransferase (CT) domain in the α subunit catalyzes the carboxyl-transfer from oxaloacetate to biotin; the β subunit catalyzes the subsequent carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation and the coupled sodium transport; the γ subunit stabilizes the OAD complex by interacting with the α and β subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dimroth et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>OAD belongs to the decarboxylase sodium pump family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dimroth et al., 2001</xref>). Members in this family also include methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylases (MCD), glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase (GCD) and malonate decarboxylase (MAD). They utilize the free energy derived from decarboxylating the relevant substrates to drive sodium transport across the cell membrane, and constitute a unique family of primary-active transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saier et al., 2016</xref>). MCD and GCD catalyze a two-step decarboxylation/sodium transport reaction similar to the OAD reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckel, 2001</xref>). Their CT and BCCP domains are encoded by separated α and γ subunits, respectively. Their β subunits are highly homologous to the OAD β subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). They also form stable complexes and contain a scaffolding δ subunit homologous to the OAD γ subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckel, 2001</xref>). MAD catalyzes a more complex reaction. The <italic>Malonomonas rubra</italic> MAD transfers the carboxyl group in malonate to a specific acyl carrier protein before to biotin. Its MadB component catalyzes the subsequent carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation and sodium transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimroth and Hilbi, 1997</xref>). MadB is homologous to the OAD β subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>).</p><p>Structural studies of the CT domains in OAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Studer et al., 2007</xref>) and GCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wendt et al., 2003</xref>) have provided insights into their substrate decarboxylation. Homologues of the CT and BCCP domains in decarboxylase sodium pumps are found in many biotin-dependent enzymes. Structural studies on these enzymes have also shed light on their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jitrapakdee and Wallace, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tong, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waldrop et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, little is known about the structure of other components in decarboxylase sodium pumps, and the mechanism of their sodium transport is poorly understood. We present here structure of the <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> OAD (<italic>St</italic>OAD) βγ sub-complex. The structure revealed that the β and γ subunits form a β<sub>3</sub>γ<sub>3</sub> hetero-hexamer with extensive interactions between subunits and provides insights into the OAD holo-enzyme assembly. The structure and structure-guided functional studies provided insights into the sodium binding sites in the β subunit and identified a number of residues critical for its function. Our data suggest an ‘elevator mechanism’ for the sodium transport by the OAD β subunit and provide insights into its coupling with carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall structure of the <italic>St</italic>OAD βγ sub-complex</title><p>We initially attempted to study the structure of the <italic>St</italic>OAD holoenzyme and expressed it in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli)</italic> and purified it through a 6x Histidine tag engineered to the N-terminus of the γ subunit and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA). The purified complex was crystallized with vapor diffusion, and the crystals diffracted to a maximum resolution of 4.4 Å at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis revealed that they do not contain the α subunit, suggesting that it dissociated during crystallization and the βγ sub-complex is more stable. We further purified the βγ sub-complex, which appears to be well-folded judged by our gel filtration experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although it crystallized, the crystals did not diffract better. Dynamic light scattering experiments indicated that it has a molecular weight of 250 kDa, suggesting that it is suitable for cryo-electron microscopy (EM) studies. We carried out cryo-EM experiments and determined its structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a–d</xref>) to an overall resolution of 3.88 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3e</xref>). Resolution of the core regions reaches 3.6 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3f</xref>). The excellent density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a–e</xref>) allowed us to place all the non-hydrogen atoms for residues 13–432 in the β subunit. Additional poorer densities were found for an α helix about 40 amino acids in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4f</xref>). Since most residues in the β subunit were accounted for, residues 2–43 in the γ subunit were assigned to this helix based on secondary structure prediction and density features. The structure agrees well with the experimental data and expected geometric values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Although 100 mM of sodium chloride was included in the protein buffer, no obvious densities for sodium ions were observed, probably due to the moderate resolution. Using the cryo-EM structure as the search model, we determined the crystal structure of the βγ sub-complex by molecular replacement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). No major conformational differences were found between the cryo-EM and the crystal structures. In the remainder of the manuscript we will mainly discuss the cryo-EM structure, since its resolution is higher.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM data collection and structure refinement statistics</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">Cryo-EM structure of the <italic>St</italic>OAD βγ sub-complex (PDB 6IWW)</th></tr><tr><th valign="top">Data collection and procession</th><th valign="top"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Magnification (nominal)</td><td valign="top">105,000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Voltage (kV)</td><td valign="top">300</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Electron exposure (e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>)</td><td valign="top">50 (32 frames)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Defocus range (μm)</td><td valign="top">1.0–3.5</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Pixel size (Å)</td><td valign="top">0.68</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Symmetry imposed</td><td valign="top">C3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Initial particle images (no.)</td><td valign="top">260,982</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Final particle images (no.)</td><td valign="top">75,699</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Map resolution (Å)</td><td valign="top">3.88</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">FSC threshold</td><td valign="top">0.143</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Refinement</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Initial model used</td><td valign="top">EMBUILDER generated model</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Model resolution (Å)</td><td valign="top">3.88</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">FSC threshold</td><td valign="top">0.143</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Map sharpening B factor (Å<sup>2</sup>)</td><td valign="top">−250</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Model composition</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Non-hydrogen atoms</td><td valign="top">10,227</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Protein residues</td><td valign="top">1386</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ligands</td><td valign="top">3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">B-factors (Å<sup>2</sup>)</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Protein</td><td valign="top">41.7</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ligand</td><td valign="top">23.9</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">R.m.s deviations</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Bond lengths (Å)</td><td valign="top">0.008</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Bond angles (°)</td><td valign="top">1.016</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Validation</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Molprobity score</td><td valign="top">1.61</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Clashscore</td><td valign="top">5.83</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Poor rotamers (%)</td><td valign="top">0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ramachandran plot</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Favored</td><td valign="top">95.78</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Allowed (%)</td><td valign="top">4.22</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Disallowed (%)</td><td valign="top">0</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The structure revealed that the β and γ subunits form a β<sub>3</sub>γ<sub>3</sub> hetero-hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>). The expected molecular weight estimated by dynamic light scattering is larger than that of the hexamer (168 kDa), likely due to detergent molecules bound to the hexamer. The β subunits form a trimer at the center of the hexamer, the γ subunits are located in the periphery. One side of the β subunit trimer is predominantly positively charged, the opposite side is negatively charged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–d</xref>). The ‘positive inside rule’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">von Heijne, 1992</xref>) indicates that the positively charged side is located in the cytoplasm. This side is also concentrated with conserved residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5a–d</xref>).

Consistent with such a role, it was found that substituting the Ser419 equivalent in <italic>Kp</italic>OAD (Ser419) with alanine reduced its oxaloacetate decarboxylation activity by 90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jockel et al., 2000a</xref>).</p><p>Our mutagenesis screen identified a number of residues essential for the β subunit’s function, including Glu40, Asp203, Arg304, Asn311, Ser382 and Asn412 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Our data suggests that the Asp203, Ser382 and Asn412 side chains coordinate the sodium ions required for the OAD catalysis. They and side chains of Glu40, Arg304 and Asn311, may have additional functions. For instance, serval of them may participate in coordinating the biotin moiety, and/or in relaying the proton required for carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation. These residues are all located in the putative sodium-binding cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Our ITC experiments suggest that sodium and proton compete for binding to this cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Together, these data are consistent with a model that carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation takes place in the sodium-binding cavity. Sodium binding to the cavity could facilitate the release of proton for carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation, providing an explanation for the sodium requirement for continuous oxaloacetate decarboxylation by OAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dimroth, 1982</xref>). However, it remains to be established that the proton competes with sodium for binding is the same proton for carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation, and the possibility that this reaction takes place elsewhere cannot be ruled out. To pinpoint the location of carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation and understand the functional roles of the important residues we identified a clear picture of how carboxyl-biotin interacts with the β subunit is required.</p><p>Both inward- and outward-open conformations have been captured by structural studies on several sodium transporters including CitS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wöhlert et al., 2015</xref>), NapA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Coincon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2013</xref>) and NhaP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paulino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wöhlert et al., 2014</xref>). These studies revealed that an ‘elevator-like’ motion of their substrate binding domain against their scaffold domain transports the substrates across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drew and Boudker, 2016</xref>). Their substrate binding and scaffold domains are homologous to the core and scaffold domains in the <italic>St</italic>OAD β subunit, respectively. In the <italic>St</italic>OAD β subunit, the interface between the core and scaffold domains are primarily composed of hydrophobic residues, which could facilitate a similar elevator-like motion. In addition, our data suggests that sodium ions probably bind to equivalent locations in the <italic>St</italic>OAD β subunit, CitS and NhaP. These data suggest that the OAD β subunit may also utilize a similar ‘elevator mechanism’ for sodium transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). The competition of sodium and proton for binding to the inward-open β subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>) is consistent with a model that the ‘elevator’ movement also transport the proton for carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Our model is consistent with the reported reversibility of decarboxylase sodium pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dimroth and Hilpert, 1984</xref>), and may provide a mechanism for the observed inside/outside sodium exchange by OAD in the absence of pyruvate and oxaloacetate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dimroth and Thomer, 1993</xref>). In this condition the enzyme cannot catalyze functional cycles, either forward or backward; however, the β subunit can interconvert between sodium-bound outward- and inward-open conformations, and thus catalyze the passive exchange of sodium across the membrane.</p><p>Our ITC experiments and proposed OAD reaction cycle suggest a precise coordination of the OAD components during the reaction. Under most physiological conditions, the sodium concentration exceeds the proton concentration a million- to a billion- fold. The absolute dissociation constants for proton and sodium determined by our ITC experiments differ less than 500-fold. Therefore, under most physiological conditions, the inward-open β subunit is prone to lose the bound proton due to competitive sodium binding. If it is the same proton for carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation, our model suggests that the inward proton transport by the β subunit (state 5 to 1 depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>) is accompanied by a synchronized carboxyl-biotin transfer to the β subunit, or the proton is lost to solution by competitive sodium binding.</p><p>Based on conservation and predicted locations in the protein, a number of residues in the <italic>Kp</italic>OAD β subunit have been selected for mutagenesis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Di Berardino and Dimroth, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jockel et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jockel et al., 2000b</xref>).

In addition to Asp203 and Ser382, it was found that substitutions on Tyr229, Asn373 and Gly377 in the <italic>Kp</italic>OAD β subunit also severely affected its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jockel et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jockel et al., 2000b</xref>). The equivalent residues in the <italic>St</italic>OAD β subunit are Tyr229, Asn373 and Gly377. The Tyr229 side chain in T5 forms a hydrogen bond with the Leu343 main chain carbonyl in the nearby T9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3b</xref>). The Asn373 side chain N-terminal to H2 forms a hydrogen bond with the Glu249 main chain carbonyl C-terminal to T5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3c</xref>). Gly377 in H2 packs against T9 and the space between them cannot accommodate an amino acid side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3d</xref>). Therefore, Tyr229, Asn373 and Gly377 are important for the proper folding of the core domain. Substitutions on these residues likely disrupt the function of the β subunit by distorting its structure.</p><p>The extensive interactions between the β and γ subunits suggest that they form a similar β<sub>3</sub>γ<sub>3</sub> hetero-hexamer in the OAD holoenzyme. In a recent study on <italic>Vc</italic>OAD2, blue native PAGE analysis of the complex revealed multiple species; two species with molecular weights of 530 kDa and 750 kDa were found to contain all three subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balsera et al., 2011</xref>). These two species may represent βγ sub-complexes associated with different numbers of α subunits, suggesting that the association of the α subunit and the βγ sub-complex is dynamic. Our blue native PAGE experiments of the anti-HA agarose-purified <italic>St</italic>OAD complex also revealed species of similar molecular weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1h</xref>), although it remains to be seen whether they contain the α subunit. The γ subunit C-terminal tail binds to the α subunit with a 1:2 molar ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balsera et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that the β<sub>3</sub>γ<sub>3</sub> hetero-hexamer can bind up to 6 α subunits. The α subunit consists of CT, AD and BCCP domains. The isolated α subunit is dimeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balsera et al., 2011</xref>), probably through dimeric interactions of its CT domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Studer et al., 2007</xref>). In our structure, the last residue visible in the three γ subunits (Phe43) are located ~65 Å apart. A simple modeling indicates that three α subunit dimers can simultaneously interact with the three γ subunit C-terminal tails in the β<sub>3</sub>γ<sub>3</sub> hetero-hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). The modelled α subunits dimerize through their CT domains. One of the AD domains in each α subunit dimer interacts with the γ subunit C-terminal tail. The model suggests that interactions between the α subunit dimers may also exist and play a role in stabilizing the OAD complex, consistent with a recent study that the isolated γ subunit C-terminal tail promotes the formation of α subunit tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balsera et al., 2011</xref>).

In the γ subunit, the predicted amphipathic helix that likely interacts with the AD domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balsera et al., 2011</xref>) is linked to the transmembrane helix with a 20-residues linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

For instance, the γ subunit interacts with both the core and scaffold domains in the β subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In the proposed ‘elevator’ movement for sodium transport, the relative orientation of the core and scaffold domains changes drastically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). A synchronous conformational change in the γ subunit is expected, which may be in turn coupled to conformational changes in the α subunit. Such synchronization of the α and β subunits may play a role in coordinating their activities.</p><p>Our study provided important insights into OAD’s function. However, a full understanding of the molecular mechanism requires extensive future studies. The ‘elevator mechanism’ we proposed is largely based on structural homologies to CitS and other transporters, which needs to be verified and improved by additional structures of the β subunit at different stages in the reaction cycle. Structural studies of the β subunit in complex with biotin and other substrates are needed to elucidate where carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation takes place and how it drives the sodium transport. Importantly, how oxaloacetate decarboxylation is coupled to sodium transport is poorly understood. Structural studies of the OAD holo-enzymes could provide valuable insights into this process.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>)</td><td><italic>St</italic>OAD</td><td>GenBank</td><td>GenBank: CP007235.2, bases 836524–839869</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21 star (DE3)</td><td>Thermo Fischer</td><td>C602003</td><td>Chemical competent cells</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-HA (rabbit monoclonal)</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>Cat# 3724S</td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>HRP-linked anti-rabbit IgG (goat polyclonal)</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>Cat# 7074P2</td><td>1:2000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>HRP-linked anti-6x Histidine tag (goat polyclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat# ab1269</td><td>1:5000</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>St</italic>OAD-pET28a (plasmid)</td><td>This paper, Materials and methods</td><td/><td><italic>St</italic>OAD expersion, can be obtained from the Xiang lab</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>St</italic>OAD-β/CitS-pET28a (plasmid)</td><td>This paper, Materials and methods</td><td/><td><italic>St</italic>OAD β/CitS variant expersion, can be obtained from the Xiang lab</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td><italic>St</italic>OADα- pET28a (plasmid)</td><td>This paper, Materials and methods</td><td/><td><italic>St</italic>OAD α subunit expersion, can be obtained from the Xiang lab</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>NativePAGE Novex Bis-Tris gel</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td>Cat# BN1001BOX</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>DYNAMICS V6</td><td>Wyatt Technologies</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MotionCor2</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zheng et al., 2017</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>CTFFIND4</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>e2boxer.py</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tang et al., 2007</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>RELION</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scheres, 2012</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>EMAN</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ludtke et al., 1999</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>EMBUILDER</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhou et al., 2017</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>COOT</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>PHENIX</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ResMap</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kucukelbir et al., 2014</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Dali server</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holm and Rosenström, 2010</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>HKL2000</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Otwinowski and Minor, 1997</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MOLREP</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vagin and Teplyakov, 1997</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ORIGIN 7.0</td><td>Originlab</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>QTIPLOT</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qtiplot.com">www.qtiplot.com</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The <italic>St</italic>OAD operon was amplified from the <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> genome and inserted into vector pET28a (Novagene).

Here, Xiang and co-workers report a partial structure of a bacterial protein complex whose function is to generate such a Na<sup>+</sup> gradient, through a conformational cycle that couples a decarboxylation reaction with Na<sup>+</sup> translocation across the membrane. Specifically, the manuscript describes a cryo-EM structure for the β and γ submits of the oxaloacetate decarboxylase (OAD) complex. The OAD complex decarboxylates oxaloacetate to pyruvate. This chemical process somehow results in sodium extrusion across the membrane. In this way the catabolism of oxaloacetate is used to power the generation of a sodium gradient. To date, the molecular mechanism of OAD has remained enigmatic. The manuscript describes an important piece of the puzzle. Interestingly, the structure of the β subunit is highly similar to other secondary-active transporters belonging to the CPA/AT superfamily. More specifically, the structure of OAD most closely resembles the sodium-coupled citrate symporter (CitS). The structure of CitS has been determined in multiple conformations and has been shown to operate by an elevator alternating-access mechanism. Based on this structural similarity, a mechanism for OAD is proposed. Combined with functional and binding assays, this study constitutes a significant advancement in our understanding of this class of systems, and will no doubt foster new experimental and theoretical work. The study was perceived by reviewers as technically sound, scientifically rigorous, and presented logically. These merits notwithstanding, reviewers and editors agree that key aspects of the study require further development before the manuscript can be accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is essential for the authors to show the mutants used in the functional assay are well folded (gel filtration traces).</p><p>2) The mechanistic model outlined in Figure 6 describes two very different – and seemingly contradictory – processes. When the transporter is outward-facing, the release of Na<sup>+</sup> permits the recognition of an external proton; binding of Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> to this state is therefore implicitly assumed to be competitive, as in conventional sodium-proton antiporters. The model postulates something very different for the inward-facing conformation, however – namely that Na<sup>+</sup> must bind concurrently with H<sup>+</sup>, and that only upon decarboxylation of carboxyl-biotin is the H<sup>+</sup> released (i.e. transferred to biotin). If confirmed, the notion that Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> binding to the same transporter can be synergistic in one conformation but competitive in another would be quite remarkable. Thus, we believe this element requires further analysis. As has been demonstrated for other membrane protein systems that bind Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> (Leone et al., 2015; Hariharan and Guan, 2017), ITC experiments carefully designed to minimize initial Na<sup>+</sup> contamination and carried out at different pH values and/or with different buffers of varying protonation enthalpy can convincingly probe whether binding of Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> is synergistic or competitive, and in some cases, reveal their stoichiometric ratio. It seems likely that the purified protein sample examined by the authors by ITC primary reflects the same conformation observed in the cryo-EM images, i.e. the inward-facing state of the β subunit. The authors should therefore pursue this type of experiments, particularly for the WT and if possible also for selected mutants (e.g. Glu40), and contrast their results with the hypotheses outlined in Figure 6. Use of Tris-HCl buffer may help this assay if Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> binding are interdependent.</p><p>3) The ITC results should include the thermograms, which can be shown as supplementary information.

The structure of the β subunit of OAD is interesting, but the major question is how decarboxylation of oxaloacetate to pyruvate is coupled to Na<sup>+</sup> transport? This manuscript does not appear to answer this question, as the α subunit of OAD could not be co-purified for structural determination. The authors should make it much clearer what &quot;has&quot; and &quot;has not&quot; been shown by this study. In reality, the authors have presented an elevator alternating-access mechanism that is inferred from that observed the citrate transporter CitS and more distantly related Na+/H? exchangers (<italic>eLife</italic> 2015 4:e09375; Scientific Reports 2017 7:2548).

Here, Xiang and co-workers report a partial structure of a bacterial protein complex whose function is to generate such a Na<sup>+</sup> gradient, through a conformational cycle that couples a decarboxylation reaction with Na<sup>+</sup> translocation across the membrane. Specifically, the manuscript describes a cryo-EM structure for the β and γ submits of the oxaloacetate decarboxylase (OAD) complex. The OAD complex decarboxylates oxaloacetate to pyruvate. This chemical process somehow results in sodium extrusion across the membrane. In this way the catabolism of oxaloacetate is used to power the generation of a sodium gradient. To date, the molecular mechanism of OAD has remained enigmatic. The manuscript describes an important piece of the puzzle. Interestingly, the structure of the β subunit is highly similar to other secondary-active transporters belonging to the CPA/AT superfamily. More specifically, the structure of OAD most closely resembles the sodium-coupled citrate symporter (CitS). The structure of CitS has been determined in multiple conformations and has been shown to operate by an elevator alternating-access mechanism. Based on this structural similarity, a mechanism for OAD is proposed, whereby the catalytic reaction powers the translocation of Na<sup>+</sup> uphill, utilizing a H<sup>+</sup> in the process. This system is thus distinct from primary-active ion transporters, which are energized by ATP hydrolysis, and from most secondary-active transporters, which are energized by downhill uptake of ions. Combined with functional and binding assays, this study constitutes a significant advancement in our understanding of this class of systems, and will no doubt foster new experimental and theoretical work. The study was perceived by reviewers as technically sound and scientifically rigorous. These merits notwithstanding, reviewers and editors agreed that key aspects of the study required further development, and invited a revision. The reviewers found the revised manuscript to have improved. However, key concerns remain pertaining to the interpretation and discussion of some of the results. No new experimental data is required at this point, but the authors are strongly encouraged to pursue experiments designed to reveal the location of the site of decarboxylation reaction.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The newly provided ITC data probing the interplay between Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>, most probably for the inward facing state, is a strong indication that these ions compete for the same binding site, as in the conventional Na+/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters that are closely related to this system. However, neither the mechanistic diagram presented in Figure 6 or the related text seem to have been altered in the light of this key finding. The competitive model that stems from the ITC data implies that state 2 does not actually exist as drawn, i.e. an inward-facing state with both Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> bound concurrently. Instead, the new data suggests that the state that follows state 1 must be one in which the proton has already transferred out (either to the decarboxylation site or other proton-buffering site in the protein or the solvent) before Na<sup>+</sup> ions can bind. This would be in analogy to the authors' own description of the subsequent steps in the cycle, for the outward-facing states, i.e. Na<sup>+</sup> comes off between states 5 and 4 before a proton binds between states 5 and 6. The authors must correct their scheme and explanation so that they are consistent with the newly provided ITC data – which was requested precisely to challenge the notion that competition occurs in the outward state but not in the inward state.</p><p>2) In globular proteins (e.g., <italic>E. coli</italic> biotin carboxylase) carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation reactions seem to require extensive coordination of biotin in a large domain interface, and to be further mediated via several metal ions (Waldrop et al., 2012). In the absence of direct evidence of a bound substrate, the claim that the enzymatic reaction occurs in the sodium binding cavity (Figure 5) seems too speculative – and should be discussed as such, outlining alternative interpretations and possible approaches to clarify this question. For example, it would appear just as plausible for the reaction to take place in the oligomerization interface, somehow. It is worth noting that <italic>E. coli</italic> biotin carboxylase forms a complex with ATP in the absence of biotin. By analogy future experiments could assay and identify nucleotide binding sites in OAD.</p><p>3) We strongly encourage the authors to trim down their manuscript to focus on the main scientific contributions and to improve its readability. Possible sections where the text could be more concise include the Introduction, e.g. the preamble regarding topology discrepancies or discussion of other members in the OAD family; likewise, in Results, it is unclear what mechanistic insights are gained through the comparison of the scaffold domains in β OAD to CitS and NapA and the different oligomerization of these proteins; this section could be more concise, or omitted entirely – with details added to the supplementary figures captions if needed. Finally, in Discussion, there is some repetition of the structural analysis presented earlier.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53853.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is essential for the authors to show the mutants used in the functional assay are well folded (gel filtration traces).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Figure 1—figure supplement 2 to show the gel filtration traces.

We have added our crystallographic study of the <italic>St</italic>OAD βγ sub-complex to the manuscript, which also captured the β subunit in the inward-open conformation. Our crystallographic and cryo-EM studies were performed at pH 5.5 and 7.5, respectively, suggesting that the inward-open conformation is preferred in our experimental conditions over a large pH range. Together, the ITC and structural data suggest that sodium and proton compete for binding to the negatively charged pocket in the inward-open β subunit. In the studies referenced by the reviewers(Hariharan and Guan, 2017; Leone, Pogoryelov, Meier, and Faraldo-Gomez, 2015), a strong correlation between the sodium binding enthalpy and the buffer protonation enthalpy is found. In these studies, proton is released from the protein by the competitive sodium binding. Its subsequent binding to buffer molecules contributes to the correlation. Such correlation allows the estimation of the sodium/proton stoichiometric ratio. In our experiments, such correlation was not observed, suggesting that a large fraction of the released proton does not bind to the buffer molecules. The β subunit contains a solvent exposed cluster of four histidine residues, which may bind to the released proton in our ITC experiments. We have added a “Effect of pH on Sodium binding to the <italic>St</italic>OAD βγ sub-complex” section to describe these experiments. We have also revised the Discussion to discuss the insights these new experiments brought into the mechanism of OAD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The ITC results should include the thermograms, which can be shown as supplementary information.

It has been reported that the OAD β subunit contains two sodium binding sites (Jockel, Schmid, Steuber, and Dimroth, 2000) and our structure indicates that they are probably not identical (Figure 4B). However, the thermograms of our ITC experiments appear to be uniphasic, making data fitting using more than one set of binding sites difficult(Brautigam, 2015). We fitted the ITC data with the one set of sites model. In our ITC experiments, the concentration of the <italic>St</italic>OAD βγ sub-complex (120 mM) is significantly smaller than <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> (in the millimolar range) and cannot be significantly increased due to difficulties in concentrating the sample. This makes the Wiseman “<italic>c</italic>” parameter less than 1, in which case fixing the stoichiometry number to a known number can restrain data fitting to obtain more accurate results (Turnbull and Daranas, 2003). We fixed the stoichiometry number to 2 since the β subunit contains two sodium binding sites. We have revised the related paragraph in the Materials and methods section to include the above discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors appear to gloss over the fact that the β subunit of the OAD was thought to resemble other CPA transporters as highlighted in the transporter classification data-base (http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.B.1) and Wikipedia for example (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium transporting_carboxylic_acid_decarboxylase).

We agree with the reviewers that our current study did not answer many important questions regarding OAD’s function including how oxaloacetate decarboxylation is coupled to sodium transport, and that the “elevator mechanism” is primarily based structural homology to other transporters and needs to be validated and improved. We have added a last paragraph in the Discussion section to discuss the limitations of the current study and what future studies are needed. We thought that future structural studies of the β subunit at different stages of the reaction cycle and on the OAD holo-enzyme are needed to fully understand the molecular mechanism of OAD.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The newly provided ITC data probing the interplay between Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>, most probably for the inward facing state, is a strong indication that these ions compete for the same binding site, as in the conventional Na+/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters that are closely related to this system.

Biotin carboxylase couples ATP hydrolysis with the carboxyl transfer from bicarbonate to biotin. However, neither biotin carboxylation nor carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation by OAD requires ATP or other nucleotides.
