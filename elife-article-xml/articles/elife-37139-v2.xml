Acute insult often results in axonal degeneration, and therefore many experimental strategies aim to stimulate regeneration of damaged axons. These efforts have been informed by two insights: (1) the extrinsic environment of the adult CNS is hostile to axonal growth due to the formation of a glial scar, and (2) adult CNS neurons have lost their intrinsic ability to express axon-growth-promoting factors. The inhibitory properties of the glial scar are primarily due to extracellular matrix molecules, particularly chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burnside and Bradbury, 2014</xref>). Digesting CSPG GAG chains with the bacterial enzyme chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) has been shown to promote axonal extension in several experimental models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradbury and Carter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao and Fawcett, 2013</xref>). In parallel, many approaches have endeavored to restore the intrinsic growth capability of CNS axons, most prominently through the activation of cell growth programs such as the PTEN/mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 2008</xref>). However, such approaches are not directly translatable to human patients: ChABC has failed to reach clinical trials, and manipulation of tumor suppressor genes is likely to prove clinically questionable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Increasing evidence supports a critical role for GAG chain sulfation in CSPG signaling. Global removal of sulfate groups from GAG chains eliminates the inhibitory actions of CSPGs in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smith-Thomas et al., 1995</xref>), and specific sulfation motifs dictate whether GAGs inhibit or permit axon growth. For instance, axons grow readily over surfaces coated with 6-sulfated (6S) CSPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), and deleting the enzyme that adds 6S to CS GAGs impairs axonal regeneration in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, axons avoid 4-sulfated (4S) CSPGs, an effect abolished by treatment with 4-sulfatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Sulfation at both positions (4,6S) has been shown to inhibit axonal growth in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2012</xref>), and an increase in the ratio of 4S to 6S has been linked with age-related declines in plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foscarin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyata et al., 2012</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that reducing 4S while preserving 6S on intact GAG chains may enable growing axons to overcome CSPG-mediated inhibition more effectively than indiscriminate reductions in sulfation or destruction of GAGs.</p><p>We have previously shown that the deposition of CSPGs in the glial scar following brain and spinal cord injury is dominated by 4S GAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we demonstrate the ability of arylsulfatase B (ARSB), a clinically approved enzyme that selectively removes 4S groups from the non-reducing ends of CSPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Litjens and Hopwood, 2001</xref>), to enhance axonal regeneration in vitro and in vivo. Treating CSPGs with ARSB or adding ARSB to TGF-β-treated astrocytes reverses their inhibition of neurite outgrowth by modifying CSPG sulfation. We then show that ARSB significantly enhances axon regeneration in vivo when the enzyme is delivered to the injured optic nerves of adult mice in combination with intravitreal injection of Zymosan and CPT-cAMP, an intrinsic growth stimulus. Importantly, this treatment is effective when administered several days after ONC, making it relevant for human conditions where interventions are rarely available immediately following injury. Crucially, ARSB (Naglazyme, Biomarin) is clinically approved for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis VI, a lysosomal storage disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Muñoz-Rojas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harmatz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harmatz et al., 2005</xref>); thus, its inclusion in future human therapeutic treatments is plausible. Taken together, these data establish a critical role for 4S at the non-reducing end of CS GAG chains in mediating the inhibitory actions of CSPGs. Moreover, they provide evidence for a promising translatable therapy that utilizes a highly selective human enzyme to modify chondroitin sulfation and enhance axon regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ARSB reverses the inhibition of neurite growth caused by 4-sulfated CSPGs</title><p>The ability of ARSB to alter the inhibitory actions of CSPGs was first assessed in cell culture models of the glial scar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2008</xref>).

Mouse cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) were then seeded onto these astrocytes and allowed to grow for 24 hr. Cultures were stained for GFAP and βIII-tubulin, and the lengths of CGN neurites were measured. Neurons growing on TGF-β-treated astrocytes exhibited significantly lower neurite outgrowth than those plated on untreated control astrocytes (p=0.0059, Mann-Whitney U test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–f</xref>). However, incubating TGF-β-treated co-cultures with ARSB restored average neurite length to the levels observed in untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–f</xref>), significantly different from TGF-β-treatment alone (p&lt;0.0001). This suggests that cleaving 4S from the non-reducing ends of GAG chains is sufficient to neutralize the inhibitory effects of CSPGs on neurons.</p><p>To demonstrate that ARSB acts on extracellular CSPGs, rather than being internalized into astrocytes and interfering with CSPG production or secretion, conditioned medium (CM) was collected from TGF-β-treated astrocytes and left untreated, treated with ARSB, or treated with ChABC. The isolated and treated CM was added to separately cultured CGNs. Application of CM from TGF-β-treated astrocytes significantly reduced neurite outgrowth while ARSB treatment reversed this effect to a degree equivalent to ChABC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these findings demonstrate that the presence of CSPGs can inhibit neurite outgrowth, and that this inhibition is overcome by exposing the CSPGs to either ARSB or ChABC.</p><p>To further validate that ARSB does not interfere with CSPG secretion, the level of CSPGs in CM was measured by immunoblotting with the antibody CS-56, which reacts with 4S and 6S groups on GAG chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avnur and Geiger, 1984</xref>). The increase in CSPGs caused by TGF-β treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2008</xref>) was not altered by treatment with ARSB, even after repeated additions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), indicating that its enhancement of neurite growth was derived from modifying the sulfation pattern rather than attenuating CSPG production or secretion. These data also demonstrate that CS-56 immunoreactivity is not altered by removal of 4S from the non-reducing end of CS GAG chains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Optic nerve crush leads to astrogliosis and sustained elevation of CSPGs</title><p>Injury to the CNS is accompanied by astrogliosis, characterized by the accumulation of CSPGs in a glial scar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burnside and Bradbury, 2014</xref>).

A cohort of adult mice received optic nerve crush (ONC) or non-lesioned sham surgery (in which the nerve was exposed but not crushed) and optic nerves were collected at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 days post crush (dpc). Optic nerve sections were stained with antibodies against GFAP (to identify reactive astrocytes) and Iba1 (to identify microglia and macrophages). By 7 dpc, GFAP<sup>+</sup> reactive astrocytes had retracted from the lesion site to form a cavity, which was densely populated with Iba1<sup>+</sup> microglia and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Astrocytes displayed reactive morphology, with elongated processes defining the lesion boundary. Some GFAP<sup>+</sup> cells were also found within the lesion core. Microglia in and around the lesion displayed an activated morphology, with enlarged cell bodies and retracted processes, distinct from the striated morphology of cells found distal to the injury site and in non-lesioned sham control nerves. By 21 dpc, astrocytes had begun to repopulate the cavity and form a chronic scar.</p><p>CSPGs were detected using CS-56 and 2H6, an antibody that reacts predominantly with 4S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamamoto et al., 1995</xref>), and to a lesser degree, with 6S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sugiura et al., 2012</xref>) and 2,6S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matsushita et al., 2018</xref>). In non-lesioned sham control nerves, CSPGs were evenly distributed within the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Elevated CS-56 levels at the lesion site were first observed at 5 dpc and peaked around 7 dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Levels remained high at 21 dpc. An increase in 2H6 staining was also observed, with levels reaching 2.5-fold those in non-lesioned sham controls (fold change [mean ± SE]: 2.53 ± 0.15) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The axons of injured mouse RGCs visualized with fluorescently-tagged CTB, injected intravitreally 1 d prior to tissue harvest, failed to traverse the injury site and instead formed dystrophic endbulbs that appeared to be associated with areas of high CSPG deposition, which included areas of high 4S immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). CSPGs and 4S GAGs were associated with both GFAP<sup>+</sup> and Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells in nerves examined at 7 dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these results illustrate that ONC in mice leads to astrogliosis and elevated expression of CSPGs, especially those with 4S GAGs, which is sustained for at least 21 days.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37139.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Optic nerve crush stimulates glial scar formation and sustained elevation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Micrographs show lesioned optic nerve tissue collected at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 dpc and stained for CSPGs (CS-56), 4S GAGs (2H6), reactive astrocytes (GFAP), and microglia and macrophages (Iba1).

We show that the injured optic nerve develops a glial scar rich in CSPGs, including the axon-inhibiting 4S motif. The human enzyme ARSB selectively cleaves 4S groups from the non-reducing ends of GAG chains, reducing CSPG-mediated inhibition of neurite growth in vitro. We demonstrate that ARSB promotes neurite growth in culture without altering production or secretion of GAG chains. Furthermore, ARSB enhances the regeneration of RGC axons following optic nerve injury. The treatment is robustly effective even when administered 3 days after injury, an important consideration for translational therapies. Enhanced regeneration was evident as early as 7 days post ONC and remained significant at 28 days, illustrating an extended therapeutic window from a single treatment. ARSB is active in vivo, provokes less Iba1 immunoreactivity than ChABC, and preserves perineuronal structures that depend on intact GAG chains. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the 4S motif at the non-reducing end of CS GAG chains plays a major role in mediating the inhibitory actions of CSPGs. Given the approval for ARSB as an enzyme replacement therapy in human patients, our evidence that ARSB enhances axon regeneration in the optic nerve means that future treatments could readily combine ARSB with clinically viable intrinsic approaches to achieve robust regeneration of damaged or degenerated axons in the CNS.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Sulfation dictates the effects of CSPGs on axon growth</title><p>Studies that link CSPGs to the failure of axon regeneration overwhelmingly fail to distinguish between differentially sulfated GAG chains, often showing instead that digestion of GAG chains with ChABC enhances neurite growth in vitro and axon regeneration in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradbury and Carter, 2011</xref>). The importance of sulfation in governing CSPG function has been demonstrated using sodium chlorate, which broadly eliminates GAG sulfation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smith-Thomas et al., 1995</xref>). Recent studies have characterized the behaviors of specific sulfation motifs, showing that both 4S and 4,6S inhibit neurite growth while 6S is growth-permissive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2012</xref>). An age-related increase in the ratio of 4S to 6S was linked to declines in plasticity and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foscarin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyata et al., 2012</xref>), and removal of 4S with ARSB improved motor function following spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoo et al., 2013</xref>). Blocking 4,6S with a custom antibody enhanced regeneration of RGC axons after ONC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2012</xref>), which raises the question of whether 4S and 4,6S function similarly to inhibit axonal growth, and whether ARSB might convert 4,6S motifs to 6S.</p><p>The precise mechanism of how ARSB modifies the inhibitory actions of GAG chains is unknown. ARSB did not reduce the total amount of sulfated GAG in the culture medium as detected by the anti-CS antibodies, suggesting that its effects are mediated by altering GAG chain sulfation. ARSB, a lysosomal enzyme, maintains its highest activity at acidic pH, raising the question of whether it can cleave sulfate groups from secreted CSPGs, or whether lysosomal uptake is required. We observed that ARSB cleaves 4S from extracellular GAG chains in culture medium, suggesting that its activity at neutral pH is sufficient to perform its sulfatase function. This was validated by our discovery that ARSB promotes regeneration of optic nerve axons when administered exogenously. The prominent actions of ARSB are more remarkable considering that the average length of neuronal GAG chains is about 50 disaccharide units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rauch et al., 1991</xref>). Removal of just the 4S at the non-reducing end leaves virtually the entire GAG chain intact, as demonstrated by the preservation of the immunoreactivity to CS-56, while the inhibitory activity is significantly diminished.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>CSPG deposition is a key source of axon growth inhibition in the glial scar</title><p>The formation of a glial scar, including deposition of sulfated proteoglycans, is well documented in the brain and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bradbury et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradbury and Carter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burnside and Bradbury, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galtrey and Fawcett, 2007</xref>).

This supports a critical role for CSPG deposition, rather than scar formation per se, as the primary cause of axon growth inhibition. This is consistent with findings that ablating astrocytic scar formation without reducing CSPG levels does not lead to spontaneous regeneration of axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Silver, 2016</xref>).

While such studies are valuable for identifying therapeutic targets and elucidating mechanisms of RGC axon regeneration, they are not readily translatable to human patients. We found that delivery of ARSB in conjunction with Zymosan/CPT-cAMP significantly enhanced RGC axon regeneration when administered 3 days after ONC, making a strong case for its clinical viability.</p><p>Delaying ARSB treatment may confer additional advantages: previous studies have argued that CSPG synthesis in the acute phase (0–2 dpi) may, in fact, promote recovery. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rolls et al., 2008</xref> blocked CSPG synthesis immediately after spinal cord injury in mice and found that axon regeneration and functional recovery were impaired, whereas blocking synthesis in the subacute phase (2–7 dpi) enhanced regeneration and recovery. Other studies suggest that intact CSPGs recruit blood-borne monocytes and bias macrophages toward a resolving phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shechter et al., 2011</xref>), and that CSPGs regulate the spatial organization of microglia and macrophages and promote neurotrophic factor production by resident microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rolls et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shechter et al., 2009</xref>). Stripping CSPGs of their GAG chains may impede these repair functions, whereas selectively modifying sulfation with ARSB could reduce GAG-mediated inhibition of neurons without disrupting their interactions with other cells. To demonstrate that ARSB preserves perineuronal structures composed of CSPGs, we treated mouse cortical tissue with ARSB and ChABC and showed that while ChABC eliminated perineuronal nets (PNNs), ARSB left PNNs intact.</p><p>ARSB is superior to ChABC in several other respects. ARSB has relatively lower immunogenicity and maintains its activity longer than ChABC in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoo et al., 2013</xref>).

While the durability of ARSB in vivo has not been characterized, ARSB is stable at physiological temperature and pH, meaning it should retain robust levels of activity for extended periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoo et al., 2013</xref>).

Female C57Bl/6 mice aged 6–8 weeks (Charles River) were housed in a pathogen free facility with free access to food and a standard 12 hr light/dark cycle. Sample sizes were determined by statistical power calculations from pilot experiments and the results of previous studies, as described below. Animals were randomly allocated into experimental groups. Animals were removed from the study if bleeding occurred during the optic nerve crush or scaffold implantation surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Primary hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared from embryonic (e17-18) C57Bl/6 mouse brains. Hippocampi were dissected and dissociated into single cell suspensions. Dissociated cells were seeded onto coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine and cultured in 500 μL Neurobasal medium containing B27 supplement (Thermo Fisher) and 24 mM KCl. After allowing 2 hr for neuronal attachment, 500 μL of Neurobasal medium containing B27 supplement and 24 mM KCl that had been incubated for 4 hr with no treatment, 10 µg/ml CSPG (for final concentration of 5 µg/ml), or CSPG (10 µg/ml)+ARSB (2 µg/ml) (final concentrations 5 µg/ml and 1 µg/ml, respectively) was added.

Cerebral cortices were dissected and dissociated into single cell suspension. Dissociated cells were seeded into T-75 flasks and grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere until cells grew to confluence (10–14 days). Flasks were shaken for 20 hr (120 rpm, 37°C) to detach microglia, oligodendrocytes, and neurons from the more adherent astrocytes. After shaking, the medium was replaced. Media replacement was repeated 24 hr after the shaking period.</p><p>To harvest conditioned media from reactive astrocytes, purified astrocytes were plated into T-75 flasks in serum-containing medium. After reaching confluence, astrocytes were incubated with serum-free media overnight and treated with TGF-β (10 ng/mL), ARSB (1 µg/mL), TGF-β and ARSB, or neither (untreated controls), for 7 days. After harvesting, conditioned media was centrifuged at 800 rpm for 5 min to remove debris before being split into three aliquots of 2 mL each. Aliquots were treated with no enzyme, ARSB (1 μg/mL), or ChABC (1 μL/mL) for 4 hr prior to addition to neuronal cultures.</p><p>Cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) were isolated at previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2008</xref>).

Files were analyzed by an experimenter blinded to the experimental conditions. Neurons were measured if they were isolated from other neurons and had distinct nuclei and at least one neurite longer than the diameter of the cell body. The longest neurite was measured for each neuron and at least 60 neurons were measured for each condition.

CPT-cAMP (Sigma C3912) was added to achieve a final concentration of 50 mM CPT-cAMP. Aliquots were stored at 4°C for up to two weeks. ChABC (Amsbio 100332-1A) was reconstituted at 455 µg/mL in a buffer solution containing 100 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris-HCl) and 0.1% BSA in 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS). ARSB (Naglazyme) was obtained in acidic PBS (pH 5.5) from Biomarin (San Rafael, CA). ARSB with His Tag was obtained from R and D Systems (4415-SU). Sterile gelfoam sponges were cut to roughly 2 mm<sup>3</sup> and placed to soak in a sterile tube containing 5 μL of either ChABC, ARSB, or the control buffer.

Mice were anesthetized using 1–2% isoflurane; the depth of anesthesia was confirmed by lack of response to a toe pinch. The optic nerve was exposed intraorbitally, and curved forceps were inserted beneath the external ocular muscle, avoiding the ophthalmic artery and retrobulbar sinus. The nerve was crushed approximately 1 mm behind the eye for 10 s. Immediately after the crush, eyes were monitored fundoscopically for signs of ischemia, and mice were observed for bleeding in the hours following surgery. Mice received a subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg buprenorphrine as an analgesic and topical application of ophthalmic ointment to prevent corneal drying.</p><p>For implantation of enzyme scaffolds, the optic nerve was exposed by gently reopening the conjunctiva and inserting curved forceps behind the eye. Carefully avoiding the ophthalmic artery and retrobulbar sinus, the enzyme- or buffer-soaked gelfoam scaffold was placed in direct contact with the optic nerve at the site of the crush lesion, approximately 1 mm behind the eye. Retinal blood flow was assessed fundoscopically, and mice received a subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg buprenorphrine and topical application of ophthalmic ointment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Intravitreal injection</title><p>Intravitreal injections of Zymosan or a PBS control were administered immediately following implantation of the gelfoam scaffold, and injections of CTB were administered 1 d prior to tissue harvest. 2 μL of the injecting solution was drawn into a sterile 5 μL Hamilton syringe with a 33-gauge removable needle. In the case of Zymosan injections, the syringe was inspected to ensure that the needle was not blocked by Zymosan particles. The solution was then slowly injected through the superior nasal sclera at a 45° angle, avoiding the lens, external ocular muscle, and blood vessels. A sterile 33-gauge needle was used to puncture the cornea and drain the anterior chamber before removing the injecting needle, to reduce intraocular pressure and prevent reflux of the injected solution. Different needles were used for Zymosan and PBS injections to prevent contamination, and the syringe was rinsed thoroughly with ethanol followed by sterile PBS between injections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Western blot</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Tissue preparation</title><p>Mice were anesthetized using 1–2% isoflurane and exsanguinated, followed by cervical dislocation. Optic nerves were severed between the globe and the optic and cut into four equally sized segments of approximately 1.0–1.5 mm each. Nerve segments were immediately placed in sterile 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes containing cold 40 µL lysis buffer (cOmplete Lysis-M, EDTA-free, Roche). Tissue was mechanically homogenized using a sterile pestle and centrifuged to separate un-homogenized tissue. Protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using the BCA assay (ThermoFisher).

ChABC activity was measured by spectrophotometrically detecting the production of disaccharides cleaved from the glycosaminoglycan chains of CSPGs, as has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suzuki et al., 1968</xref>).</p><p>ARSB activity was measured by detecting the cleavage of a sulfate group from p-nitrocatechol sulfate (PNCS), which yields a product with an absorbance peak at 510 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Porter et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knaust et al., 1998</xref>). To measure enzyme activity after in vivo implantation, scaffolds were recovered from freshly dissected optic nerves, placed in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, and stored on ice. 250 μL of 50 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) at pH 6.5 was added to the tube containing the recovered scaffold. After approximately 1 hr, three aliquots of 75 μL were removed from this solution and combined with 75 μL 4-PNCS in a 96-well microplate. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 24 hr, after which the reaction was quenched by adding 150 μL of 0.2 N NaOH. Absorbance was measured at 510 nm.

Four sections were counted for each nerve. The number of regenerating axons per nerve was then calculated at each distance using a previously developed formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bei et al., 2016</xref>), with the total number of axons equal to πr<sup>2</sup> (r being the maximum recorded radius of the optic nerve section) times the average number of counted axons, divided by the thickness of the section (14 µm). Axon counting was verified by a separate observer blind to the experimental conditions. For quantification of longest axon, the same images were used.

The number of regenerating axons counted at 0.50 mm distal from the lesion site was obtained from groups of mice treated with either Zymosan + ARSB (n = 4) or Zymosan + Buffer (n = 5). The control group had a mean of 104 ± 53 axons at 0.50 mm, while the ARSB-treated group had a mean of 260 ± 84 axons. Based on these numbers, we assumed a standard deviation of 75, to be equal for each group, and estimated using a two-sided two sample <italic>t</italic>-test that n = 9 mice per group would be required to achieve 80% power (at the 0.025 level) to compare ARSB treatment to a buffer control.</p><p>All statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hudson H Freeze (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. All three reviewers appreciate the quality of the science and the potential impact of chondroitin sulfating in axon regeneration. They appreciated the quality of the cell culture and animal model data, as well as the potential tor translatability to axon regeneration. However, they identified a number of flaws that will preclude publication in its current form. These center around the choice of the experimental system, the need to prime the system with zymosan, and size of the effect observed, and how these results are quantitated. Addressing these issues may be within the scope of what is possible, after consulting with reviewers, we came to the conclusion that this would be beyond what could be expected with the turnaround time that we seek at <italic>eLife</italic> for acceptance of papers for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors have taken advantage of the properties of Arylsulfatase B (ARSB) to specifically degrade C4sulphate groups on GAG chains on inhibitory proteoglycans to promote regeneration in vitro but also in vivo using an optic nerve crush model. While the use of ARSB to promote regeneration is a novel and exciting idea given that this enzyme is already approved clinically, the paper contains a number of issues that are of concern.</p><p>1) In the Introduction, the authors mention that myelin is thought to be part of the &quot;glial scar.&quot; Actually, myelin inhibitory proteins are located broadly and not thought to be specifically related to the scar.</p><p>2) Also, in the Introduction the authors champion their own work (which is reasonable) suggesting that C4S proteoglycans are those that are the most potently inhibitory. However, they do not even mention the strongly opposing and well published view from the Hsieh-Wilson lab that CS-E (rather than A) is critical. I think it would be best to mention up front that there is some controversy. Then, later, the authors can discuss how their current results help to provide evidence in support of their idea. However, it would have been welcomed if the authors had compared ARSB efficacy with CS-E specific degradation in their various models.</p><p>3) Figure 1 has a major problem in that the lengths of the control neurons with axons on untreated, TGF-b and TGF-b ARSB cultures are very similar, with very tiny differences (only around 10 um) between the groups. The same problem is apparent in the conditioned media experiments. However, the authors suggest that such small differences are statistically significant. I see no obvious differences between any of the neurons in Figure 1E suggesting that the differences really are incredibly slight. It would have been much preferable if an adult neuron (such as DRGs) would have been used and the cultures had been allowed to mature until long axons (in the controls) had been elaborated.</p><p>4) In Figure 2 the absolute levels of C4S in the optic nerve lesion is very small compared to the CS56 staining especially at day 7 which is supposedly at peak of expression. Indeed, the immunohistochemistry overall is not especially convincing. This suggests that C6S GAG moieties are in high abundance in the lesion and apparently in much greater abundance than C4S. Fold changes in C4S are not as interesting as are absolute amounts.</p><p>5) In Figure 3 there is a critical flaw. In the control optic crush animals there should be zero regeneration of axons into and past the lesion. None-the-less, the authors report regeneration of numerous axons in the controls as far as 1mm beyond the lesion. This is clear evidence of axonal sparing after lesion which confounds the interpretation of all of the data. In addition, the differences that are shown between control and ARSB treated optic nerves is again, incredibly small.</p><p>In its present form this manuscript should not be acceptable for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In their submission entitled &quot;Identification of a critical sulfation in chondroitin that inhibits axonal regeneration&quot; Pearson et al. examine the role of terminal 4S groups on GAG chains of CSPGs in imparting growth inhibiting properties of CSPGs, using the enzyme arylsulfatase B. They first show in astrocyte and neuronal coculture, or neuronal culture exposed to astrocyte conditioned medium, that ARSB performs similarly to chondroitonase ABC in restoring axonal growth potential after TGF-β induced inhibition. They then characterize an optic nerve crush model to show that 4S CSPGs are a part of the scar that forms after injury, which is present for at least 4 weeks post crush. Then the authors combine a zymosan+cAMP combinatorial treatment to induce RGC regeneration with ChABC or ARSB and show that RGC axon regeneration is improved similarly between the two treatments and can act on a delay of up to three days and does not alter astrocytic distributions.</p><p>While the finding that, in this model system, targeting 4S terminal GAG chains for cleavage can mediate effects similar to that of ChABC with an already clinically approved drug is quite interesting, overall the chosen application seems inappropriate. In the introductory sections, the authors make a strong point that ARSB is already approved for clinical use, but then they apply it to a system where ChABC itself does nothing without a combinatorial therapy that would not be seen in clinics. Without the application of this suggested therapy to an injury model where beneficial results would be expected sans untranslatable combinatorial therapies (eg spinal cord injury) a major thrust of this study is lost. I would highly recommend considering a different system for this application.</p><p>Additionally, although the authors were able to demonstrate that their delivery of ChABC was able to penetrate the optic nerve to some extent and breakdown CSPGs to some extent, they do not examine the efficiency very clearly. How much of the intact CSPGs remain should be demonstrated by immunostaining, and while it is appreciably difficult to clearly show ARSB function in vivo, it needs to be shown that the treatment worked as intended. Is there no biochemical approach to examining the GAG terminal chains?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is an important paper. It is well done, thoughtful about controls and relatively well versed in glycobiology. The results of these complicated animal studies, especially, are clearly presented and the overall results are unexpected. The rationales for carrying on further work using ARSB are clear and these initial results are hopeful.</p><p>I have no objection to the general direction, but I wonder about the need for the zymosan injection to prime the system in some way. What would be the equivalent in a patient? or what other insults would occur in a therapeutic setting? Clearly, they would hope this approach is something general and not only restricted to ONC. I think it is a well worthwhile study.</p><p>All that said, I do have some suggestions for improvement. First, I don't accept their claim of a 2.5 fold increase in 4S (antibody 2H6) as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. The level at Day &quot;0&quot; is already ~1.75 fold (not baseline of 1.0) and it is shown as an increase to 2.5 fold. That's only a 1.4 fold increase, which is about the same as the CS-56 antibody. So, there is no selectivity. It seems misleading to state that. If I have misinterpreted the data, I'd like to see their justification for the claim based on these results.</p><p>In Figure 1, there are so few tubulin staining cells. I'd like to see more pictures, perhaps a small composite. How many of these cells were actually counted? How many were in the &quot;longest&quot; category. Also, it would be helpful to see the distribution of lengths, not only the (few?) longest ones. I can't tell based on the presentation. So, I have some skepticism.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Identification of a critical sulfation in chondroitin that inhibits axonal regeneration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joseph Gleeson as the Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. Two of the three reviewers were the same and one reviewer is new for this submission. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Hudson H Freeze (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript leverages off of previous findings that implicated 4-sulfation as a mechanism of CSPG inhibition of axonal growth. The three reviewers agree that the major finding presented are that the human enzyme arylsulfatase B (ARSB), which cleaves 4-sulfate groups from glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), abrogates the inhibitory actions of chondroitin sulfate in vitro and promotes regeneration of retinal ganglion cell axons in the optic nerve. The reviewers from the previous submission appreciate the positive changes and the correction to the manuscripts of the previous errors. Reviewers commented that the work is consistent with the report of Yoo et al., 2013 using ARSB together with ChABC that suggested a comparable impact of these enzymes on locomotor function recovery after spinal cord injury. The reviewers appreciated the quality of the cell culture and animal model data and the potential impact of ARSB in axon regeneration. They mention that the study is important and well thought out, with immediate therapeutic implications and possibly applications. However, there were several concerns expressed by the reviewers that require attention before the manuscript can be further considered at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Considering the known variation associated with zymosan treatment, it is questionable how much meaningful impact ARSB has on axon regeneration. In addition, in the image in Figure 3B, &quot;labeled axons&quot; in the distal optic nerve appear to be bundled, possibly spared axons.</p><p>2) 1- CS-56 staining in conditioned media is not altered by ARSB treatment. However, 2H6 antibody has more affinity for 4S groups versus 6S. It would be interesting to document how ARSB treatment impacts the elevation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan after optic nerve crush as documented in Figure 2.</p><p>3) The authors don't provide significant data to further incriminate 4S versus 4,6S role in the inhibitory effect of CSPGs as well as any new data to specifically illustrate the fundamental role of 4S. A Title reflecting the effect of ARSB enzyme in their specific ONC paradigm will be more appropriate.</p><p>4) The representation of the data related to the neurite outgrowth does not allow assessing easily the inhibitory effect of CSPGs. Several experiments were performed in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1; however different representations of the data are used. Additionally, the authors should provide standard deviations to assess the reproducibility between triplicates.</p><p>5) The authors should provide information on the amount of enzymes used in subsection “Modifying CSPG sulfation enhances retinal ganglion cell axon regener”. One is expressed as U/ml and others as ug/ml. Please include both, even though the assays are based on rather artificial substrate measurements.</p><p>6) In subsection “Sulfation dictates the effects of CSPGs on axon growth” says that ARSB cleaves extracellular GAG chains, but only an assay using an artificial substrate is presented. Besides, the enzyme should not cleave GAG chains- it cleaves terminal 4-sulfate. That statement should be corrected or explained.</p><p>7) No data was shown on the effects of ARSB on 2H9 staining/reactivity. Presumably there is not any, since it only removes 1 sulfate per CS chain, but this should be stated explicitly.</p><p>8) The size of the CS chains in these cells/settings is not known. Presumably its 50-100 monosaccharides, but again ARSB should only remove a single 4-sulfate. This remarkably small change (1/20, 1/50, 1/100) is worth stressing, and citing relevant literature.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37139.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>This current submission has been extensively revised in response to the reviewers’ comments on our original submission. We have readily corrected two key errors (noted in the bullets below), and have additionally revised the manuscript to answer each of the other major and minor criticisms. We hope that this document summarizing our changes will persuade you to consider our revised manuscript for publication.</p><p>Having carefully read each of the reviewers’ comments, we noted that two of the major flaws highlighted by reviewers were, in fact, due to our figure presentation, rather than experimental design. Briefly, these included:</p><p>1) An omission in Figure 3 led Reviewer #1 to suggest that our optic nerve samples were detecting spared axons in negative control samples. In fact, these were regenerating axons from a Zymosan-treated control. However, we mistakenly omitted the “Zymosan” label from one panel of our graph.</p><p>2) An omission in Figure 2–Figure Supplement 1 led Reviewer #3 to question the validity of our data showing that CSPGs are elevated after optic nerve crush. We had failed to include the baseline “Day 0” condition where fold change = 1.0. We have fixed both of these errors.</p><p>Of the remaining criticisms, we address the most significant first:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) “Spared” axons in controls</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3 there is a critical flaw.

This information was conveyed in the text and figure legend, but mistakenly omitted from the graph labels. We have corrected the figure. Our data confirming that no axons extended beyond the lesion in untreated control animals can be found in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. We therefore argue that this “critical flaw” was merely a labeling omission and does not in any way confound the interpretation of the data.</p><p>Regarding the differences shown between control and ARSB treated optic nerves, we believe our reported differences are substantial and noteworthy. The enhancement of axon regeneration in Zymosan + ARSB vs. Zymosan + buffer was on the order of ~250 axons at 0.50 mm from the lesion after only 14 d (Figure 3C). The inclusion of ARSB essentially doubles the effect of Zymosan alone and is comparable to the effects achieved in many landmark publications in the field of optic nerve regeneration. For instance, Lim et al., (2016) also used a combination stimulus and, in several experiments, reported effects of a similar magnitude to ours (e.g. in Lim et al., Figure 3, treatment group 3 = ~75 axons and group 4 = ~275 axons at 0.50 mm).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Use of intrinsic stimulus</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the finding that, in this model system, targeting 4S terminal GAG chains for cleavage can mediate effects similar to that of ChABC with an already clinically approved drug is quite interesting, overall the chosen application seems inappropriate.

I think it is a well worthwhile study.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that both reviewers acknowledge the interest and significance of the work and welcome the opportunity to defend our choice of the optic nerve system and our use of a combined intrinsic/extrinsic regeneration stimulus. The optic nerve has many advantages for the study of axonal regeneration as compared to spinal cord injury models, which have enabled this work. The surgical accessibility of the optic nerve enables a high degree of reproducibility and allowed us to deliver ARSB directly to the lesion site. All axons in the optic nerve come from retinal ganglion cells, making the measurement of regeneration unambiguous.</p><p>Virtually all experimental therapies with robust effects in the optic nerve or spinal cord require combinatorial treatments to stimulate significant axon regeneration. While we appreciate that Zymosan itself could not be implemented clinically, ARSB in combination with other stimuli is a distinct possibility. Reporting the efficacy of ARSB in enhancing intrinsic pro-regenerative stimuli will certainly encourage other groups to integrate ARSB into new experimental therapies. We ourselves are engaged in ongoing research to this effect. We believe that holding back our findings with ARSB due to its failure to achieve an effect independently of intrinsic stimulation is not justified, given the state of the field and the potential impact of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) CSPG immunohistochemistry</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2 the absolute levels of C4S in the optic nerve lesion is very small compared to the CS56 staining especially at day 7 which is supposedly at peak of expression. Indeed, the immunohistochemistry overall is not especially convincing. This suggests that C6S GAG moieties are in high abundance in the lesion and apparently in much greater abundance than C4S. Fold changes in C4S are not as interesting as are absolute amounts.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the impression of low C4S levels may have been due to the false-coloring of our figures – the magenta coloring for 2H6 is more difficult to see on a black background than the green coloring of CS-56 when comparing them side by side. We have thus modified Figure 2 to show all images in grayscale, where features are more readily detected by eye. For the sake of full transparency, we have also modified the Figure 2—figure supplement 1 to include both raw fluorescence intensity values and fold change. These graphs are essentially identical, showing increase in both total GAG (using CS-56) and 4S GAG (using 2H6) as compared with the uninjured control in both analyses.</p><p>We appreciate reviewer #1’s suggestion that we compare absolute levels of CSPG and C4S, as this would indeed resolve the question of whether C4S or C6S moieties are in higher abundance within the lesion. However, it is not possible to compare absolute levels of two different antigens using immunohistochemistry, as each antibody has a unique epitope and affinity for the antigen, and the images are collected in different confocal channels with distinct gain and contrast settings. To quantify absolute amounts of GAG would require biochemical methods, which is precluded by the small amount of tissue in each optic nerve, as isolating the optic nerve lesion site produces only 6-8 µg of protein per sample and would require a prohibitive number of mice. We therefore chose to report fold change of total GAG and 4S GAG as compared to control.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In their submission entitled &quot;Identification of a critical sulfation in chondroitin that inhibits axonal regeneration&quot; Pearson et al. examine the role of terminal 4S groups on GAG chains of CSPGs in imparting growth inhibiting properties of CSPGs, using the enzyme arylsulfatase B.

Our previous publications have documented a relative increase in 4S expression after injury as evaluated by biochemical methods. However, as stated above, these biochemical measurements are impossible to perform at the site of an optic nerve lesion given the extremely small amount of tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>First, I don't accept their claim of a 2.5 fold increase in 4S (antibody 2H6) as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.

However, absolute levels of GAG can only be obtained biochemically, which is limited by the amount of tissue in the injured optic nerve. To answer the question would take prohibitively high numbers of animals per condition, which is inconsistent with current pressures to reduce unnecessary use of animals in research.</p><p>Using immunohistochemistry, we found a significant increase in BE-123 “stub” immunoreactivity, indicative of ChABC activity (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), and a small but not significant decrease in CS-56 immunoreactivity at 14 days post crush. We also recovered the implanted gelfoam scaffolds from enzyme-treated mouse optic nerves and detected significant residual ARSB activity from ARSB-loaded scaffolds when compared with buffer-loaded scaffolds, which showed no ARSB activity. Taken together with the pro-regenerative effects seen in enzyme-treated mice, we believe these observations adequately support our conclusion that ChABC and ARSB were active and functioning in vivo.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Considering the known variation associated with zymosan treatment, it is questionable how much meaningful impact ARSB has on axon regeneration.

We carefully reexamined the GAP-43-labeled axons in each image quantified from the sample shown in Figure 3B, and confirmed that no signs of bundled, excessively straight, obviously spared axons were present in any of the other sections analyzed. We also stained optic nerve samples for GFAP and found a clear injury site demarcated by retracted astrocyte processes. Further, we observed that, unlike CTB, which will appear in non-lesioned or spared axons if they are present, GAP-43 stains only regenerating axons and does not stain intact, non-lesioned axons. We have added a sentence to this effect in the manuscript and cited previously published work that reports the same findings. Collectively these observations give us confidence that our analysis and results include only regenerating axons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) 1- CS-56 staining in conditioned media is not altered by ARSB treatment. However, 2H6 antibody has more affinity for 4S groups versus 6S. It would be interesting to document how ARSB treatment impacts the elevation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan after optic nerve crush as documented in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and have added a new supplementary figure (Figure 3—Figure supplement 5) to address the question. We show that treating lesioned mouse optic nerves with ARSB at 3 dpc does not significantly alter immunoreactivity of CS-56 or 2H6 at 7 dpc when compared with the buffer-treated control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors don't provide significant data to further incriminate 4S versus 4,6S role in the inhibitory effect of CSPGs as well as any new data to specifically illustrate the fundamental role of 4S. A Title reflecting the effect of ARSB enzyme in their specific ONC paradigm will be more appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>The only known action of ARSB is to remove the sulfate group from the 4-position of GalNAc. This confirms the essential role of 4S (even if it is in the presence of 6S) as an important signal to neurons. Whether ARSB attacks 4,6S is not at all known, and we found a very low level of 4,6S at the non-reducing end of CSPGs by our HPLC methods. Based on this we feel that the title to the manuscript is appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The representation of the data related to the neurite outgrowth does not allow assessing easily the inhibitory effect of CSPGs. Several experiments were performed in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1; however different representations of the data are used. Additionally, the authors should provide standard deviations to assess the reproducibility between triplicates.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed all data representations to dot plots, which we believe to be a more accurate picture of the data presented. Each experiment showed a significant action of both CSPGs and ARSB in reversing the CSPG actions on neurite outgrowth. We have included a Table of in vitro experimental statistics below containing the mean, standard deviation, standard error, and <italic>p</italic>-values (for both overall ANOVA and posthoc comparison to untreated samples) for each experiment in the triplicate of the in vitro experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should provide information on the amount of enzymes used in subsection “Modifying CSPG sulfation enhances retinal ganglion cell axon regener”. One is expressed as U/ml and others as ug/ml. Please include both, even though the assays are based on rather artificial substrate measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have standardized our reporting of enzyme amounts, using mg/mL or µg/mL units for both enzymes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In subsection “Sulfation dictates the effects of CSPGs on axon growth” says that ARSB cleaves extracellular GAG chains, but only an assay using an artificial substrate is presented. Besides, the enzyme should not cleave GAG chains--it cleaves terminal 4-sulfate. That statement should be corrected or explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have amended the sentence to more clearly state that ARSB cleaves terminal 4S groups from the non-reducing ends of GAG chains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) No data was shown on the effects of ARSB on 2H9 staining/reactivity. Presumably there is not any, since it only removes 1 sulfate per CS chain, but this should be stated explicitly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included this data, showing no significant change in 2H6 immunoreactivity following ARSB treatment, in a new supplementary figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The size of the CS chains in these cells/settings is not known. Presumably its 50-100 monosaccharides, but again ARSB should only remove a single 4-sulfate. This remarkably small change (1/20, 1/50, 1/100) is worth stressing, and citing relevant literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and have added to our Discussion section emphasizing the fact that ARSB only removes a single, terminal sulfate from the non-reducing end of GAG chains, and yet produces a pro-regenerative effect of the same magnitude as that of ChABC, which digests entire GAG chains. We have cited literature on the average length of GAG chains for neurocan and phosphacan that shows an average chain length of approximately 50 disaccharides, which implies a small change in sulfation produces a big change in inhibitory activity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
