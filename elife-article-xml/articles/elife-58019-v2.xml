hydrocarbons (CHCs); variations in the composition of this layer affect a range of traits including adaptation to arid environments and defence against pathogens and toxins. In the African malaria vector, <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> quantitative and qualitative variance in CHC composition have been associated with speciation, ecological habitat and insecticide resistance. Understanding how these modifications arise will inform us of how mosquitoes are responding to climate change and vector control interventions. CHCs are synthesised in sub-epidermal cells called oenocytes that are very difficult to isolate from surrounding tissues. Here we utilise a transgenic line with fluorescent oenocytes to purify these cells for the first time. Comparative transcriptomics revealed the enrichment of biological processes related to long chain fatty acyl-CoA biosynthesis and elongation of mono-, poly-unsaturated and saturated fatty acids and enabled us to delineate, and partially validate, the hydrocarbon biosynthetic pathway in <italic>An. gambiae</italic>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The bodies of insects are encased in an exoskeleton or cuticle that is key for their survival.

This information is important to adapt and develop new tools to improve mosquito control.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Anopheles gambiae</kwd><kwd>cuticle</kwd><kwd>desaturase</kwd><kwd>fatty acid synthase</kwd><kwd>Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting</kwd><kwd>RNAseq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship (215894/Z/19/Z)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grigoraki</surname><given-names>Linda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014976</institution-id><institution>Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Director's Catalyst Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grigoraki</surname><given-names>Linda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Delineation of the cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthetic pathway in malaria vectors is a key step in understanding how mosquitoes adapt to anthropogenic change and vector control interventions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cuticle, also known as the exoskeleton, is the outermost part of the insect body and plays a pivotal role in its physiology and ability to adapt and survive in terrestrial environments. The cuticle consists of multiple layers with different composition and properties. The thickest layer, the procuticle, is divided into the endo- and exo-cuticle, both of which are rich in chitin and cuticular proteins. The outer layer, or epi-cuticle, is mainly composed of lipids and hydrocarbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lockey, 1988</xref>). Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are relatively simple molecules but form complex and varied mixtures of n-alkanes, unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes), and terminally and internally methyl-branched alkanes/alkenes. These mixtures of CHCs protect insects from desiccation, are the first barrier to infections from microorganisms and can act as mating recognition signals (pheromones)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blomquist, 2010</xref>). The cuticle composition has also been associated with resistance to insecticides, via reduced penetration, in several insect species (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Balabanidou et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p><italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes are intensively studied because of their importance as vectors of malaria and lymphatic filariasis that together affect millions of people every year causing intolerable levels of mortality and morbidity. Recently it was shown that populations of the major African malaria vector <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> have developed a thicker cuticle with elevated amounts of hydrocarbons and this is associated with a reduction in the penetration rate of pyrethroid insecticides contributing to the high levels of resistance observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balabanidou et al., 2016</xref>). The emergence of pyrethroid resistance is a major concern for vector control strategies as it threatens the efficiency of the insecticide treated nets, all of which contain this insecticide class, that have proven so successful in reducing the malaria burden in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhatt et al., 2015</xref>). CHCs are also important in conferring desiccation tolerance in <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, which may be vital in adaptation to arid conditions and survival during the dry season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reidenbach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arcaz et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Cuticular hydrocarbons are synthesised in oenocytes which are secretory cells of ectodermal origin found in most, if not all, pterygote insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Makki et al., 2014</xref>). In adult mosquitoes oenocytes are found in characteristic, predominantly ventral, subcuticular clumps that form rows in each segment, while in larval stages they are located in small groups underneath each of the abdominal appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lycett et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The biosynthesis of hydrocarbons has been studied using radiolabelled precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dillwith et al., 1981</xref>) and the biochemical steps of their biosynthetic pathway have been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blomquist, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chung and Carroll, 2015</xref>). The pathway starts with a fatty acid synthase (FAS) that uses malonyl-CoA to generate a fatty acyl-CoA. In the case of methyl-branched hydrocarbons propionyl-CoA groups (as methyl-malonyl-CoA) are also incorporated in the growing fatty acyl-CoA chain. The fatty acyl-CoA chain is further extended by elongases, which extend the chain to different lengths depending on their specificity. Desaturases introduce double bonds, contributing to the generation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, and reductases convert the generated acyl-CoA to aldehydes. These aldehydes serve as substrates for the final step of the pathway, which involves a single carbon chain-shortening conversion to hydrocarbons catalysed by P450 enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>). Only this latter step has been delineated in <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes with two P450 decarbonylases identified, Cyp4G16 and Cyp4G17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balabanidou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kefi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Only a subset of the large number of lipid metabolic enzymes encoded in the genome are likely to be significant players in CHC synthesis, but we hypothesised that transcripts from these genes will be specifically enriched in oenocytes to enable this function. Here we report the isolation of oenocytes from adult <italic>An. gambiae</italic> mosquitoes using a transgenic line with fluorescently tagged oenocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lynd et al., 2019</xref>). RNAseq of the isolated oenocytes identified the key biological processes enriched in these cells and revealed candidate genes for each step of the CHC biosynthetic pathway. A member of the putative pathway was validated by perturbing expression of the AGAP001899 fatty acid synthase (hereafter called FAS1899). The elucidation of this pathway is a major milestone in delineating the role of variable hydrocarbon composition on key traits that impact vectorial capacity of these important vectors of human disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FACS isolation of fluorescent oenocytes from transgenic <italic>An. gambiae</italic> mosquitoes</title><p>To tag adult <italic>An. gambiae</italic> oenocytes, we expressed the red fluorescent marker m-cherry specifically in these cells using the GAL4/UAS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lynd and Lycett, 2012</xref>).

The difficulties in isolating the CHC synthesising cells in adult mosquitoes, due to their close association with fat body cells within the abdomen, and the absence of clear one to one orthologs with <italic>Drosophila</italic> in some families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), has hindered the identification of genes involved in mosquito CHC production. In this study we describe the FACS purification of fluorescently tagged oenocytes from adult <italic>An. gambiae</italic> mosquitoes, and the subsequent transcriptomic analysis of the purified cells which enabled us to identify key candidate genes in the CHC biosynthetic pathway.</p><p>The samples analysed consisted of total cells recovered from dissected abdomen integument, containing ~12% of tagged oenocyte cells, which were then compared to purified oenocyte cells isolated by passage through the FACS. The abdomen tissue is mainly composed of fat body and epithelial cells, neither of which are expected to synthesise hydrocarbons. Fat bodies do however have a primary role in lipid biosynthesis, which has several steps in common with the CHC biosynthetic pathway, both utilising fatty acid synthases, elongases and desaturases. The analysis pathway was purposively designed to reveal genes and isoforms that are predominantly enriched in oenocytes and thus likely to be involved in CHC biosynthesis but a limitation, in our goal to delineate the entire CHC pathway, is that it will likely fail to detect genes that are expressed at similar levels in fat bodies and oenocytes and are involved in both CHC and lipid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wicker-Thomas et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our data set is the first transcriptomic data for adult mosquito oenocytes. Limited depth transcriptional analysis of larval <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> oenocytes that persist during early pupal development, and are relatively easily dissected in pure form due to their distinct large size and loose attachment as clumps of cells to the integument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Makki et al., 2014</xref>), has previously been performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martins et al., 2011</xref>). Comparison of the partial oenocyte <italic>Aedes</italic> transcriptome with our adult <italic>Anopheles</italic> oenocyte data set provides insights into key genes potentially involved in CHC synthesis throughout development. Seven genes involved in lipid biosynthesis were detected in <italic>Aedes</italic> larval oenocytes, including one acetyl-coA synthetase (AAEL007283), two elongases (AAEL008219 and AAEL013542), two desaturases (AAEL003611 and AAE004278) and the two orthologs of Cyp4G16 and Cyp4G17 (AAEL004054 and AAEL006824). Clear orthologs for five of these larval oenocyte expressed genes (except for the desaturase AAEL004278) were present in our <italic>An. gambiae</italic> adult oenocyte transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Further work to characterise <italic>Anopheles</italic> oenocyte transcriptomes at earlier life stages will be facilitated by this FACS approach to enable functional analysis of these cells during mosquito development.</p><p>In addition to genes involved in lipid and hydrocarbon biosynthesis, genes associated with the biological processes of synaptic vesicle coating and docking, and nerve impulse transmission were found enriched in the oenocyte transcriptome. The Oeno-Gal4 driver line used to generate the mosquito population with fluorescent oenocytes has a red fluorescent marker (dsRed) under the control of the 3xP3 promoter that drives expression in the eyes and nerve cord. A small contamination of the FACS isolated oenocytes with cells of the nerve cord could be speculated, although nerve cells were not observed when visually observing the isolated cells with confocal microscopy. Moreover, oenocytes have been reported to play a role in the neuronal processes during <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryogenesis through the secretion of semaphorin (Sema2a), a peptide that drives axon elongation; ablation of oenocytes results in sensory axon defects similar to the <italic>sema2a</italic> mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bates and Whitington, 2007</xref>). In addition, the development of oenocytes and of sensory organ precursors (SOPs) in the peripheral nervous system is intimately linked. A previous study has shown that in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos primary SOPs signal, via the EGFR pathway, to the overlying ectoderm. This results in the differentiation of signal receiving cells into oenocytes, in the presence of the Sal transcription factor, or into secondary SOPs in the absence of Sal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rusten et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Thus, oenocytes likely have a variety of currently unexplored functions, which is also supported by our gene enrichment analysis. A further interesting aspect is their potential role in lipid synthesis, processing and secretion (signalling), as reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Makki et al., 2014</xref> and suggested by the enrichment in our dataset of sphingolipid and fatty acid biosynthesis and endocytic recycling. Further studies are needed to explore these functions in more detail and to investigate the potential cross talk (regulation) of oenocytes with other tissues. For example <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larval oenocytes are thought to produce a VLCFA dependent signal that controls remotely the water-tightness of the respiratory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parvy et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, oenocyte regulated lipid signalling under normal and stressful developmental conditions would be an interesting area of future research.</p><p>We functionally validated the role of the fatty acid synthase FAS1899 in CHC biosynthesis, by stably knocking down its expression during mosquito development. Oenocyte specific knock down of FAS1899 was lethal at the L2/L3 larvae stages, showing its important role for the normal mosquito development, possibly by synthesising Very Long Chain Fatty Acids (VLCFA) that are utilised at the larvae stage either for waterproofing the respiratory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parvy et al., 2012</xref>) or for other metabolic purposes. Lethality was also reported for the RNAi-mediated knock down of its ortholog (CG17374) in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> before adult eclosion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chung et al., 2014</xref>). Silencing of the FAS1899 expression using the polyubiquitin (Ubi) promoter also resulted in high levels of mortality (70–80%), but this time at the pupae stage and during adult emergence. This milder phenotype could be explained by the fact that the Ubi promoter drives lower levels of expression in oenocytes, which is supported also by the quantitative real time PCR data (26% knock down of the FAS1899 in adult progeny of the UAS-FAS1899i x Ubi-A10 Gal4 cross compared to the 70% of knock down seen in L2/L3 progeny of the UAS-FAS1899i x Oeno-Gal4 cross).</p><p>The relative expression levels of FAS1899 affect both the quantity and composition of CHCs produced in adult oenocytes. A 25% reduction in the total amount of hydrocarbons was observed for adults surviving knock down of FAS1899 and the CHC profile showed a decrease in the total proportion of methyl branched CHCs and an increase in saturated and un-saturated straight-chain hydrocarbons. Silencing Cyp4G16 or Cyp4G17 transcript levels in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> oenocytes by approximately 90% resulted in high mortality in late pupae, pharate adults and during adult emergence and, in surviving adults, a 50% reduction in the total amount of CHCs was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lynd et al., 2019</xref>). The Cyp4G16 and Cyp4G17 P450s catalyse the final decarbonylation step in the cuticular hydrocarbon synthetic pathway, while FAS1899 is thought to catalyse the first step using acetyl-CoA to generate and elongate a fatty acyl-CoA chain. Thus, perturbing both extremes of the pathway can influence the final amount of synthesised hydrocarbons.</p><p>Partial knock down of the Desat3050 transcripts in larval oenocytes was correlated with larval lethality, similar to FAS1899 knock down. High levels of mortality were also observed when using the weaker oenocyte line (but more widespread driver line). However, no qualitative or quantitative differences in the CHC profile were observed in surviving adults. Further work is required, but it may indicate that Desat3050 catalyses the formation of unsaturated lipids that are not converted to hydrocarbons but are important in development, such that even a slight perturbance in the expression levels of this gene can have severe developmental effect. In <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> either deletion or strong over-expression of the desaturase, <italic>desat1</italic>, result in larval mortality, showing that correct regulation of this gene is critical for development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Köhler et al., 2009</xref>). In addition desat1 was shown to affect not only the biosynthesis of unsaturated lipids, but also the availability of saturated lipids, as a reduction in its activity results in decreased amounts of both unsaturated and saturated fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ueyama et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, a perturbance in the function of a desaturase enzyme can have a broader effect on lipid metabolism potentially leading to developmental abnormalities or lethality.</p><p>Variations in the relative abundance of CHCs on the cuticular surface have been correlated in <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes with species, karyotype, age and mating status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caputo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Polerstock et al., 2002</xref>). Sex specific differences in the relative abundance of some CHC compounds have also been reported in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caputo et al., 2005</xref>), but in contrast to other insects like <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coyne and Oyama, 1995</xref>), sexual dimorphism in CHCs in mosquitoes has not been reported. This lack of sex specificity is reflected in the absence of sex specific expression of CHC synthesising genes in our analysis. However, interestingly we did identify some splice variants of Cyp4G16, encoding for a different C-terminus, to be differentially expressed between male and female oenocytes, but further work is needed to validate this observation. A change in C- terminus is likely to alter the intracellular location of proteins through removal of the ER retention signal. Previous work on females has demonstrated enriched localisation of CYP4G16 on the oenocyte plasma membrane surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balabanidou et al., 2016</xref>). It would be interesting to examine males in comparison.</p><p>Variation in the abundance of CHCs has been associated in <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> with insecticide resistance; a 30% increase in CHC content has been correlated with a decrease in the penetration rate of pyrethroid insecticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balabanidou et al., 2016</xref>). Several of the genes implicated in CHC biosynthesis from the results of the current study are expressed at elevated levels in pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes and may provide useful genetic markers for detecting this emerging resistance phenotype. For example FAS1899 is a member of the Cyp4G16 correlation network and is over-expressed in pyrethroid insecticide resistant <italic>An. gambiae</italic> and <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> populations from Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire (data from the IR-TEx web-based application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ingham et al., 2018</xref>]). Thus, this gene could be implicated in cuticular resistance, through the production of a thicker cuticle with more hydrocarbons.</p><p>In addition to insecticide exposure, environmental factors can also select for changes in the CHC profile; relative proportions of unsaturated and methyl-branched CHCs altered following exposure to arid conditions in the insectary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reidenbach et al., 2014</xref>) and these arid conditions were also associated with an enrichment of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, including six elongases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>), four of which overlap with the oenocyte enriched elongases identified in this study. The pleiotropic effect of alterations in CHC composition has important implications. Selection pressures that alter the CHC composition, for example the extensive use of insecticides, or an increase in aridity due to climate change, could have multiple effects on mosquito fitness and impacts on disease transmission. Investigating how the different traits influence one another and how this is regulated by the CHC composition is a key next step to understand how mosquitoes adapt and survive in a changing environment and in response to disease control interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AGAP001899</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">NCBI <break/>Gene ID: 1281226</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AGAP003050</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">NCBI <break/>Gene ID: 1272902</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>An. gambiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">UAS-mCD8: mCherry responder line</td><td valign="top">doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2018.03.005">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2018.03.005</ext-link></td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">Transgenic line previously generated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolfi et al., 2018</xref> and referred to as UAS-mCD8:mCherry line.

isoform differentially expressed in female oenocytes compared to female carcass cells and 752 to have at least one isoform differentially expressed in male oenocytes compare to male carcass cells. The same analysis was performed for female and male oenocytes showing 578 genes to have at least one isoform differentially expressed between sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>). Five genes belonging to the six gene families implicated in the hydrocarbon biosynthetic pathway (the elongase AGAP004373, the desaturases AGAP003051, AGAP004572 and AGAP01713 and the decarbonylase P450 Cyp4G16) had at least one isoform differentially expressed in at least two of the three comparisons (female oenocytes vs female total carcass cells, male oenocytes vs male total carcass cells and female vs male oenocytes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref>). Most of the isoforms for these genes differ solely in the untranslated regions. Exceptions are the RD isoform of Cyp4G16 that encodes for a slightly truncated protein with a different C-terminus (last 19 a.a) compared to the other isoforms, and isoforms RA and RB of the desaturase AGAP003051, which encode proteins with highly diverged C-termini. We need however to point out that the two predicted isoforms for AGAP003051 might be affected by some annotation error, as the AGAP003051-RB isoform is identical with the adjacent AGAP003050 transcript after nucleotide 407 (total length of 1038 nt). The AGAP003051-RB isoform was more abundant in oenocytes compared to total Carcass cells and more abundant in female oenocytes compared to male oenocytes, although this latter difference was clearly driven by one of the male oenocyte replicates. The Cyp4G16-RD isoform was enriched in female oenocytes in comparison to both female carcass cells and male oenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Splice variant analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Venn diagram (on the left) showing the number of genes with differential expression of at least one isoform in female and/or male oenocytes compared to total carcass cells.

Cuticle hydrocarbons are synthesized in oenocytes, specialized secretory cells in the subdermis. These cells were purified from a transgenic <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> line containing fluorescently tagged oenocytes and RNAseq used to identify candidate genes for each step in cuticle hydrocarbon biosynthesis. Genetic knock-down of an oenocyte-enriched fatty acid synthase supported the role of this enzyme in cuticle hydrocarbon biosynthesis. The study represents a rich resource for further studies delineating the role of variable hydrocarbon composition on the biology and the malarial vectorial capacity of <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please better explain possible reasons for the Ubi-gal4 x uas.desat30501 no significant silencing/no change in CHC, but mortality, related to the oenocytes.</p><p>2) Please provide better images if available showing adulty mortality in the supplement (not clear if they suffer from desiccation).</p><p>3) Is there any possible explanation, why 58% of the RNAseq transcripts map top the genome?

Unfortunately we don’t have alternative images showing the adult mortality of the Desat3050i and FAS1899i individuals available. Hence, to obtain these we would have to set up new crosses and rear their progeny to adulthood, which would take at least four weeks of extra work, something quite difficult at the moment due to restrictions imposed to our work by the Covid-19 pandemic. We would kindly request to retain the original supplementary figures. We do accept that the quality could be improved, but the originals do clearly show the high mortality of individuals following knock-down of the two studied genes, in the pupae and adult stages, compared to wild type individuals. It is most possible that mortality is related to desiccation as the reviewer suggested, although this would best be tested by monitoring water loss before a definitive statement could be made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is there any possible explanation, why 58% of the RNAseq transcripts map top the genome? (compared to other studies)</p></disp-quote><p>We attributed this relatively low mapping rate to a combination of factors.</p><p>1) Our read sets contained a certain amount of short reads that, whilst having high-quality base calls, could not be aligned to the predicted transcriptome. Specifically, we used a stringent mapping procedure that relied on a minimum alignment length ofk=31 base pairs so as to take advantage of our long reads (average length = 150 bp), as per the recommended good practice in thesalmonaligner. However, as part of read quality pre-processing, we shortened reads by removing low-quality base calls (Phred &lt; 20), which resulted in a small amount of reads pairs with one pair shorter thank=31 base pairs (~2% reads were &lt;31 bp) A similar effect might originate from reads that retain the transcript's poly-A tails (a further ~1% reads per sample). These two groups of reads are not derived from sequencing errors, but they cannot be aligned and thus drive down mapping rates. While they are often removed from RNA-seq libraries because they can hinder transcriptome assemblies, this is not a problem in our analyses because we relied on the high-quality gene annotations from the<italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>genome.</p><p>2) It is also worth mentioning thatthesalmonaligner relies on mapping reads to a set of spliced, predicted transcripts instead of the genome. Thus, any reads containing retained introns due to alternative splicing would not align. This is an important difference with commonly used read mappers that support spliced reads on the genome, such asSTAR.</p><p>3) Finally, another possible cause of lowered mapping rates is the high frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms in<italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>genomes, where up to 30% of genomic bases have variants (Miles et al. 2017, Nature doi:10.1038/nature24995). To test the effect of genetic distance to the reference on mapping rates, we have aligned our reads to the contigs from ade novoassembled transcriptome that could be aligned to the reference transcriptome (same alignment parameters as in the paper), and we have observed ~25% higher mapping rates across all samples.</p><p>Given the increased mapping rates observed in our tests against ade novoassembled transcriptome (point 3), it is worth emphasising our reasons for using genome-derived gene models in our main analyses:</p><p>1) by doing so we are able to interpret our results using the curated gene models available for<italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>rather than often-fragmented assembled transcripts;</p><p>2) in principle, low mapping rates in SNP-rich transcripts would affect all samples equally and thus not alter the results of our differential expression analyses; and</p><p>3) in fact, we found no indication that SNP-rich transcripts had lower mapping rates in our samples. Specifically, there was no significant negative correlation between mapping rates (either measured as TPMs or number of mapped reads per transcript) and SNP density (using SNPs from coding sequences retrieved from the <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> 1000 genomes project), according to a Pearson's correlation test (significance threshold p&lt;0.01).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Could the authors possibly expand on the possibility that oenocytes have roles in neurogenesis during Drosophila embryonic development.</p></disp-quote><p>We added an extra paragraph in the Discussion (fourth paragraph) expanding on the link between oenocytes and nervous system development in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.
