Here we identify a sleep state in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae that coincides with a major wave of neurogenesis. Mechanisms controlling larval sleep are partially distinct from adult sleep: octopamine, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> analog of mammalian norepinephrine, is the major arousal neuromodulator in larvae, but dopamine is not required. Using real-time behavioral monitoring in a closed-loop sleep deprivation system, we find that sleep loss in larvae impairs cell division of neural progenitors. This work establishes a system uniquely suited for studying sleep during nascent periods, and demonstrates that sleep in early life regulates neural stem cell proliferation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33220.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nearly all animals sleep more while they are still developing, suggesting that sleep is important in early life. Previous studies have shown that sleep may be required for building connections in the brain. However, it has been difficult to study the effects of sleep in earlier stages of brain development, when stem cells divide to create brain cells in a process known as “neurogenesis”. This is partly because, in mammals, most neurogenesis occurs in the womb.</p><p>Scientists have successfully studied sleep using the common fruit fly. But these studies have so far focused on adult flies, in which neurogenesis is mostly complete. Fly larvae, on the other hand, are widely used to study brain development and neurogenesis. Compared to mammals in the womb, fruit fly larvae are very easy to access and manipulate. However, unlike adult flies, no one had previously looked to see if larvae even display a behaviour that would fit the definition of sleep.</p><p>To see if fruit fly larvae do sleep, Szuperak et al. created the “LarvaLodge”, an apparatus in which individual larvae can be housed while having their activity monitored over time. In these lodges, a bright light was used to test how hard it is to arouse inactive fruit fly larvae, and further experiments asked what happens when larvae are prevented from resting. Then, to look at neurogenesis in the larvae, Szuperak et al. used a stain that labels dividing stem cells within the nervous system. Those cells could then be seen and counted when a larva was dissected and examined under a microscope.</p><p>The results from the LarvaLodge showed that fruit fly larvae do indeed sleep: they have extended periods of rest during which they react less to outside disturbances and adopt a particular posture (they retract their heads towards their bodies). Also when larvae were deprived of sleep, by shining a light or shaking, they compensated by sleeping more afterwards. Importantly, depriving the larvae of sleep also led to lower levels of neurogenesis. These findings establish the fruit fly larva as a new and useful system for studying the role of sleep in early development, and may help shed light on the role sleep plays in disorders affecting brain development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>larva</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08NS090461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kayser</surname><given-names>Matthew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kayser</surname><given-names>Matthew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Many studies have focused on the role of sleep in synaptic formation, homeostasis, and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kayser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tononi and Cirelli, 2014</xref>), underscoring that a core function of sleep during development is likely to involve modification of neural connectivity. However, examination of a function for sleep in earlier phases of brain development has been limited by the lack of a tractable experimental system. Indeed, there is no established platform to investigate the role of sleep in developmental neurogenesis, which in mammals predominately occurs <italic>in utero</italic>. The adult fruit fly is a widely studied model organism for sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>), and while significant brain plasticity is ongoing in young adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barth et al., 1997</xref>), neurogenesis is largely complete; adult flies are therefore not suitable for investigating the function of sleep during initial periods of neural development. In contrast, the timing of these events in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae is ideal. The first wave of neurogenesis occurs during embryonic stages but contributes only 10% of neurons in the adult brain; 90% of neurons in the adult brain are born during the second wave of neurogenesis that is timed to larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Homem and Knoblich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kohwi and Doe, 2013</xref>). Fly larvae are widely used to study the neural basis of complex behaviors, and are readily accessible for experimental manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heckscher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Honjo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vogelstein et al., 2014</xref>). Yet, it has remained unknown whether <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae sleep. Here, we identify a sleep state in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, define the principal cellular controls of larval sleep, and provide evidence that sleep during early development is required for normal proliferation of neural stem cells. Our results suggest that sleep is a critical factor in the initial steps of nervous system elaboration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Prolonged monitoring of larval rest-activity behaviors</title><p>Most prior research on <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heckscher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vogelstein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Widmann et al., 2016</xref>) employed short-term assays not sufficient for analysis of rest/activity.

We simultaneously imaged up to 20 larvae at 35 µm resolution (a second instar larva is ~1500 µm in length and ~350 µm in width), acquiring images every 6 s under dark field infrared illumination (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). We focused on second instar larvae because this period coincides with the second wave of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Homem and Knoblich, 2012</xref>). With this system, rest/activity during the entire second instar phase (~22 hr) was recorded, with tightly aligned developmental staging across larvae as indicated by synchronized onset of the second molt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We observed that larvae exhibit dynamic transitions between quiescence and activity throughout the imaging period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

Total quiescence was higher early in the second instar period compared to later, resulting from more frequent and longer sleep bouts in immature larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).

We tested whether behavioral quiescence in larvae represents a sleep state by examining these behavioral criteria. First, we asked if larval quiescence is associated with a postural change. Using frame-by-frame postural analysis of individual sleep bouts, we observed that during periods of rest, larvae frequently retract their head towards the body, resulting in a quantitative change in body length and width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Head retraction occurred in 76.6% of prolonged quiescence bouts (&gt;36 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and less commonly (47.1%) in shorter bouts (18 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that postural change is related to duration of the sleep bout. The postural change most often occurred as part of a stereotyped sequence of behaviors: we found in 72.0% of sleep-associated postural changes that the animal transitioned from activity to behavioral quiescence prior to postural change; quiescence then persisted following postural change in 64.6% of episodes, prior to resumption of activity (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Less often (28.0%) a larva transitioned directly from activity to coincident postural change with quiescence, or directly from head retraction to an active phase (35.4%), consistent with the observation that posture is more likely to change in association with prolonged rest. Our data thus show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval quiescence is a patterned behavior with a previously unrecognized temporal sequence, and that like animals ranging from nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iwanir et al., 2013</xref>) to humans, larvae demonstrate postural changes during sleep.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33220.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> larval quiescence meets behavioral criteria for sleep.</title><p>Image of a larva before (<bold>A</bold>) and after (<bold>B</bold>) postural change associated with sleep.

Using a low intensity blue light stimulus (irradiance 3.98 µW/mm<sup>2</sup>) to perturb larvae, we found that only ~60% of inactive larvae became active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), demonstrating an altered responsiveness to sensory stimuli during larval rest. Importantly, only ~20% of quiescent larvae spontaneously became active without a stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), confirming that the low intensity stimulus arouses resting larvae more than chance. We next increased the temporal resolution of our system to monitor behavior every 2 s, with the goal of examining whether the behavioral quiescence described above is qualitatively distinct from brief (2 s) periods of inactivity. Focusing first on probability of spontaneous arousal, we found that following 2 s of inactivity, 54% of larvae became active in the subsequent frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In contrast, following 6 s of inactivity, only 19% of larvae became active spontaneously; longer bouts of quiescence were not associated with a further reduction in probability of subsequent spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These results suggest that ≥6 s of quiescence represents an altered behavioral state in comparison to brief (2 s) periods of inactivity. To test directly whether arousal threshold is altered with ≥6 s of behavioral quiescence, we presented a 1 s high intensity blue light stimulus and assessed arousal in larvae that were inactive at the time of stimulus presentation. While 82.4% of larvae were aroused after 2 s of inactivity, only 46.5% were aroused by the same stimulus if quiescent for ≥6 s prior to light presentation (n = 108 quiescent episodes for 2 s and 357 quiescent episodes for ≥6 s; p&lt;0.0001, Fisher’s exact test). Together, these findings indicate that larval quiescence is a reversible state during which arousal threshold is increased from baseline, and that behavioral quiescence lasting at least 6 s can be defined as sleep.</p><media id="video5" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-33220-video5.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33220.010</object-id><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>Time-lapse (36x) of a second instar larva demonstrating rapid reversibility of quiescence.</title><p>Quiescence begins at 00:02, and the light stimulus occurs at 00:05.</p></caption></media><p>Does larval quiescence exhibit homeostatic properties of sleep, with rebound following enforced sleep loss?

We demonstrate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae exhibit periods of reversible behavioral quiescence characterized by a change in posture and increased arousal threshold, with homeostatic properties such that quiescence deprivation is followed by subsequent increased quiescence amount and depth. These features meet the behavioral criteria for sleep shared across phylogeny, and establish <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae as a new system to study questions at the intersection of sleep and development.</p><p>Little is known regarding the cellular and molecular control of sleep during early life. Surprisingly, we find that the most severe short sleeping mutations identified in adult flies exhibit no sleep phenotype in larvae, and that sleep time in larvae is not correlated with that of adults. Moreover, direct activation of dopamine neurons in second instar larvae fails to promote wakefulness as it does in adult flies. Together these findings suggest that genetic and neural sleep regulatory mechanisms might be partially distinct at different developmental time points. What purpose might be served by this mechanistic divergence? One possibility is that the drives facing a developing animal (e.g., high levels of feeding to meet metabolic demands related to tissue growth) are different than those in adulthood (e.g., reproductive drive). Sleep must be suppressed to fulfill these demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beckwith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keene et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Machado et al., 2017</xref>), and perhaps sleep regulatory mechanisms are dynamically coupled to the most relevant environmental cues for drives that change throughout maturation. Notably, sleep bouts in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae are relatively brief, with an average length of 15–20 s. We identify 6 s as the minimum period of behavioral quiescence considered sleep. Though brief, sleep bouts of this length are similar to that described in other organisms, including adult zebrafish in which inactivity for 6 s is also the minimum period defined as sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yokogawa et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, the fragmented nature of sleep we observe in larvae is consistent with the idea that rapid sleep-wake cycling is a shared feature of early life sleep across phylogeny: human infants exhibit fragmented sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kleitman and Engelmann, 1953</xref>), and early postnatal rats show sleep bout durations averaging &lt;15 s that begin to consolidate in the first postnatal weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blumberg et al., 2005a</xref>). Fragmented sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae (and perhaps other young animals) might reflect high metabolic needs of a rapidly developing organism, raising the possibility that sleep regulatory mechanisms during development show divergence from adulthood in order to facilitate brief rest bouts interspersed among frequent feeding required to meet the developmental challenge.</p><p>Not all sleep-wake systems are distinct between <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae and adults, as octopamine is a key arousal-promoting signal in both. Activation of OA neurons in larvae promotes wake while OA synthesis or receptor mutants exhibit more sleep. Given the conserved role of OA/NE in mammalian sleep-wake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981</xref>), this neurotransmitter may also be a critical regulator of early developmental sleep in other species including humans. Our results are consistent with the idea that sleep control from early life to maturity is characterized by sequential elaboration of regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blumberg et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cirelli and Tononi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karlsson et al., 2005</xref>), perhaps starting with noradrenergic signaling. In the adult fly, specific clusters of OA-releasing neurons mediate arousal/wake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crocker et al., 2010</xref>). Whether such circuit-specific features exist in larval sleep is not known. While OA serves an arousal function, we have yet to identify a sleep-promoting brain region in larvae. Sleep/arousal centers are organized with common neural logic across phylogeny, where activity of one region dampens the other to switch between states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Artiushin and Sehgal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saper et al., 2005</xref>). Specifically, in the adult fly brain, wake-promoting neurons project to and inhibit activity of a sleep-promoting area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ueno et al., 2012</xref>). A circuit-level understanding of sleep/wake control during development is necessary for studying sleep ontogeny across species. Given the detailed understanding of sleep circuitry in adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Artiushin and Sehgal, 2017</xref>), the relatively simple larval nervous system presents a unique opportunity to examine how sleep-arousal circuitry in early development compares to adulthood.</p><p>Most physiological functions, including cell cycle progression and DNA replication, are gated within optimal time windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsuo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tu et al., 2005</xref>). Work in adult rodents suggests that sleep restriction/fragmentation reduces hippocampal neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guzmán-Marín et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lucassen et al., 2010</xref>), but it has been difficult to untangle the effect of sleep loss per se from the well-known impairment of neurogenesis with stress of sensory stimuli used to keep animals awake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lucassen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Warner-Schmidt and Duman, 2006</xref>); sleep deprivation paradigms have, for the most part, not controlled for this issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lucassen et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the magnitude of neurogenesis (and therefore consequences of its disruption) is dramatically higher in early development compared to adulthood. The timing of a major wave of neurogenesis to larval life, a period accessible for experimental manipulation, makes <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae ideal for examining sleep function and control during early development. Using a closed-loop system in which control animals received the same degree of sensory stimulation as sleep-deprived larva, we uncovered a previously unknown role for sleep in developmental neurogenesis, with broad implications for both brain patterning and the ramifications of sleep loss in early life.</p><p>A number of areas for investigation emerge from this work. First, while sleep quantity is greater in early second instar larva compared to later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), the rate of neuronal proliferation does not decrease over this same period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ito and Hotta, 1992</xref>). Together, these findings suggest sleep might act as a permissive, but not instructive, cue for neurogenesis. Alternatively, sleep could play an important role in initiating the wave of neurogenesis, though not be essential to sustain this process. Second, we provide evidence that sleep can influence NB proliferation, but have not established whether this relationship is bidirectional. While critical to control for more general effects on larval health and function, it will be interesting to dissect how accelerating/slowing cell division affects sleep. Finally, it remains unknown whether the effect of sleep loss on neuronal proliferation is general, or if specific NB subtypes are particularly sensitive to sleep deprivation, which could lead to predictable deficits following sleep loss. Our work describes an ~15% reduction in rate of cell division with 2–3 hr of sleep loss. We aim to develop approaches that achieve long-lasting sleep deprivation, with the goal of understanding how impaired neurogenesis during early development affects brain and behavioral development. More broadly, future work will leverage the tractable larval system to gain novel insights into the genetic/molecular regulation of sleep during development and examine how sleep and neurogenesis are mechanistically coupled.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="center">Designation</th><th align="center">Source or reference</th><th align="center">Identifiers</th><th align="center">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">gene (Drosophila melanogaster)</td><td align="left">clock</td><td align="left">NA</td><td align="left">FLYB:FBgn0023076</td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">gene (D. melanogaster)</td><td align="left">cycle</td><td align="left">NA</td><td align="left">FLYB:FBgn0023094</td><td align="center"/></tr><tr><td align="left">gene (D. melanogaster)</td><td align="left">sleepless</td><td align="left">NA</td><td align="left">FLYB:FBgn0260499</td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">gene (D. melanogaster)</td><td align="left">DAT</td><td align="left">NA</td><td align="left">FLYB:FBgn0034136</td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">gene (D. melanogaster)</td><td align="left">Oamb</td><td align="left">NA</td><td align="left">FBgn0024944</td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">gene (D. melanogaster)</td><td align="left">Octβ2R</td><td align="left">NA</td><td align="left">FBgn0038063</td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">gene (D. melanogaster)</td><td align="left">Tdc2</td><td align="left">NA</td><td align="left">FBgn0050446</td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">gene (D. melanogaster)</td><td align="left">Tbh</td><td align="left">NA</td><td align="left">FBgn0010329</td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">genetic reagent (D. melanogaster)</td><td align="left"><italic>iso31</italic></td><td align="left">Dr. Amita Sehgal</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">genetic reagent (D. melanogaster)</td><td align="left"><italic>clockjrk</italic> </td><td align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allada et al., 1998</xref></td><td align="left">FLYB:FBal0090722</td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">genetic reagent (D. melanogaster)</td><td align="left"><italic>cyc01</italic> </td><td align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rutila et al., 1998</xref></td><td align="left">FBal0195440</td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">genetic reagent (D. melanogaster)</td><td align="left"><italic>sssP1</italic> </td><td align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koh et al., 2008</xref></td><td align="left">FBal0121566</td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">genetic reagent (D. melanogaster)</td><td align="left"><italic>fumin</italic></td><td align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kume et al., 2005</xref></td><td align="left">FBal0197506</td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">genetic reagent (D. melanogaster)</td><td align="left"><italic>Oamb286</italic></td><td align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2003</xref></td><td align="left">FBal0152344</td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">genetic reagent (D. melanogaster)</td><td align="left"><italic>Octβ2Rf05679</italic> </td><td align="left">Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center</td><td align="left">FBal0161089</td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">genetic reagent (D. melanogaster)</td><td align="left"><italic>Tdc2R054</italic></td><td align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cole et al., 2005</xref></td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">genetic reagent (D. melanogaster)</td><td align="left"><italic>TbhnM18</italic> </td><td align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Monastirioti et al., 1996</xref></td><td align="left">FBal0061578</td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">genetic reagent (D. melanogaster)</td><td align="left">UAS-NachBac</td><td align="left"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nitabach et al., 2006</xref></td><td align="left">FBtp0021523;

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mani Ramaswami as Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Mark S Blumberg (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission..</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript provides a comprehensive characterization of the phenomenon of sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae and demonstrates that suppressing larval sleep reduces neural proliferation. It's interesting to observe the wake-promoting effects of octopamine in larvae. Although <italic>Drosophila</italic> has been a well-established genetic model for sleep research for nearly two decades, this first detailed description of sleep in larvae is a substantial contribution. The finding regarding the importance of sleep for neural development is important and exciting. Together these advances open new opportunities to mechanistically study the role of sleep in neural development.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and clearly organized. However, addressing the comments below will improve the manuscript and extend the significance of the findings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Sleep in second instar larvae appear highest in the few hours after molting, then tails off after several hours. The authors mention that a wave of neurogenesis also occurs in second instar larvae – are the precise kinetics of this known? If sleep plays an important role in this process, we might expect neurogenesis to be highest in the first few second instar hours during which larvae sleep peaks. This should be addressed appropriately in the Results and Discussion sections.</p><p>2) The authors show that suppressing sleep decreases neuroblast proliferation generally. Do particular neuroblasts that contribute specifically to second instar proliferation most sensitive to sleep loss? Or are neuroblasts that proliferate over wider time windows (e.g., MB neuroblasts) also affected by sleep deprivation? Is this known? And can it be addressed?</p><p>3) Neuroblast proliferation seems to be influenced by sleep, but it is not clear whether the relationship is bi-directional. Do manipulations that speed/slow proliferation also modulate sleep?</p><p>4) Is there any long-term consequence of reduced neuroblast proliferation? Or is the process just delayed by sleep deprivation? Can this be addressed or discussed?</p><p>5)The study established sleep using many established criteria: distinct sleep posture, arousal threshold, and sleep rebound after deprivation. However, it does not mention sleep pressure. A revised manuscript should provide an explanation as to why.</p><p>6) Subsection “Octopamine controls sleep-wake in larvae”: It seems too strong to state that octopamine &quot;controls sleep-wake in larvae.&quot; Modulates? Influences?</p><p>7) Subsection “Octopamine controls sleep-wake in larvae”: It is suggested, based on a reference to the Aston-Jones and Bloom paper, that norepinephrine plays &quot;a conserved role in developmental sleep across species.&quot; Leaving aside the awkward sentence, the reference is to an adult rat sleep paper. I don't know of any studies on norepinephrine and sleep in early development in rats or any other species, but if they exist they should be cited here. Regardless, suggestions of conserved functions at this early juncture seem premature.</p><p>8) The reviewers agree that the current analyses are perfectly adequate for the current manuscript. However, here are two possibly helpful suggestions for future manuscripts.</p><p>a) The choice of 6 seconds between video frames is longer than ideal and the authors are encouraged to reconsider this choice in the future. The average sleep bout lengths of 15-30 seconds represent only 2.5-5 frames, so 6 seconds provides a course measure of bout length; preferably, sampling intervals should be smaller in relation to bout lengths. Also, with more precise measurement of bout lengths, it will be possible to analyze the statistical distributions of the sleep and wake bout lengths, as has been done profitably in infant rats and the adults of several mammalian species. For example, do the sleep bouts distribute exponentially, as has been found in mammalian sleep? More precise measurement would also allow the authors to more sensitively assess bout consolidation, developmental changes, etc. Such analyses can also provide clues to mechanism.</p><p>b) A related issue concerns the definition of larval sleep as a minimum of 6 seconds of quiescence, which is defined as no evidence of activity across two frames. This definition, though clear, appears to be an arbitrary one. It also makes the comparison to the 6-second definition of sleep in zebrafish (Discussion section) less interesting. Why not measure sleep postures more accurately and analyze the frequency distributions of sleep times with greater precision (e.g., 1-second bins)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33220.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Sleep in second instar larvae appear highest in the few hours after molting, then tails off after several hours.

Published work (Ito and Hotta, 1992) indicates that the rate of neurogenesis does not decrease as development progresses. We find that larval sleep is highest, however, early in the second instar period. This suggests that sleep could act as a permissive, rather than instructive, cue for neurogenesis; or that sleep is important to initiate the wave of neurogenesis, but not sustain cell division. We now address these possibilities in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors show that suppressing sleep decreases neuroblast proliferation generally.

And can it be addressed?</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to determine whether MB neuroblasts (NBs) are affected by sleep deprivation. In early first instar larvae, only MB NBs are dividing, so this population can be selectively labeled by feeding larvae EdU, which incorporates into dividing cells. We then examined second instar larval brains that were co-labeled with markers for NBs (anti-Deadpan) and dividing cells (anti-PH3). As is evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we were able to see clear MB lineages (green), though found that EdU labeling of the MB NBs themselves was already too diluted to be visible. We could still identify MB NBs (yellow arrows) in most cases based on Deadpan labeling (red) and proximity to MB lineages. However, we found that at a given point in time, of the 8 total MB NBs per brain, only 1-2 were dividing (white arrowhead; labeled by PH3 [magenta] co-localized with Deadpan [red]). Therefore, attempting to sleep deprive larvae and assess for a decrease in number of dividing MB NBs is not feasible given the low number of these NBs dividing at the time of our experiment (i.e., “floor effect”). We agree that in the future it will be interesting to label distinct subpopulations of NBs and determine whether some but not others are particularly susceptible to sleep loss. We have added discussion of this issue into the manuscript (Discussion section).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33220.028</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Labeling of MB neuroblasts (NBs) in second instar larval brains.</title><p>Each panel (A-D) is a single hemisphere from four different second instar larval brains.

MB NBs (yellow arrows) can be identified by location with regard to MB lineages. Most MB NBs at any point in time do not appear to be actively dividing (absence of PH3).

Do manipulations that speed/slow proliferation also modulate sleep?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this question, we conducted a series of experiments in which we used genetic approaches to accelerate or slow NB cell division rate, followed by sleep assays. We used <italic>worniu-GAL4</italic> (Lai et al., 2012 and Lee, Robinson and Doe, 2006)to drive NB-specific expression of activated Ras (<italic>UAS-Ras1<sup>V12</sup></italic>) or Alk (<italic>UAS-Alk</italic>) to increase NB proliferation (Cheng et al., 2011 and Karim and Rubin, 1998), or dp60 (<italic>UAS-dp60</italic>) to reduce NB proliferation (by decreasing PI3-kinase activity) (Weinkove et al., 1999 and Sipe and Siegrist, 2017). Our results were mixed, as manipulations that increased NB proliferation had different effects on sleep, while NB-specific expression of activated Ras and dp60 both increased sleep despite opposing effects on proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that altering cell proliferation might indeed impinge on sleep, but that the relationship is complicated. It is likely that manipulating NB division has more general effects on the animal aside from sleep, and therefore it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions. It will be important to pursue other means of altering the rate of cell division, perhaps within more restricted NB populations, and to ensure that such manipulations do not impair overall health or function of the animal (addressed in the Discussion section).</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33220.029</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Sleep following manipulation of NB division.</title><p>Total sleep (<bold>A</bold>) and quantification of number of dividing NBs (<bold>B</bold>) shows that the relationship between proliferation rate and sleep is mixed.

The relatively brief sleep loss protocol described in this manuscript is unlikely to have long-lasting permanent consequences. We are actively pursuing approaches to achieve prolonged sleep deprivation in second instar larvae, with the goal of understanding how a more severe reduction in NB proliferation during this time window affects structural development of the brain, as well as later behaviors.
