across repetitions of stimuli. Spiking variability can arise from internal (behavioral state, unreliable neurons, or chaotic dynamics in neural circuits) and external (uncontrolled behavior or sensory stimuli) sources. The amount of irreducible internal noise in spike trains, an important constraint on models of cortical networks, has been difficult to estimate, since behavior and brain state must be precisely controlled or tracked. We recorded from excitatory barrel cortex neurons in layer 4 during active behavior, where mice control tactile input through learned whisker movements. Touch was the dominant sensorimotor feature, with &gt;70% spikes occurring in millisecond timescale epochs after touch onset. The variance of touch responses was smaller than expected from Poisson processes, often reaching the theoretical minimum. Layer 4 spike trains thus reflect the millisecond-timescale structure of tactile input with little noise.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06619.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06619.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06619.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells called neurons connect to form large networks that process information in the brain. A region of the brain called the cerebral cortex receives information about touch from sensors in the skin. A series of neurons relay the touch information to the cerebral cortex as patterns of electrical activity called ‘spike trains’. Understanding how these spike trains represent information about the world around us is one of the greatest challenges facing neuroscience.</p><p>At first glance, the number and timing of the individual spikes within the trains appear to be random. It is possible that the irregularity within spike trains is ‘noise’ that is generated within the cortex itself. This noise could represent uncertainty about the nature of the stimulus from the sensors, or random fluctuations in brain activity. However, other findings have challenged this view and argued that these erratic spike trains actually carry hidden information.</p><p>Hires et al. investigated this possibility by recording how neurons within a region of the mouse brain called the somatosensory cortex responded to sensory information coming from the mouse's whiskers. Mice sweep their whiskers across objects to locate and identify them, much like how humans feel objects with their fingertips. Here, the mice used their whiskers to judge the location of an object by touch alone, while the electrical activity of the neurons was measured using electrodes. Importantly, the movements of the whiskers and contact with the object were tracked to one millisecond precision.</p><p>Similar to previous studies, sensory information from the whiskers triggered irregular spike trains in neurons within the somatosensory cortex. Hires et al. found that the apparently irregular spikes coincided precisely with the timing of when the whiskers contacted the object. Other spikes aligned perfectly with the movement of whiskers into particular positions. Furthermore, the patterns of electrical activity in the spike trains precisely predicted when and how the object was contacted, and which whisker was involved.</p><p>These findings suggest that the timing of individual spikes within spike trains carries important information to the brain. Future studies will develop our understanding of how the brain interprets and responds to the rich data contained in these spike trains to identify objects and decide how to interact with them.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06619.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06619.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>sensory coding</kwd><kwd>somatosensation</kwd><kwd>barrel cortex</kwd><kwd>noise</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrew Hires</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name><name><surname>Gutnisky</surname><given-names>Diego A</given-names></name><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Jianing</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Connor</surname><given-names>Daniel H</given-names></name><name><surname>Svoboda</surname><given-names>Karel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Touch information is represented with minimal noise in the somatosensory cortex during tactile exploration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Variability in spike trains constrains how neural computations can be implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">London et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Renart and Machens, 2014</xref>). Measured cortical spike trains are often irregular in time, and spike counts vary over repeated presentations of identical sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tolhurst et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maimon and Assad, 2009</xref>). One view holds that this variability is irreducible and therefore represents noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">London et al., 2010</xref>). Noisy spike trains are difficult to reconcile with the integrative properties of single neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Softky and Koch, 1993</xref>) and the high reliability of cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995</xref>) and synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stevens and Zador, 1998</xref>). This discrepancy has motivated models of cortical circuits that inherently produce noisy spike trains even with reliable neurons, by virtue of chaotic dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Litwin-Kumar and Doiron, 2012</xref>). Irregular spike trains suggest that spike rates, but not spike timing, are used by the brain for computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mazurek and Shadlen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">London et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Another view contends that variability in cortical spike trains is not noise but reflects fluctuating hidden states with possible behavioral significance and uncontrolled experimental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gur et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeWeese et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">VanRullen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amarasingham et al., 2006</xref>). Measuring and accounting for these hidden states may reveal the detailed structure of spike trains to be deterministic and predictable. For example, minimizing fixational eye movements in alert monkeys reduces spike count variability in the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gur et al., 1997</xref>). In the sensory periphery, spikes are often coupled to stimulus features with high temporal precision. This precision allows timing-based neural codes to be faster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johansson and Birznieks, 2004</xref>) and more efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gollisch and Meister, 2008</xref>) than rate-based codes.</p><p>Multiple factors can shape neural spike trains, only a subset of which are controlled or measured in typical experiments. Uncontrolled factors will add to measured variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Masquelier, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Renart and Machens, 2014</xref>). These factors can be external to the brain, such as sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baudot et al., 2013</xref>), or internal to it, such as behavioral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitchell et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>). They can be fundamentally irreducible, such as channel noise and chaotic dynamics of neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996</xref>), or potentially controllable, such as animal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gur et al., 1997</xref>) and fluctuating input from other brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gomez et al., 2013</xref>). Here we assessed the precision of spikes during active tactile behavior. We recorded from neurons in layer 4 (L4) in the mouse barrel cortex and measured tactile behaviors with high temporal and spatial resolution.</p><p>L4 contains a precise map, where individual barrels process information from single whiskers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Simons, 1978</xref>). Similar to other cortical circuits, connectivity within L4 is highly recurrent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>). However, the only major long-range input into L4 ascends from sensory neurons via the posterior medial thalamus into L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu and Lin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bureau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hooks et al., 2011</xref>). L4 thus receives little uncontrolled input.</p><p>During natural behavior animals move their sensors to acquire information about the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deschenes et al., 2012</xref>). Measurement of spiking statistics in the barrel cortex is thus most meaningful during active sensation, when mice shape sensory input by moving their whiskers to solve a tactile task. In our experiments mice localized objects with their whiskers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Knutsen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O'Connor et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O'Connor et al., 2013</xref>). Activity within the barrel cortex is necessary for whisker-based sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hutson and Masterton, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O'Connor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guo et al., 2014</xref>).

Spike rates of barrel cortex are also modulated by whisker movements on multiple time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crochet and Petersen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Curtis and Kleinfeld, 2009</xref>). Similar to visual cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tolhurst et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maimon and Assad, 2009</xref>), barrel cortex neurons respond with high trial-to-trial variability to passive sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adibi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To minimize uncontrolled variability we thus recorded cortical spike trains in a well-characterized neural circuit, in mice engaged in active sensorimotor behavior, with precisely quantified sensory input. We show that spikes in L4 are temporally precise and have spike count variance close to the theoretical minimum. This precision allows efficient decoding of touch timing from small numbers of L4 neurons, supporting a role for temporal coding in cortical computation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>L4 responses are temporally precise</title><p>We trained mice to locate an object by active touch with a single whisker (C2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O'Connor et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O'Connor et al., 2013</xref>) (<italic>n</italic> = 21 mice, 52 sessions; fraction of trials correct, 0.740 ± 0.086; mean ± s.d.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Single whisker experiments allowed us to track the relevant tactile variables with high precision during behavior. In each trial, during a sample epoch lasting a few seconds (1.54–4.05, mean 2.39 s), a pole appeared in one of two locations on the right side of the head. High-speed videography and automated whisker tracking quantified whisker movement (azimuthal angle, θ; whisking phase, ϕ), changes in curvature caused by the forces exerted by the pole on the whisker (change in curvature, ∆κ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birdwell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pammer et al., 2013</xref>), and contact time, all with 1 millisecond temporal precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clack et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O'Connor et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

The Fano factor (FF) is a widely used measure of variability in spike trains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berry et al., 1997</xref>). FF is defined as the variance of the spike count divided by the mean spike count over some time window. For a Poisson process, FF = 1, independent of the window size. In our task, mice are free to explore the object differently in each trial. At a coarse scale, behavior and neural responses were irregular during object localization. FF computed by counting spikes over the entire sample epoch (stimulus presentation), was huge (FF = 7.51). Since each trial corresponds to different whisker movements and different patterns of touches this value of FF includes extrinsic variability due to behavior, in addition to intrinsic variability. Aligning spikes to the fine-scale structure of behavior revealed that spikes were mainly coupled to temporally irregular sensory input from object contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

A brief (10 ms) sliding window was used to compute the FF, ensuring that mostly touch-related spikes were counted after touch. Since the spike rate is very low outside of the touch window, the mean spike count is also very low (∼0.03), implying FF of ∼1 for both the binomial and Poisson models. In contrast, around the peak of the touch response the mean spike count is high (∼0.7), allowing us to detect spiking statistics that differ from the Poisson distribution.</p><p>One possible explanation for the low FF after touch is a Poisson process with a refractory period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berry II and Meister, 1998</xref>). A Poisson spike train with deletion of spikes that occur during the refractory period exhibits a FF less than one. We calculated FFs for simulated spike trains with Poisson rates matched to each recorded neuron and a median refractory period of 2.3 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Comparing the simulations with actual spike trains revealed that L4 neuron response precision could not be explained by the refractory period alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>We calculated the FF with different degrees of alignment to fine-scale behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). Response variability was very large (FF = 6.57 mean ± 5.41 s.d.) when we ignored the millisecond time scale of behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig1">Figures 6E and 1</xref>). Integrating activity in time windows as wide as average touch response periods (38 ms) gave a FF of 1.59 ± 0.49 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berry II and Meister, 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig2">Figures 6E, 2</xref>) when randomly sampling from the trial, and FF of 1.37 ± 0.74 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig3">Figures 6E, 3</xref>) when aligned to touch onset. Using a narrower touch window of 10 ms reduced the FF to 0.73 ± 0.19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig4">Figures 6E, 4</xref>). The FF was further reduced to 0.54 ± 0.27 when calculated only across similar touches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig5">Figures 6E, 5</xref>). Together, these results show that excitatory neurons in L4 of barrel cortex exhibit almost noiseless responses to touch.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We measured the encoding of information by L4 neurons in the somatosensory cortex during active tactile sensation. Spike rates were low except for several milliseconds after touch onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1, 2</xref>). During object localization, the majority (&gt;70%) of spikes were temporally coupled to touch onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Whisker movements organized the remaining spikes so that they aligned with particular phases of the whisk cycle. The time-scale of temporal modulation (approximately 10 ms) was much shorter than the mean inter-spike interval (approximately 1 s). Based on observations of whisker behavior it is possible to predict brief time windows when a neuron will fire a single or small number of spikes, as well as time periods when the spike probability is zero. Touch times could be reliably and precisely decoded by pooling activity from a handful of L4 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Panzeri et al., 2014</xref>). Spike count variance after touch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), measured using the FF, was close to the binomial limit, the theoretical minimum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Based on these criteria we conclude that L4 responses encode touch with millisecond timescale precision and minimal noise.</p><p>This picture of low noise, rapidly modulated responses differs from the conclusions based on recordings from the cortex of behaving non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tolhurst et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maimon and Assad, 2009</xref>). Even in cases with time-varying stimuli and corresponding cortical responses with rapid modulation, spike counts vary greatly across trials, resulting in large FFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bair and Koch, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buracas et al., 1998</xref>). Four experimental factors might contribute to the large spike rate modulation and small FFs observed in our experiments: First, mice solved a discrimination task using active sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Knutsen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O'Connor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kleinfeld and Deschenes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O'Connor et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to passive presentation of stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tolhurst et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maimon and Assad, 2009</xref>), in our task mice control sensory input by palpating the object with their whiskers. It is likely that mice tune their movements to achieve high signal-to-noise ratio encoding of tactile information. Second, by employing loose-seal cell-attached recordings we targeted neurons independent of activity, permitting accurate sampling of the spike trains produced by the L4 neuron population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeWeese et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">O'Connor et al., 2010</xref>). These recording methods could be critical because standard extracellular recordings can have problems detecting neurons with low spike rate and high synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewicki, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeWeese et al., 2003</xref>). During highly synchronous events, such as the population volley after touch, the probability is high that simultaneously recorded units in an extracellular electrode will be missed or misassigned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cotton et al., 2013</xref>). Close to the binomial limit relatively few misassigned spikes can have a large impact on calculations of the FF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeWeese et al., 2003</xref>). Third, compared to measurements from other cortical layers and regions, L4 spike trains in barrel cortex are more easily interpreted because extrinsic input arises mainly from the sensory periphery, rather than other cortical layers or higher cortical areas that might provide input with unobserved dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Fourth, we track sensory input and whisker movements with temporal resolutions that are high compared to the inter-spike intervals of L4 cells. This is necessary to uncover possible influences of behavior on individual spikes. Indeed, L4 spikes appear irregular when aligned to the sample epoch (coefficient of variation &gt;&gt; 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). Only after aligning spikes to the fine-scale structure of the sensory input does the meaning of individual spikes become clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berry et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baudot et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to L4, only a small fraction of spikes in L5 neurons in the barrel cortex can be interpreted in terms of somatosensory behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This is likely because these neurons receive multiple types of input with unobserved dynamics representing hidden states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>). The irregularity of the L5 spike trains, as well as spike trains in other cell types and brain areas, may reveal themselves as deterministic fine-scale structure once the multitude of their inputs can be simultaneously monitored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gomez et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The irregularity of cortical spike trains has often been interpreted as an irreducible feature of cortical discharges, or noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Renart and Machens, 2014</xref>). This in turn has led to the view that only spike rates averaged across neuronal populations, but not precisely timed spikes, can be used to perform computations in cortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mazurek and Shadlen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">London et al., 2010</xref>). However, because a large number of inputs converge on single cortical neurons, noisy discharges are difficult to achieve in most models of neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Softky and Koch, 1993</xref>). One exception is balanced networks, which have gained prominence in part because they produce irregular discharges as a result of chaotic dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Litwin-Kumar and Doiron, 2012</xref>). L4 neurons have variability close to the theoretical minimum. This implies that models of cortical networks should not explicitly aim to produce intrinsically noisy activity.</p><p>Other measurements in the barrel cortex have found highly variable responses to passive whisker deflection in L4 of anesthetized rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bale et al., 2013</xref>). Several key differences between this study and ours could underlie this discrepancy. During anesthesia cortical activity is modulated by slow rhythms (e.g., up and down states), which are not observed during active behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crochet and Petersen, 2006</xref>). These rhythms are expected to increase spike count variability. In addition, the movements underlying active sensation might recruit circuit mechanisms that reduce variability. In our experiments mice ‘choose’ temporally sharp touches, which are expected to drive strong and rapid feedforward inhibition within L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gabernet et al., 2005</xref>). The inhibition shortens L4 responses after touch and thus might produce effectively binary (0 or 1 spike) responses and low variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeWeese et al., 2003</xref>). Attentional mechanisms are also known to reduce neuronal variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitchell et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2009</xref>) and may contribute to the low FFs we report here.</p><p>Neural coding of the timing of touch onset and whisking phase are key components of models of object localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Curtis and Kleinfeld, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kleinfeld and Deschenes, 2011</xref>). We show that touch onset is reliably decodable from a small number of L4 neurons. In contrast, although many L4 cells are modulated by whisking phase, their low spike rates during whisker movements (mean &lt;0.15 spikes/whisk cycle) hinders efficient decoding of whisking phase from population activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The poor encoding of whisking phase is consistent with the observation that mice do not use the timing of L4 activity relative to whisking phase to measure object location, at least in the context of the simple task used in our experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O'Connor et al., 2013</xref>). How the brain uses temporally precise and low variance coding of touch in L4 neurons for tactile sensation remains to be discovered.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures were in accordance with protocols approved by the Janelia Farm Research Campus Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

For whisking phase, each spike that was not attributed to touch onset was indexed by the time elapsed between the spike and the closest whisk cycle preferred phase (taking into account phase circularity and including whisking epochs with non-monotonic phase).

Each spike train was causally integrated with a defined window (i.e., w = 10 ms). At each time point <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> we built a different decoder that was trained to discriminate between the pooled population response at <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and the population response at epochs without touch (i.e., a one-dimensional decoder). We used half of the data to find the optimal threshold and the other half of the data to predict the performance of the decoder. Other decoders, such as naïve Bayes classifier and Fisher linear discriminant, produced similar results (not shown). The decoders assume implicit knowledge of when the touch occurred, since at each time point a different decoder was employed.</p><p>To decode the time elapsed since touch onset we used the same sampling procedure as described above and integrated the response with a sliding window with duration of 10 ms. We trained a multinomial naïve Bayes classifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duda et al., 2001</xref>) to report for every time point what was the most likely time elapsed from touch onset, with a root mean square time error derived from boostrapping (100 runs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To decode the whisking phase we assumed that the preferred phase was uniformly distributed. For each neuron we aligned the spikes to the whisking phase of each whisking cycle (minimum peak whisking amplitude &gt;2.5°) and binned the response in 120 bins between <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. To simulate the population response we randomly picked a set of neurons (with replacement) and circularly shifted their response to obtain a uniform distribution of preferred phases. We trained a naïve Bayes classifier to discriminate the population response to two different whisking phases. We tested the performance of the decoders in function of the difference of whisking phase and determined the phase difference that achieved 76% correct discrimination in function of the number of neurons.</p><p>Under the assumption of independent neural responses, our simulations show several-fold more information about touch in C2 than non-C2 and poor performance in decoding whisking phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Other factors, such as correlated activity among neurons, can impact the accuracy of the population code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dayan and Abbott, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moreno-Bote et al., 2014</xref>) and the exact information carried by touch and whisking phase, but this is unlikely to alter the qualitative picture presented here.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis of spike count variance</title><p>To sort out external and intrinsic contributions to spike count variability, we took several steps to reduce external variability due to differences in sensorimotor variables. Touch responses in L4 neurons are modulated by adaptation, pretouch velocity and curvature of the whisker (which is proportional to touch force) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). To reduce adaptation effects we selected touch epochs in which the inter contact interval (ICI) was longer than 250 ms. We divided the remaining touch events into five groups (<italic>N</italic>, number of points per group; minimum, 20), clustered by touch characteristics. We z-scored pretouch velocity and the maximum curvature change shortly after touch (0–20 ms). For each neuron we clustered the touch events using a density-based clustering method (OPTICS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cunningham and Yu, 2014</xref>]). The output of OPTICS gives an ordered list <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of points sorted by similarity. We searched for the set of consecutive sorted points <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> that mimimized the sum over all pairwise distances. After obtaining the set of touch events for the first bin, we removed those points and proceeded in the same manner to obtain the second data bin. We repeated the procedure until obtaining five data bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We calculated the FF by counting spikes in sliding windows of 10 ms for each cell and each of the five bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Confidence intervals for the FFs were obtained by resampling 1000 times. We also computed FFs using a Poisson process with absolute refractory period, with average touch response matched to the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berry II and Meister, 1998</xref>)

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments extensively before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) This revised submission does not require new experiments, but it does require new analyses and ideally new data from other cortical layers, which the authors may already have in their database.</p><p>This is potentially a solid study that sheds some light on the factors that determine what makes cortical neurons fire. The paper reports on the variability of spike trains in layer 4 (L4) neurons in mouse somatosensory cortex during a touch task (pole localization) involving active whisking. It makes a convincing argument that variability is very low, once spikes are aligned properly based on time of touch and on whisk phase. Specifically, touch (more than whisking phase) seems to be the primary feature encoded by the timing of the spikes. Indeed, most spikes can be explained by whisker curvature and related kinematics, together with (to a smaller degree) whisking itself. Around the time of the touch the noise in these neurons is near the theoretical minimum. Thus what might appear as trial-to-trial variability or noise is not. Spiking appears to be noisy only if the observer does not or cannot take into account the true determinants of spiking.</p><p>2) This paper, however, doesn't really change our view of sensory processing in L4 of barrel cortex. It shows that L4 responses can be predicted rather closely if one knows a few fundamentals about the sensory and motor time courses. This is hardly surprising: it would have been surprising if one could have predicted spike trains without knowledge of those fundamentals. Still, it is interesting to see that most spikes can be accounted for, once one has those simple pieces of information.</p><p>3) This said, the study also suffers from major limitations. Principally, the main finding is not novel – it is made to appear novel only by adopting strawman hypotheses, ignoring much of the relevant and recent literature.</p><p>4) Indeed, it is widely agreed that individual cortical neurons are not noisy: if cortical responses are variable, the variability is due to integration of inputs, which is mostly seen in central neurons.</p><p>5) Moreover, as the paper points out, layer 4 in this system is close to the sensory periphery, with little input from the rest of cortex – and we already know that in the sensory periphery there is very little noise. These and other criticisms are laid out below.</p><p>6) Premise of the paper. The Introduction begins with “Cortical spike trains are often considered to be noisy”, and casts much of the paper in the context of this view. But after decades of work, this idea of cortical neurons being “noisy” has become a strawman. It is out of step with crucial pieces of the literature. We already know that cortical neurons are not intrinsically noisy; see e.g. Mainen and Sejnowski, “Reliability of spike timing in neocortical neurons”. Science 1995, and Deweese and Zador, “Shared and private variability in the auditory cortex”. J Neurophysiol 2000. Also, the apparent Poisson nature of variability can be explained by a deterministic spike threshold (Carandini, Plos Biol 2000). Similarly, the statement that “In cortex, irregular spike trains suggest that only rate codes can be used to perform reliable computations” is misleading, and based on a reference that is over 10 years old.</p><p>7) Vision literature. The paper uses the literature from visual cortex to make the point that cortical responses are noisy. But even in that literature there is much that contradicts this point. In a paper titled “Low response variability in simultaneously recorded retinal, thalamic, and cortical neurons” (Neuron, 2000), Kara, Reinagel, and Reid have already shown that responses in layer 4 of visual cortex can be remarkably repeatable. And these results are not limited to anesthetized preparations: similar results have been obtained in awake monkeys, where (as one could have imagined, and similarly to what is done here for whiskers) it is essential to know eye position on a moment by moment basis: Gur, Beylin, and Snodderly, “Response variability of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) of alert monkeys” (J Neurosci, 1997).</p><p>8) Somatosensory literature. If we now turn to the recent literature on somatosensory cortex, we see that it makes precisely the opposite case relative to neurons being “noisy”. Indeed, the paper might just as well have begun with: “Cortical spike trains are often considered to be made up of precisely timed spikes, whereby the timing of each spike carries some meaning about the stimulus.” See for example Arabzadeh, Zorzin and Diamond “Neuronal encoding of texture in the whisker sensory pathway” (PLoS Biol 2005) and “Deciphering the spike train of a sensory neuron: counts and temporal patterns in the rat whisker pathway” (J Neurosci 2006). Additional contributions that should be considered in rethinking how to cast these results include those from G. Stanley (admittedly anesthetized, as noted in this study), E. Arabzadeh, G. Foffani, R. Petersen, and S. Panzeri. The latter include “Information carried by population spike times in the whisker sensory cortex can be decoded without knowledge of stimulus time” (Frontiers, 2010) – which is related to the authors' conclusion that “Pooling activity from only fifteen L4 neurons […] in C2 was sufficient to detect 95 % of touches” – and “Complementary Contributions of Spike Timing and Spike Rate to Perceptual Decisions in Rat S1 and S2 Cortex” (Current Biology, 2015). The latter is admittedly too recent to have shaped the present paper, but it is now in the literature.</p><p>9) Poisson spike generators. Given the literature, the Poisson model with a refractory period has become a strawman. Therefore, the simulation of Poisson firing with refractory period (in the sixth paragraph of the subsection “Low spike count variability”) is unsatisfying. We already know that the Poisson model is not a reasonable model, even with refractory periods. We know this in retina, in LGN, in V1, and in A1. It would be more interesting to test a more plausible model. For instance, would an integrate-and-fire model with Gaussian noise in Vm give the observed statistics?</p><p>10) Fano Factor. Related to the last point: is it sensible to calculate Fano Factor (FF) for such a radically non-stationary process? Fano Factor is at best awkward for non-stationary processes and the main message of the paper is that spiking is non-stationary, e.g. extremely variable over large time scales and extremely precise when whiskers kinematics dictate so. For a Poisson process, FF = 1, independent of the window size. Since the observed FF for full stimulus window was large, evidently a Poisson process is not underlying spikes. At best it is a Poisson process driven by a variable mean rate. Indeed, Poisson statistics are meant to model stationary processes, that is, processes where the probability of an event per unit time is constant. Obviously firing probability increases in the tens of ms after touch, compared to the rest of the trial.</p><p>11) Further, having demonstrated that the neurons of interest in barrel cortex do not resemble a Poisson process, the modeled neurons do: “We used a simplified model based on independent Poisson neurons with rapidly modulated spike rates”. It is puzzling to model Poisson neurons once one knows that the model is not correct.</p><p>12) Factors accounting for spike trains. In the present analysis (in the second paragraph of the subsection “Low spike count variability”), 3 factors are used to account, one at a time, for spike trains: order of touch, whisker velocity, and whisker curvature. Why use them one at a time? Why not use all 3 at once and see how much better one does? Or use only the two main ones? Are there any spikes unaccounted for once one does this? This could be done with a GLM (perhaps enlisting the help of colleague Jeremy Freeman) or with similar approaches. Indeed, since the main message of the paper is that spike trains can be explained by whisker curvature and related kinematics, it would make sense to place less emphasis on the Poisson analysis and more emphasis on showing whisker state as a determining factor.</p><p>13) Other layers. Rather than focusing solely on L4, it would have been much more interesting to compare L4 with other cortical layers, and investigate the sources of variability there. Indeed, a major missing component is that neurons outside L4 are not recorded or reported. This is set up in the Introduction, but not really addressed. It's great to show L4 does one thing, but more interesting to show that it does something different than other layers. Given other publications from this group, it seems likely that the authors have other data that addresses this. Analyzing these data would make the paper much stronger.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06619.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) This revised submission does not require new experiments, but it does require new analyses and ideally new data from other cortical layers, which the authors may already have in their database</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are presumably referring to the database from O’Connor et al. 2010. Unfortunately, in this previous study and all other previous studies from our lab and other labs, the behavioral tracking (videography) was not sufficiently accurate to extract touches with millisecond precision and low error rates.</p><p>However, we agree that the paper would be stronger by comparing our results with other neuron types that are known to receive long-range cortico-cortical inputs. One of the main points of our work is that virtually all L4 spikes can be explained based on behavior. The layer 4 circuit in one S1 barrel receives external inputs mainly from ∼200 neurons of the corresponding barreloid in VPM. Other neuron types, such as layer 5 pyramidal neurons, receive in addition inputs from diverse sources that we do not observe (motor cortex, S2 etc); this can cause apparently variable neural responses.</p><p>To enable a comparison between microcircuit types, we have extended our analysis to a new set of L5 neurons. In contrast to L4, only a small percentage of spikes in L5 can be explained by whisking and touch. The new L5 data has been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>.</p><p>We have extended our L4 data set as well, adding 14 new recordings in L4 C2 bringing the total from 17 neurons to 31 neurons.</p><p><italic>2) This paper, however, doesn't really change our view of sensory processing in L4 of barrel cortex. It shows that L4 responses can be predicted rather closely if one knows a few fundamentals about the sensory and motor time courses. This is hardly surprising: it would have been surprising if one could have predicted spike trains without knowledge of those fundamentals. Still, it is interesting to see that most spikes can be accounted for, once one has those simple pieces of information</italic>.</p><p>We respectfully disagree with this point. The experimental literature overwhelmingly reports highly variable neural responses (e.g. references in our manuscript; Carandini, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Churchland et al. 2010</xref>; Goris et al. 2014). This has influenced theoretical modeling in such a way that variable (Poisson-like) spiking statistics are a measure of success for networks models of the brain (e.g. van Vreeswijk &amp; Sompolinsky, 1996; Litwin-Kumar &amp; Doiron, 2012).</p><p>Although it may not be ‘surprising’ to the reviewers that L4 spike rates and spiking statistics can be ‘accounted for’ by behavioral variables, the quantitative extent in behaving animals is new (and surprising to us).</p><p>In fact, we see little published prior art on these key points made in our paper:</p><p>A) Our measurements are in defined neurons in an active sensory perception task. Most of what we know about L4 responses in mice and rats comes from experiments in anesthetized experiments with passive stimulation. Even responses in the ganglion cells are very different with piezo stimulation compared to actively sensing rodents (Rasmus Petersen, Thalamus meeting Janelia 2015). Furthermore, anesthesia puts the brain in a non-natural state. Studies of neural coding have to be ultimately performed in a well-controlled behavioral task (Renart &amp; Machens, 2014).</p><p>B) The existing literature clearly does not predict our results, even for simple metrics such as spike rate. For example, in the only other paper reporting recordings in L4 in awake animals (Curtis &amp; Kleinfeld, 2009) baseline spike rates are high and modulation is relatively low – implying that a relatively small fraction of spikes would be explained by behavior. The difference might be due to recording techniques (cell-attached vs. wire electrodes), behavioral state, or tracking of the behavior.</p><p>C) Our quantitative estimate of the fraction of spikes that are behavior-related is a new analysis and observation. Our analysis goes well beyond qualitative assessments (i.e. classification as cells responding to touch or not). Importantly, our analysis could not have been done without millisecond timescale tracking of behavior.</p><p>D) The observed Fano factors are much smaller than any reported before, even though our measurements were done in active behavior. Careful tracking of behavior and best-of-class single unit isolation are critical for this analysis. There is a great interest in understanding and explaining variability in neural responses. For instance Goris et al. (2014) found that a stimulus-independent parameter can account for the super-Poissonian variability observed in multiple visual areas. Ecker at al. (2014) found that under anesthesia correlated variability is modulated by slowly fluctuating input that also significantly reduces the correlation among neurons. Our work highlights that the neural code can be close to noiseless ‘under battleground conditions’.</p><p>We have rewritten parts of the paper to make these points clearer (Introduction).</p><p><italic>3) This said, the study also suffers from major limitations. Principally, the main finding is not novel – it is made to appear novel only by adopting strawman hypotheses, ignoring much of the relevant and recent literature</italic>.</p><p>We respectfully disagree with the statement that our study is not novel. To the best of our knowledge, the major take-home messages in our paper are new (also see response to Point 2).</p><p>A) The vast majority of spikes, in many cases &gt;90%, can be accounted for in terms of tactile behavior.</p><p>B) The intrinsic variability of responses was substantially lower than expected for Poisson spike trains and often reached the theoretical minimum.</p><p>We are not aware of any studies that showed (A) and (B) in behaving animals in any cortical area.</p><p>We understand that ‘strawman’ refers to our Fano factor (FF) calculation, where we compare FF in the vicinity of touch (low) to the FF integrated over the full sampling period. This comparison could be easily removed without changing any of our conclusions. However, we feel that this comparison serves as an important didactic point.</p><p>The ‘strawman’ shows that FF can be affected dramatically if behavior is not measured with precision. The same would hold if neural dynamics is influenced by the hidden dynamics of unobserved brain areas (as is the case in most experiments where this sort of analysis has been attempted).</p><p>We have reworded the offending sections to dismantle the strawman (Results):</p><p>“Neuronal variability can arise from external factors […] at least in part due to trial-to-trial variability in active touch.”</p><p>We reply below to the point on recent literature on cortical noise.</p><p><italic>4) Indeed, it is widely agreed that individual cortical neurons are not noisy: if cortical responses are variable, the variability is due to integration of inputs, which is mostly seen in central neurons</italic>.</p><p>Please note that we do not write nor imply nor state that ‘individual cortical neurons’ are noisy. In fact, in our Introduction we write:</p><p>“…noisy discharges are difficult to reconcile with the observed high reliability of cortical neurons (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995) and groups of synapses (Stevens and Zador, 1998)”.</p><p>It is well established that intrinsically noisy networks can be constructed with reliable neurons.</p><p>We state that trial-to-trial variability in neuronal responses (e.g. spike count) has been observed in visual cortex, motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, both in behaving and anesthetized preparations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>). Contrary to the reviewers’ assertions, the causes of this variability are unknown and an intense area of study (for reviews see Renart &amp; Machens, 2014). Our point is that if extrinsic factors are taken into account cortical neurons are remarkably precise (as precise as they can be!). One important corollary is that we do not need network models that are intrinsically noisy.</p><p><italic>5) Moreover, as the paper points out, layer 4 in this system is close to the sensory periphery, with little input from the rest of cortex – and we already know that in the sensory periphery there is very little noise. These and other criticisms are laid out below</italic>.</p><p>In terms of number of synapses L4 is as far from the periphery as L5 and L6; all of these layers receive direct input from VPM. The key point is that L4 receives long-range input almost exclusively from VPM (and recurrent input from other L4 neurons); it’s therefore a relatively simple cortical circuit and by monitoring sensory information we monitor a lot of the input to L4. In contrast, L5 and L6 receive inputs from other long-range sources.</p><p>We cite papers in which low response variability was recorded (below; however, none during active behavior):</p><p>“However, some studies in the sensory cortex suggest that the apparent irregularity in spike trains does not reflect noise but the hidden states of a temporally rich signal (DeWeese, Wehr and Zador 2003; Gur, Beylin and Snodderly 1997; VanRullen, Guyonneau and Thorpe 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amarasingham et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kara, Reinagel and Reid 2000</xref>).”</p><p>Many recent high profile papers report high FF in multiple brain areas:</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Churchland et al.

It is often quantified in terms of reliability and precision (Box 1), and both are usually poor in vivo (e.g. Fano factors ∼1 and precision ∼tens of ms or above). The origin of this variability, and its implication for information processing, has been much debated (Stein et al., 2005; Ermentrout et al., 2008; Faisal et al., 2008; Tiesinga et al., 2008; Rolls and Deco, 2010), yet a consensus has not emerged. Here we argue that most of the observed variability could come from uncontrolled variables, or the use of inappropriate reference times, rather than from intrinsic sources of noise (“intrinsic” meaning that they cannot be eliminated).”</p><p>We believe that our study sheds light onto these issues. The citations above clearly show that many researchers in the field feel that this is important and unsettled business.</p><p><italic>6) Premise of the paper. The Introduction begins with</italic> “<italic>Cortical spike trains are often considered to be noisy</italic>”<italic>, and casts much of the paper in the context of this view. But after decades of work, this idea of cortical neurons being</italic> “<italic>noisy</italic>” <italic>has become a strawman. It is out of step with crucial pieces of the literature. We already know that cortical neurons are not intrinsically noisy; see e.g. Mainen and Sejnowski,</italic> “<italic>Reliability of spike timing in neocortical neurons</italic>”<italic>. Science 1995, and Deweese and Zador,</italic> “<italic>Shared and private variability in the auditory cortex</italic>”<italic>. J Neurophysiol 2000. Also, the apparent Poisson nature of variability can be explained by a deterministic spike threshold (Carandini, Plos Biol 2000). Similarly, the statement that</italic> “<italic>In cortex, irregular spike trains suggest that only rate codes can be used to perform reliable computations</italic>“ <italic>is misleading, and based on a reference that is over 10 years old</italic>.</p><p>Please see the responses above.</p><p>We further disagree that we are misleading with our statement that it has been argued that irregular spike trains suggest that only rate codes can be used to perform reliable computations. London et al. (2010) and others make exactly that argument. The title of their paper is: “Sensitivity to perturbations in vivo implies high noise and suggests rate coding in cortex”. And they take variability in cortical discharges for granted: “It is well known that neural activity exhibits variability, in the sense that identical sensory stimuli produce different responses”.</p><p>Mainen &amp; Sejnowski (1995; cited) is slice work and we have no disagreements with them. Neural networks can generate noisy discharges with deterministic neurons (there are literally hundreds of papers on this). In the last 10 years nothing has happened as far as we can tell that has challenged the status quo.</p><p>We feel that we present the status quo fairly in our revised Introduction.</p><p><italic>7) Vision literature. The paper uses the literature from visual cortex to make the point that cortical responses are noisy. But even in that literature there is much that contradicts this point. In a paper titled</italic> “<italic>Low response variability in simultaneously recorded retinal, thalamic, and cortical neurons</italic>” <italic>(Neuron, 2000), Kara, Reinagel, and Reid have already shown that responses in layer 4 of visual cortex can be remarkably repeatable. And these results are not limited to anesthetized preparations: similar results have been obtained in awake monkeys, where (as one could have imagined, and similarly to what is done here for whiskers) it is essential to know eye position on a moment by moment basis: Gur, Beylin, and Snodderly,</italic> “<italic>Response variability of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) of alert monkeys</italic>” <italic>(J Neurosci, 1997)</italic>.</p><p>We cite Gur et al. (1997). They show that responses in V1 are more reliable when fixational eye movements are taken into account. This paper is indeed important prior art and is discussed as such. However, this study does not show that responses are close to the theoretical minimum (which would be FF ∼ 0 for their high spike counts). Kara et al. (2000; also cited) show that responses can be sub-Poissonian in anesthetized cats.</p><p><italic>8) Somatosensory literature. If we now turn to the recent literature on somatosensory cortex, we see that it makes precisely the opposite case relative to neurons being</italic> “<italic>noisy</italic>”<italic>. Indeed, the paper might just as well have begun with</italic> “<italic>Cortical spike trains are often considered to be made up of precisely timed spikes, whereby the timing of each spike carries some meaning about the stimulus.</italic>” <italic>See for example Arabzadeh, Zorzin and Diamond</italic> “<italic>Neuronal encoding of texture in the whisker sensory pathway</italic>” <italic>(PLoS Biol 2005) and</italic> “<italic>Deciphering the spike train of a sensory neuron: counts and temporal patterns in the rat whisker pathway</italic>” <italic>(J Neurosci 2006). Additional contributions that should be considered in rethinking how to cast these results include those from G. Stanley (admittedly anesthetized, as noted in this study), E. Arabzadeh, G. Foffani, R. Petersen, and S. Panzeri. The latter include</italic> “<italic>Information carried by population spike times in the whisker sensory cortex can be decoded without knowledge of stimulus time</italic>” <italic>(Frontiers, 2010) – which is related to the authors' conclusion that</italic> “<italic>Pooling activity from only fifteen L4 neurons […] in C2 was sufficient to detect 95 % of touches</italic>“ <italic>– and</italic> ”<italic>Complementary Contributions of Spike Timing and Spike Rate to Perceptual Decisions in Rat S1 and S2 Cortex</italic>“ <italic>(Current Biology, 2015). The latter is admittedly too recent to have shaped the present paper, but it is now in the literature</italic>.</p><p>It’s been known since the classic studies of Dan Simons (cited) that after passive whisker deflection L4 neurons spike with short latencies and little timing jitter. We cite this and other papers in our Introduction.</p><p>We show similar temporal precision in L4 neurons during active sensation. Furthermore we show that spike rates are extremely low except in a narrow time window after touch. This picture is very different compared to the only other L4 recordings during active behavior that we are aware of (Curtis and Kleinfeld, 2009); this study shows high baseline spike rates and thus relatively small fraction of spikes explained.</p><p>Importantly, rapidly changing spike rates do not imply low variability! <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bair and Koch (1996)</xref> have already shown temporally precise responses with large FF. Where it’s been looked at variability has been relatively high in anesthetized barrel cortex (FF ∼ 1; e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adibi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the papers from Diamond’s lab. We now discuss one of them in our revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Panzeri et al. 2014</xref>; in the subsection “Decoding touch”).</p><p>We note in passing that Diamond too acknowledges the need to identify the sources of cortical variability (Arabzadeh et al., 2005):</p><p>“In a number of sensory modalities, first-order neuron responses can be remarkably reliable when a stimulus is presented repeatedly, whereas cortical responses vary across trials. It is of interest to elucidate the mechanisms that permit reliable first-order neuron responses and, by the same token, to identify the sources of trial-to-trial variability among cortical neurons.”</p><p>“From these observations we conclude that, under our experimental conditions, the trial-to-trial response variability of first-order neurons is caused exclusively by stimulus jitter, whereas that of cortical neurons results mainly from variations across time in sensory integration, and must emerge at some integration site between the trigeminal ganglion and cortex. A question of current interest is whether the variability in cortical responses results from noise and imprecision in neuronal integration, or else reflects functionally significant modulations in responsiveness.”</p><p><italic>9) Poisson spike generators. Given the literature, the Poisson model with a refractory period has become a strawman. Therefore, the simulation of Poisson firing with refractory period (in the sixth paragraph of the subsection “Low spike count variability”) is unsatisfying. We already know that the Poisson model is not a reasonable model, even with refractory periods. We know this in retina, in LGN, in V1, and in A1. It would be more interesting to test a more plausible model. For instance, would an integrate-and-fire model with Gaussian noise in Vm give the observed statistics</italic>?</p><p>We respectfully disagree with this characterization of Poisson models. Spike trains are almost always modeled as Poisson trains.</p><p>Recent papers (e.g. Goris, Movshon, &amp; Simoncelli, 2014) insist on the Poisson model with some variations. All GLM models we are aware of have an output that is a Poisson generator (refractoriness is obtained with a post-spike filter). Given that we observe variability below Poisson, the next simplest model would be to add a refractive period. This is a statistical, not a mechanistic model (as the reviewers propose). Our analysis says that the low variability we report is not due to very high spike rate changes followed by a refractory period (which was the first possible explanation we considered).</p><p><italic>10) Fano Factor. Related to the last point: is it sensible to calculate Fano Factor (FF) for such a radically non-stationary process? Fano Factor is at best awkward for non-stationary processes and the main message of the paper is that spiking is non-stationary, e.g. extremely variable over large time scales and extremely precise when whiskers kinematics dictate so. For a Poisson process, FF = 1, independent of the window size. Since the observed FF for full stimulus window was large, evidently a Poisson process is not underlying spikes. At best it is a Poisson process driven by a variable mean rate. Indeed, Poisson statistics are meant to model stationary processes, that is, processes where the probability of an event per unit time is constant. Obviously firing probability increases in the tens of ms after touch, compared to the rest of the trial</italic>.</p><p>We respectfully disagree. FF is appropriate for analysis of non-stationary processes. There are two types of non-stationarity that have different impact on the FF. First, a time-varying firing rate that is the same in every trial, referred to as an inhomogenous Poisson process. The Fano factor is often used to characterize non-stationary processes, precisely because FF = 1 even for an inhomogeneous Poisson process (e.g. Berry and Meister, 1997). Second, the other type of non-stationarity corresponds to changes in mean firing rate across trials. In this case, for a neuron that fires with Poisson statistics according to a stochastic rate in each trial, the Fano factor will be larger than 1 (i.e. it is a doubly stochastic process).</p><p><italic>11) Further, having demonstrated that the neurons of interest in barrel cortex do not resemble a Poisson process, the modeled neurons do:</italic> “<italic>We used a simplified model based on independent Poisson neurons with rapidly modulated spike rates</italic>”<italic>. It is puzzling to model Poisson neurons once one knows that the model is not correct</italic>.</p><p>We now use spike trains sampled from recorded spike trains for modeling (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>12) Factors accounting for spike trains. In the present analysis (in the second paragraph of the subsection “Low spike count variability”), 3 factors are used to account, one at a time, for spike trains: order of touch, whisker velocity, and whisker curvature. Why use them one at a time? Why not use all 3 at once and see how much better one does? Or use only the two main ones? Are there any spikes unaccounted for once one does this? This could be done with a GLM (perhaps enlisting the help of colleague Jeremy Freeman) or with similar approaches. Indeed, since the main message of the paper is that spike trains can be explained by whisker curvature and related kinematics, it would make sense to place less emphasis on the Poisson analysis and more emphasis on showing whisker state as a determining factor</italic>.</p><p>The point of this figure is to show that touch-evoked spikes vary with the quality of the touch in multiple, correlated dimensions. This sets up the message of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, which is that spike count variability during touch is minimal once these touch characteristics are considered. Because of the low spike rates and spike counts, number of sensory variables, and limited experiment duration, it is difficult to fit models with more parameters.</p><p>The use of GLM models for this work is problematic for the following reasons:</p><p>A) Amount of data and overfitting. In a recent imaging study with a GLM-like model (Peron et al., 2015) we observed that we needed at least ∼100 trials to fit GLMs with only two variables and nine time bins (this was an imaging study with frame rate ∼ 7.5Hz). At a resolution of 1ms and much more temporal richness than in imaging we’d need many more time bins to describe the data, which increases the risk of overfitting. Regularization and carefully chosen temporal basis sets may overcome this problem under some conditions, but this is far from trivial. In general we are limited by trials and spikes.</p><p>B) GLMs typically use linear kernels and a static non-linearity. However, phase preference extracted from whisking cannot be linearly mapped. This means that standard GLMs cannot be applied to extract modulation with whisking.</p><p>C) Adaptation, to a first-order, can be accounted using a post-spike filter. But this significantly increases the number of model parameters and given limited data makes fitting impossible.</p><p>D) It is not possible in the classical GLM to generate near-binomial responses and still capture the overall ISI distribution.</p><p>E) Ideally every input variable should have a white-noise spectrum to fully sample the system. Temporally and spatially inhomogeneous sampling (across different input variables), as is the case in active behavior, can give unreliable estimates of the GLM parameters.</p><p>F) Adaptation of GLMs for trial-based, spiking neurons, with multiple correlated features were only recently developed (Park…Pillow, 2014). Even in this case, most of the inputs are discretized (saccade direction, stimulus onset, coherence level), implying relatively low dimensionality and few parameters.</p><p>This is just to say that we simply don’t know how to apply ‘GLM or with similar approaches’ (even with Dr. Freeman). To show that we have seriously considered this approach we show GLMs to fit the time-course of touch-responses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06619.019</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>GLM modeling of L4 touch responses.

To deal with adaptation, first touch and subsequent touches were treated separately. As expected, the GLM captures the touch-aligned responses well (constraints for smoothness mean that the GLM doesn’t capture sharp temporal responses). We tested if the GLM can help predict a larger fraction of spikes than the approach presented in the paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Indeed, the GLM does slightly better (i.e. the proportion explained curves rise faster than with the approach we adapted) but the difference was small. We therefore chose to stick with the approach that was more closely related to the primary data.</p><p><italic>13) Other layers. Rather than focusing solely on L4, it would have been much more interesting to compare L4 with other cortical layers, and investigate the sources of variability there. Indeed, a major missing component is that neurons outside L4 are not recorded or reported. This is set up in the Introduction, but not really addressed. It's great to show L4 does one thing, but more interesting to show that it does something different than other layers. Given other publications from this group, it seems likely that the authors have other data that addresses this. Analyzing these data would make the paper much stronger</italic>.</p><p>L4 is the core of this study. As discussed in point 5), other layers receive multiple long-range inputs that can make the activity more variable (since the input is not observed). However, we agree with the reviewers that adding L5 data would strength our paper by showing that the L4 is distinct from other layers. We repeated several of our analysis with a new set of L5 neurons. Whereas the vast majority of spikes in L4 can be explained by touch and whisking, only a small percentage of spikes can be explained in L5.</p><p>The new L5 data has been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
