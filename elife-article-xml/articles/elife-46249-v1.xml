(ExM), which achieves nanoscale-precise imaging of specimens at ~70 nm resolution (with ~4.5x linear expansion) by isotropic swelling of chemically processed, hydrogel-embedded tissue. ExM of <italic>C. elegans</italic> is challenged by its cuticle, which is stiff and impermeable to antibodies. Here we present a strategy, expansion of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (ExCel), to expand fixed, intact <italic>C. elegans</italic>. ExCel enables simultaneous readout of fluorescent proteins, RNA, DNA location, and anatomical structures at resolutions of ~65–75 nm (3.3–3.8x linear expansion). We also developed epitope-preserving ExCel, which enables imaging of endogenous proteins stained by antibodies, and iterative ExCel, which enables imaging of fluorescent proteins after 20x linear expansion. We demonstrate the utility of the ExCel toolbox for mapping synaptic proteins, for identifying previously unreported proteins at cell junctions, and for gene expression analysis in multiple individual neurons of the same animal.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>expansion microscopy</kwd><kwd>super-resolution imaging</kwd><kwd>immunohistochemistry</kwd><kwd>in situ

important model system in biology, because of its tractable size (959 somatic cells in adult hermaphrodites), its genetic manipulability, and its optical transparency, which yields the possibility of whole-organism imaging of biological processes and signals. Perhaps not surprisingly, therefore, super-resolution microscopy has been useful to the analysis of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, with studies applying STORM, PALM, SR-SIM, and STED to <italic>C. elegans</italic> to investigate cells and tissues in both intact or dissected <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rankin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vangindertael et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Köhler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krieg et al., 2017</xref>). However, the depths of imaging of such studies were largely physically limited to a few microns to tens of microns, insufficient to map the entire depth of an adult animal, and the hardware required for super-resolution microscopy is not available in all laboratories, and can be slow and/or expensive to deploy. Furthermore, the tough cuticle of <italic>C. elegans</italic> presents a barrier to immunostaining in the intact animal, important for STORM and STED imaging and for the general labeling of proteins in a variety of scientific contexts.</p><p>Recently, we discovered that it is possible to isotropically expand biological specimens by permeating them evenly and densely with a swellable hydrogel polymer network, anchoring key biomolecules or labels to the hydrogel, softening the tissue through a chemical process, and then adding water, which swells the polymer and in turn the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). This technique, expansion microscopy (ExM), is now being adapted and improved by many groups, and has been applied to tissues of mice, human patients, and in many other biological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chozinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ku et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tillberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Truckenbrodt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gambarotto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wassie et al., 2019</xref>). However, <italic>C. elegans</italic> is wrapped in a multi-layer cuticle, which is well known to be impermeable to many small molecules and all antibodies, and mechanically stiff to the point where physical expansion would be expected to proceed poorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duerr, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Page and Johnstone, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chisholm and Xu, 2012</xref>). Thus, we set out to develop an ExM protocol customized for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> context that would overcome these barriers.</p><p>To achieve this goal, we modified previously published protocols in a number of ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, green steps) to generate a new protocol which we call expansion of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (or ExCel). This protocol results in high signal-to-background antibody staining against protease-resistant fluorescent proteins, low-distortion (~1–6% over length scales of 0–100 μm) physical expansion by ~3.3x, and both protein and RNA detection with sub-cellular resolution. Using ExCel, we were able to resolve synaptic and gap junction proteins better than with ordinary confocal microscopy, and simultaneously image proteins, RNA, and DNA location within the same specimen. In particular, such multiplexed capability has not been demonstrated with previous super-resolution methods in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and facilitates nanoscale-precise analyses of how multiple molecular types are spatially organized in the context of an entire animal.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Workflow for expansion of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (ExCel) sample processing.</title><p>A method for expanding cuticle-enclosed intact <italic>C. elegans</italic>, extending published proExM and ExFISH protocols with specific modifications (shown in green text; full key in lower left). Depending on whether the user intends to visualize RNAs or not, the protocol branches into two forms. The protocol without ExFISH, which supports the readout of fluorescent proteins, DNA location (in the form of DAPI staining), and anatomical features, is indicated with blue arrows, ending in Panel L. The protocol with ExFISH, which additionally supports readout of RNAs, is indicated with orange arrows, ending in panel Q. For all steps after hydrogel formation (Panels G-Q), the linear expansion factor of the hydrogel-specimen composite is shown in parentheses. (<bold>A–Q</bold>) Steps of the protocol, with the bold text indicating the title of the step; see text for details of each step.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46249-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The standard ExCel protocol visualizes fluorescent reporters, such as those fused to proteins of interest, which requires transgenesis, and could in principle affect the function and localization of the target protein. Thus, we additionally developed an alternative ExCel protocol, which we call epitope-preserving ExCel, that enables detection of untagged, completely endogenous proteins, using off-the-shelf primary antibodies. The epitope-preserving ExCel protocol replaces the use of Proteinase K, a general protease that disrupts most epitopes in the standard ExCel protocol, with an epitope-preserving cuticle-permeabilization treatment that we identified in a systematic screen of chemical treatments. This protocol enables antibody staining of protein epitopes at the expense of a slightly reduced expansion factor (~2.8x) and lower expansion isotropy (~8–25% error over length scales of 0–100 μm). We showed that epitope-preserving ExCel allows multiplexed readout of multiple native proteins at super-resolution, a capability that we used to identify a previously unreported protein localization at the junctions between developing vulval precursor cells, and to resolve the peri-active and active zones of chemical pre-synapses.</p><p>Lastly, we developed a third protocol, iterative ExCel (iExCel), which enables two successive rounds of hydrogel-mediated expansion of a given worm, by incorporating the previously validated strategies of iterative expansion microscopy into the ExCel context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2017</xref>). iExCel brings the expansion factor from ~4x to ~4x *~4x = ~20x, and the theoretical limit of resolution down to ~25 nm, at a low level of distortion (~1.5–4.5% over length scales of 0–100 μm), on par with that of standard ExCel, on which it builds.

The monomers self-assemble into a dense polymer matrix, a hydrogel of swellable sodium polyacrylate, to which AcX (and thus proteins) are bound. Treatment with a strong protease, Proteinase K, softens the sample by destroying most proteins, but sparing the fluorescent antibodies. Then, adding water swells the hydrogel-specimen composite by ~4.5x in linear extent, for mouse brain specimens. A related process, expansion microscopy followed by in situ hybridization (ExFISH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), uses an RNA-binding anchor, LabelX, to couple RNA molecules to the hydrogel, with similar monomer-infusion and proteolysis steps as proExM.</p><p>We first designed an ExM protocol for <italic>C. elegans</italic> (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), extending the published proExM and ExFISH protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tillberg et al., 2016</xref>) with several design choices that we reasoned would help with isotropic expansion of fixed, intact, cuticle-enclosed <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In outline (see Methods for details), we first collect animals in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes to facilitate centrifugation and solution exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We fix animals with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and then for 4 hr at 4°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We then incubate the animals in a buffer containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol overnight at 4°C to chemically reduce the disulfide bonds between collagen fibers in the cuticle, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Finney and Ruvkun (1990)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garriga et al. (1993)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duerr (2006)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We thought that incorporation of this step into the protocol design could enhance diffusion of chemical reagents for ExM into the specimen.</p><p>Next, we add AcX and/or LabelX to the specimen to equip proteins and nucleic acids, respectively, with a polymer-anchorable moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). For applications that involve RNA readout, we treat the specimen with both LabelX and AcX, sequentially and in that order. For other applications, we treat the specimen solely with AcX. The AcX treatment is performed with a low-pH buffer (pH 6.0 MBST, i.e. MES-buffer saline with Triton X-100) building from our prior observation that such a condition helped with deep AcX permeation into specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tillberg et al., 2016</xref>). We then perform monomer infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) by incubating the specimen in non-activated monomer solution (7.5% (w/w) sodium acrylate, 2.5% (w/w) acrylamide, 0.5% (w/w) N,N'-diallyl-tartardiamide (DATD; a crosslinker that can be chemically cleaved by periodate ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Späth and Koblet, 1979</xref>], which we reasoned would make the hydrogel compatible with ExM-related downstream applications that require the disintegration of this initial hydrogel; we employ this hydrogel-disintegration procedure in two other <italic>C. elegans</italic> expansion protocols that we describe later in this manuscript), in a solution of 50 mM MOPS pH 7.0 and 2 M NaCl) overnight at 4°C. We reasoned that this overnight incubation could promote more thorough diffusion of hydrogel monomers into the specimen, compared to the 30 min incubation in the published proExM or ExFISH protocols. This infusion is followed by polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), an extensive Proteinase K digestion over 2 days at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), longer than in previous protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tillberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>), to allow a thorough digestion of the cuticle.</p><p>Usually when Proteinase K is added to a gelled specimen, a moderate amount (~1.7-fold) of expansion begins, even before the main water-addition swelling step. We thought that distortions might occur if the internal tissue starts partially expanding before the cuticle is thoroughly digested. To prevent premature hydrogel expansion during the digestion process, we designed a digestion buffer containing 40 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, since such divalent cations prevent polyacrylate gel expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tillberg et al., 2016</xref>). We further considered that slower speeds of expansion could potentially result in more isotropic expansion even after Proteinase K digestion, by permitting time for the gel network to more uniformly stretch out the embedded tissue. Thus, we designed a protocol to partially expand the Proteinase K digested specimens in 6 serial washes lasting 30 min each, incrementally reducing salt concentrations each time (i.e., lowering Tris, NaCl, and CaCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations bit by bit throughout each of the 6 washes, ending with 5x saline-sodium citrate buffer (SSC)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). The final expansion factor at the end of the 6 washes is 1.8-fold.</p><p>Although the original proExM protocol preserves, to some extent, fluorescent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tillberg et al., 2016</xref>), some of the fluorescent proteins are destroyed, a problem exacerbated by a strong Proteinase K digestion protocol such as utilized here. We thus add fluorescent antibodies that bind to the remaining fluorescent proteins, to amplify their fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>); the thorough cuticle digestion, we reasoned, would increase the normally poor permeability of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> cuticle to antibodies so that staining would be possible. We next perform optional steps, such as the adding of an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS ester) of a fluorescent dye, which binds to amines and thus enables the visualization of general anatomical features, or the adding of DAPI to visualize DNA location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Finally, we expand the tissue-hydrogel composite yet further, again at a slow speed by using four serial washes of 30 min each, reducing the amount of SSC each time, until the final specimen is immersed in deionized water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). This results in a final expansion of 3.8-fold. However, we found that 0.05x SSC, i.e. a low-salt environment, promotes stability of antibody staining signals better than deionized water, i.e. a no-salt environment, and may be favorable for long-term (&gt;1–3 hr) imaging; to reach this state, we skip the last wash (with deionized water) in the serial washes, so the final specimen ends up immersed in 0.05x SSC, with a final expansion factor of 3.3-fold.</p><p>If LabelX was included as an anchor in the corresponding step mentioned above, post-expansion fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), followed by hybridization chain reaction (HCR), is possible, as we previously described for single molecule resolution RNA imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). In the original ExFISH protocol, a linear expansion factor of ~3.3x was achieved, for mouse brain specimens. This expansion factor resulted from first performing RNA detection in the specimen with hybridization probes, then performing HCR to amplify the hybridized products, and finally hydrogel expansion in 0.05x SSC, which has a sufficient salt concentration to maintain stable hybridization of the RNA detection probes, but which results in a lower expansion factor than deionized water. However, newer (‘version 3.0’) HCR strategies, which offer higher signal-to-background ratio and reduced necessity of optimizing probe sequences on a per-RNA-target-basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2018</xref>) use split-initiator probes that carry half the HCR initiator length of previous versions of HCR probes (18 instead of 36 nucleotides), and thus require a greater salt concentration to maintain hybridization stability between the HCR hairpins and the initiator, which in turn would result in linear expansion factors below ~3.3x. For <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we thought that the tradeoff between hybridization stability and expansion factor could be ameliorated if we first expand the tissue-hydrogel sample to ~3.8x (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>), then re-embed it into a non-expandable hydrogel to lock its size at the expanded state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>), as described in the published ExFISH and iterative expansion protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2017</xref>). In practice, the re-embedding monomer solution contains some ions, and thus the linear expansion factor slightly drops from 3.8x to 3.3x during this step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). But, after re-embedding, the linear expansion factor remains at ~3.3x, regardless of the salt concentration. Afterwards, we can then perform probe hybridization and HCR amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>), and the resulting hydrogel can be constantly maintained in high-salt environments (such as 5x SSC) that stabilize hybridized and amplified products, while the expansion factor can be maintained at ~3.3x, as previously reported. We finally perform antibody staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>), as well as optional NHS-ester staining and DAPI staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q</xref>), to visualize fluorescent proteins, anatomical features and DNA location, respectively. For the rest of this paper, we will refer to the protocol outlined above as the ‘expansion of <italic>C. elegans</italic>’ (ExCel) protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Visualizing fluorescent proteins via antibody staining with ExCel</title><p>We first asked whether the proposed ExCel protocol of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> could support immunohistochemistry against fluorescent proteins following the strong Proteinase K digestion of ExCel, in order to achieve signal amplification of retained fluorescent proteins. We applied the steps of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–I</xref> of the ExCel protocol on transgenic animals expressing pan-neuronal cytosolic GFP (<italic>tag-168p::GFP</italic>), and then performed immunostaining with anti-GFP primary antibody and fluorophore (Alexa Fluor 546)-conjugated secondary antibody in the step of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, followed by DAPI staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>) and expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). We observed bright, uniform anti-GFP staining of the nervous system in ExCel-processed, but not pre-ExCel, animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that ExCel could enable good antibody access to the inside of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and that GFP epitopes could survive the Proteinase K digestion sufficiently to serve as targets for antibody labeling. To quantify these observations, we computed the signal-to-background ratio for antibody staining with ExCel vs. standard processing, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. In short, we defined signal-to-background as the ratio between the average fluorescent intensity of the nerve ring region in the pan-neuronal cytosolic GFP animal (representing the signal), and that of the non-neuronal tissue (e.g. gonad and intestine tissue; representing the background) in the same animal. Signal-to-background ratios obtained with ExCel were several fold higher than those obtained using prior immunohistochemistry protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Finney and Ruvkun, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li and Chalfie, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nonet et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duerr, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>).

In situ analyses generally benefit from spatial context, which allow probed features (e.g. protein and nucleic acid targets) of unknown localization to be spatially attributed to known features or compartments (e.g. an identified cell, a tissue type, or an anatomical landmark). We reasoned that a label for spatial context could be particularly useful in an intact, multi-cellular organism that densely contains many tissue types (e.g. nervous, alimentary, reproductive, epithelial, muscle tissues) and anatomical structures (e.g. pharynx, nerve ring, intestines, gonads). In principle, it would be possible to create transgenic animals with multiple fluorescent markers labeling each structure, but here we asked whether a simple labeling strategy, which ideally requires a single, commercially available stain, and which could be rapidly applied, would suffice to provide sufficient contrast to differentiate tissue types throughout the whole animal. The chemical moiety N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS ester) could potentially satisfy these criteria, by reacting to primary amines on proteins. To determine whether the concentration of reactive amines after ExCel processing (which will digest many proteins, but may leave fragments of proteins attached to the hydrogel for staining) varies sufficiently across tissue types and anatomical features to produce sufficient contrast, we incubated ExCel-processed animals in a buffer containing 2 μM Atto 647N NHS Ester (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), and then expanded the animals in deionized water (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>).

To enable readout of RNA molecules via ExFISH and HCR, without trading off the expansion factor, we performed the re-embedding strategy that we discussed earlier in the Results section. Specifically, we expanded and re-embedded the hydrogel to maintain its expanded state (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M–N</xref>), which allows the hydrogel to be maintained at an expansion factor of ~3.3x, while immersed in a high-salt environment (5x SSC, which would otherwise shrink the non-re-embedded hydrogel to an expansion factor of ~2.0x) that supports signal stability of the ExFISH-HCR hybridized products. Afterwards, we sequentially performed 4 types of staining procedures on the re-embedded samples. First, we hybridized RNA detection probes to GFP mRNA transcripts, and amplified the detected signal with hybridization chain reaction (HCR) following the published ExFISH and HCR protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2018</xref>). Second, we used immunohistochemistry to label GFP. Third, we used an NHS ester of a fluorescent dye to stain anatomical features. Fourth, we used DAPI to stain for DNA location. We observed that simultaneous readout of GFP, the mRNA of GFP, DNA and anatomical features could be achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). From these images, we observed that, as expected, GFP mRNA was found in GFP-labeled neurons (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>); the nerve ring was visible clearly in both the GFP and the NHS-ester channels (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and D</xref>); DAPI-labeled nuclei spatially complemented the dark ellipsoidal spaces with length scales of 2–3 μm observed in the NHS-ester staining (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>); and relatively little GFP mRNA is found inside the DAPI-labeled nuclei compared to the peri-nuclear space (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>).

Although we rarely used pure water as such, because it encouraged antibody dissociation away from antigens (e.g., anti-GFP signal would drop by ~30% over a 3 hr imaging session), we did try this near-maximal expansion for the purposes of seeing how images would look. At 3.8x linear expansion, the diffraction limited resolution of a typical confocal microscope, using a standard 40x water immersion lens with a numerical aperture of 1.15, would effectively be approximately ~250 nm / 3.8 = ~65 nm (where the 250 nm value is derived from the Abbe diffraction limit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbe, 1873</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lipson et al., 1995</xref>]). We applied ExCel to transgenic animals expressing GFP-labeled synaptic proteins RAB-3, SNB-1 or GLR-1, and expanded them to linear expansion factors of 3.8x with deionized water. ExCel resolved nearby puncta that were blurred into a single punctum at the pre-ExCel stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). For the acquisition of quantitative data, we used the more conservative 0.05x SSC expansion protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>), which results in an expansion factor of 3.3x (and yields an effective resolution of ~75 nm, instead of ~65 nm in the fully expanded case); in 0.05x SSC, antibody brightness was stable. We measured the number of synaptic puncta detected from the RAB-3::GFP intensity profiles along segments of ventral nerve cord or SAB axonal processes, in pre- and post- ExCel images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and observed 2.1-fold more detected puncta in post-ExCel images than in pre-ExCel images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

However, differences in the relative expression of genes expressed among members of a single class have not been reported. We used ExCel to fill this gap, comparing single-neuron mRNA counts of probed transcripts in bilaterally and radially symmetric neurons of the same class. We did not observe any significant difference in the expression levels of examined transcripts between L and R neurons of the same class, including <italic>unc-25</italic> levels in RMEL/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>), <italic>cat-2</italic> levels in ADEL/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>) and <italic>tph-1</italic> levels in NSML/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>) (n = 3–7 animals from 1 population for each transcript; 2-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test; alpha = 0.05), which could suggest that the bilaterally symmetric L and R neurons of the same class have generally similar levels of expression. However, when we examined the RME neurons (a class of radially symmetric neurons) inside the same animals, we observed a significant difference in <italic>unc-25</italic> transcript count between RMEV/D and RMEL/R neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>, n = 6 neurons for each sub-class neuron group, over 3 animals from 1 population; p&lt;0.01, two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test), which provides evidence against the generalization that all neurons of the same class have similar levels of expression. Taken together, these results suggested that ExCel can achieve single-cell-resolution quantification of mRNA transcripts in identified single neurons of the same animal, which can resolve differential expression within the same neuronal class, and which allows collection of linked expression data over the same animal. Given that correlations of gene expression between identified neurons in a neural circuit may reveal principles of how neural circuits are organized and develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schulz et al., 2006</xref>), this may be very useful for the mapping of plasticity and homeostasis mechanisms in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Development of an alternative ExCel protocol for detecting general endogenous epitopes</title><p>In the standard ExCel protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), a strong treatment with Proteinase K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>) is used to both permeabilize the cuticle for antibody access (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and to confer high isotropy of expansion. Such treatment disrupts most protein epitopes, except for protease-resistant ones, such as fluorescent proteins. While the versatile genetic toolbox of <italic>C. elegans</italic> makes it relatively feasible to fuse target proteins of interest with fluorescent proteins, transgenesis could still be a labor-intensive process (e.g. compared to applying an affinity probe against a target), especially for investigating multiple protein targets. More importantly, fusion with fluorescent proteins could in principle disrupt expression level, localization and/or function of target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Snapp, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hammond et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crivat and Taraska, 2012</xref>). It would therefore be useful to develop an alternative ExCel protocol that supports detection of arbitrary, untagged endogenous protein targets, via completely post hoc methods such as immunohistochemistry.</p><p>There are two strategies for introducing general-target immunohistochemistry into the ExCel pipeline – either prior to gelation and partial expansion (e.g. at the state of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), or afterwards. We decided to proceed with the latter option, because our results with anti-GFP indicated that the former option resulted in lower uniformity and intensity of staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C,D</xref>), due to the insufficiently permeabilized cuticle. While stronger cuticle permeabilizations, such as physical cracking of the frozen cuticle, and protease digestion, can improve staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duerr, 2006</xref>), such treatments can also adversely affect the physical integrity of the worms. In principle, the strategy of performing immunostaining after gelation and partial expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–G</xref>) could solve this problem, by first covalently anchoring proteins to the hydrogel network, which preserves their spatial organization. Then, strong permeabilization treatments could be applied.</p><p>Therefore, we sought to identify an epitope-preserving post-gelation treatment that could replace the Proteinase K digestion. Such a treatment would need to fulfill two criteria. First, like Proteinase K, the treatment would need to mechanically homogenize the tissue, since otherwise fixed worm tissue could only be expanded by a limited amount (as in the first row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>; without any treatment, the worm expanded only by 1.4x linearly whereas the surrounding hydrogel expanded by 3.5x linearly). We developed an assay to score such capability to confer tissue expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). In this assay, hydrogel-embedded animals (as prepared by steps shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C, E–G</xref>) first undergo a candidate treatment (i.e. a single entry among all the post-gelation treatments in this screen), and then are expanded by deionized water, until the hydrogel reaches ~3.5x linear expansion factor (as shown in the third column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). At this stage, the animal expansion factors are measured, and normalized by the hydrogel expansion factor. (The normalization step removes sample-to-sample variability in hydrogel expansion factors, which had a standard deviation of 0.16x around the mean of 3.53x; n = 52 hydrogel samples from 3 separate experiments) If a treatment sufficiently homogenized the worm tissue, the worm would expand by nearly the same extent as the surrounding hydrogel does, and result in a normalized expansion factor of unity. As we expected, we observed that a collagenase treatment, which digests collagens, abundant structural proteins in the worm cuticle, resulted in improved normalized expansion factor (66%; third row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>) compared to the no-treatment condition (40%; first row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>), and that the Proteinase K treatment from the standard ExCel protocol, which we added as a positive control known to achieve thorough tissue homogenization (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), resulted in a normalized expansion factor close to unity (97%; second row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Screen of post-gelation treatments that confer tissue expandability and general stainability of epitopes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative transillumination images of paraformaldehyde-fixed, β-mercaptoethanol-reduced, AcX-treated, and hydrogel-embedded hermaphrodite animals, (left column) right after hydrogel embedding and prior to any hydrogel expansion, (middle column) after 1.9x-2.1x hydrogel expansion, by incubating the gelled sample in 1x PBS, or (right column) after 3.3–3.7x hydrogel expansion, by sequentially washing the gelled sample with 0.5x PBS, 0.1x PBS, and 0.01x PBS. After hydrogel embedding, gelled samples either are left in TNT buffer (top row; no treatment), processed with a 2 day 37°C Proteinase K digestion, as in the standard ExCel protocol (middle row), or processed with a 5 day 37°C collagenase type II digestion (bottom row). Transillumination images provide visualization to both the contour of the worm (traced under high digital magnification in black dotted lines, in cases where direct observation is difficult due to reduced tissue scattering after hydrogel expansion), and also the contour of the mold in the embedding hydrogel (traced in white dotted lines, in cases where direct observation is difficult to reduced gel-boundary scattering after hydrogel expansion). For each treatment, the expansion factor of the worm (measured as the length ratio of a worm in the pre-expansion and the post-3.5x-expansion (hydrogel) state) is normalized by the expansion factor of the embedding hydrogel, which results in a normalized expansion factor (abbreviated as nExF), to remove the variation on worm expansion factor due to inter-sample variation in the hydrogel expansion factor. For the no-treatment condition (top row) and the collagenase type II condition (bottom row), where the normalized expansion factors are markedly less than unity (0.40 and 0.66, respectively), the hydrogel-embedded worm tissue detaches from the surrounding hydrogel, due to tissue mechanical hindrances against expansion that are incompletely removed by the post-hydrogel-embedding treatment, and can be visualized by the extent of mismatch between the worm contour and the hydrogel-mold contour. Images are single-plane wide-field acquisitions. For post-2.0x- and 3.5x- images, in cases where uneven illumination from the bright-field light source strongly affects contour visualization, a band-pass filtering with the boundary of 3 and 30 pixels was performed with the Fiji function ‘Bandpass Filter’ to remove the illumination artifact, and to improve contour visualization. Brightness and contrast settings: first set by the automatic adjustment function in Fiji, and then manually adjusted (raising the minimum-intensity threshold and lowering the maximum-intensity threshold) to improve contrast for the boundaries of the worm and the mold. Scale bars: 300 μm in actual units (not converting to biological units here, since the two features (worm and hydrogel-mold) are associated with different expansion factors). (<bold>B</bold>) Representative images of the immunostaining of hydrogel-embedded animals in (<bold>A</bold>), via a panel of 5 primary antibodies with known patterns of staining. Due to spectral limitation, the five antibodies were separated into four spectrally separable channels (DyLight 405 for anti-GFP, Alexa 488 for anti-LMN1, Alexa 546 for anti-myotactin and anti-DLG1, Alexa 647 for anti-acetylated tubulin). An IHC score from 0 to 1 was manually assigned to each channel, based on the estimated signal-to-noise ratio of the expected pattern of staining, and thereby provides a rough quantification for the quality of immunostaining of each antibody (or pair of antibodies) following the specified post-hydrogel-embedding treatment. The strain used had pan-neuronal cytosolic expression of GFP (<italic>tag-168p::GFP</italic>). A few patterns of channel crosstalk, such as the anti-GFP signal observed in the anti-myotactin + anti-DLG1 channel, were observed but do not affect the scoring process, because the known patterns of staining for each of the five antibodies were spatially separable (GFP, pan-neuronal by promoter choice; LMN1 (lamin), nuclear; myotactin, periphery of pharyngeal muscle and beneath cuticle; DLG1 (disc large), adherens junctions that form characteristic thread-like patterns across the length of the worm; acetylated tubulin, touch-receptor neurons). Images are max-intensity projections of confocal stacks acquired through the entire animal. Brightness and contrast settings: individually set by the automatic adjustment function in Fiji. Linear expansion factors of the hydrogel: 1.9–2.1x (after immunostaining, the samples were left in 1x PBS and imaged in that state, without further expansion in deionized water; we decided to use this procedure here, because we observed that even at this partially expanded state, we could already evaluate whether the staining against protein targets yielded the expected patterns of localization, as demonstrated by the images in this panel, without the additional improvements in resolution that would result from further expansion of the samples). Linear expansion factors of the worm: no treatment, 1.1x; Proteinase K (standard ExCel), 1.9x, Collagenase Type II, 1.6x. Scale bars: left images, 50 μm (in biological units, i.e. post-expansion lengths are divided by the expansion factor of the worm). (<bold>C</bold>) Summary of the screen of 22 post-hydrogel-embedding treatments, each of which is characterized by (X axis) the post-treatment expandability of the worms, as quantified by the normalized expansion factor analysis as performed in A, and (Y axis) the post-treatment quality of immunohistochemistry, as quantified by the average of IHC scores across the four channels in the immunostaining assay as performed in B. Each dot represents a single treatment. See Methods for the protocol performed for each treatment. Treatments are grouped based on the nature of the protocol, and colored according to the group they belong to (legend). X- and Y- coordinates of each treatment represent the mean values of all animals analyzed in the expandability assay (which quantifies the normalized expansion factor, as in A) and the immunostaining assay (which quantifies the IHC score, as in B), respectively.

We developed an assay to screen for the combination of these two effects, by evaluating the quality of immunostaining on the treated animals. As different epitopes could respond differently to any given treatment, we utilized a panel of multiple targets to estimate the generality of epitope stainability (GFP, expressed pan-neuronally; LMN-1, a nuclear envelope protein; myotactin, a protein in the hypodermis; DLG-1, an adherens junction marker; and acetylated tubulin, a touch-receptor-neuron marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Siddiqui et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hadwiger et al., 2010</xref>]). These antibodies were selected because the authors of this paper were familiar with the expected patterns of staining, which were distributed into four spectral channels. We then scored the quality of immunostaining for each channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>), and then used the average score across all channels to represent the general epitope stainability for a given treatment. As we expected, the no-treatment negative control resulted in poor staining over all channels due to insufficient cuticle permeabilization. Proteinase K yielded excellent GFP staining, as expected, but low staining in most other channels (except for anti-myotactin, which yielded the expected pharyngeal staining with a moderate signal). Lastly, collagenase type II treatment, which could potentially permeabilize the cuticle (as the cuticle is majorly composed of collagen) while preserving general antigens (as collagenase recognizes a glycine-proline-hydroxyproline sequence that is highly specific to collagens), showed strong immunostaining results in 3 out of the 4 channels, and received an average immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 0.67.</p><p>We used these two assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A and B</xref>) to screen through 22 different candidate post-gelation treatments, which are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. We explored using non-Proteinase-K proteases with different substrate specificity, treatments derived from the antigen retrieval literature (which has been described to reverse formaldehyde-mediated crosslinks introduced by fixation, and could thus potentially improve tissue expandability and epitope stainability), and treatments that were derived from the magnified analysis of the proteome (MAP)

As we expected, the no-treatment condition resulted in lower expandability (represented by the normalized expansion factor, on the x-axis) and stainability (represented by the average IHC score, on the y-axis) than nearly all other treatments. The Proteinase K treatment from the standard ExCel protocol resulted in nearly the highest expandability among tested treatments, and a near-median stainability (due to high quality of anti-GFP staining and moderate quality of anti-myotactin staining). Several substrate-specific proteases (including collagenase type II, sequencing-grade trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin and elastase) outperformed Proteinase K in stainability, but at the expense of expandability. Treatments adopted from the antigen-retrieval literature performed similarly to the no treatment control, suggesting that fixative reversal itself might be insufficient to grant cuticle permeabilization and tissue homogenization, both of which could be more related to the mechanical properties of native tissue, rather than to covalent crosslinks made by the fixative. Lastly, heat-mediated denaturation treatments in buffers that we adopted from the MAP protocol (i.e., MAP1 buffer, which is the original buffer from the protocol and contains 50 mM Tris pH 9.0, 200 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (abbreviated as SDS; a protein denaturant), and 200 mM NaCl; and MAP5 buffer, which is a modified buffer containing 200 mM of additional NaCl (for 400 mM total) and 20 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (to reduce tissue expansion during treatment, as employed in the standard ExCel protocol)) resulted in modest expandability but high stainabilities (relative to the rest of the treatments) under certain temperature profiles (e.g. MAP5 18-18-2, which denotes a treatment in MAP5 buffer for 18 hr at 37°C, 18 hr at 70°C, and 2 hr at 95°C).</p><p>None of the screened treatments landed in the upper right corner, which represents the ideal of both full expandability and high-quality immunostaining. We reasoned that expansion factor could always be improved later, for example by applying expansion iteratively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2017</xref>), whereas permanent loss of epitopes could not be compensated for by a downstream step. Therefore, we focused on the treatments that in our screen scored highest on stainability, including denaturation treatment in MAP5 buffer (MAP5 18-18-2, abbreviated as ‘MAP5’ in following texts) and collagenase type II treatment (abbreviated as ‘Coll II’), for a more thorough analysis of general epitope stainability, by testing the quality of immunostaining (via the same method as in the initial screen, i.e. estimating the signal-to-noise ratio of the expected pattern of staining) over an expanded panel of 16 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>). We found that although these two treatments yielded similar average IHC scores (~0.67) as in the initial screen, MAP5, with which ~6–8 antibodies worked (~40%), moderately outperformed Coll II, with which ~4–5 antibodies worked (~28%).</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Immunohistochemistry after selected post-gelation treatments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Estimated signal-to-noise ratio of immunostaining in paraformaldehyde-fixed, β-mercaptoethanol-reduced, AcX-treated, and hydrogel-embedded hermaphrodite animals, where the immunostaining was performed after the gel-embedded sample was processed with either a collagenase type II treatment (Coll II; 24 hr at 37°C), a denaturation treatment in MAP5 buffer (MAP5; 18 hr at 37°C + 18 hr at 70°C + 2 hr at 95°C), or the same denaturation treatment but additionally preceded by a collagenase type VII treatment (Coll VII + MAP5; the collagenase VII treatment was performed for 24 hr at 37°C).

The first group was antibodies against GFP, which resulted in dim and uneven (i.e. consistently brighter around the vulva but dimmer in the head and tail) signal across the animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). We hypothesized that as MAP5 functions through protein denaturation, which does not specifically degrade the cuticle, the rate of antibody diffusion across the cuticle could limit the effective concentration of antibody that reaches the internal tissue, which could preferentially affect staining of high-copy-number targets, such as GFP expressed at a high level. We thus attempted to further permeabilize the cuticle by preceding the MAP5 treatment by a collagenase type VII pre-treatment (abbreviated as ‘Coll VII’); this collagenase is a chromatography-purified collagenase that removes a number of non-specific proteases found in other collagenase preparations, such as Coll II. Indeed, anti-GFP staining became stronger and more uniform across animals, for both of the GFP antibodies that we tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>), and without affecting the quality of staining for other epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>; compare second and third rows).</p><p>The second group that failed to stain after MAP5 treatment was antibodies of the IgM class, which yielded nearly no signal inside the worm tissue, for all 5 of the IgM-class antibodies tested. As discussed above, MAP5 does not specifically degrade the cuticle. Since IgM-class antibodies are pentamers of 180-kDa-sized subunits (i.e. ~900 kDa total, compared to the ~150 kDa IgG-class antibodies), their inability to diffuse across the relatively under-permeabilized cuticle following MAP5 could explain why internal tissues were never stained, whereas collagenase type II achieved staining with a few (2/5) IgM antibodies, likely because of the ability of collagenase II to digest the cuticle. We observed that while the Coll VII pre-treatment improved anti-GFP staining, it did not rescue the stainability of epitopes detected by IgM-class antibodies, which suggests that the Coll VII pre-treatment does not permeabilize the cuticle as extensively as Coll II does (but critically preserves many antigens that Coll II failed to preserve; compare rows 1 and 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the combination of Coll VII and MAP5 treatments resulted in strong signal-to-noise ratios and expected patterns of localization for many epitope targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>), such as GFP (expressed pan-neuronally in the cytosol), acetylated tubulin (expressed specifically in touch-receptor neurons), DLG-1 (adherens junction marker), DAO-5 (a nuclear protein), UNC-10 (a GTPase for synaptic vesicle release; localized to synapse-dense regions such as the nerve ring) and DYN-1 (a dynamin, for clathrin-mediated endocytosis; also localized to synapse-dense regions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Siddiqui et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hadwiger et al., 2010</xref>). The Coll VII + MAP5 treatment achieved high signal-to-noise ratios of staining for ~70% (~8 out of 11) of epitopes that we attempted to detect using non-IgM class antibodies (including IgG, the most prevalent class that accounts for &gt;95% of all commercially available antibodies). Thus, the Coll VII/MAP5 dual treatment enables immunostaining of general epitopes in hydrogel-embedded, morphology-intact whole animals of <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Design of the epitope-preserving ExCel protocol</title><p>Having established the Coll VII/MAP5 treatment as good for epitope preservation, we next incorporated strategies from iterative expansion microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2017</xref>) to boost the expansion factor, resulting in an epitope-preserving ExCel protocol (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>) capable of achieving expansion factors comparable to those of the standard ExCel protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In this protocol, we first use the same procedures as in the standard ExCel protocol to prepare hydrogel-embedded worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C,E–G</xref>). Then, instead of the Proteinase K treatment, we apply Coll VII and MAP5 treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B–C</xref>). As in standard ExCel, we employ a strategy to minimize premature sample expansion via adding calcium ions during mechanical homogenization; the collagenase type VII treatment is performed in a calcium-containing buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 40 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). Despite the use of calcium, small mismatches between the expansion factors of the worm and surrounding gel (which are ~0.9x and ~1.2x, respectively) can still cause the worm to detach from, but physically stay within, its own cast in the hydrogel (as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B</xref>). We speculate that the divalent calcium ions confer their sample-shrinking effect by crosslinking, via ionic interaction, polymers with repeating negative charges, including the polyacrylate network that constitutes the hydrogel, and perhaps the phosphate backbone of nucleic acids. Thus, a potential explanation for why the gel-embedded worm tissue is more responsive to the shrinking effect of the calcium-containing buffer, than the surrounding pure hydrogel, is that the worm tissue additionally contains negatively charged biological polymers such as DNA and RNAs, which could potentially get retained within the hydrogel even without explicit anchoring by LabelX (especially for chromosomal DNA, whose molecular weight would likely prevent it from free diffusion in the hydrogel network). After collagenase treatment, we perform denaturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13C</xref>) for 18–24 hr at 37°C, 18–24 hr at 70°C, and then 2 hr at 95°C, in MAP5 buffer, again with high salt to minimize premature hydrogel expansion. NaCl and CaCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations in MAP5 buffer are lower (400 mM and 20 mM, respectively) compared to those in the Proteinase K or Collagenase VII buffers (500 mM and 40 mM, respectively), due to the limited solubility of these ions in the presence of 200 mM SDS, a key component of the denaturation buffer.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig13" position="float"><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Workflow for epitope-preserving expansion of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (epitope-preserving ExCel) sample processing.</title><p>A method for expanding cuticle-enclosed intact <italic>C. elegans</italic>, while permitting readout of a majority of antigens that are detectable through non-IgM-class antibodies (~70%; estimated from the immunostaining results from the panel of 12 non-IgM antibodies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>).

(<bold>A–L</bold>) Steps of the protocol, with the bold text indicating the title of the step. (<bold>A</bold>) Hydrogel polymerization is performed on the specimen, by first incubating the specimens in activated monomer solution (0.015% 4-hydroxy-TEMPO, 0.2% TEMED, 0.2% APS, in addition to the non-activated monomer solution) for 1 hr at 4°C, transferring the specimens into a gelation chamber, and incubating the chamber for 2 hr at 37°C. During polymerization, AcX-modified proteins are covalently anchored to the hydrogel network. (<bold>B</bold>) Specimens are treated with chromatography-purified collagenase type VII at 0.5 kU/mL, in a calcium-containing tris-buffered saline (100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 40 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) overnight (18–24 hr) at 37°C. During this treatment, the hydrogel expands by ~1.2x linearly, whereas the worm slightly reduces in size to ~0.9x linearly. Due to the mismatch in expansion factor between the worm and the gel, the worm tissue detaches from the surrounding hydrogel, but physically remains in the hydrogel mold that was made of its own shape during the gelation step in A. (<bold>C</bold>) Specimens are processed with a denaturation treatment, in which they are incubated in a minimally-expanding protein-denaturing buffer (MAP5 buffer; 50 mM Tris pH 9.0, 5.72% (w/w) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 400 mM NaCl, 20 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) overnight (18–24 hr) at 37°C, overnight (18–24 hr) at 70°C, and 2 hr at 95°C. Reduced calcium and NaCl concentrations are used in this buffer, compared to other non-expanding buffers designed in this paper, due to their incompatible solubility with SDS at higher concentrations. (<bold>D</bold>) Specimens are washed four times in a tris-buffered saline (TNC40020 (acronyms are used in the supplementary protocols in Appendix 1) buffer; 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 400 mM NaCl, 20 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) to remove SDS from the hydrogel sample. Specimens are then washed four times in tris buffered saline with reducing calcium concentration (once with TNT Buffer + 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and then three times with TNT Buffer; TNT Buffer is 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1M NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) to remove calcium ions from the hydrogel sample. Finally, specimens are washed with phosphate-buffer saline with reducing NaCl concentration (once with PBST + 500 mM NaCl, twice with PBST; PBST is 1x PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100). (<bold>E</bold>) Specimens are immunostained with fluorescent antibodies against the target antigens. (<bold>F</bold>) Specimens are incubated with AcX at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL in PBST (1x PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100) overnight at RT. This step equips proteins, including the fluorescent antibodies introduced in E, with a polymer-anchorable moiety. (<bold>G</bold>) Specimens are incubated in non-activated G2 monomer solution (50 mM MOPS pH 7.0, 2 M NaCl, 7.5% (w/w) sodium acrylate, 2.5% (w/w) acrylamide, 0.15% (w/w) N,N’-methylene-bis-acrylamide) overnight at 4°C, to ensure complete diffusion of the monomer solution throughout the specimen, prior to the gelation reaction. (<bold>H</bold>) Specimens are re-embedded into a second expandable hydrogel, by incubating the specimens in activated monomer solution (0.015% 4-hydroxy-TEMPO, 0.2% TEMED, 0.2% APS, in addition to the non-activated monomer solution) for 45 min at 4°C, transferring the specimens into a gelation chamber, and incubating the chamber for 2 hr at 37°C. During polymerization, AcX-modified fluorescent antibodies are covalently anchored to the hydrogel network of the second hydrogel (orange grids). We use blue grids to represent the hydrogel network of the first, DATD-crosslinked hydrogel (i.e., the network synthesized in Panel A), to differentiate it from the network of the re-embedding second hydrogel. (<bold>I</bold>) Specimens are treated with Proteinase K at 8 U/mL, in non-expanding digestion buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 40 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% Triton X-100) overnight (18–24 hr) at RT, to further reduce the mechanical strength of the original worm tissue and permit greater expansion. During this proteolytic treatment, most proteins lose antigenicity, but some of the fluorescent signals from AcX-anchored fluorescent proteins are retained, as utilized by the original ProExM protocol. (<bold>J</bold>) Specimens are treated with DATD cleaving solution (20 mM sodium meta-periodate in 1x PBS, pH 5.5) for 30 min at RT, to chemically disintegrate the first hydrogel, which contains the periodate-cleavable crosslinker N,N'-diallyl-tartardiamide (DATD), while sparing the second hydrogel, which contains a periodate-resistant crosslinker, N,N’-methylene-bis-acrylamide (bis). (<bold>K</bold>) To visualize anatomical features, specimens can be stained with an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS ester) of fluorescent dye (introduced in Main Text, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>).

Specifically, samples are first washed four times with a buffer formulated similar to the denaturation buffer, but without the SDS component (50 mM Tris pH 8, 400 mM NaCl, 20 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>), to remove SDS from the sample. Next, the samples are washed four times in buffers with reduced (10 mM, for the first wash) or no calcium ions (for the next three washes) to remove calcium ions from the sample. Then, the samples are washed in phosphate-based buffers with reducing salt concentration, ending with PBST (1x PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100).</p><p>At this stage, the samples are immunostained against the target epitopes, with standard primary and fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies, in PBST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13E</xref>). As we re-embed the samples into another hydrogel, in a step later in the protocol, to boost the net expansion factor, the fluorophores on the secondary antibodies must be able to survive the free-radical-mediated hydrogel polymerization process. Many fluorophores that fit such criterion were described in the proExM study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tillberg et al., 2016</xref>), including common fluorescent dyes such as Alexa 488, Alexa 546, and Atto 647N. After immunostaining, samples are treated with AcX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13F</xref>), with the goal of adding a gel-anchorable moiety to the fluorophore-conjugated antibodies.</p><p>For the second expandable gel, in which we re-embed our samples for extra physical magnification, we designed a second-gel (‘G2’) monomer solution (50 mM MOPS pH 7.0, 0.15 M NaCl, 40 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 7.5% (w/w) sodium acrylate, 2.5% (w/w) acrylamide, 0.15% (w/w) N,N’-methylenebisacrylamide), whose formulation is similar to the monomer solution used in the first gelation, but replacing the gel crosslinker from the periodate-cleavable DATD with the periodate-resistant N,N’-methylenebisacrylamide (abbreviated as ‘bis’). To perform the re-embedding, we use a scheme similar to how the initial gelation was performed (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>): samples are first pre-incubated with the non-activated form of the G2 monomer solution overnight (to ensure equilibration of monomer concentration; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13G</xref>), and then re-embedded with the activated form of the G2 monomer solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13H</xref>).

We chose to use this version of the Proteinase K treatment, instead of the stronger version used in standard ExCel, because we reasoned that this version has been reported in our earlier proExM study to preserve a fair portion of the fluorescent signal (~50%) from fluorophore-conjugated antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tillberg et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>As in iterative expansion microscopy, the second expandable gel could reach its maximal expansion factor after the crosslinker of the first expandable gel was cleaved, thus chemically disintegrating the first gel. Therefore, we treat the samples with sodium periodate (1x PBS pH 5.5, 200 mM sodium periodate; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13J</xref>), which cleaves the DATD crosslinker that was used to compose the first expandable gel, based on a previously characterized chemistry of cis-diol cleavage by periodate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Späth and Koblet, 1979</xref>).</p><p>At this stage, NHS-ester staining could be applied to enable visualization of general anatomical features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13K</xref>), as described in the standard ExCel protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). While DAPI staining could also be applied here, we observed that the staining pattern looked very different from the regular, nucleus-contained pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplement 1</xref>). Specifically, while DAPI staining still seemed to localize to regions near nuclei, staining was no longer spatially restricted to being inside nuclei. In addition, we observed ellipsoidal blobs that localized to the periphery of the nuclei, had length scales of roughly 1/10 – 1/3 of a nucleus, and had brighter intensities than the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplement 1B and D</xref>). These observations are in contrast to DAPI staining with standard ExCel (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>) or previous protocols for applying DAPI in fixed worm tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shaham, 2006</xref>). A potential reason for this observation is that the heat-denaturation treatment, which combines non-physiologically high temperature (70–95°C), alkaline environment (pH 9), and a protein-denaturing agent (i.e. SDS) could have disrupted histone-DNA interactions, causing structural disintegration of nucleosomes. Under this hypothesis, genomic DNA, which was not covalently anchored to the hydrogel network (as no LabelX treatment was applied) would no longer be in its native, tightly packed state, and could potentially unwind, expand in physical size, and spill out from the nucleus (as the nuclear membrane would also be disrupted by the denaturation treatment). Of course, in standard ExCel, Proteinase K treatment did not alter DAPI staining from the expected nuclear-restricted staining profile. Perhaps Proteinase K does not access the histones, which may be sterically protected by DNA, whereas heat and small-molecule denaturants like SDS can access and exert disruptive effects on histones. In future studies, including LabelX to covalently anchor genomic DNA to the hydrogel may enable better preservation of genomic integrity.</p><p>Finally, we expand the samples in buffers with reducing salt, ending in deionized water, to fully expand the hydrogel-embedded worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13L</xref>). At this stage, the hydrogel expands by ~7.4x linearly, whereas the worm tissue expands by ~2.8x linearly, within a range from 2.5 to 3.5x (median, 2.78x; mean, 2.83x; n = 10 independently processed hydrogels from 2 sets of experiments). As the expansion factor of the worm tissue determines the effective resolution (which differs from ~250 nm / 3.5 = ~70 nm, to ~250 nm / 2.5 = ~100 nm, accordingly), we hypothesized two potential reasons why such variation could have occurred. First, during the execution of these experiments, we switched the vendor for sodium acrylate (from Millipore Sigma, product #408220, to Santa Cruz Biotechnology, product # sc-236893B), a key ingredient of the monomer solution, because we noticed an abrupt change in quality of the sodium acrylate powder supplied by the original vendor; these differences included changes in the powder texture (which increased distinctly in ‘fluffiness’), solubility (e.g. powders no longer dissolved at the stock concentration of 33%, and instead left insoluble, string-like precipitates, which might indicate premature polymerization within the source), and color of solution (from near-complete clearness to moderately yellow). We have since then screened through sodium acrylate powders from various vendors, and developed a strategy to identify, and to stock up on, quality-screened powders, which we describe in detail in Appendix 1 – 'Notes on sodium acrylate quality'. After switching to the second vendor, however, we noticed that the quality of sodium acrylate did not exactly match that of the original batches from the first vendor (i.e., the batches from the first vendor prior to aforementioned quality decline), based on slight but perceivable differences in the intensity of the yellow-ness of the stock solutions, as well as the timing of gelation after monomer activation. Such variations could indicate differences in the effective concentration of sodium acrylate, whose ionic interaction is the mechanism by which the hydrogel expands, and could explain differences in the linear expansion factor.</p><p>In epitope-preserving ExCel, tissue homogenization is not complete, as evident from the strong mismatch in the expansion factors of the worm tissue (2.8x) and the hydrogel (7.4x). Since homogenization is incomplete, unintended variations in the parameters of homogenizing treatments (which affect their strengths; e.g. temperature, duration, effective enzyme concentrations) could thus more strongly impact the final expansion factor. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observe less variation in the final-state expansion factor in the standard ExCel protocol (3.1–3.6x, for the re-embedding protocol; 3.8–4.2x, for the protocol without re-embedding), compared to the variation associated with epitope-preserving ExCel (2.5–3.5x). Thus, the greater variability in the final expansion factor of epitope-preserving ExCel could be due to insufficient homogenization, here deliberately pursued so that we can preserve epitopes and fluorophore-conjugated antibodies. We note that thorough homogenization could be potentially feasible with this protocol (and would grant more consistent expansion factor under this hypothesis), if in the future one were to replace the fluorophore-conjugated antibody with a DNA-oligo-conjugated antibody (as utilized in the original expansion microscopy publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>]), precisely for the purpose of de-coupling tissue homogenization from signal retention), although this also means added complexity for the end user, who will have to synthesize the DNA-conjugated antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Validation of epitope-preserving ExCel isotropy</title><p>Using a similar analysis to that used for characterizing the isotropy of standard ExCel (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we examined <italic>tag-168p::GFP</italic> animals (which has pan-neuronal GFP expression in the cytosol) at different stages of development, and compared rigidly registered (via scaled rotation) images of the same animal at four stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14A</xref>): (1) pre-expansion, for which the image was acquired right after animals are embedded into the first hydrogel (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A</xref>); (2) after the embedded sample underwent collagenase type VII digestion, heat denaturation, partial expansion and immunostaining (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13E</xref>; as discussed previously, starting with the collagenase treatment, a slight sample expansion occurs and causes a mismatch in the expansion factors of the worm and the surrounding hydrogel, which in turn results in detachment of the worms); (3) after the immuno-stained sample is re-embedded into the second hydrogel (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13H</xref>); (4) after mild homogenization with the 1 day RT Proteinase K treatment and full expansion in deionized water (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13L</xref>), which corresponds to the state where the final imaging occurs. We observed a noticeable change in the overall body posture between images from the first two stages (pre-expansion, vs. after Coll VII, MAP5, and partial expansion), which could be likely due to the detachment of the worm tissue from the surrounding hydrogel, and release of the worm from external mechanical forces exerted by the gel on the worm. In contrast, the body posture stays relatively consistent through the three later stages (after Coll VII, MAP5 and partial expansion, vs. after re-embedding, vs. after entire protocol), suggesting that the majority of body-posture level distortions occur during the initial stages (i.e. Coll VII, MAP5 and partial expansion) of the epitope-preserving ExCel protocol.</p><fig id="fig14" position="float"><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><title>Isotropy of epitope-preserving ExCel.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of paraformaldehyde-fixed, β-mercaptoethanol-reduced, AcX-treated, and hydrogel-embedded (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C, E–G</xref>) hermaphrodite animals in the second larval stage (‘Larval Stage 2’; L2), the fourth larval stage (‘Larval Stage 4’; L4) and day 1 adulthood (‘Day 1 Adult’) at various stages of the epitope-preserving ExCel workflow.

We observed that the error over 0 to 100 microns was ~25–32% for L1-L2 animals,~32–34% for L3-L4 animals, and ~34–36% for day 1 and day 2 adults, far greater than the errors from standard ExCel (~1–3% for L1-L2 animals;~2–5% for L3-L4 animals,~3–6% for day 1 and day 2 adults). We hypothesized that most of this error was not due to local distortion of the kind of concern to microscopists, but rather the large changes in overall body posture mentioned above. To isolate body posture distortion from local distortion, we used a built-in image-straightening function from ImageJ to adjust the worm body posture into a straight shape, for both the pre-gelation and post-entire-protocol images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14C</xref>). The straightened images help isolate the local, tissue-level distortions across the entire animal. When we now apply non-rigid registration and RMS error quantification on these body-posture-normalized images, we observed that the local, tissue-level error over 0 to 100 microns was ~8–17% for L1-L2 animals,~12–22% for L3-L4 animals, and ~16–25% for day 1 and day 2 adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14D</xref>). These error values are still greater than those of standard ExCel, suggesting that the replacement of the harsh but fully-homogenizing 2 day 37°C Proteinase K treatment, by milder, epitope- or fluorescent-signal- preserving treatments, comes at a tradeoff of reduced micron-scale isotropy. However, such levels of error could be acceptable for many biological applications that are concerned with the relative organization of proteins, rather than precise length measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s2-13"><title>Super-resolution imaging of multiple endogenous proteins with epitope-preserving ExCel</title><p>We next explored whether epitope-preserving ExCel could enable multiplexed imaging of endogenous protein targets, at the sub-diffraction-limit resolutions (~90 nm at 2.8x expansion factor) granted by tissue expansion. Following the epitope-preserving ExCel protocol, we immunostained against three protein targets, including DAO-5 (a nuclear protein), DLG-1 (a marker of adherens junctions), and DYN-1 (a marker of clathrin-mediated endocytic sites), applied NHS-ester staining to visualize general anatomical contexts, and then imaged the sample after full expansion in deionized water, which yielded a 3.2x linear expansion factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>). At this improved resolution, we more clearly observed the contours made by DLG-1, which shows a pattern of longitudinal lines spanning across the entire animal. In addition, we identified the six vulval precursor cells (i.e. P3.p to P8.p) from the DLG-1 staining, which shows six connected rings on the ventral midbody region of the L2 animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15D,E</xref>), a pattern that has been previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pellegrino et al., 2011</xref>).

After expansion, specimens are ready for imaging.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46249-fig17-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In the iExCel protocol, we first prepare hydrogel-embedded, Proteinase-K-digested, and partially expanded samples, following the same procedure as in the standard ExCel protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C, E–G</xref>). Next, instead of fluorescent-dye-conjugated antibodies, we use DNA-oligo-conjugated antibodies to stain for fluorescent proteins in the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17B</xref>, recall that with the standard ExCel protocol, only protease-resistant proteins such as fluorescent proteins can be stained and detected, because of the Proteinase K treatment; this characteristic is inherited by this iExCel protocol). These antibodies were custom synthesized using commercially available reagents (see conjugation protocol in Appendix 1 – 'Protocol for synthesizing DNA-conjugated Secondary Antibody for iExCel', which is essentially the same as previously published protocols for synthesizing oligo-conjugated antibodies for ExM purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>]). They contain a 24-base DNA oligonucleotide that carries an unreacted acrydite group, which is a gel-anchorable moiety that later allows these DNA oligos to be covalently linked into the next hydrogel.</p><p>After immunostaining, we fully expand the sample to a 3.8x linear expansion factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17C</xref>), and re-embed the sample into another non-expanding hydrogel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17D</xref>), which maintains the expanded state of the first hydrogel, even when the re-embedded sample is later immersed into a high-salt environment downstream in the protocol. This re-embedding process is therefore functionally similar to the re-embedding process used in the standard ExCel protocol with ExFISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M–N</xref>). Because the re-embedding monomer solution contains some ions, the expansion factor slightly reduces during the re-embedding step, from 3.8x to 3.6x. (Recall that a drop in expansion factor is also observed for the re-embedding step in standard ExCel with ExFISH, from 3.8x to 3.3x, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M–N</xref>. The expansion factor drops by a smaller extent for the iExCel case, because the re-embedding monomer solution used here contains less ions, i.e. by 50 mM less Tris base, than the version used in standard ExCel; see Methods for full recipes). During this re-embedding step, the gel-anchorable acrydite groups on the DNA-conjugated antibodies are covalently anchored to the second hydrogel, thereby retaining their relative spatial positions in the hydrogel network, regardless of downstream treatments that could cause antibody dissociation from the currently-bound targets (e.g. downstream hybridization requires a buffer containing formamide, an organic solvent that could disrupt protein-protein interactions). Lastly, the crosslinker that we use for this second hydrogel is DATD, which is the same as the crosslinker of the initial hydrogel. Such design allows controllable disintegration (via periodate-mediated DATD cleavage, as utilized in epitope-preserving ExCel, i.e. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13I–J</xref>) of both of these gels following re-embedding of the third (and the final) hydrogel, allowing the final expandable hydrogel to expand maximally.</p><p>After re-embedding into the second hydrogel, we hybridize a 100-base DNA oligo, which we refer to as the ‘linker’, to the hydrogel-anchored 24-base DNA oligo that was introduced via the oligo-conjugated antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17E</xref>). This linker oligo contains three components: (1) a region that is complementary to the anchored 24-based oligo, which enables detection of the immunostained locations; (2) four identical regions that are complementary to a fluorescent-dye-conjugated 15-base locked-nucleic-acid (LNA) oligo, which will hybridize to the linker oligo downstream in the protocol, for the final readout; and (3) another unreacted gel-anchorable acrydite group, which allows this linker oligo to be covalently retained in the third hydrogel. During this hybridization step, the re-embedded sample swells by ~30% linearly, and results in a linear expansion factor of ~4.6x. The reason for this additional expansion is that although we refer to the re-embedding second gel as ‘non-expanding’ (by excluding sodium acrylate, the charged ingredient that confers hydrogel expandability in deionized water, from the recipe of this second gel), this acrylamide-only gel still swells by ~1.3x when immersed in an aqueous solution, a property that has been well-described for polyacrylamide gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baselga et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Patel et al., 1989</xref>). For the standard ExCel protocol with ExFISH, we also perform re-embedding with an acrylamide-only hydrogel, but did not observe changes in the expansion factor afterwards (which stayed at ~3.3x for all subsequent procedures; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N–Q</xref>); this lack of change in the sample expansion factor could be potentially explained by a balance between two effects: the swelling effect of the polyacrylamide re-embedding gel, and the shrinking effect of the high-ionic-strength immersing solution used in ExFISH applications (5x SSC, whose ionic strength is ~1600 mOsm), the latter of which might have been reduced, but not eliminated, by the re-embedding procedure. On the other hand, for the iExCel case, the polyacrylamide-gel swelling effect could have overcome the ion-mediated shrinking effect, because the sample was immersed in 1x PBS (a lower-ionic-strength buffer, i.e.,~300 mOsm, than 5x SSC) prior to the measurement of expansion factor, and that the re-embedding hydrogel consists of a greater concentration of acrylamide (4% for standard ExCel; 10% for iExCel), which is expected to be mechanically stronger and more resistant to the shrinking effects of a ion-containing immersing solution. In summary, we observed that the post-re-embedding iExCel sample gains additional expansion (from 3.6x to 4.6x) during the hybridization step, a phenomenon that is not-observed for post-re-embedding samples from the standard ExCel protocol with ExFISH, likely because of differences in the ionic strengths of immersing buffers, and in the compositions of the re-embedding gels.</p><p>We then re-embed the linker-hybridized sample into a third (and the final) hydrogel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17F</xref>). Similar to the first hydrogel, the third hydrogel is expandable, thus conferring two rounds of sample expansion. We designed a third-gel monomer solution that contains the periodate-resistant bis crosslinker, which permits this gel to survive through the periodate-mediated disintegration of the embedded hydrogels, as demonstrated in epitope-preserving ExCel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13I–J</xref>). During this re-embedding process, the gel-anchorable acrydite group on the linker oligo is covalently attached to the third hydrogel network.</p><p>Following the re-embedding of the third hydrogel, we chemically dis-integrate the first two hydrogels (both of which were constituted with the periodate-sensitive DATD crosslinker) with sodium periodate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17G</xref>), using the same protocol as used in epitope-preserving ExCel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13I–J</xref>). The sample is then incubated with fluorescent-dye-conjugated 15-base locked nucleic acid (LNA) strands, which hybridizes to the complementary regions on the linker oligos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17H</xref>; there are four regions per linker oligo, which allows signal amplification). Importantly, an LNA oligo was used instead of a normal DNA oligo, because of its ability to retain hybridization with the linker molecule even in deionized water, i.e. the immersing medium that is required for full sample expansion. Finally, we expand the sample with deionized water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17I</xref>), which is expected to yield a linear expansion factor of ~20x (based on results from the iExM publication), and then image the fluorescent signals from the LNA, which reports the spatial positions of the immuno-stained fluorescent proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-16"><title>Super-resolution imaging of sub-neuronal features with iExCel</title><p>We tested whether the iExCel protocol could indeed achieve ~20x linear expansion, which would yield an effective resolution of ~25 nm, in cuticle-enclosed entire animals of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. To validate improvements in resolution from the iterative expansion process, it would be informative to compare the same animal at three different stages of the protocol: prior to expansion, after 1 round of expansion, and after 2 rounds of expansion. To perform such a comparison, we first prepared hydrogel-embedded <italic>tag-168p::GFP</italic> animals (which express GFP pan-neuronally in the cytosol) with the standard ExCel protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C, E–G</xref>), on which we acquired pre-expansion images right after hydrogel-embedding, and prior to Proteinase K digestion, similar to how we acquired pre-expansion images for other ExCel-related experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">14A</xref>). We then treated the sample with Proteinase K digestion and partial expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>), and then proceeded to the iExCel protocol, by staining GFP with a primary antibody and a DNA-oligo-conjugated secondary antibody, performing full expansion of the first hydrogel to a 3.8x linear expansion factor, re-embedding into the second hydrogel, and linker hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17A–E</xref>).</p><p>Normally, the iExCel protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>), similar to the published iExM protocol, does not include steps that enable readout at the post-1st-round-expansion stage (since the fluorescent dye, which reports the immunostained locations, is not introduced until right before the 2nd-round expansion), so we added the following steps into the iExCel protocol to enable post-1st-round-expansion readout, for this validation experiment. After linker hybridization, we incubate the sample with a fluorescent-dye-conjugated 15-base DNA oligo, which has the same sequence as the LNA oligo that would be applied downstream for the post-2-round-expansion readout (i.e. at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17H</xref>), except that it is composed completely of DNA, since the readout at this post-1st-round-expansion stage does not need to be performed in deionized water (it is re-embedded, so the hydrogel expansion factor is maintained at ~3–4x) and thus does not require LNA to maintain hybridization. These DNA oligos thus hybridize to the linker (which contains 4 repeats of the complementary sequences for the 15-base DNA oligos) and fluorescently report the stained positions, allowing readout at this post-1st-round-expansion stage, which had a linear expansion factor of 4.6x.</p><p>After acquisition of the post-1st-round-expansion image, we de-hybridize the sample in a buffer that contains a high concentration of formamide (80% formamide + 0.1% Triton X-100), which is an organic solvent that disrupts nucleic acid hybridization, at 37°C for 6 hr. Afterwards, we re-hybridize the sample with the linker. These de-hybridization and re-hybridization steps replace the linkers that are occupied by the 15-base fluorescent-dye-conjugated DNA oligos, with a set of new, unbound linkers, to ensure that downstream LNA hybridization would not be affected by this intermediate readout stage. After linker replacement, we proceed to the rest of the iExCel protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17E–I</xref>), by re-embedding into the third hydrogel, cleaving the first and the second gels, hybridizing with fluorescent-dye-conjugated LNA, and then fully expanding the sample, to yield an expansion factor of ~20.6x.</p><p>We then compared images of the same animal, acquired at the pre-expansion, post-1st-round-expansion, and post-2nd-round expansion stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18A</xref>). We observed that visible distortion is fairly low throughout the iExCel process, perhaps because the devised protocol uses the same, highly homogenizing 2 day 37°C Proteinase K treatment as in the standard ExCel protocol. To quantify the distortion associated with the entire iExCel protocol, we applied non-rigid registration between the pre-expansion and post-2nd-round-expansion images, and calculated the root-mean-square (RMS) error of feature measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18s1">Figure 18—figure supplement 1</xref>), as performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14B</xref>. We observed that the error over 0 to 100 microns was ~1.5–4.5% for animals across developmental stages from L1 to day 1 adulthood, which are within a similar range to that from standard ExCel (~1–6%), a single-round expansion protocol. These observations are consistent with results from earlier ExM studies, which suggested that the micron-scale isotropy of iteratively expanded samples was essentially equivalent to those of single-round-expanded samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2017</xref>). Next, we observed improved sharpness of cell boundaries and neuronal processes with progressive rounds of expansion, over the length scale of the entire pharyngeal region of the animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). The improvement from the unexpanded to the 1st-round-expanded stage seems more obvious than the improvement from the 1st-round- to the 2nd-round-expanded stage, perhaps because the former (a change of resolution from ~250 nm to ~250 nm / 4.6x = ~55 nm) is more easily appreciated at this tissue-level length scale, compared to the later (a change of resolution from ~55 nm to ~250 nm / 20.6x = ~12 nm). Consequently, when we examined regions of the animal over the length scales of single neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18C</xref>) or over length scales of sub-neuron compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18D</xref>; showing a neuronal projection and a portion of a soma), we observed that the 2-round-expanded image clearly resolves individual fluorescent puncta (which likely arose from individual GFP molecules; in the iExCel protocol, the target protein (GFP, in this case) could be equipped by antibody binding and oligo-nucleotide hybridization events, to become a complex of ~37 nm in diameter in the pre-expansion scale (i.e.,~750 nm in the post-expansion scale), and would appear as fluorescent puncta of ~50 nm in diameter in the pre-expansion scale (i.e.,~1040 nm in post-expansion scale) after the diffraction effect, on a confocal microscope), even in regions where the puncta are positioned so densely such that optical diffraction made them appear as continuous in the 1-round-expanded samples. We note that the highly punctate appearance of the cytosol-filling GFP, as observed from the 2nd-round-expanded images, is what we expected, because fluorescent signals are composed of individual molecules (GFP, in this case) that can appear as continuous under the diffraction effect if densely packed (i.e. if the inter-molecule distance falls below the diffraction-limited distance); however, as we approach spatial resolutions around the scale of inter-molecule distances, as achieved by the ~20 nm resolution from iExM, we would expect to observe, and indeed observed, a collection of individually separable fluorescent puncta, much like other localization-based super-resolution techniques such as STORM. Thus, iExCel enables visualization of fluorescent proteins following iterative expansion of intact animals, for ~20x linear expansion factor and ~25 nm effective resolution, which is demonstrated here to be finer than the inter-molecule distance for an over-expressed protein target in the cytosol.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig18" position="float"><label>Figure 18.</label><caption><title>iExCel-expanded whole <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</title><p>A representative iExCel-processed (formaldehyde-fixed, β-mercaptoethanol-reduced, AcX-treated, hydrogel-embedded, Proteinase-K digested, antibody-stained, second-gel-re-embedded, linker-hybridized, third-gel-re-embedded, LNA-hybridized, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17A–I</xref>) L3 hermaphrodite animal at various stages along the iExCel protocol.

The standard ExCel protocol is a an ExM variant that permeates the tough <italic>C. elegans</italic> cuticle and permits antibody staining against fluorescent proteins, RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization, and morphological staining, all in the context of expansion microscopy. We show that ExCel can be used for multiplexed imaging of multiple molecular types, for synapse mapping, and for gene expression analysis in multiple individual neurons of the same animal. Because the standard ExCel protocol cannot detect general epitopes, and requires attachment of fluorescent reporters to target proteins, we developed epitope-preserving ExCel, which enables antibody staining against general untagged endogenous proteins. We show that epitope-preserving ExCel can detect previously unreported localization of a protein at the cell junctions between developing cells, and resolve peri-active and active zone proteins in chemical pre-synapses. Finally, we developed iterative ExCel, which enables two consecutive rounds of hydrogel-mediated expansion of entire worms, for ~20x linear expansion and a ~25 nm resolution, which is sufficient to resolve distances between individual cytosolic GFP molecules expressed in neurons. Compared to earlier super-resolution methods, all three variants of ExCel offer the ability to image at arbitrary depths in the worm, and on existing common microscopes available to many groups already.</p><p>The current standard of <italic>C. elegans</italic> in situ RNA detection, single-molecule FISH (smFISH), is diffraction-limited and requires wide-field illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ji and van Oudenaarden, 2012</xref>), yielding single transcript sizes of ~200–500 nm laterally, and ~700–800 nm axially. Given the small neuronal size of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, smFISH can practically detect up to ~10–20 transcripts in an average-sized neuronal soma before losing single-transcript resolution. On the other hand, standard-ExCel-based ExFISH-HCR can detect at least 300 individually resolvable transcripts at ~3.3x linear expansion (which reduces the effective size of HCR amplified transcripts to ~150 nm laterally, and ~250 nm axially), thereby allowing precise digital quantification even for highly abundant mRNA targets, while also improving the attributability of single transcripts into sub-cellular compartments and identified single cells, due to nanoscale resolution in all other channels that provide spatial context (GFP, DAPI, NHS-ester-stained anatomical features). We note that out of the three variants of ExCel, the standard ExCel is the only one that currently supports RNA readout. The epitope-preserving ExCel uses a heat-mediated denaturation treatment at pH 9.0, which could induce alkaline hydrolysis of RNA molecules and disrupt downstream detection. In principle, RNA readout could be compatible with iterative ExCel, using a serial hybridization strategy similar to how the current iExCel protocol passes positional signals across hydrogels in different rounds of expansion, but we have not explored such a strategy in the present study. Therefore, the current incompatibility with RNA readout for these ExCel variants provide grounds for future improvements.</p><p>The standard ExCel protocol has good isotropy, with exceptions in the gonad and mouth areas, which suggests future improvements may be possible. Given that eggshells of <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos (inside adult gonads) and the pharyngeal lumen walls (inside the mouth region) both contain chitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heustis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stein and Golden, 2018</xref>), and are the only structures reported to contain chitin in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), it is possible that future versions of ExCel that incorporate chitin disruption may be able to alleviate these distortions. Epitope-preserving ExCel has a lower expansion isotropy compared to standard ExCel, because its epitope-friendly treatment, which combines collagenase and a heat-mediated denaturation, is not as effective in mechanically homogenizing the cuticle and/or the internal worm tissue, as the standard, epitope-disruptive, Proteinase K treatment. On the other hand, iterative ExCel has a high isotropy that is on par with standard ExCel, because it inherits the Proteinase K treatment from standard ExCel; for that same reason, it can only detect fluorescent proteins, but not general proteins, in its current state. Future improvements on the ExCel toolbox could aim at enhancing the isotropy of epitope-preserving ExCel, and increasing the molecular types that can be imaged with iterative ExCel. iExCel achieves ~20x linear expansion, and a theoretical limit of resolution down to ~25 nm. Using additional hydrogel crosslinkers that are compatible with DATD and bis, it would be feasible to perform three or more rounds of expansion, as previously demonstrated in iExM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2017</xref>), which could further improve theoretical limits of resolution. Similar to any other super-resolution microscopy, such as electron microscopy, the ability to visualize fine structural details is dependent on not only the magnification, but also a stain that can densely label biological structures, to make it possible for finer spatial sampling of the structure. In this regard, future developments of iExM and iExCel should consider strategies to maximize the density of labeling molecules on biological structures (e.g. use of smaller-size affinity probes, instead of large molecules that can have steric effects and reduced packing densities, e.g. ~150 kDa IgG antibodies), hydrogel chemistries that can accommodate increased densities of labeling molecules, and strategies to ensure positional signals are thoroughly transferred across hydrogels in multiple rounds of expansion.</p><p>Expansion microscopy protocols are continuously being extended, to include greater multiplexing capability for both RNA imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) and protein imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ku et al., 2016</xref>), physical magnification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Truckenbrodt et al., 2018</xref>), imaging of lipid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karagiannis, 2019</xref>), hydrogels that yield greater nanoscale isotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao, 2019</xref>), and other features. These augmentations could in principle be applied to ExCel as well. For example, if combined with a high-density membrane stain and antibodies against synaptic proteins, ExCel and its variant protocols, such as iterative ExCel with three or more rounds of hydrogel expansion, might facilitate the reconstruction of a molecularly annotated connectome (i.e. with molecular information at each synapse) of a single entire animal, potentially acquired and segmented at a higher speed than with electron microscopy by utilizing unique advantages offered by light microscopy, such as optical sectioning, spectral multiplexing, and the related wealth of information that might facilitate semi- or fully automated connectomic analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenor-habditis elegans</italic>)</td><td>N2</td><td><italic>Caenorhabditis Genetics</italic> Center</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:WBStrain00000001">WB-STRAIN:WBStrain00000001</ext-link></td><td>Genotype: wild-type</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>CX16682</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Genotype: <italic>kyIs700 [tag-168p::GFP;

Unless otherwise specified, all procedures were performed at room temperature (RT) and all centrifugation was performed at 400 g for 2 min. Animals were collected from agar plates into a 15 mL conical tube with M9 buffer. Animals were washed three times in fresh M9 buffer, distributed into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, pelleted by centrifugation, chilled on ice for 5 min, and fixed with ice-cold paraformaldehyde fixative (1x PBS + 4% paraformaldehyde) on a tube rotator for 30 min at RT, and then incubated for 4 hr at 4°C. Fixed animals were washed three times in cuticle reduction buffer (25 mM borate buffer, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.5), and incubated in cuticle reduction buffer overnight at 4°C. Cuticle-reduced animals were washed twice in BT (25 mM borate buffer, pH 8.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 8.5), twice in PBST-0.5% (1x PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100), and stored in 1x PBS at 4°C for up to 2 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>LabelX and AcX treatments</title><p>For the standard ExCel protocol, the LabelX and AcX treatments were performed using the following procedure. LabelX reagent was prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, Label-IT Amine Modifying Reagent (Mirus Bio, LLC) was re-suspended in the provided Reconstitution Solution at 1 mg/mL. LabelX stock solution was prepared by reacting 100 μL of Label-IT Amine Modifying Reagent stock solution (at 1 mg/mL) to 10 μL of AcX stock solution (6-((acryloyl)amino)hexanoic acid, succinimidyl ester; also known as Acryloyl-X, SE; here abbreviated AcX; Thermo Fisher Scientific; re-suspended in DMSO at 10 mg/mL) overnight at RT. LabelX stock solution was stored at −20°C. To add gel-anchorable groups onto nucleic acids for ExFISH readout, fixed animals were treated with LabelX reagent at 0.02 mg/mL in nucleic-acid-anchoring buffer (20 mM MOPS, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.7), overnight at 37°C with gentle shaking. We note that although LabelX was applied at 0.02 mg/mL for all data presented in this study, we observed that a lower concentration of 0.01 mg/mL resulted in no discernable difference in the quantity of detected RNA transcripts, but significantly improved the extent by which the animals expand (by ~10% of the expansion factor). Therefore, we recommend the use of 0.01 mg/mL for future applications. After the overnight incubation, samples were washed with PBST-0.1% (1x PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100) for three times, 30 min each at RT on a tube rotator. To add gel-anchorable groups onto fluorescent proteins for post-ExCel antibody staining, fixed animals were treated with AcX at 0.1 mg/mL in protein-anchoring buffer (also referred as MBST pH 6.0; 100 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.0), overnight at RT on a tube rotator. After the overnight incubation, samples were washed with MOPST-0.1% (100 mM MOPS pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) for three times, 30 min each at RT on a tube rotator.

Animals were fixed and immuno-stained with one of the following immunohistochemistry protocols: Tube Fixation, Bouin’s Tube Fixation, Peroxide Fixation (all as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duerr, 2006</xref>]), or the standard ExCel protocol (as described above). Primary antibodies used were chicken anti-GFP (Abcam ab13970), rabbit anti-mCherry (Kerafast EMU106) and guinea pig anti-TagRFP (Kerafast EMU108). Secondary antibodies used were conjugated to dyes that are spectrally separate from the fluorescent proteins (Alexa Fluor 546 was used for GFP; Alexa Fluor 647 was used for mCherry and TagRFP). Confocal stacks were acquired throughout entire animals. Optical intensities of the laser power were computed as the ratio of the laser power to the beam area. The laser powers at wavelengths of 561 nm and 647 nm were measured with an optical power sensor (Thorlabs S170C), and the beam area was computed from the beam diameter, which was measured with a caliper. For the signal-to-background analysis, max intensity projection of an animal was first cropped into 50 μm * 50 μm images centered around the nerve ring and the upper body (between the nerve ring and the vulva) regions (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Mask were generated by a semi-automated algorithm (MATLAB) to capture regions of the images corresponding to neurons around the nerve ring (where FPs were strongly expressed by the pan-neuronal promoters <italic>tag-168p</italic> or <italic>rab-3p</italic>) and to the tissue background (i.e. non-neuronal regions, with non-detectable FP expression) based on the percentile-ranking of intensity values of each pixel relative to the rest of the cropped image. Signal-to-background ratio was defined as the ratio of average intensity values between pixels inside the two masks. Analysis of the signal-to-background ratio was performed as schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.

For the isotropy analysis of the standard ExCel protocol, animals of various developmental stages (L1 to day 2 adult) were imaged before and after ExCel under the same settings (spinning disk confocal microscopy with a 40 × 1.15 NA water-immersion objective). The pre-ExCel image was acquired after hydrogel embedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) to fixate the orientation of the animals to enable registration with the post-ExCel image. The post-ExCel image was acquired after the additional steps of Proteinase K digestion, partial expansion to 1.8x, antibody staining, and expansion to 3.3 or 3.8x (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J,L</xref>).

Confocal images of before and after ExCel were acquired as described in ‘Isotropy analysis of whole-nematode expansion’. Max-intensity projections of the pre- and post- ExCel images were rigidly registered by scaled rotation. From each animal, line intensity profiles were generated over multiple segments of the ventral nerve cord or the SAB axonal processes. Line intensity profiles were linearly normalized to an intensity range between 0 and 1, and averaged with a moving window of 3 pixels to reduce noise. Local maxima from the line profiles were detected. The topological prominence of each local maxima was computed using the MATLAB built-in function <italic>findpeak</italic>. Local maxima with topographic prominence &lt;0.01, which corresponds to local maxima whose heights are insignificant compared to the neighboring intensity level, were rejected as noise. The number of local maxima with topographic prominence &gt;0.01 was defined as the peak count.

Animals were fixed, sequentially treated with LabelX and AcX treatments, gel-embedded, digested with Proteinase K, re-embedded, processed with FISH-HCR and immunohistochemistry against GFP as described in sections above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–I,M–Q</xref>). Specimens were imaged under spinning disk confocal microscopy with a 40 × 1.15 NA water-immersion objective. Single-neuron RNA quantification was performed by a custom workflow developed in MATLAB. Briefly, max-intensity-projections for the x-, y- and z- directions were generated for both the GFP and the FISH-HCR channels. From the projection images, individual neurons were identified by their stereotypical location and neuronal morphology provided by the cytosolic GFP signal, as well as prior knowledge of neuron-specific expression from the ExFISH signal. A 3D-bounding box enclosing each identified neuron was manually selected with an ROI-selection tool developed in MATLAB. Based on the coordinates of the selected 3D-bounding box, 3D stacks containing the identified neurons were cropped out from raw image stacks. For each cropped stack, FISH-HCR spots were detected using a 3D spot-finding algorithm developed by the Raj Lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raj, 2017</xref>) (source code and instructions can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bitbucket.org/arjunrajlaboratory/rajlabimagetools/wiki/Home">https://bitbucket.org/arjunrajlaboratory/rajlabimagetools/wiki/Home</ext-link>).

For the expandability assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A and C</xref>, transillumination images were acquired on paraformaldehyde-fixed, β-mercaptoethanol-reduced, AcX-treated, and hydrogel-embedded hermaphrodite animals (as processed by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C,E–G</xref>) at three stages: (1) right after hydrogel embedding and prior to any hydrogel expansion, (2) after a candidate treatment and 1.9x-2.1x hydrogel expansion, by incubating the post-treatment gelled sample in 1x PBS, or (3) after a candidate treatment and 3.3–3.7x hydrogel expansion, by sequentially washing the post-treatment gelled sample with 0.5x PBS, 0.1x PBS, and 0.01x PBS. From images of the first and the third stages (i.e. pre-expansion and post-3.3–3.7x-expansion, respectively), expansion factors of the worm and the surrounding hydrogel were computed. The normalized expansion factor of the worm was computed via dividing the worm expansion factor by the hydrogel expansion factor.</p><p>For the stainability assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B and C</xref>, post-treatment samples were stained by a panel of 5 primary antibodies: anti-GFP, anti-LMN1, anti-myotactin, anti-DLG1 and anti-acetylated tubulin. The primary antibodies are then detected by secondary antibodies with the following fluorescent dyes, respectively: DyLight 405, Alexa 488, Alexa 546, Alexa 546 and Alexa 647. An IHC score from 0 to 1 was manually assigned to each channel, based on the estimated signal-to-noise ratio of the expected pattern of staining (estimated by manual inspection of the relative intensity values of the on-target pixels (signal; pixels identified by prior knowledge about the expected localization of staining) versus the off-target pixels (noise) in the fluorescence images).

(2002)</xref>, ‘in experiments based on the success or failure of a desired goal, the number of animals required is difficult to estimate.’ As was also noted in this paper, “the number of animals required is usually estimated by experience instead of by any formal statistical calculation, although the procedures will be terminated [when the goal is achieved].” Since the goal of the current paper was to demonstrate a technology, rather than test a hypothesis, we did not pre-determine any sample sizes for this study. The measurements were collected simply for providing a quantitative characterization of the underlying population. For this purpose, we employed statistical heuristics, and aimed to collect sufficient data to ensure that all reported quantities have at least three biological replicates. For the statistical test performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>, we used the two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test, since we cannot assume normality of the underlying populations. For all experiments performed in this study, fixed animals were randomly allocated into experimental groups, by thoroughly mixing the tube of fixed animals (after the steps described in the ‘fixation and cuticle reduction’ section) and then aliquoting constant quantities into separate groups. Masking of experimental conditions (blind experiments) was not performed during data collection and analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Steven W Flavell for sharing the transgenic strain CX16682.

This protocol is not currently not compatible with RNA readout. The sensitivity to read out target signal is lower than the standard ExCel protocol (due to a greater volumetric dilution associated to the expansion process), and therefore it works best on fluorescent proteins that are strongly expressed (ideally, with clearly observable signal at the pre-expansion state, when imaged under a high NA (&gt;~0.8) objective under typical illumination settings on a confocal microscope).</p><p>A number of oligo-nucleotides are used in this protocol. They serve several purposes: (1) acting as spatial anchors for the immunostained locations, (2) signal transfer between gels, and (3) signal amplification and fluorescent readout. Their sequences and ordering information can be found in ‘Oligo-nucleotides in iExCel protocol’.</p><sec id="s11-1"><title>Synthesis of DNA-conjugated secondary antibody</title><p>Perform the protocol shown in ‘Protocol for synthesizing DNA-conjugated secondary antibody for iExCel’.</p></sec><sec id="s11-2"><title>Fixation and Cuticle Reduction</title><p>Same as in the standard ExCel protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s11-3"><title>Protein Anchoring</title><p>Same as in the standard ExCel protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s11-4"><title>Gelation (Gel #1)</title><p>Same as in the standard ExCel protocol.

This way, the worms (which settle to the lower ~50 μm during Gel #1 gelation, out of the full ~180 μm thickness of the gel) will remain at the bottom surface of the gel at the end of this protocol, ensuring maximal coverage of the worm tissue by the working distance of the objective during the final imaging. In order to provide a way to check the orientation (side) of the gel throughout the protocol, at least one of the two additional procedures is necessary at the end of the Gelation step. See 'Methods to track the surface of the hydrogel on which the worms are located' for a protocol of these procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s11-5"><title>Digestion</title><p>Same as in the standard ExCel protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s11-6"><title>Antibody Staining (for fluorescent protein readout)</title><p>As a reference, we have successfully used the following antibodies and obtained results with good signal-to-noise ratios:</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Anti-GFP: Abcam ab13970, a chicken polyclonal, at 10 μg/mL</p></list-item><list-item><p>Anti-mCherry: Kerafast EMU106, a rabbit polyclonal, at 1:500 dilution</p></list-item><list-item><p>Anti-tagRFP: Thermo R10367, a rabbit polyclonal, at 10 μg/mL</p></list-item></list><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Pre-incubate sample in 1 mL of 5x SSCT for 30 min at RT.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Incubate sample with primary antibody against fluorescent protein, at desired concentration (a good starting point is 10 μg/mL) in 500 μL of 5x SSCT overnight at 4°C.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Wash sample with 1 mL of 5x SSCT for 3 times, 1 hr each at RT.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Incubate sample with secondary antibody conjugated to an acrydite-bearing DNA oligo (synthesis instruction is shown in the earlier section ‘Synthesis of DNA-conjugated secondary antibody’), at desired concentration (a good starting point is 10 μg/mL) in 500 μL of DNA-conjugated Antibody Staining Buffer overnight at 4°C.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Wash sample with 1 mL of 5x SSCT for 3 times, 1 hr each at RT.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s11-7"><title>Expansion and Re-embedding into Non-Expanding Gel #2</title><p>Same as in the standard ExCel protocol, in sub-section ‘<italic>Part A: Maintain expansion factor of the gelled sample with re-embedding</italic>’ of the section ‘ExFISH-HCR’, except for two points:</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Prior to the re-embedding protocol, flip the gels to the same side as when it was casted in Gel#1 gelation, to ensure that the worms are at the bottom of the gel.</p></list-item><list-item><p>For re-embedding, replace the <underline>Re-embedding monomer solution</underline> with <underline>iExCel G2 monomer solution</underline>.</p></list-item></list><p>After Gel#2 gelation, it is recommended to trim the gels, to avoid samples too large to handle and image at the fully expanded final state.

Ideally, gels are trimmed into a dimension less than ~6 mm on each side, and have at least several worms (&gt;=3) or regions of interest in the trimmed gel. Also, not all trimmed gels need to proceed with the protocol (which might be laborious to handle), and can be saved at this point, in 5x SSC at 4°C for at least 2 months.

sec-type="appendix"><title>Notes on sodium acrylate quality</title><p>During the execution of experiments in this study, we switched the vendor of sodium acrylate, a key ingredient of the monomer solutions, from Millipore Sigma (Product number 408220) to Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Product number sc-236893B), because we noticed that the quality of the more recent lots from Millipore Sigma (roughly from 2019/06, to the time of publication) differed significantly from that of the previous lots (roughly before 2019/06), in several aspects: the powder texture (which differed distinctly in the fluffiness), solubility (e.g. powder no longer dissolves at the stock concentration of 33%, and instead left insoluble, string-like precipitates, which might indicate premature polymerization within the source), and color of solution (high quality, near-complete clearness vs. poor quality, moderately yellow). Since we worried that the inability to fully dissolve the sodium acrylate would affect experimental results, we switched to another vendor, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, whose sodium acrylate lots yielded completely dissolved stock solutions, at the time of our experiments (ordered at around 2019/06). However, we later received reports that some of the more recent lots from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies also had quality issues, similar to the ones associated with the Millipore Sigma lots.</p><p>Thus, we screened through sodium acrylates from various vendors, and compiled our results below:</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Vendor for sodium acrylate</th><th valign="top">Catalog Number</th><th valign="top">Reports of insoluble lots</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Combi-Blocks</td><td valign="top">QC-1489</td><td valign="top">None at the time of publication</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">AK Scientific</td><td valign="top">R624</td><td valign="top">None at the time of publication</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">BLDpharm</td><td valign="top">BD151354</td><td valign="top">None at the time of publication</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td valign="top">sc-236893B</td><td valign="top">one report after ~2019/06</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">50-750-9773​</td><td valign="top">one report after ~2019/11</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Millipore Sigma</td><td valign="top">408220</td><td valign="top">&gt;5 reports after ~2019/06</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>We recommend the following practice for ExCel users:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Order sodium acrylate from multiple vendors listed above.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and David Ron as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work builds on the method of Expansion Microscopy (ExM), a groundbreaking technique developed by the senior author (Boyden) that enables embedding and controlled expansion of biological tissue to enhance microscopic analysis by increasing spatial resolution. Boyden and colleagues had previously found that the tough outer cuticle precludes isotropic expansion of <italic>C. elegans</italic> larvae or adults. Given the widespread use of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> as an experimental model for cell biology and neuroscience, such a technique would likely be widely useful. Here, the authors have developed a version of ExM to address this issue, which they term ExCel (Expansion of <italic>C. elegans</italic>). This required significant effort to overcome the barrier of the outer cuticle that surrounds <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which acts as a barrier to entry of macromolecules. To circumvent this obstacle, a procedure involving disulfide reduction and extended protease digestion, prior to expansion, was developed to digest the cuticle prior to expansion. The method results in successful, near-isotropic expansion by a linear factor of ~3.3, with some distortions observed around particular anatomical structures (portions of the gonad and pharynx). The authors show that this method is compatible with immunolocalization of abundant, fluorescently-tagged proteins, as well as a number of transgenic and endogenous mRNAs.</p><p>This is an important technical advance that will be of interest to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> research community, and may accelerate discovery. It represents a nontrivial adaptation of an existing technique. The work also introduces a novel and likely useful method for counterstaining anatomical structures in expanded worms using amine-reactive dyes. However, the reviewers' enthusiasm was tempered by the current limitations of the methodology, and they felt that the authors should explore some additional parameters before publication. In its current form, the reviewers agreed that the paper would be suitable for publication in a more specialized journal, but the reviewers were divided on its suitability for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major limitation of the current procedure is that the extensive Proteinase K treatment of the intact worms (required to digest the cuticle) also destroys most internal proteins. In the current work, only fluorescent-protein tagged proteins expressed from high-copy arrays, which typically result in marked overexpression of a protease resistant fluorescent protein, were successfully localized. Although there are clearly some cases where this will be useful to other researchers, the technique would be much more widely adapted if untagged proteins and/or proteins expressed at endogenous levels could be detected, particularly since overexpression may perturb the normal localization, and genome editing methods now allow proteins to be tagged at their endogenous loci, reducing potential overexpression artifacts. While we appreciate that other researchers will likely build on and enhance the method once it is published, we are also concerned that in its current form it may prove to be of very limited use.</p><p>An obvious way to increase the sensitivity of the method would be to target the cuticle for degradation more selectively. β-mercaptoethanol has been known for many years to facilitate disruption of the disulfide-crosslinked collagen network, and the authors have exploited this in adapting their protocol. Prior work has also shown that elastase is useful to digest the outer layer, and the pharyngeal lining is sensitive to pronase; while the latter may not be markedly more selective than Proteinase K, elastase may prove useful.

We first constructed a transgenic strain in which the endogenous copy of <italic>che-7</italic> (encoding an innexin, which marks electrical synapses in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) is fused to a fluorescent protein (TagRFP) via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination (and thus at endogenous levels, as opposed to classical overexpression). We then showed that CHE-7::TagRFP could be clearly visualized after applying the original version of ExCel (Figure 7), and the spatial pattern of the post-ExCel anti-TagRFP staining corresponded well to the spatial pattern of the pre-ExCel native TagRFP signal. These results demonstrate that the standard ExCel protocol has enough sensitivity to detect proteins expressed at endogenous levels.</p><p>Second, we developed an alternative ExCel protocol that can read out untagged, completely endogenous proteins in a more general case. This protocol, which we call epitope-preserving ExCel, replaces the epitope-disruptive Proteinase K treatment essential for the original form of ExCel, with a combination of collagenase and heat-denaturation treatments, which, among the 22 treatments that we screened, yielded the optimal immunostaining results observed against a general set of antigens (Figures 11-12 and Table 1). Then, antibodies could be delivered directly into the processed worm for direct visualization of endogenous proteins. We formalized this protocol (Figure 13), and showed that although the omission of the strong 2-day Proteinase K treatment from the original form of ExCel reduced expansion isotropy (Figure 14), conclusions about qualitative spatial relationships could still be made. For example, we demonstrated that this protocol enables multiplexed imaging of endogenous proteins at nanoscale resolution, using examples including the identification of previously unreported protein localization at the interface between developing vulval precursor cells (Figure 15), and mapping of peri-active and active zones of chemical synapses (Figure 16). These results demonstrate that epitope-preserving ExCel, an alternative ExCel protocol, enables multiplexed and nanoscale-resolved imaging of untagged proteins expressed at endogenous levels, through direct antibody staining.</p><p>In order to develop the epitope-preserving ExCel protocol, we explored extensive parameters for an alternative post-gelation treatment, which would replace the strong 2-day Proteinase K treatment in the standard ExCel protocol with a gentler, epitope-preserving formula, and thus achieve greater preservation of general protein epitopes (Figures 11-12). In particular, we explored non-Proteinase-K proteases with various substrate specificity (e.g. elastase, trypsin, pepsin, papain, collagenase), treatments derived from the antigen retrieval literature (which has been described to reverse formaldehyde-mediated crosslinks introduced by fixation, and could thus potentially improve tissue expandability and epitope stainability), and treatments that were derived from earlier tissue-expansion protocols had been shown to permit a wide range of antibody stains to be applied post-treatment (Ku, 2016). We found that the post-gelation treatment that yielded optimal immunostaining results was a combination between a collagenase type VII digestion, followed by a heat-mediated denaturation treatment (Figure 12). We incorporated this combination of treatments into our final protocol for epitope-preserving ExCel (Figure 13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major limitation of the current procedure is that the extensive Proteinase K treatment of the intact worms (required to digest the cuticle) also destroys most internal proteins.

In particular, we have shown that untagged proteins, and proteins expressed at endogenous levels, can be directly visualized via the new, epitope-preserving ExCel protocol (Figures 11-16). In addition, we show that genome editing methods that enable proteins to be tagged at their endogenous loci can also result in proteins that can be visualized by the original form of ExCel (Figure 7).</p><p>The authors’ suggestions were very helpful – indeed, we found that screening a wide variety of proteases, in addition to other chemical treatment conditions, was very useful (Figure 11 and Table 1). In particular, we did target the cuticle for degradation more selectively, by replacing the Proteinase K treatment, which non-specifically digests proteins (and thus disrupts most epitopes, and thus precludes antibody staining of most things), with a combination of collagenase (which targets a peptide sequence that is highly specific to collagen) and heat-mediated denaturation (which does not cleave peptides, and have been shown to preserve antigenicity in other tissue-expansion protocols). With this combined treatment, the cuticle appears to be degraded by a lesser extent than by the strong 2-day Proteinase K treatment in the standard ExCel protocol, as the spatial error increases from ~1-6% to ~8-25% (compare Figure 3 to Figure 14). However, the cuticle is sufficiently permeabilized for antibody access, as we showed that the protocol can clearly visualize ~70% of protein antigens that are stainable through non-IgM class antibodies, a capability that would not be achievable with the non-specific digestion by Proteinase K.</p><p>The novel epitope-preserving ExCel protocol can clearly visualize ~70% of antigens that are detectable by non-IgM-class antibodies (Figure 12), such as acetylated tubulin (expressed in touch receptor neurons), DLG-1 (adherens junction marker), DAO-5 (a nuclear protein), UNC-10 (a pre-synaptic protein that mediates release of synaptic vesicles), and DYN-1 (dynamin, for clathrin-mediated endocytosis). In addition, we demonstrated simultaneous readout of multiple endogenous proteins, including proteins at the junctions between developing vulval precursor cells (Figure 15) and in the peri-active and active zones of chemical pre-synapses (Figure 16).</p></body></sub-article></article>
