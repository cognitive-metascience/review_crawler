maintaining genome integrity in response to various replication stresses as well as during the normal growth. The evolutionally conserved ATR-Claspin-Chk1 pathway is induced during replication checkpoint activation. Cdc7 kinase, required for initiation of DNA replication at replication origins, has been implicated in checkpoint activation but how it is involved in this pathway has not been known. Here, we show that Cdc7 is required for Claspin-Chk1 interaction in human cancer cells by phosphorylating CKBD (Chk1-binding-domain) of Claspin. The residual Chk1 activation in Cdc7-depleted cells is lost upon further depletion of casein kinase1 (CK1γ1), previously reported to phosphorylate CKBD. Thus, Cdc7, in conjunction with CK1γ1, facilitates the interaction between Claspin and Chk1 through phosphorylating CKBD. We also show that, whereas Cdc7 is predominantly responsible for CKBD phosphorylation in cancer cells, CK1γ1 plays a major role in non-cancer cells, providing rationale for targeting Cdc7 for cancer cell-specific cell killing.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>It takes a human cell between six and eight hours to copy all three billion letters of its genome. During this time, any interruption to the process can lead to genetic errors, putting the cell in danger of developing disease. To guard against this, cells use a checkpoint system, testing their own health before, during and after DNA replication to make sure that they are ready for the next step. If a cell detects a problem while copying its DNA, it responds by activating proteins called checkpoint kinases. These stop the cell from continuing until the problem is resolved. One of these checkpoint kinases is a protein called Chk1, which switches on if the cell gets stuck part way through copying its DNA.</p><p>To switch Chk1 on, the cell first needs to activate a protein called Claspin. Activating Claspin involves adding a chemical phosphate group to part of the Claspin protein. A third protein takes on this role, but its identity is controversial. Recent research points to a protein called casein kinase 1, but it was also possible that another protein, Cdc7 kinase, might be involved.</p><p>To find out, Yang et al. used gene editing to lower the levels of Cdc7 in human cancer cells. The cells were able to copy their DNA under normal conditions, but they struggled to activate Chk1 when DNA replication stopped. Biochemical tests revealed that this was because, without Cdc7, Claspin was not receiving the phosphate group it needed. Even so, the cancer cells still had some Chk1 activation, which meant that they must be able to activate some of their Claspin. So, Yang et al. tried getting rid of both Cdc7 and the other candidate protein, casein kinase 1. This stopped Chk1 activation completely, revealing that although the cancer cells mainly used Cdc7 to activate Claspin, they also used casein kinase 1. In tests on non-cancerous cells, the results were the other way around; healthy cells mainly used casein kinase 1 and relied less heavily on Cdc7.</p><p>These differences could prove useful for drug design. One of the challenges in cancer treatment is producing drugs that target cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed. Future research could explore whether blocking Cdc7 could stop Chk1 activation in cancer cells only. This could stop the diseased cells fixing problems with their DNA replication, making it harder for them to survive.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>replication checkpoint</kwd><kwd>Claspin</kwd><kwd>Cdc7 kinase</kwd><kwd>casein kinase</kwd><kwd>Chk1 kinase</kwd><kwd>cancer cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23247031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Masai</surname><given-names>Hisao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26251004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Masai</surname><given-names>Hisao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24114520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Masai</surname><given-names>Hisao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25125724</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Masai</surname><given-names>Hisao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007428</institution-id><institution>Naito Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Continuation Subsidy for Outstanding Projects</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Masai</surname><given-names>Hisao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cdc7 and CK1g1 independently and additively phosphorylate the Chk1-binding domain of claspin to activate replication checkpoint with differential contribution of each kinase in different cell types.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic DNA replication depends on the formation of pre-Replicative Complex on chromatin during the G1 phase of cell cycle, which is mediated by assembly of Orc, Cdc6, Cdt1 and Mcm proteins. Cdc7 kinase plays a crucial role in initiation of DNA replication by phosphorylating Mcm proteins, essential as a part of the replicative helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Masai and Arai, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Masai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Labib, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Inhibition of DNA replication by hydroxyl urea (HU) or UV triggers cellular responses known as replication stress checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Branzei and Foiani, 2009</xref>). Conserved checkpoint kinases (Mec1-Rad3-ATR) are activated in response to replication stress, which ultimately activates Rad53-Cds1-Chk1 effector kinases, that inhibits progression of S phase as well as entry into M phase to reduce the genomic instability potentially caused by replication fork arrest. The stalled replication fork caused by replication stress results in activation of the ATR-ATRIP complex and its association with TopBP1, another activator of ATR. Activated ATR phosphorylates Chk1, the crucial step for activation of the key effector kinase. ATR-mediated phosphorylation of Chk1 requires Clapsin as a mediator/adaptor for the signal transfer. Indeed, ATR phosphorylates Chk1 in the Clapsin-Chk1 complex more efficiently than Chk1 alone in the absence of Claspin in virto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindsey-Boltz et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Cdc7 kinase has been implicated in replication checkpoint responses. In budding yeast, it is known that Rad53 checkpoint effector kinase directly phosphorylates Dbf4 upon fork stalling to block late origin firing most likely through inhibition of the Cdc7 kinase function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zegerman and Diffley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lopez-Mosqueda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duch et al., 2011</xref>), although the mechanism of this regulation is not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weinreich and Stillman, 1999</xref>). In mammalian cells, it was implicated in repair of stalled replication forks through Rad18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Day et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to its role in the effector phase of checkpoint, the role of Cdc7 kinase in checkpoint activation has been suggested. In fission yeast, activation of checkpoint kinase was impaired in <italic>cdc7</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shimmoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matsumoto et al., 2010</xref>). However, a possibility that the reduced number of active replication forks in these mutants is responsible for compromised checkpoint activation could not be ruled out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shimada et al., 2002</xref>). However, the impaired checkpoint activation in <italic>cdc7</italic> bypass mutants (∆<italic>mcm4N</italic> ∆<italic>cdc</italic>7 in budding yeast and <italic>rif1</italic>∆ <italic>hsk1</italic>∆ in fission yeast; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheu and Stillman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ogi et al., 2008</xref>; our unpublished data) provided strong evidence that Cdc7 is required for checkpoint activation in yeasts. In mammalian cells, induced knockout of Cdc7 gene in mouse ES cells as well as siRNA-mediated inhibition of Cdc7 expression in cancer cells resulted in almost complete loss of Chk1 activation in response to HU or UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). Later, requirement of Cdc7 for timely checkpoint activation in cancer cells was confirmed by using a compound that inhibits Cdc7 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rainey et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it is now well established that Cdc7 is required for replication checkpoint activation. Furthermore, replication stress-induced hyperphosphorylation of Claspin/Mrc1 exemplified by mobility-shift on PAGE is largely gone in cells where Cdc7 activity is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shimmoto et al., 2009</xref>). This suggests a possibility that Cdc7 may regulate checkpoint through Claspin/Mrc1. However, the precise mechanism by which Cdc7 activates replication checkpoint has not been known.</p><p>Claspin, originally discovered as a factor that binds to Chk1 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kumagai and Dunphy, 2000</xref>), and its yeast homologue, Mrc1, are essential for activation of downstream effector kinases (Chk1 and Cds1/Rad53, respectively), and are required for replication checkpoint control as a mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chini and Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindsey-Boltz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcasabas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Osborn and Elledge, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tanaka and Russell, 2001</xref>). Claspin/Mrc1 is required also for efficient fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petermann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scorah and McGowan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Szyjka et al., 2005</xref>). Claspin interacts with various replication factors and other factors including ATR, Chk1, Cdc7 kinase, Cdc45, Tim, MCM4, MCM10, PCNA, DNA polymerases α, δ, ε, And-1, and Rad9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gambus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Izawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brondello et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Serçin and Kemp, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gold and Dunphy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Uno and Masai, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hao et al., 2015</xref>), as well as with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhao and Russell, 2004</xref>) suggesting its role at the replication forks and potentially in initiation. Yeast Mrc1 was shown to move along with replication fork, linking the helicase components to the replicative polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Katou et al., 2003</xref>). More recently, Mrc1, in conjunction with Tof1/Csm3, was shown to stimulate DNA replication fork progression in an in vitro reconstitution assay system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yeeles et al., 2017</xref>). We recently reported a novel role of Claspin as a recruiter of Cdc7 kinase for efficient phosphorylation of Mcm proteins required for initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Cdc7-recruiting function and its potential role in origin firing regulation was reported also for fission yeast Mrc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsumoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Masai et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The role of Claspin/Mrc1 as a replication checkpoint mediator is well established from yeasts to human. In metazoan Claspin, phosphopeptide motifs (CKBD [Chk1-binding domain] or CKAD [Chk1-activating domain]) were identified that are required for regulated binding of Chk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kumagai and Dunphy, 2003</xref>). In vitro reconstituted system was also reported in which Chk1 activation could be monitored in the presence of ATR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindsey-Boltz et al., 2009</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, conserved serine-864 and serine-895 are phosphorylated upon replication stress and this phosphorylation is required for checkpoint activation. CKBD is required for checkpoint activation, and a phosphopeptide containing CKBD is sufficient for binding to Chk1. In human cells, Thr-916 residue in CKBD was reported to be phosphorylated in response to HU and the 3A mutant (T916A S945A S983A) is deficient in checkpoint activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chini and Chen, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The nature of kinase(s) responsible for CKBD phosphorylation has been controversial. Chk1 kinase was reported to phosphorylate Thr-916 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chini and Chen, 2006</xref>), although it was later reported that Chk1 is not responsible for the phosphorylation of the CKAD in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, Dunphy’s group reported that casein kinase is a potential kinase responsible for phosphorylating CKBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meng et al., 2011</xref>). They showed that casein kinases can phosphorylate in vitro the critical threonine residue in CKBD, and that casein kinase γ1, among different types of casein kinases, promotes phosphorylation of CKBD in vivo and its depletion reduced phosphorylation of Thr-916 of the CKBD polypeptide (899-953) ectopically expressed in human cells, and diminished checkpoint activation.</p><p>Here, through CRISPR/Cas9 system, we have established a derivative of HCT116 (human colon cancer cell line) in which the promoter of Cdc7 gene is mutated. This cell line (HCT116-323), expressing Cdc7 at a low level, replicates its DNA at a normal rate, but replication checkpoint activation was significantly reduced. The AP (acidic patch) motif near the C-terminus of Claspin interacts with Cdc7 and is required for Cdc7-mediated phosphorylation of Claspin and also for its interaction with various replication proteins. We have generated a DE/A mutant (AP<sub>DE/A</sub>) of Claspin, in which all the acidic residues in aa988-1086 were replaced by alanine, and have shown that this mutant does not interact with Cdc7 and is not phosphorylated by Cdc7 in spite of the presence of all the serine/threonine residues. We speculated this is due to the inability of the AP<sub>DE/A</sub> mutant to recruit Cdc7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). We found that AP<sub>DE/A</sub> is not able to activate Chk1 in response to HU, and cannot bind to Chk1 in spite of the presence of intact CKBD sequence. We surmised this is probably due to the absence of required phosphorylation of CKBD in AP<sub>DE/A</sub> mutant. Through mass spectrometry analyses, a number of phosphorylation sites were identified near CKBD, including S945 in CKBD. Cdc7 depletion resulted in loss of most of these phosphorylations including S945. These results provide strong evidence for the proposal that Cdc7 plays a crucial role in phosphorylation of CKBD.</p><p>We noted that complete suppression of Chk1 activation requires depletion of both Cdc7 and CK1γ1 in all the cell lines tested. The dependency of Chk1 kinase activation on each kinase differs between cancer cells and non-cancer cells; cancer cells expressing a high level of Cdc7 exhibit higher dependency on Cdc7, whereas non-cancer cells with a lower level of Cdc7 depend more on Chk1γ1. We propose that either Cdc7 or CK1γ1 can phosphorylate CKBD for checkpoint activation, while the cellular context affects the pathway choice in different cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cdc7 is required for replication checkpoint activation in human cells</title><p>Previously, we reported that conditional knockout of Cdc7 in mouse ES cells resulted in loss of Chk1 activation (measured by Chk1 S317 phosphorylation) in response to HU or UV irradiation. We also showed siRNA-mediated inhibition of Cdc7 expression resulted in significant reduction of Chk1 activation in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). It was later reported that Cdc7 inhibition using an inhibitor delayed the checkpoint activation in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rainey et al., 2013</xref>). We reexamined this in human cancer cell lines by knocking down Cdc7 expression with siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the human colon cancer cell line, HCT116, Chk1 activation was detected at 15 min after addition of 2 mM HU, and increased up to 50 min. At 48 hr after transfection of Cdc7 siRNA, Cdc7 expression was reduced by over 90%. Under this condition, Chk1 activation was reduced by ~90% at 30 min compared to the parental cells.</p><p>In order to more precisely examine the effect of the Cdc7 level on the replication checkpoint activation, we generated a derivative of HCT116. By using CRISPR-Cas9, we generated a mutant cell line, HCT116-323, in which Cdc7 expression level was reduced due to a deletion in its promoter region. The deletion covers 12 bp near the transcription initiation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The growth of HCT116-323 was slightly slower than the parent (data not shown), but the DNA synthesis or S phase progression was not noticeably affected. There was no significant difference in the level of BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and S phase proceeded in a similar timing for up to 8 hr after release from the double thymidine block. However, at 10 hr after release, the wild-type HCT116 cells proceeded to G1, while HCT116-323 cells have not divided yet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This suggests that HCT116-323 cells have some difficulty going through mitosis, although eventually they enter mitosis. The Cdc7 protein level was reduced by 90% in HCT116-323 compared to the parent HCT116. After HU treatment, Chk1 activation was reduced by about 80% at 30 min in HCT116-323 compared to the parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), confirming that a certain level of Cdc7 activity is required for full activation of Chk1 in HCT116.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cdc7 is required for activation of Chk1 in response to replication stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HCT116 and its derivative, HCT116-323, in which the promoter for the Cdc7 gene was mutated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for details of the mutation), were incubated with BrdU for 20 min and were analyzed by FACS for BrdU incorporation.

The Claspin mutant cells without transgene did not show Chk1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 2, pChk1), as expected from the loss of Claspin, whereas expression of the wild-type Claspin restored it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 4). In contrast, the AP<sub>DE/A</sub> mutant did not restore the Chk1 activation, consistent with its reduced binding to Chk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 6). We examined the function of the Claspin AP<sub>DE/A</sub> mutant for checkpoint activation in U2OS cells (human bone osteosarcoma epithelial cells) as well.

These possibilities were examined by conducting the in vitro phosphorylation assays using CKBD containing polypeptides.</p><p>We first conducted phosphorylation assays using a Claspin-derived polypeptide (aa897-1100) as a substrate. This substrate contains both AP and CKBD. Both Cdc7 and CK1γ1 phosphorylated this polypeptide in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of Cdc7 in the presence of a low amount of CK1γ1 increased the phosphorylation level of the polypeptide. At a low level of Cdc7, the effect of CK1γ1 was additive on the level of the phosphorylation, whereas, at the highest concentration of Cdc7, similar levels of phosphorylation were observed regardless the presence or absence of CK1γ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). CK1γ1 alone also could achieve the similar level of phosphorylation when added in a sufficient amount (data not shown). These results are consistent with the notion that Cdc7 and CK1γ1 can phosphorylate this polypeptide in an independent fashion.</p><p>In order to more directly examine whether Cdc7 phosphorylates CKBD, we have prepared the 50 amino acid polypeptide (906 ~ 955) containing two CKBD (wild-type) and their derivatives containing amino acid substitutions at selected serine/threonine residues, and used them as substrates for in vitro phosphorylation assays with Cdc7 and/or CK1γ1. Cdc7 was able to phosphorylate the 50 aa polypeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lanes 2, 13–15), and this phosphorylation was significantly reduced by alanine substitutions of threonine and serine in CKBD (CKBD-A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, compare lanes 15 and 16), indicating that CKBD is the major target of Cdc7 kinase on this polypeptide. To assess the roles of other serine/threonine residues on the polypeptide, we replaced all other serine/threonine residues with either alanine (Others-A) or glutamic acid (Others-E). Cdc7 was able to phosphorylate Others-A, albeit at a reduced level compared to Wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lanes 15 and 19), whereas Others-E was phosphorylated by Cdc7 at about three times more efficiently than was Wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lanes 15 and 22). This is probably due to the effect of acidic residues that facilitate the substrate recognition by Cdc7. In contrast, CK1γ1 did not very efficiently phosphorylate Wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lanes 6, 10–12). Consistently, addition of CK1γ1 did not stimulate Cdc7-mediated phosphorylation of Wild-type was (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lanes 2–5). CK1γ1 alone did not phosphorylate Others-E very efficiently, either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lanes 23). These results are consistent with the conclusions that Cdc7 phosphorylates preferentially the serine/threonine residues in CKBD in vitro and that CK1γ1 does not serve as a priming kinase for phosphorylation of CKBD by Cdc7. They also suggest that Cdc7 is more active than CK1γ1 as a CKBD-phosphorylating kinase in vitro.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Cdc7 phosphorylates T916 and S945.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two hundred ng (34 pmole) each of wild type CKBD peptide (wild-type) or mutant peptides (CKBD-A, Others-A and Others-E) was incubated in the kinase reaction with indicated amounts of purified Cdc7-ASK and/or CK1γ1 in the presence of [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP for 60 min at 30°C.

Then, how is the kinase selected for phosphorylation of CKBD in cells? We examined other cell lines for dependency of checkpoint activation on Cdc7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We used XL413, a Cdc7-specific inhibitor, to inhibit Cdc7 kinase. In HL60 (human promyelocytic leukemia cell line), KM12-Luc (human colon cancer cell line), SK-BR-3-Luc (human breast cancer cell line) and HCT15 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line), pretreatment with XL413 reduced HU-induced Chk1 S317 phosphorylation by 32, 25, 24% and 61%, respectively. In contrast, in NCI-H1975-Luc (human lung adenocarcinoma cell line) and NUGC-3 (human gastric cancer cell line), the effect of XL413 was weaker (15% and 4% inhibition, respectively). We noted that the levels of Cdc7 were significantly lower in these latter cell lines than in other cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>). Non-cancer cells including NHDF, RPE-1, and TIG-3 exhibited more dependency on CK1γ1 than on Cdc7 for checkpoint activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>We therefore examined the levels of Cdc7 and CK1γ1 proteins in different cell lines. By comparing the western signals of the whole cell extracts from a fixed number of various cells with those of the control protein samples of known quantity, we estimated the numbers of Cdc7 and CK1γ1 molecules per cell. The results indicate that the numbers of Cdc7 molecules in cancer cells are 10–50 fold more than those in non-cancer cells. On the other hand, the numbers of the CK1γ1 molecules in non-cancer and cancer cells are roughly the same (1.4 ~ 2.4×10<sup>5</sup>; except for HeLa cells which have four-fold more than NHDF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). The results suggest a possibility that Cdc7 predominantly serves as a CKBD kinase in the majority of cancer cells, since it is overexpressed, whereas in NHDF, CK1γ1 is more abundant than Cdc7, and thus serves as a major kinase for CKBD phosphorylation.</p><p>In order to test the above possibility, we examined the effects of manipulation of protein expression levels on the checkpoint pathway choice. In HCT116, CK1γ1 depletion does not significantly affect the Chk1 activation, whereas Cdc7 depletion reduced it by over 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, in HCT-323 that expressed Cdc7 at a reduced level, CK1γ1 depletion reduced the Chk1 activation almost completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>, compare lanes 5 and 7). We also examined whether overexpression of Cdc7 modulates the effect of CK1γ1 depletion. Cdc7 was expressed in NHDF by a lentivirus expression vector and the cells were adjusted for 3 days. Then, CK1γ1 or Cdc7 was depleted by siRNA for two days. HU-induced Chk1 S317 phosphorylation was reduced by more than 70% by CK1γ1 depletion in mock-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>, lanes 1 and 3), but the inhibition was mitigated in Cdc7-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>, lanes 5 and 7), whereas stronger inhibition by Cdc7 siRNA (by ~60%) was observed in Cdc7-overexpressing NHDF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). This effect appears to depend on the ‘adaptation’ period. Incubation of Cdc7-overexpressing cells for three weeks before addition of siRNA resulted in even better dependence on Cdc7 for checkpoint activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).

These studies showed that Cdc7 is required for activation of checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheu and Stillman, 2010</xref>; Shimmoto and Masai, unpublished data). Similarly, in mammalian cells, Cdc7 is very likely to be required for efficient and timely Chk1 activation, as shown by using Cdc7 knockout cells, siRNA-mediated Cdc7 knockdown or a low molecular weight Cdc7 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rainey et al., 2013</xref>). However, precise mechanisms of Cdc7-mediated checkpoint activation have remained unclear.</p><p>Claspin and its yeast homologue, Mrc1, play a crucial role in replication checkpoint as a mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kumagai and Dunphy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcasabas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tanaka and Russell, 2001</xref>). Claspin recruits Chk1 through CKBD. CKBD needs to be phosphorylated to interact with Chk1. Chk1 and CK1γ1 have been reported to phosphorylate CKBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chini and Chen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meng et al., 2011</xref>), although the in vivo role of Chk1 in phosphorylation of Claspin has been ruled out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, CK1γ1 is required for efficient checkpoint activation, and evidence reported by Dunphy’s group indicates a potential role of CK1γ1 in phosphorylation of CKBD. In this report, we have presented evidence that Cdc7, a kinase crucial for initiation of DNA replication, plays a role in phosphorylation of CKBD, thus contributing to checkpoint activation. We also show that Cdc7 and CK1γ1 phosphorylate CKBD independently and additively. Intriguingly, we found that two kinases contribute to CKBD phosphorylation differentially in cancer and non-cancer cells in a manner dictated by the levels of both kinases.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cdc7 phosphorylates CKBD of Claspin for checkpoint activation</title><p>The following results presented in this study show that Cdc7 is predominantly responsible for phosphorylation of CKBD of Claspin in response to replication stress in most of the cancer cells.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Cdc7 depletion by siRNA or by hypomorphic mutation results in decreased interaction between Chk1 and Claspin in response to replication stress.</p></list-item><list-item><p>AP<sub>DE/A</sub> mutant of Claspin, which does not interact with Cdc7 and is not phosphorylated by Cdc7, cannot activate checkpoint.</p></list-item><list-item><p>CKBD of Claspin is phosphorylated by Cdc7 in vitro.</p></list-item></list><p>Mass spectrometry analyses revealed the presence of the clusters of phosphorylation sites in and near CKBD, and notably at Thr-916/Ser-945, conserved serines/threonines in the two CKBD. The phosphorylation of Thr-916/Ser-945 is not detected in Cdc7-depleted cells consistently in three independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These two CKBD appear to be important for binding to Chk1, since the peptide containing both CKBD bound to Chk1 but not the peptide containing only one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Using human in vitro cell-free system, mutation of Thr-916 and Ser-945 was shown to inhibit its association with Chk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clarke and Clarke, 2005</xref>). Our analyses indicate that Cdc7 recruited to AP (aa988 ~ 1086) phosphorylates multiple serine/threonine residues in the adjacent segment (aa720 ~968). These sites do not match very well with previously reported phosphorylation sites of Claspin phosphorylated by Cdc7 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rainey et al., 2013</xref>; the phosphorylation sites do not include serine/threonine in CKBD; only S721 and S744 in aa720 ~ 968). Claspin may adopt a conformation that is more favorable for recruitment of Cdc7 kinase in vivo, that may permit more localized phosphorylation in aa720 ~ 968. Cdc7 likes acidic environment, and thus initial phosphorylation may trigger further recruitment of Cdc7, causing autoactivating loop of phosphorylation. Indeed, the CKBD-derived peptide, in which serine-threonine residues other than Thr-916 and Ser-945 were replaced by glutamic acid, was phosphorylated by Cdc7 with much better efficiency in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). On the other hand, some Cdc7-dependent phosphorylation sites outside CKBD were detected only in one or two experiments out of the three independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This may suggest promiscuous or stochastic nature of phosphorylation of Claspin by Cdc7 recruited to AP.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Contribution of CK1γ1 to phosphorylation of CKBD and checkpoint activation</title><p>CK1γ1 were previously reported to phosphorylate CKBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meng et al., 2011</xref>). Casein kinase is similar to Cdc7 in its acidophilic preference for substrate selection. Thus, it is predictable that casein kinase also recognizes CKBD which is embedded in acidic environment. In fact, CK1γ1 can phosphorylate CKBD+AP containing polypeptides with efficiency similar to that of Cdc7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We examined the possibility that CK1γ1 may initially act as a priming kinase, which phosphorylates serine/threonine residues near the Cdc7 target site. This priming phosphorylation would create acidic environment which may facilitate the recognition by Cdc7. However, we were unable to detect priming phosphorylation events on the aa897-1100 polypeptide containing CKBD used in this study. Both kinases appear to independently and additively phosphorylate this polypeptide in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is consistent with the fact that, in cancer cells, Cdc7 depletion inhibits checkpoint activation more vigorously than CK1γ1 depletion does, and that combination of both depletions results in almost complete inhibition of checkpoint activation.</p><p>Although Cdc7 can phosphorylate Thr-916/Ser-945 on the 50aa oligopeptide (906 ~ 955) in vitro, albeit to a lower extent, CK1γ1 was not able to efficiently phosphorylate it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). CK1γ1 may need the adjacent polypeptide segment to efficiently recognize Claspin. Furthermore, Cdc7 only poorly phosphorylates ST27A Claspin, in which all the serines/threonines in aa903 ~1120 containing CKBD were replaced by alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2016</xref>).

This finding also clarifies the role of Cdc7 in replication checkpoint activation. Another important finding of this report is that complete shutdown of Chk1 activation requires loss of both Cdc7 and CK1γ1, and that contribution of each kinase on Chk1 activation may vary from one cell-type to another and may be at least partly determined by the abundance of each protein and cellular context. The crucial role of Cdc7 in checkpoint activation in cancer cells but not in non-cancer cells may provide molecular explanation for cancer cell-specific cell death induced by Cdc7 inhibition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>293T, HeLa, NHDF, HCT116 and U2OS were obtained from ATCC. <italic>Claspin flox /-</italic> Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (<italic>MEFs</italic>) were established from E12.5 embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Claspin flox /- MEFs</italic> stably expressing the wild-type or AP<sub>DE/A</sub> mutant Claspin were established by infecting recombinant retroviruses expressing these cDNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2016</xref>).

investigation, and signal transduction related to these processes differs between cancer and normal cells. Multiple protein kinases have been reported to be involved in the activation of the Chk1 kinase in human cells, as part of the ATR-Claspin mediated signally pathway. In this report, the authors have demonstrated that Cdc7 kinase, which is known to play a key role in the initiation of DNA replication, binds to Claspin-Chk1 and is critical for Chk1 activation. Interestingly, they find that Cdc7 kinase is more important in cancer cells, whereas the previously identified CK1γ1 kinase is important in non-cancer cells. As such the paper clarifies the literature on Chk1 signalling mechanisms.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cdc7 activates replication checkpoint by phosphorylating the Chk1 binding domain of Claspin&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Bruce Stillman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The Masai lab has previously reported that Claspin helps recruit the Cdc7 kinase to chromosomes to promote the phosphorylation of MCM and the initiation of DNA replication. Specifically, in Yang et al., 2016, they conclude that Cdc7 phosphorylates amino acids within the Chk1 binding domain (CKBD) of Claspin to prevent an intramolecular Claspin interaction that inhibits Claspin's ability to interact with DNA and PCNA.</p><p>In this study, they expand upon this published work by providing evidence that the Cdc7-Claspin interaction, again involving phosphorylation of the Chk1 binding domain (CKBD) of Claspin, is also important for activating the ATR-replication stress pathway (via permitting a Claspin-Chk1 interaction). While several reports provide evidence that the Cdc7 kinase functions in activating the ATR-replication stress (ATR-RS) checkpoint, the precise mechanistic explanation has been unclear. Furthermore, there was some confusion on this issue because the CK1γ1 kinase could also activate the ATR-RS checkpoint. This study makes an important contribution by providing evidence that Cdc7 and CK1γ1 independently and additively phosphorylate the Chk1 binding domain (CKBD1) of Claspin to activate the replication stress checkpoint, but that each kinase provides different levels of contributions depending on cell type and levels of the kinase expressed. Cdc7 kinase, due at least in part to its higher expression levels in cancer cell lines, is more critical for ATR-RS checkpoint activation in these cell lines compared to CK1γ1. This latter conclusion has important potential translational implications for considering Cdc7 as a target for cancer therapies.</p><p>The evidence that Cdc7 directly interacts with the AP of Claspin and directly phosphorylates the Claspin CKBD is the weakest link in the study as it is difficult to glean how data were quantified. Even in the Yang et al., 2016, study, where it was reported that the DE/A mutant reduced Claspin-Flag IP of Cdc7 ~5-fold, it was difficult to determine how quantifiably reproducible this effect was. The link between Cdc7 function and Chk1 activation in vivo is compelling, but the data concerning mechanism, in particular directness of Claspin as a Cdc7 target, were more difficult to glean.</p><p>Based on these comments and the points listed below, a revised manuscript is needed that addresses the biochemistry and as pointed out in point 3 below, tests additional cell lines to determine if the difference between cancer cells and normal cells with respect to Cdc7 and CK1γ1 kinases is robust.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Figure 2. An important supporting line of evidence is that the AP<sub>DE/A</sub> mutant (the acidic patch mutant that blocks Cdc7-phosphorylation of the Claspin CKBD) does not alter any other important functions of Claspin. For example, is this mutant still fully capable of CK1γ1-dependent activation of the checkpoint? What is the evidence that this mutation does not disturb other critical functions of Claspin needed to mediate the ATR activation of Chk1?</p><p>2) Is the S27A allele of Claspin defective in Chk1 phosphorylation after treatment of cells with HU, and does S27A block Cdc7 (and CK1) phosphorylation of Claspin? The manuscript (Figure 2) only presents Chk1 association with Claspin.</p><p>3) The authors' argument that Cdc7 is predominantly important for CKBD phosphorylation in cancer cells, whereas CK1γ1 is more important in non-cancer cells, is based on a single non-cancer line (NHDF). So it is essential to compare the relative importance of Cdc7 and CK1 for Chk1 phosphorylation in other such lines (e.g. RPE-1).</p><p>Other comments or clarifications:</p><p>1) Figure 1A. Claspin levels are lower in the siRNA of Cdc7 treatment. Why? This appears to be in contrast to Figures 3A and 3B.</p><p>2) The time course in Figure 1C should be extended since the difference at 10 hours is not striking.</p><p>3) Figure 1A. It is not clear what this siRNA really adds to this figure, when the key result is provided in Figure 1D, where constitutive depletion of Cdc7, via the promoter mutant, is shown to allow for normal S-phase progression of HCT116 cells yet insufficient activation of Chk1 upon replication stress. Wouldn't this Figure 1 be clearer with Figure 1D in place of Figure 1A? Also, how do you interpret why so much less Cdc7 is required for normal S-phase versus for responding to replication stress? Is it that Cdc7 is only one of multiple (e.g. CK1γ1) mechanisms to activate stress, so that stress activation depends potentially on multiple redundant pathways while origin function per se does not?</p><p>4) Related to point 1 above, are Claspin levels lower in the 323 cell line?</p><p>5) Figure 2C. The levels of expression of WT and mutant Claspin appear to be different and this may explain the difference in Chk1 activation.</p><p>6) The authors state &quot;If the dephosphorylated oligopeptide was incubated with Cdc7 prior to pull down, the level of Chk1 pull down slightly increased (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, compare lanes 8 and 9).&quot; This claim is very hard to assess – the figure isn't clear, and the reader would need to see that the result is reproducible and quantified.</p><p>7) Does the DE/A mutant of Claspin also affect interaction of Claspin with CK1, or is this motif specific to Cdc7?</p><p>8) The text requires further work to improve clarity (e.g., a section entitled &quot;Casein kinase also contributes to the phosphorylation of CKBD&quot; is followed by a section called &quot;Cdc7 is responsible for phosphorylation of CKBD&quot;. There are a number of minor textual errors, and abbreviations that are not clear (e.g. 'mAG-Claspin' in Figure 2C and associated text).</p><p>9) Some figure panels have very small text and are hard to read (e.g. bottom of Figure 1B, labels of flow cytometry data in Figure 1C, labels of flow cytometry data in Figure 4—figure supplement 2, sequences in Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>10) Is DNA replication as monitored by flow cytometry/BrdU still normal in the 323 cells (Cdc7 promotor mutant) upon treatment with siRNA to CK1? This is important to know, in order to interpret the effect on Chk1 phosphorylation.</p><p>11) Subsection “Cdc7 is responsible for phosphorylation of CKBD”: &quot;Figure 5 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1B&quot; should be &quot;Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1B&quot;.</p><p>12) The quantification of Claspin phosphorylation sites in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 is very hard to assess. From what can be seen, it appears that the experiment was just done once, and so the significance of the findings remains unclear.</p><p>13) In Figure 6A and Figure 6—figure supplement 1, the authors argue that Cdc7 and CK1 have additive effects on phosphorylation of CKBD peptides, but the effects are not clear.</p><p>For example, a comparison of lanes 7-9 and 13-15 in Figure 6A does not support the authors claims that &quot;Addition of Cdc7 in the presence of a low amount of CK1γ1 increased the phosphorylation level of the polypeptide. At a low level of Cdc7, the effect of CK1γ1 was additive on the level of the phosphorylation, whereas, at the highest concentration of Cdc7, similar levels of phosphorylation were observed regardless the presence or absence of CK1γ1 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).&quot;</p><p>14) The Discussion is essentially a repeat of the Results section with citation of figures and data all over again. It could be shortened and include discussion of previous data and the new observations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50796.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…]</p><p>The evidence that Cdc7 directly interacts with the AP of Claspin and directly phosphorylates the Claspin CKBD is the weakest link in the study as it is difficult to glean how data were quantified.

NC, 2016). AP<sub>DE/A</sub> mutant is reduced in DNA replication and growth in normal cells, due to its inability to recruit Cdc7. However, AP<sub>DE/A</sub> can bind to PCNA and Tim, which bind to Claspin through its N-terminal segments. It can bind to ATR as well. It binds to DNA with efficiency four times higher than that of the wild-type. Thus, it retains some activities of the wild-type Claspin. AP<sub>DE/A</sub> is almost completely inactive in checkpoint activation in both MEF cells and U2OS cells. This is due to the loss of binding of both Cdc7 and CK1g1 in the AP<sub>DE/A</sub> mutant.</p><p>In MEF, DNA synthesis (BrdU incorporation) is reduced by Claspin KO or by AP<sub>DE/A</sub> mutation, probably due to reduced Mcm phosphorylation (NC paper, Fig. 3e). However, Claspin is not needed for Mcm phosphorylation in cancer cells, and thus AP<sub>DE/A</sub> mutant does not show any S phase defect in for examples U2OS cells. In a paper from Steve Elledge’s lab, reduced cell numbers were reported in Claspin-depleted U2OS cells, but no significant effect on BrdU incorporation was seen. On the other hand, McGowan showed that replication fork rate is reduced but origin firing is more frequent in Claspin-depleted HeLa cells. Thus, loss of Claspin does not significantly affect the S phase progression per se. However, AP<sub>DE/A</sub> exhibits defect in checkpoint activation in U2OS cells (Fig. 2C). Therefore, we believe that the effect of AP<sub>DE/A</sub> mutation on checkpoint activation is due to its inability to recruit Cdc7, not through indirect effect of reduced DNA synthesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is the S27A allele of Claspin defective in Chk1 phosphorylation after treatment of cells with HU, and does S27A block Cdc7 (and CK1) phosphorylation of Claspin? The manuscript (Figure 2) only presents Chk1 association with Claspin.</p></disp-quote><p>The ST27A mutation includes the three serine/ threonine residues (T916,S945,S982) in CKBD, and therefore, this mutant is expected to be defective in CHK1 phosphorylation after treatment of cells with HU. In fact, similar mutants were reported to be defective in checkpoint activation (JBC 281,33276[2006]; 3A[T916A,S945A,S982A] mutant). We have reported that the ST27A mutation is partially defective in Cdc7-mediated phosphorylation, suggesting that the mutated serine/ threonines include some but not all the Cdc7-directed phosphorylation residues (Figure 7a of Yang et al. NC, 2016). On the other hand, the same mutant was phosphorylated by CK1g1 as efficiently as the wild-type was (new Figure 6-figure supplement 2), suggesting that CK1g1 can phosphorylate the residues other than ST27.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors' argument that Cdc7 is predominantly important for CKBD phosphorylation in cancer cells, whereas CK1γ1 is more important in non-cancer cells, is based on a single non-cancer line (NHDF). So it is essential to compare the relative importance of Cdc7 and CK1 for Chk1 phosphorylation in other such lines (e.g. RPE-1).</p></disp-quote><p>In accordance with this comment, we have examined two more non-cancer cell lines, RPE-1 and TIG-3, and the new data show that checkpoint activation is dependent much more on CK1g1 than on Cdc7 in both cell lines (new Figure 5-figure supplement 4), supporting our argument above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments or clarifications:</p><p>1) Figure 1A. Claspin levels are lower in the siRNA of Cdc7 treatment. Why? This appears to be in contrast to Figures 3A and 3B.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done siRNA depletion of Cdc7 many times, and generally did not see much effect on the Claspin protein level, more concomitant with the results of Figures 3A and 3B. One of such data are shown in new Figure1-figure supplement 1. The old data (the original Figure 1A) might have been the result of some experimental variations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The time course in Figure 1C should be extended since the difference at 10 hours is not striking.</p></disp-quote><p>We have redone this experiment, took longer time course until 22 hrs after release. Similar to the previous data, we did not see difference in S phase progression between the parent HCT116 and Cdc7-promoter mutant HCT116-323 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1A. It is not clear what this siRNA really adds to this figure, when the key result is provided in Figure 1D, where constitutive depletion of Cdc7, via the promoter mutant, is shown to allow for normal S-phase progression of HCT116 cells yet insufficient activation of Chk1 upon replication stress. Wouldn't this Figure 1 be clearer with Figure 1D in place of Figure 1A? Also, how do you interpret why so much less Cdc7 is required for normal S-phase versus for responding to replication stress? Is it that Cdc7 is only one of multiple (e.g. CK1γ1) mechanisms to activate stress, so that stress activation depends potentially on multiple redundant pathways while origin function per se does not?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and took out the Figure 1A, and put this figure (after replacement with a new data) in Figure1-figure supplement 1. The reason why checkpoint activation is so sensitive to the level of Cdc7 in HCT116 is not clear. Cdc7 kinase needs to be somehow activated and/or relocated upon replication stress to phosphorylate the CKBD of Claspin which is presumably at the stalled replication fork. In cancer cells, the number of Cdc7 was estimated to be more than 1 million per cell. Even after 10-fold reduction, the numbers are still higher than the estimated numbers of replication origins, which may be sufficient for normal S phase progression. For initiation of DNA replication, Cdc7 may need to be recruited to any one of the origins present on the chromosome within the same replication timing domain, and thus the rate of encounter with the target would be high even at a low concentration of Cdc7. On the other hand, certain concentrations of Cdc7 would be needed for rapid recruitment of Cdc7 to the particular stalled replication fork on the chromosome, which is much lower in number.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Related to point 1 above, are Claspin levels lower in the 323 cell line?</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Fig. 3B, Claspin protein level is similar in the parent and 323 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 2C. The levels of expression of WT and mutant Claspin appear to be different and this may explain the difference in Chk1 activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated this experiment. The new data in Figure 2C shows that checkpoint activation is much lower in AP<sub>DE/A</sub> mutant in spite of similar levels of ectopically expressed Claspin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors state &quot;If the dephosphorylated oligopeptide was incubated with Cdc7 prior to pull down, the level of Chk1 pull down slightly increased (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, compare lanes 8 and 9).&quot; This claim is very hard to assess – the figure isn't clear, and the reader would need to see that the result is reproducible and quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the comment and redone the experiment. The new data in Figure 2-figure supplement 1 show clear increase of Chk1 binding to the peptide upon phosphorylation by Cdc7. In the new experiment, we used 10 times more Cdc7 kinase, since the efficiency of phosphorylation is low on the peptide due to the lack of AP. Even under this condition, the binding is still inefficient due to incomplete phosphorylation of the peptide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Does the DE/A mutant of Claspin also affect interaction of Claspin with CK1, or is this motif specific to Cdc7?</p></disp-quote><p>We have examined the interaction of AP<sub>DE/A</sub> mutant with CK1γ1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, Claspin interacts with CK1γ1 as well, and this interaction is significantly reduced in the AP<sub>DE/A</sub> mutant.

The data indicate that DNA replication of S phase cells is not affected by CK1g1 depletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Subsection “Cdc7 is responsible for phosphorylation of CKBD”: &quot;Figure 5 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1B&quot; should be &quot;Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1B&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This was corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The quantification of Claspin phosphorylation sites in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 is very hard to assess. From what can be seen, it appears that the experiment was just done once, and so the significance of the findings remains unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>Experiments were conducted three times for HU, and HU+siCdc7 cells and twice for no treat and siCdc7 cells.

At a low level of Cdc7, the effect of CK1γ1 was additive on the level of the phosphorylation, whereas, at the highest concentration of Cdc7, similar levels of phosphorylation were observed regardless the presence or absence of CK1γ1 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. The experiments of Figure 6 were conducted with a 50 aa polypeptide that is not phosphorylated by CK1g1 to any significant extent. Thus, as pointed out by the reviewer, we cannot argue for the additive effect from this data. Our argument is based on the results in Figure 6-figure supplement 1 in which we have conducted kinase assays with a longer Claspin-derived polypeptide #27 containing both CKBD and AP. This polypeptide can be phosphorylated by both Cdc7 and CK1g1.</p><p>The results indicate that the presence of the two kinases show additive effect on the phosphorylation of the polypeptide #27.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The Discussion is essentially a repeat of the Results section with citation of figures and data all over again. It could be shortened and include discussion of previous data and the new observations.</p></disp-quote><p>In accordance with this comment, we rewrote the Discussion, removing the repeat of the results and adding more discussion in relation to the previous data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
