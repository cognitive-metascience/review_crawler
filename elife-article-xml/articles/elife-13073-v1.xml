neuronal sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.1. Earlier studies using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have produced mixed results regarding the importance of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in human inhibitory versus excitatory neurons. We studied a Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mutation (p.S1328P) identified in a pair of twins with Dravet Syndrome and generated iPSC-derived neurons from these patients. Characterization of the mutant channel revealed a decrease in current amplitude and hypersensitivity to steady-state inactivation. We then differentiated Dravet-Syndrome and control iPSCs into telencephalic excitatory neurons or medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-like inhibitory neurons. Dravet inhibitory neurons showed deficits in sodium currents and action potential firing, which were rescued by a Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 transgene, whereas Dravet excitatory neurons were normal. Our study identifies biophysical impairments underlying a deleterious Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mutation and supports the hypothesis that Dravet Syndrome arises from defective inhibitory neurons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13073.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13073.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Dravet Syndrome</kwd><kwd>NaV1.1</kwd><kwd>SCN1A</kwd><kwd>iPSC</kwd><kwd>interneurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001605</institution-id><institution>Epilepsy Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Yishan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant RT2-01906</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dolmetsch</surname><given-names>Ricardo E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship PBSKP3-123434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Portmann</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006521</institution-id><institution>Stanford University School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Dean's postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Yishan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH049428</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubenstein</surname><given-names>John LR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Private funds from the Hsiao Family</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral research fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Yishan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RB2-1602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubenstein</surname><given-names>John LR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A human cellular model of a prototypical form of intractable childhood epilepsy supports selective impairment of inhibitory neurons as a key pathophysiological mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title id="head_1">Introduction</title><p>Dravet Syndrome, initially described by Dr. Charlotte Dravet in the 1970s, represents one of the most severe forms of intractable childhood epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dravet et al., 2011</xref>). Seizures in Dravet Syndrome appear early in infancy, progress throughout childhood, and are often accompanied by developmental delays in language, motor function, learning and social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dravet, 2011</xref>). Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>SCN1A</italic> gene are the most common genetic basis for Dravet Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Catterall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Escayg and Goldin, 2010</xref>). <italic>SCN1A</italic> encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, which contributes the fast depolarization of neuronal membranes during an action potential. Loss of one copy of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 might be expected to reduce neuronal excitability, but paradoxically the genetic perturbation causes epilepsy. Initial insights into the neurobiological function of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 came from studies of a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome, where the loss of one copy of <italic>Scn1a</italic> impaired the excitability of hippocampal inhibitory interneurons but not excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2006</xref>). The disproportionate contribution of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 to the excitability of inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum and thalamus was confirmed by additional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dutton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalume et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>), but the effect of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mutation in the mouse is dependent on the genetic background with seizures occurring in the C57/B6 background but absent in the 129 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mistry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rubinstein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The effect of the genetic background on the mouse phenotype has highlighted the importance of characterizing the cellular effects of Dravet mutations in a human genetic context. Until recently, experiments on human neurons required the use of tissues obtained following surgeries. However, the development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>) has made it possible to generate neurons from patients with disease-causing mutations. Several research groups have used iPSCs to study the pathophysiology of Dravet Syndrome. Two studies demonstrated impairment of action potential firing in patient iPSC-derived inhibitory neurons without examining the excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higurashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Two other studies reported elevated excitability and increased sodium currents in patient-derived excitatory neurons alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiao et al., 2013</xref>) or both excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). The precise reason for differences between the studies is unclear; however, differences in the generation of specific neuronal cell types likely contribute to the discrepancy. A side-by-side comparison of inhibitory neurons and excitatory neurons derived from Dravet and control iPSCs, including detailed cellular characterization of the neuronal cell types would help to resolve some of the controversy surrounding these studies.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the p.S1328P mutation in Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 identified in a pair of twins with Dravet syndrome. We characterized the effect of this mutation on the biophysical properties of the channel in human neurons and used patient-derived iPSCs to study the consequence of this mutation on the activity of inhibitory and excitatory telencephalic neurons. We found that the disease-associated mutation impairs both functional expression and channel gating of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1. We also found that inhibitory neurons from the Dravet patients have reduced sodium currents and a pronounced defect in action potential firing particularly when stimulated by large injections of current. In contrast, both the sodium currents and the excitability of excitatory neurons from Dravet patients were indistinguishable from those of control subjects. The reduced excitability of Dravet inhibitory neurons could be rescued by ectopic expression of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, while reducing Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 levels by RNAi in wild-type inhibitory neurons could phenocopy the Dravet cells. Together these findings suggest that the p.S1328P mutation reduces the function of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 channel, which selectively impairs the activity of inhibitory neurons in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title id="head_2">Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title id="head_3">The Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-p.S1328P mutation impairs functional expression and alters voltage-dependent gating of the channel</title><p>We obtained fibroblasts from two twins affected with Dravet Syndrome. Sequencing of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 coding sequence from these patients revealed a serine to proline mutation at position 1328 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; Reference mRNA: GenBank AB093548.1; reference protein: GenBank BAC21101.1). The Serine-1328 residue is located in a voltage-sensing transmembrane segment of the protein, and it is conserved in human and mouse Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 α subunits. This mutation has previously been described in other individuals with Dravet Syndrome (SCN1A Infobase: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scn1a.info/">http://www.scn1a.info/</ext-link>; SCN1A variant database: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.molgen.ua.ac.be/scn1amutations/">http://www.molgen.ua.ac.be/scn1amutations/</ext-link>) but the functional effects of the mutation are not known. To determine whether the Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-p.S1328P mutation alters the function of the channel we expressed wild type and mutant Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 channels in human neurons. To distinguish the exogenous from the endogenous channels we introduced a second mutation, p.F383S, that makes the channel resistant to tetrodotoxin (TTX). This allowed us to block the activity of the endogenous channels with TTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cestèle et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2013</xref>) to measure the currents carried by the expressed channels in isolation. Expressing Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 constructs in neurons allowed us to examine the function of the mutant channel in cells that express the correct auxiliary subunits and other molecular partners that regulate channel gating. We made two lentiviruses: mCherry-T2A-Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S that expresses the engineered control protein and mCherry from a bisystronic message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Donnelly et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Szymczak et al., 2004</xref>), and mCherry-T2A-Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S-S1328P, which expresses the mutant channel and mCherry. Both viruses contained a Doxycline (Dox)-regulated promoter that allowed us to control the expression of the constructs. We transduced the lentiviral vectors into human neurons derived from the human ESC line H9 that expresses the transcription factor from the NgN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). NgN2-expression generates highly homogeneous and rapidly maturing human excitatory neurons in easily scalable quantity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13073.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Impacts of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-p.S1328P mutation on channel expression and function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The p.S1382P mutation is located in Domain III Transmembrane Segment 4 (DIII-S4) of the human Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 protein.

We found that Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S and Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S-S1328P were expressed at similar levels in NgN2 neurons following treatment with either 0.1 µg/ml or 2 µg/ml Dox in the culture media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that the mutation does not affect the expression of the channel. We then used whole-cell patch clamp to measure the TTX-resistant sodium currents. We found that Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S-S1328P produces currents that are significantly smaller than those of control channels when the cells are treated with both 0.1 µg/ml and 2 µg/ml Dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 1</xref>). This suggests that the S1328P either affects the number of channels on the cell surface or the activity of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 channel. The trend that the current observed in the presence of 2 µg/ml Dox was larger than that observed in the presence of 0.1 µg/ml Dox in the cells expressing the mutant channels but not the control channels suggests that there is a defect in trafficking the channel to the cell surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 1</xref>). We also examined the biophysical properties of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S-S1328P channels that do make it to the cell surface. The activation voltage (V<sub>1/2</sub>) was hyperpolarized by around 5 mV, while the steady-state inactivation voltage (V<sub>1/2</sub><sup>’</sup>) showed a hyperpolarizing shift of around 15 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 2</xref>). This increased sensitivity for activation is likely to enhance the activity of the channel in neurons slightly, however, the much larger increase in steady-state inactivation offsets this effect and probably results in a net loss of function by reducing the fraction of channels that are available to open under prolonged current injections.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13073.008</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Peak current amplitude of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S and Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S-S1328P expressed in human NgN2 neurons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13073.008">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13073.008</ext-link></p><p><supplementary-material id="SD2-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13073.009</object-id><label>Table 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>The peak I<sub>Na</sub> amplitude for each neuron described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 1</xref>.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13073.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13073.009</ext-link></p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-13073-table1-data1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2" valign="top">Mean <break/>(95% CI)</th><th align="left" colspan="2" valign="top"><p>Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S</p></th><th align="left" colspan="2" valign="top"><p>Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S-S1328P</p></th></tr><tr><th valign="top">2 µg/ml Dox <break/>(10 cells)</th><th valign="top">0.1 µg/ml Dox <break/>(8 cells)</th><th valign="top">2 µg/ml Dox <break/>(9 cells)</th><th valign="top">0.1 µg/ml Dox <break/>(7 cells)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">I<sub>max</sub> (pA/pF)</td><td valign="top">152.4 <break/>(114.4, 190.3)</td><td valign="top">141.7 <break/>(83.04, 200.4)</td><td valign="top">109.6 <break/>(44.94, 174.2)</td><td valign="top">77.03 <break/>(17.77, 136.3)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><p>I<sub>max</sub> is the maximal inward current detected in a neuron and normalized to the whole cell capacitance.

COUP-TFII is known to be expressed in the caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE), the dorsal portion of lateral ganglionic eminence (dLGE), and the dorsal portion of MGE (dMGE).

We did not identify any cells that expressed Parvalbumin, possibly because these cells emerge during postnatal development and require both cell-intrinsic and non-intrinsic factors for specification, migration and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Okaty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sultan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wonders and Anderson, 2006</xref>).

However, an alternative scenario could be that the Calretinin-expressing neurons in our current study arise from a population of CGE-like progenitors, as in the adult mammalian cortex where Calretinin expression is mostly restricted to CGE-lineage interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wonders and Anderson, 2006</xref>). To distinguish between the two possibilities, we performed double immunostaining for NKX2.1 and Calretinin in differentiating cells before plating them to rat astrocyte feeders. We observed co-expression of NKX2.1 and Calretinin in many cells with progenitor-like morphology and also in a population of cells showing neuronal morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, expression of SP8, an aforementioned transcription factor found in CGE-derived progenitors and neurons, was barely detected in our iPSC-derived inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). These results are consistent with findings from the differentiating neural rosettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and support the idea that the Calretinin-expressing inhibitory neurons in our study originate from MGE-like progenitors.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13073.015</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Characterization of telencephalic excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons differentiated from human ESCs/iPSCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An example for the immunostaining of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (in green) and general neuronal marker MAP2 (in red) in differentiated inhibitory neurons (top) and excitatory neurons (bottom).

We used fluorescent indicators to select the mature neurons for electrophysiological characterization. To identify excitatory neurons we used a lentivirus that expresses EGFP under the control of the CaMKII promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shcheglovitov et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To identify inhibitory neurons we used a lentivirus in which GFP is expressed under the control of an enhancer sequence that is found between the mouse <italic>Dlx1</italic> and <italic>Dlx2</italic> genes (Dlxi1/2b-GFP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The mouse Dlxi1/2b enhancer is homologous to its counterpart in the human genome and labels MGE-like progenitor cells differentiated from mouse ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Approximately 65% of the Dlxi1/2b-GFP labeled neurons were co-stained by an anti-GABA antibody, indicating they are inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). To further identify the cells that were being patch clamped we collected the cell soma after every recording and used single-cell RT-PCR to measure the expression of GAD65 and GAD67. About 70% of the Dlxi1/2b-GFP neurons expressed at least one of the two markers, consistent with the results of the anti-GABA staining and independently of whether the neurons were derived from control or Dravet iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Furthermore, by single-cell RT-PCR only a small percentage of these GAD67/65-positive inhibitory neurons (0.9% of the control sample group and 5.4% of the Dravet group) expressed 5HT3aR, a serotonin receptor and specific marker for CGE-derived inhibitory interneurons, while more than 60% (for both the control and Dravet groups) expressed Calbindin, which is commonly found in MGE-derived interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results are consistent with other characteristics of the neural differentiation protocol and indicate that the cellular composition of the inhibitory neuron pool is dominated by MGE-like rather than CGE-like lineages.</p><p>Prior to studying the differences between inhibitory neurons from patients and controls we characterized basic physiological properties of inhibitory neurons from control iPSCs. The Inhibitory neurons fired trains of action potentials upon a 1000-millisecond current injection, and the fraction of cells firing continuous trains increased as the cells matured at least until differentiation day 90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). At this later stage, 73.3% of the inhibitory neurons showed an accommodating pattern of action potential firing; 3.3% had a non-accommodating pattern; a 5% showed a stuttering pattern; and the remaining 18.4% fired at most a few or single action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). We also observed spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents that were blocked by Gabazine indicating that the cells have functional GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). To determine whether the iPSC-derived inhibitory neurons could integrate into a neural circuit and form functional inhibitory synapses, we infected the cells with a lentivirus expressing Channelrodopsin 2 fused to YFP under the control of the human synapsin-1 promoter (pLenti-Syn1-ChR2(H134R)-YFP) and engrafted them into rat hippocampal organotypic slices. After 8 weeks on the slices, multipolar, ChR2-YFP positive neurons could be observed in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>) containing presynaptic-bouton like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). We used whole-cell patch clamp to measure the currents in the transduced cells and found that illumination with 470 nm light could reliably activate ChR2 and elicit repetitive action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Patch clamping of rat neurons surrounding the axons of ChR2-YFP-cells revealed light-driven Gabazine sensitive postsynaptic currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4D and E</xref>) indicating that the engrafted human inhibitory neurons formed synapses with the rat neurons. Taken together these experiments suggest that the protocol for specifying inhibitory neurons from iPSCs generated cells that expressed the ventral telecephalic and terminal identity markers, fired repetitive action potentials and formed functional GABAergic synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title id="head_7">Neurophysiological phenotypes of inhibitory and excitatory neurons from patients with Dravet syndrome</title><p>We next characterized the physiological properties of inhibitory and excitatory neurons from patients with Dravet syndrome and compared them to cells from individuals without the disease.

We compared the expression of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mRNA between inhibitory neurons and excitatory neurons derived from human iPSCs. When normalized to the expression of NaVβ3 mRNA, which encodes a sodium channel auxiliary subunit uniformly present among subtypes of mouse cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sugino et al., 2006</xref>), we observed a 1.6–5.6 fold enrichment of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mRNA in cultures of inhibitory neurons relative to excitatory neurons derived from multiple control iPSC lines, Dravet iPSC lines and the hESC line H9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Using <italic>MAPT</italic> mRNA as an alternative reference for normalization, we obtained a consistent result for the control iPSC line 8858–3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The data suggest that Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 expression is enriched in inhibitory neurons, and the enrichment can be observed within the time frame of human iPSC in vitro differentiation that is much shorter compared to the natural time course of human brain development preceding disease onset. To examine the functional contribution of enriched Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 expression, we developed lentiviral expression constructs carrying Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-tRFP-shRNAs (one scramble shRNA sequence and two Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-targeting shRNA sequences in separate vectors; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and a doxycycline-inducible mCherry-T2A-Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-cDNA (mCherry-T2A tagged wild-type Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), which served to decrease or increase Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 expression in neurons, respectively. We first verified that both shRNAs reduced the expression of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mRNA by around 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>; p&lt;0.005 by Sidak’s multiple comparisons following ANOVA). We then transduced the human neurons grown on rat astrocytes and measured I<sub>Na</sub> currents and membrane excitability in neurons that co-express the lentiviral tracers (tRFP or mCherry) and the cell-type reporters (CaMKII-GFP or Dlxi1/2b-GFP). We found that suppressing Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 expression using the lenti-shRNAs reduced the I<sub>Na</sub> amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> middle) in Dlxi1/2b-GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons derived from the control hESC line H9, but not in the CaMKII-GFP<sup>+</sup> excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> left). Conversely, the Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 lenti-cDNA rescued the I<sub>Na</sub> amplitude in the Dlxi1/2b-GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons derived from Dravet iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> right).

We investigated a Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mutation in a pair of twins with Dravet Syndrome and found that it resulted in a decrease in the current carried by the channel but not in a complete loss of function. We studied the effects of this mutation on excitatory and inhibitory interneurons by taking great care to generate and characterize human ESC/iPSC-derived telencephalic excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons in parallel. We found that the p.S1328P mutation affected I<sub>Na</sub> and action potential firing specifically in patient-derived inhibitory neurons without affecting excitatory neurons. Furthermore, we determined that Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 is expressed at higher levels in human telencephalic inhibitory neurons than in excitatory neurons, and that it makes a disproportionate contribution to the excitability of these cells. This is consistent with previous findings in mouse models of Dravet syndrome that correlated Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 expression and function in inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dutton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ogiwara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tai et al., 2014</xref>) but differs from some of the previous findings in iPSC models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higurashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Specifically, two previous papers have suggested that there is an increase in I<sub>Na</sub> and neuronal excitability in Dravet neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2013</xref>) rather than a selective decrease in I<sub>Na</sub> and excitability in inhibitory neurons as we have observed here. Two other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higurashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) broadly agree with our findings, although the authors only characterized inhibitory neurons, and the developmental origin and trajectory of the inhibitory neurons were not studied.</p><p>It is not clear why there is a discrepancy between the various iPSC studies. One possibility is that the different groups studied different sets of mutations which could differentially affect Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 expression and function. We found that p.S1328P affects the trafficking and gating of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 expressed heterologously in neurons. This correlated with the decreased sodium current and excitability in patient-derived inhibitory neurons.</p><p>A second possibility underlying the discrepancy between studies is that experimental conditions that were used to measure sodium channel activity and neuronal excitability were different between our work and earlier papers. For example, in two earlier studies the sodium currents were quantified as the inward component of the whole cell current, without pharmacologically eliminating voltage-dependent potassium currents and calcium currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiao et al., 2013</xref>) or with calcium currents eliminated only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). This could confound the results as the measurements of current amplitude, kinetics and voltage dependence could be contaminated by membrane conductance to the non-sodium ions.</p><p>A third possibility is that the method we used to generate neurons in this paper produced physiological properties different than those studied in earlier papers. Although in all four prior studies neural differentiation began with the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs), the earlier papers do not provide sufficient information on specific steps of neural differentiation or cell lineage markers for us to determine if the cells are similar to ours. Our neurons resemble inhibitory and excitatory neurons found in the developing human telencephalon, based on the expression of cell-type specific markers in both neural progenitors and neurons. The critical question is whether iPSC-derived neurons in a culture dish fully mimic the neurons in patient brains. While we can’t answer this question definitively, it is encouraging that the neurons in our experiments have similar phenotypes compared to those observed in vivo in multiple mouse model of Dravet Syndrome.</p><p>Why does loss of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 have a greater effect on the excitability of inhibitory neurons relative to excitatory neurons? One possibility might be that excitatory neurons are more effective than inhibitory neurons at upregulating other sodium channels in response to loss of one copy of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1. Our data suggests that this is not the case. We observed that human Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mRNA was present at higher levels in ESC/iPSC-derived inhibitory neurons than excitatory neurons, and that bi-directional manipulation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 expression level using lentiviral constructs correlated with I<sub>Na</sub> currents and membrane excitability in the inhibitory neurons. In addition, studies in rodents suggest that cortical inhibitory interneurons express both Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 in their axon initial segments while cortical excitatory neurons express only Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 channels in this cellular compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lorincz and Nusser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>). As the axon initial segment plays a key role in the initiation of action potentials, this difference could account for the disproportionate effect of loss of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 on inhibitory neuron firing in Dravet Syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title id="head_10">Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title id="head_11">Dravet syndrome iPSC generation and characterization</title><p>All procedures and experiments involving primary fibroblasts and iPSCs from Dravet Syndrome patients were carried out at Stanford University after informed consent and under protocols approved by the IRB and SCRO of Stanford University.

Detection of both proteins was carried out with a HRP conjugated secondary antibody (W401B, used at 1:5000, Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) and the SuperSignal West Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific) on a ChemiDoc MP imaging system (BioRad).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to the family who participated in this study. We thank Jennifer M Perry (clinical research associate) for her assistance in enrolling the family. Philip Manos, Dr. Arnaud Lacoste, and Dr. YounKyoung Lee kindly shared control iPSC line WT-GM08402A-SeV-hiPSC 1, which we used to generate the subclone 8402-2 WT9. WT-GM08402A-SeV-hiPSC 1 was derived from the fibroblast cell line GM08402 from the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research. We thank Maria L Fabian and Dr. Ben A Barres for providing rat cortical astrocytes, Dr. Lief Fenno and Dr. Karl Deisseroth for the pLenti-Syn1-ChR2(H134R)-YFP virus, and Dr. Michael Lochrie and the Stanford University Neuroscience Gene Vector core for generating and titering other lentiviral vectors. The wild-type human Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 cDNA described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> was acquired from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and used in the Dolmetsch lab at Stanford University under an MTA between GSK and Stanford. The authors acknowledge Dr. Massimo Mantegazza, Dr. Andrew Powell, Dr. Mike Bird, Dr. Jane Lewis, and Dr. Jaysen Rajkomar for their help with material transfer. The Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 cDNAs encoding p.F383S and p.F383S-p.S1328P mutations was synthesized de novo at Genewiz and Novartis with help from Dr. Paul Groot-Kormelink. We also thank Dr. Alex Shcheglovitov and Dr. Jason Bant for their advice on electrophysiology techniques, as well as Dr. Masayuki Yazawa, Dr. Ajamete Kaykas, Dr. Shengda Lin, Jesse Mull, Marie Sondey, Erica Seigneur, David M Lipton, Le An, Alex Sosa, Samantha Madala, Kimberly Hsu, and members of the Dr. David Prince’s lab and Dr. John Huguenard’s lab for scientific discussions and assistance with various lab techniques.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Deficit in inhibitory neuron activity and amelioration by Cannabidiol in a human cellular model of Dravet Syndrome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by William A. Catterall as the Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. One of the two reviewers involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Reviewer, Scott Baraban.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Dravet Syndrome is an intractable genetic epilepsy syndrome with substantial premature death and severe co-morbidities, which are caused by mutations in the <italic>SCN1A</italic> gene encoding Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 voltage-gated brain sodium channel. Induced pluripotent stem cell methods are used here to determine the functional impact of a Dravet Syndrome mutation. Previous published work on iPSC-derived neurons has given inconsistent results. The highlights of this work are: 1. well-developed and well-defined iPSC-derived neurons; 2. evidence that a Dravet Syndrome mutation impairs the sodium currents and excitability of inhibitory neurons; 3. evidence that excitatory pyramidal cells are unaffected; and 4. evidence that the nonpsychotropic marijuana component cannabidiol inhibits excitability of excitatory neurons and increases excitability of inhibitory neurons.</p><p>Summary and essential revisions:</p><p>The recommendation of the reviewers and guest editor is for major revisions and resubmission.</p><p>1) The work on cannabidiol is considered to be premature and tangential to the main thrust of this manuscript, and therefore we recommend that it be developed as a separate manuscript for submission elsewhere.</p><p>2) The reviewers and guest editor are also concerned that, as now written, the manuscript seems relevant to only a single Dravet Syndrome mutation out of nearly one thousand. However, the significance of the work could be substantially enhanced by demonstrating that this mutation is a complete, or nearly complete, loss-of-function mutation, because the majority of Dravet Syndrome mutations are thought to be complete loss-of-function. This study could therefore serve as a model for this large set of disease mutations. This question could be addressed by introducing a single-residue mutation to block tetrodotoxin inhibition, expressing the mutant and an appropriate control in your iPSC-derived neurons, blocking endogenous sodium channels with tetrodotoxin, and determining the functionality of the toxin-resistant Dravet Syndrome mutant. Several groups have used this approach successfully in other contexts.</p><p>3) An additional point of interest is to determine whether this mutant is expressed as a protein at all, in order to assess whether dominant negative effects of the mutant on wild-type sodium channels are possible through association with a limiting supply of auxiliary subunits or through other means.</p><p>4) Interpretation of these interesting findings, in the context of an intact network, requires a more complete understanding of the precise interneuron identity. Although this may seem a bit trivial at first glance, it is critical to how the two major findings presented here are interpreted. We have learned much about interneuron diversity and interneuron origins since the initial 2006 Catterall et al. identification of a defect in firing associated with a GABA-expressing bipolar neuron from Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 mutant mice. Rubenstein, Fishell, Marin and many others have carefully classified GABA-expressing neurons into a wide variety of sub-populations with distinct embryonic origins. From this literature, and looking at the data presented here – putative interneurons with a telencephalic identity express GABA or GAD (30-50%), and of these 50% express calretinin with a very small percentage expressing SST and none expressing PV. This would suggest that the iPS protocol used enriches for GABA-expressing CR+ interneurons and would be more in line with a Caudal (not Medial) Ganglionic Eminence origin designation; current-clamp firing properties shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3G and 5E</xref> are also consistent with a CR+ Regular-Spiking Non-Pyramidal cell designation. Interneurons derived from the MGE are primarily parvalbumin+ (~65%) and somatostatin+ (~35%) sub-types and it is rare to have CR+ interneurons derived from an MGE lineage (Anderson et al. Cereb. Cortex 2002; Xu et al. J. Neurosci. 2004; Butt et al. Neuron 2005; Fishell et al. Novartis Found. Symp. 2007; Gelman et al. Jaspers 2012). It would be helpful to know if the interneurons shown here also express 5HT3a receptors (see below), VIP or CoupTFII, as this would further help in distinguishing interneuron sub-populations.</p><p>5) If the telencephalic interneurons shown here are primarily CGE-derived CR+ interneurons, an interneuron cell population that can target other interneurons (Freund and Buzsaki, Hippocampus 1996; Gonchar and Burkhalter, Cereb. Cortex 1999; Chamberland et al. Front. Cell Neurosci. 2010; Urban et al. Acta Biol. Hung. 2002), then the interpretation that DS-derived interneurons have reduced sodium current and reduced firing would functionally result in a loss of inhibitory tone onto inhibitory neurons or an overall disinhibition placed in the context of a compete network environment. This would not be a reasonable explanation for epilepsy in DS, as it would be associated with increased network excitability and likely an increased propensity toward seizures. Nor would this be entirely consistent with mouse data from Catterall and other groups who have demonstrated that Cre-mediated inactivation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in SST+ or PV+ interneuron sub-populations (which primarily target excitatory neurons) can result in epileptic phenotypes.</p><p>6) Firing properties depicted are not entirely consistent with those expected for mature interneurons or principal cells. First, the representative traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> do not match very well with the quantitative input-output plots. The excitatory neuron appears to exhibit spike frequency accommodation, as expected in the plot but not the sample traces. Whereas the control interneuron, which would not be expected to show SFA does appear to accommodate. Second, the spike firing rates shown for interneurons and excitatory neurons appear equivalent. But mature interneurons should have much higher firing frequencies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13073.042</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary and essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>The recommendation of the reviewers and guest editor is for major revisions and resubmission.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The work on cannabidiol is considered to be premature and tangential to the main thrust of this manuscript, and therefore we recommend that it be developed as a separate manuscript for submission elsewhere.</italic></p><p>We thank our reviewers and guest editor for this recommendation to refine the focus of the paper.

In the revised manuscript we expressed a TTX-resistant version (Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S-S1328P) of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in human neurons and compared it to a control lacking the S1328P mutation. We expressed the channel in NgN2-induced, hESC-H9-derived human telencephalic neurons and found that while the mutant channel is expressed at similar levels to the control channel it has defects in trafficking that result in reduced expression of functional channels. In addition, has altered gating properties including a hyperpolarizing shift of the steady-state inactivation curve of 15 mV and a minor hyperpolarizing shift of the activation voltage of the channel of 5 mV. On balance, the impairment in trafficking and the increased inactivation results in a channel that is less active particularly during trains of action potentials when the fraction of inactivated channels is likely to accumulate. This in fact is what we observed in the patient cells. These new findings are presented in text (subsection “The Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-p.S1328P mutation impairs functional expression and alters voltage-dependent gating of the channel”), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 2</xref> in the new manuscript.</p><p>We were also able to perform a study using rat cortical neurons and the same expression constructs. The findings are very similar to those in human NgN2 neurons. This data is somewhat redundant with what is shown in in the manuscript using NGN2 human cortical neurons so we are not including it in the manuscript but are including it as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref> for the reviewers.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13073.039</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13073.039">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13073.039</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13073-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>3) An additional point of interest is to determine whether this mutant is expressed as a protein at all, in order to assess whether dominant negative effects of the mutant on wild-type sodium channels are possible through association with a limiting supply of auxiliary subunits or through other means.</italic></p><p>Thank you for raising this point. As described in our response to comment #2, Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S and Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-F383S-S1328P are expressed at similar levels in the NgN2 neurons by western blot, indicating normal biogenesis (protein synthesis). Therefore it is possible that the p.S1328P mutant may have a dominant-negative effect on wild-type Na<sub>v</sub>1.1. At first glance it doesn’t appear that the p.S1328P channel is dominant negative because we can measure significant sodium currents in the patient neurons but we can’t discount a subtle dominant negative effect of the mutation.</p><p><italic>4) Interpretation of these interesting findings, in the context of an intact network, requires a more complete understanding of the precise interneuron identity. Although this may seem a bit trivial at first glance, it is critical to how the two major findings presented here are interpreted. We have learned much about interneuron diversity and interneuron origins since the initial 2006 Catterall et al. identification of a defect in firing associated with a GABA-expressing bipolar neuron from Nav1.1 mutant mice. Rubenstein, Fishell, Marin and many others have carefully classified GABA-expressing neurons into a wide variety of sub-populations with distinct embryonic origins. From this literature, and looking at the data presented here – putative interneurons with a telencephalic identity express GABA or GAD (30-50%), and of these 50% express calretinin with a very small percentage expressing SST and none expressing PV. This would suggest that the iPS protocol used enriches for GABA-expressing CR+ interneurons and would be more in line with a Caudal (not Medial) Ganglionic Eminence origin designation; current-clamp firing properties shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3G and 5E</xref> are also consistent with a CR+ Regular-Spiking Non-Pyramidal cell designation. Interneurons derived from the MGE are primarily parvalbumin+ (~65%) and somatostatin+ (~35%) sub-types and it is rare to have CR+ interneurons derived from an MGE lineage (Anderson et al. Cereb. Cortex 2002; Xu et al. J. Neurosci. 2004; Butt et al. Neuron 2005; Fishell et al. Novartis Found. Symp. 2007; Gelman et al. Jaspers 2012). It would be helpful to know if the interneurons shown here also express 5HT3a receptors (see below), VIP or CoupTFII, as this would further help in distinguishing interneuron sub-populations.</italic></p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We performed additional studies to characterize the iPSC-derived inhibitory inter-neurons generated using our protocol. We would like to summarize our interpretation of the literature as well as what we found in the additional studies:</p><p>A) Nicholas et al. (Cell Stem Cell, 2013, PMID 23642366) demonstrated that human iPSC/ESC-derived MGE progenitors produce up to ~80% Calretinin positive GABAergic neurons in the time frame of their neural differentiation (up to 30 weeks). The authors also showed that human fetal MGE explants produced prevalent Calretinin-positive GABAergic neurons. Importantly, the authors demonstrated co-expression of Calretinin and the MGE marker NKX2.1. Specifically, Calretinin expression and the NKX2.1-GFP reporter overlapped in hiPSC/ESC derived GABAergic neurons and Calretinin staining was also found in the 15-gestational-week human fetal MGE. Although it is believed that in the adult mammalian brain Calretinin expression is largely restricted to CGE-derived interneurons, it appears that human interneurons go through a stage in which they express calretinin. To examine this possibility we performed co-immunostaining for Calretinin and NKX2.1 in our inhibitory neuron cultures at roughly half way of the differentiation protocol, we found many NKX2.1-positive progenitor-like cells co-express Calretinin, and we also identified cells with neuronal morphology that co-express both. These results are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and in text (subsection “Verifying identity of iPSC-derived inhibitory neurons”, second paragraph).</p><p>B) Coup-TFII and Sp8 are transcription factors that are strongly expressed in CGE derived neuronal progenitors. We found that Coup-TFII and Sp8 were only weakly expressed in the neural stem cells/progenitors that form the inhibitory neurons in our study. By quantitative RT-PCR, the neural rosettes (containing neural stem cells/progenitors) generated from the ventral telencephalon patterning protocol showed a strong expression of the MGE-marker NKX2.1 but only mild induction of CoupTF-II and Sp8. These results are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> panel C and in text (subsection “Verifying identity of iPSC-derived inhibitory neurons”, first paragraph).</p><p>C) Only less than 6% of the inhibitory neurons in our study express the CGE-interneuron-specific marker 5HT3aR. We performed the analysis by single-cell RT-PCR using cytoplasmic RNA harvested with the patch-clamp pipette. 5HT3aR was only found in 0.9% of the inhibitory neurons derived from control ESCs and iPSCs and 5.4% of the inhibitory neurons derived from Dravet iPSCs. In this analysis we also saw low-percentage expression of VIP (&lt;10%), CCK(&lt;20%) and NPY (&lt;20%), and ~30% of the inhibitory neurons express Reelin. Although VIP, CCK,NPY and Reelin are commonly found in CGE derived interneurons, they are also expressed in sub-populations of MGE-derived interneurons. Overall, our data suggest only a small fraction of inhibitory neurons are of CGE origin. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and text (subsection “Verifying identity of iPSC-derived inhibitory neurons”, third paragraph) in the revised manuscript.</p><p>In summary, our data suggest that the majority of the inhibitory neurons in our study represent an MGE identity.</p><p><italic>5) If the telencephalic interneurons shown here are primarily CGE-derived CR+ interneurons, an interneuron cell population that can target other interneurons (Freund and Buzsaki, Hippocampus 1996; Gonchar and Burkhalter, Cereb. Cortex 1999; Chamberland et al. Front. Cell Neurosci. 2010; Urban et al. Acta Biol. Hung. 2002), then the interpretation that DS-derived interneurons have reduced sodium current and reduced firing would functionally result in a loss of inhibitory tone onto inhibitory neurons or an overall disinhibition placed in the context of a compete network environment. This would not be a reasonable explanation for epilepsy in DS, as it would be associated with increased network excitability and likely an increased propensity toward seizures. Nor would this be entirely consistent with mouse data from Catterall and other groups who have demonstrated that Cre-mediated inactivation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in SST+ or PV+ interneuron sub-populations (which primarily target excitatory neurons) can result in epileptic phenotypes.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers and guest editor pointing this out as a caveat. As pointed out above, we believe that the neurons we are generating are largely MGE derived and not CGE derived. In addition it appears that not all CGE derived CR+ interneurons target interneurons. For example, Gonchar and Burkhalter (Cereb. Cortex, 1999) found that “in (visual cortex) layers 5 and 6, 60% of CR+ terminals form synapses with GABA negative somatic profiles”. Urban et al. (Acta Biol. Hung. 2002) found that “(in the hippocampal CA1 subfield, one type of CR positive terminals) formed symmetric synapses on both pyramidal and interneuron dendrites. Distribution of postsynaptic targets showed that 26.8% of the targets were CR positive interneuron dendrites, and 25.2% proved to be proximal pyramidal dendrites. CR negative interneuron dendrites were also contacted (12.4%).” Having said this, the only convincing way to answer whether the human neurons that we are generating in our system target excitatory or inhibitory neurons and affect network excitability is to study them in a network that reflects the relative numbers of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the human cortex. This is still a difficult experiment to do with the current state of the technology.</p><p><italic>6) Firing properties depicted are not entirely consistent with those expected for mature interneurons or principal cells. First, the representative traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> do not match very well with the quantitative input-output plots. The excitatory neuron appears to exhibit spike frequency accommodation, as expected in the plot but not the sample traces. Whereas the control interneuron, which would not be expected to show SFA does appear to accommodate. Second, the spike firing rates shown for interneurons and excitatory neurons appear equivalent. But mature interneurons should have much higher firing frequencies.</italic></p><p>Because human neurons in culture have a prolonged maturation time, we don’t think that the neurons that we have generated are completely mature. We have found that at this stage in development, inhibitory interneurons in culture do not have the fast firing rate of mature inhibitory neurons. Others in the field have demonstrated their prolonged maturation time course that roughly matches the timing of human embryonic brain development (Nicholas et al. Cell Stem Cell, 2013; Maroof et al. Cell Stem Cell, 2013) and our observations agree with these findings. In the revised manuscript, we discuss the limited time frame of in vitro differentiation (subsection “Enrichment of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in inhibitory neurons correlates with its contribution to neuronal excitability” and Discussion, last paragraph) but do not describe the neurons as mature.</p><p>Spike frequency accommodation (SFA) is indeed a common feature of the developing inhibitory interneurons in our study. We examined current clamp traces for all inhibitory interneurons derived from control ESC and iPSC lines, and we found that 73.3% have variable degrees of SFA, while small fractions of the neurons show non-accommodating (3.3%) or stuttering (5%) patterns. The remaining fraction (18.4%) fired immature or single action potentials, consistent with the nature of the neuronal culture being “developing in a culture dish”. In our opinion, the prevalence of the accommodating pattern is mostly reflecting the developmental timing rather than cell type or lineage, although it is worth noting that in the adult mouse brain, accommodating spike patterns are actually found to various degrees in subpopulations of Martinotti cells, bipolar cells, bitufted cells, double bouquet cells, and even basket cells and Chandelier cells (Markram et al. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 2004; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the maximal spike firing rates, we did not see a statistical difference between the inhibitory neurons and excitatory neurons derived from control iPSC/ESC lines, although we are seeing a few inhibitory neurons firing at near or above 30 Hz (See the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref> on the left). Again, such a spike frequency profile could reflect the developmental timing of the neurons. Interestingly, we could observe a difference in the half-width of excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons derived from the same control iPSC line (e.g. line 6593-8, see the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref> on the right).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13073.040</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13073.040">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13073.040</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13073-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig></p></body></sub-article></article>
