during gastrulation of anamniotes, including amphibians such as <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, depends on circumblastoporal convergence forces generated by the marginal zone (MZ), but direct evidence is lacking. We show that explanted MZs generate tensile convergence forces up to 1.5 μN during gastrulation and over 4 μN thereafter. These forces are generated by convergent thickening (CT) until the midgastrula and increasingly by convergent extension (CE) thereafter. Explants from ventralized embryos, which lack tissues expressing CE but close their blastopores, produce up to 2 μN of tensile force, showing that CT alone generates forces sufficient to close the blastopore. Uniaxial tensile stress relaxation assays show stiffening of mesodermal and ectodermal tissues around the onset of neurulation, potentially enhancing long-range transmission of convergence forces. These results illuminate the mechanobiology of early vertebrate morphogenic mechanisms, aid interpretation of phenotypes, and give insight into the evolution of blastopore closure mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>biomechanics</kwd><kwd>force</kwd><kwd>convergent extension</kwd><kwd>gastrulation</kwd><kwd>blastopore closure</kwd><kwd>convergent thickening</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NICHD R37 HD025594 MERIT AWARD</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>Raymond</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Blastopore closure in Xenopus is driven by two morphogenic mechanisms that have strongly context dependent effects on tissue movement and that generate tensile force across tissues: convergent extension, as expected, and, unexpectedly, convergent thickening.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Major morphogenic (shape-generating) movements in the development of multicellular organisms occur by integration of local, force-generating activities and force-transmitting properties of individual cells into ‘morphogenic machines’ that act across the tissue-level length scale.

In amphibians, blastopore closure occurs as the ring of presumptive mesoderm lying at the margin of the blastopore, called the ‘Involuting Marginal Zone’ (IMZ), rolls, or ‘involutes’, over the blastoporal lip and simultaneously converges, or decreases in circumference, thereby ‘squeezing’ the blastopore shut and internalizing the presumptive mesoderm in one motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, top panel; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, left embryo).

A cutaway of the same stage (<bold>E</bold>) shows the progressive, posterior expansion of the array of MIB-expressing cells, which advances with the closing blastopore as more cells involute and are added to the array.

In explants, MIB/CE pulls the unanchored lateral margin of the somitic mesoderm medially while extending and narrowing the somitic and notochordal mesoderm (<bold>I–J</bold>).

The source of this tensile force was thought to be Convergent Extension (CE), an autonomous force-producing process of the IMZ in which its cells express a mediolaterally polarized cell motility, resulting in the intercalation of cells along the mediolateral axis to produce a narrower, longer array, which generates a primary convergence force, and in turn, an extension force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Moore, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Disrupting this mediolaterally polarized cell motility (called ‘mediolateral intercalation behavior’, MIB) by perturbation of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, blocks convergence in embryos and explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Djiane et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tada and Smith, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wallingford et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Habas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goto and Keller, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Habas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ewald et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feroze et al., 2015</xref> measured a convergence force of ~0.5 μN at the blastopore lip of Xenopus embryos, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhou et al. (2015)</xref> measured the extension force after blastorpore closure.</p><p>Although it was originally thought that CE was the sole source of convergence force in Xenopus, recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shook et al., 2018</xref>) shows that a second convergence process, Convergent Thickening (CT), is also involved. CT was originally defined in explants of the ventral IMZ of <italic>Xenopus</italic> as an active, radial thickening, perpendicular to the embryonic surface or planar dimension of the tissue, the IMZ in this case, that results in decreasing its planar dimension (convergence), and it was thought to occur only ventrally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Keller and Danilchik, 1988</xref>). Recently, we found that CT occurs throughout the pre-involution IMZ, not just ventrally, and that the cells expressing CT undergo a transition to express CE at involution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shook et al., 2018</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). CT is in many respects the opposite of what is known by convention as radial intercalation (RI), in which cells intercalate between one another perpendicular to the plane of the tissue, which results in the thinning (and spreading) of a tissue. The mechanism involves chemotactic polarization of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Szabó et al., 2016</xref>), integrin-fibronectin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Marsden and DeSimone, 2001</xref>), and boundary capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Keller, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Szabó et al., 2016</xref>). During radial intercalation (often resulting in epiboly) cells enter the surface plane of the tissue, whereas CT is the reverse in that cells leave the surface of the tissue, minimizing tissue surface area, resulting in thickening and convergence of the tissue. Coupled with convergence by MIB, RI helps generate extension; in the absence of RI, MIB could instead lead to thickening (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Keller et al., 2000</xref>). Another major difference between RI and CT is that, like MIB, RI depends on polarized cell behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ossipova et al., 2015</xref>), whereas our understanding of CT is that the underlying surface tension based mechanism does not require a polarized cell behavior, only motility to maximize high-affinity cell-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shook et al., 2018</xref>). In the geometric context of the IMZ, however, the collective result of the cell motility driving CT does result in a polarized, circumblastoporal tension.</p><p>Here we use various explants of normal embryos, including the entire IMZ, to measure the composite circumblastorporal convergence forces generated by CT and CE, and we use explants of ventralized embryos lacking the dorsal tissues expressing CE to measure forces generated by CT alone. Therefore it is important to understand at the outset the different spatial and temporal dynamics of CT and CE expression during early development. In our working model, CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, white symbols) occurs throughout the IMZ as gastrulation begins and decreases the circumference of the IMZ symmetrically from all sides, which tends to push it toward the blastoporal lip and contributes to blastopore closure by advancing the blastoporal lips across the vegetal endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, green arrows, VE; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, left embryo). The early involuting cells of the presumptive head, heart and lateroventral mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, orange), which expressed CT in the preinvolution IMZ, transition to migrating directionally across the blastocoel roof toward the animal pole after involution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, gray arrows, dorsal cutaway) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Winklbauer and Nagel, 1991</xref>). In contrast, the following, later-involuting presumptive notochordal and somitic mesodermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, magenta and red, respectively), which also expressed CT in the preinvolution IMZ, transition on involution to expressing MIB, and thus CE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, enlargement of 1B, MIB – aligned, black, fusiform cells; CE- green/blue arrows symbol). Expression of MIB is progressive, beginning anteriorly at the midgastrula (stage 10.5) with the formation of an arc of intercalating cells just inside the dorsal blastopore, called the ‘Vegetal Alignment Zone’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, VAZ). The VAZ spans the dorsal aspect of the blastopore and is anchored at both ends to the vegetal endoderm near the bottle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, asterisks indicating anchorage point, VE, BCs,). As preinvolution IMZ cells continue to express CT and aid in blastopore closure throughout gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), MIB progresses posteriorly from its anterior origin in the VAZ. As preinvolution cells undergo involution, they cease expressing CT and begin expressing MIB as they round the blastoporal lip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), thereby adding to the posterior end of the postinvolution array of MIB expressing cells that span the roof of the gastrocoel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). The array of postinvolution, MIB expressing cells increases in length and number of cells acting in parallel to drive CE (green-blue arrows symbol, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The cells that are progressively added at the posterior end of this array as the blastopore closes contribute to a constricting arc or hoop of tension just inside the blastoporal lip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), just as those that formed the VAZ did initially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The posterior progressivity of expression of MIB/CE results in an increasingly anisotropic blastoporal closure from St. 10.5 (midgastrula) onward, with the dorsal/dorsolateral sides closing over the vegetal endoderm faster than the ventral/ventrolateral sides (green arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). These events are based on studies in embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Keller, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Keller, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Keller and Danilchik, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Keller et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lane and Keller, 1997</xref>), correlation with live imaging of MIB in explants of the marginal zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wilson and Keller, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Keller and Winklbauer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shih and Keller, 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shih and Keller, 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Domingo and Keller, 1995</xref>), and characterization of CT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shook et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To assay circumblastoporal tensile forces, we use ‘giant sandwich explants’ consisting of the entire IMZ plus posterior ectodermal and neural tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These explants reproduce the major movements described above in embryos, excepting involution (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). CT occurs early and symmetrically across the entire mediolateral extent of the IMZ, beginning at the onset of gastrulation, and produces a progressive thickening and convergence of the IMZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>, white symbols; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shook et al., 2018</xref>), a convergence that we believe acts as a preloading force that pushes the IMZ toward the blastoporal lip and tends to close the blastopore in embryos as described above. In explants, although IMZ cells do not involute, they nevertheless progressively stop expressing CT and express <italic>postinvolution behaviors</italic>, including MIB-driven cell intercalation (resulting in CE) initiated in the form of the VAZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, black, fusiform shapes), beginning at the midgastrula stage. Here, in the explant, the ends of the VAZ are unanchored, ending within the vegetal edge of the explant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, asterisks) and when MIB-driven cell intercalation shortens the arc, it acts with CT in the more posterior portions of the IMZ to converge the IMZ medially. As MIB progresses, the explant begins to undergo CE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, green/blue arrows). As MIB spreads posteriorly, it incorporates more of the cells in the IMZ in CE movements, progressively narrowing and elongating the axial and paraxial mesoderm from anterior to posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, green/blue arrows; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>), as it would in the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

We show that the IMZ can generate and maintain large, constant, convergence forces and transmit them over long distances for long periods. We also use a uni-axial tensile stress-relaxation test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wiebe and Brodland, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benko and Brodland, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Harris et al., 2013</xref>) to measure stiffness of embryonic tissues, which defines their deformation (or ‘strain’) in response to stress (force per unit area). We also demonstrate a previously unknown transition in which cells generate most or all of the force around the blastopore by CT until midgastrulation, when cells begin to progressively involute and generate force via the expression of MIB. These methods provide a quantitative approach for evaluating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of developing convergence (tissue shortening) forces and tensile stiffness. Quantification of tensile convergence force and tensile stiffness offers new insights into the causes of failure of blastopore closure, body axis extension, and neural tube closure. Failures of these processes produce common, often linked, but poorly understood phenotypes, which result from genetic and molecular lesions, notably of the PCP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ewald et al., 2004</xref>), and are of biomedical importance in neural tube defects.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26944.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Explant construction.</title><p>Giant sandwich explants are made by cutting early gastrula stage embryos mid-ventrally, then vegetally just below the lower edge of the IMZ, such that the bottle cells are included, then animally roughly 30° above the equator (dashed lines, A; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Giant explants express CT alone in early gastrula stages, followed by progressive transition to expression of MIB/CE. The IMZ of unencumbered giant explants converges equally across its mediolateral extent, without anisotropic (dorsally-biased) extension through G+2hr (stage 10.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>, through about 13:34:57). Thus CT is expressed early, from the onset of gastrulation, and everywhere in the IMZ, rather than just ventrally and later, as previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Keller and Danilchik, 1988</xref>). To measure early forces, giant explants were made from late blastulae (the future dorsal side identified by ‘tipping and marking’; see Methods), mounted in the apparatus and measured before gastrulation began and prior to expression of MIB/CE. Tension appeared as early as stage 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, light blue line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and rose to 0.3 μN of force prior to the onset of MIB, which occurs at G+2hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shih and Keller, 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lane and Keller, 1997</xref>), demonstrating that CT alone generates this early force.

This more continuous rise in force is correlated with absent or reduced ventral/ventrolateral regions lying between dorsal MIB/CE expressing tissue and the attachment strips, which suggests that the presence of ventrolateral (presumptive posterior) tissues accounts for the plateau.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-3"><title>The plateau is likely due to strain in the ventrolateral tissues</title><p>Unencumbered giants converge (=negative strain) uniformly along their mediolateral axis (data not shown; see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) at 10 %/hr (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), whereas encumbered giants converge at 70% of this rate in the dorsal sectors that are expressing CE, but there is no convergence in the more ventrolateral sectors not yet expressing CE during the first phase of force increase (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 4</xref>). Comparison of the rate of shear of the explant with respect to the attachment strips (the rate of convergence of the edges of the widest part of the IMZ minus the convergence of the sled toward the anchor (Appendix 3)), showed that shear accounted for substantially more of explant convergence than did sled movement (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). During the plateau, overall IMZ convergence dropped by 1.6 %/hr for probe three while shear dropped by 1.2 %/hr, such that it matched the remaining convergence of 2.5 %/hr (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; Appendix 3). By region, the overall decline in convergence was explained by a 0.6 %/hr increase in strain in ventrolateral tissues and a 0.2 %/hr decline in convergence in dorsal tissues. Thus, the plateau is due primarily to the increased strain of the ventrolateral tissues; this could be explained either by a decline in stiffness, or by a decline or stall of force generation in this region. Also, the end of the plateau in giant explant assays is associated with significantly increased convergence of the ventrolateral regions by 2.2 %/hr and significantly decreased convergence by 1.5 %/hr in dorsal regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting an increase in stiffness or force generation in these ventrolateral regions contributes to the end of the plateau.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Tension developed by explants represents a progressively increasing, instantaneous stall force</title><p>Forces generated by the cells within the tissue increase tension and drive convergence. Because the probe resists this convergence, tension across the explant increases over time. Tension increase is limited by the stall force of the motors involved (CT, CE) and by the yield strength of the tissues involved. We use ‘stall’ here in the sense that cellular convergence can no longer proceed, e.g. because the tension across individual cells engaged in MIB is high enough that they can no longer pull themselves between each other; it is less clear what factor limits convergence by CT. Once the yield stress (force/area) for a tissue is reached, forces generated by CT and CE result in plastic deformation of that tissue, and convergence in one region is balanced by strain in another. Understanding the behavior of the explant requires an understanding of the biomechanically complex structure of the explant, and its dynamic changes over time. Also, it may be assumed that yield strength and stall force as they apply to the explant are not ‘all or nothing’ effects; there are likely to be multiple structures with different rates of viscous flow leading to different rates of plastic deformation across a range of tensions. And because each cell is a motor, and is differently arranged within the tissue, they will reach their stall force at different over-all tensions across the explant.</p><p>We propose that initially (first 20–30 min) convergence proceeds rapidly until the stall force of the machine(s) is reached. At this point, force increase slows, advancing only as additional cells are recruited, either by the progression of MIB into more posterior tissues, or as shear allows convergence to proceed such that more MIB expressing cells are acting in parallel (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>), increasing the ‘instantaneous’ stall force for the current extent of morphogenesis. It less clear what effect convergence should be expected to have on an increase of the overall stall force of CT, but our results from ventralized explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) suggest that they too increase stall force with convergence. This slower rate of force advance continues until the plateau, at which point the level of tension across the explant reaches the yield stress for the LV region, which results in its observed slight increase in strain rate, while CE continues to drive convergence in more dorsal tissues.</p><p>Our model above, that encumbered explants are increasing tensile force as they recruit more cells into MIB, predicts that applying additional exogenous tension to an explant should prevent further force generation by the explant until shear has allowed enough convergence such that the instantaneous stall force rises above the current level of tension. To test this, we applied additional tension to explants at various stages through the end of the plateau, by increasing the strain on them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A–E</xref>). Explants (n = 9) generally showed an immediate 0.5 to 0.6 μN increase in tension, which decayed quickly over the next 15 to 30 min, then remained static until the explant’s projected rise in force prior to being strained reached its new, current level of tension (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>). In no case did tensioned explants produce higher final amounts, or rates of increase, of force. These results demonstrate that increased tension stalls the force increase, as predicted, and that while the explant can sustain greater tension, increased tension alone does not trigger increased force production.</p><p>If the force developed by the explant at a given time does represent an instantaneous stall force, we expect that decreasing tension by decreasing strain should allow more rapid convergence until the system maximum is reached again. Reducing strain by moving the anchor toward the probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4F–I</xref>) enough to decrease tension on the explant by 1.2 to 1.4 μN resulted in an immediate observed relaxation across the explant of from 0.6 to 1.2 μN, with the remainder corresponding to the rapid recoil of elastic strain during anchor movement (&lt;1 s). After the initial, rapid elastic recoil, explants converged at a rate similar to unencumbered explants (about 10 %/hr, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), until recovering their prior tension levels (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4F,G</xref>). Recovery was consistently (n = 6) rapid (&lt;15 min) during the first phase of force increase, whereas it was consistently (n = 4) slower (30 min or more) during the major plateau or during dorsal bottle cell re-expansion. After recovery during the first phase of force increase, explants converged at rates more typical of encumbered explants (about 4 %/hr, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This rapid recovery supports our model that explants generate increasing tension until reaching an instantaneous stall force, with consequently retarded convergence during all but their initial period of force increase. The slower recovery of the explants to normal levels of tension during the plateau is consistent with lower levels of stored elastic energy, across the explant as a whole at this time (Discussion).</p><p>We tested the idea that less force was being generated during the plateau phase, based on the premise that reduced force generation results in lower stored elastic energy, which is presumably continuously dissipated by long term viscous tissue flow, loss to heat, etc. While not quantitative, the immediate, rapid elastic recoil (tension released by anchor movement – observed tension drop; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4F–I</xref>), which occurs at a rate much higher than observed for normal explant convergence, suggesting it is not dependent on metabolic energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen, 1981</xref>), should provide a qualitative assessment of the relative amount of elastic energy stored. Both the fraction of tension released by anchor movement that was recovered during rapid recoil and the rate of that recoil were greater during the first phase of force increase compared to the plateau phase. We compared the fraction of tension relaxation that was recovered within the first 5 s (fractional recoil = immediate elastic recoil/tension released by anchor movement; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4F–I</xref>), and the rate of recoil in the first 5 s (recoil rate = immediate recoil distance (as a percent of total mediolateral explant width)/time). We found that the fractional recoil was 41% (S.E. =±5%, n = 6) during the first phase of force production, compared to 28% (S.E. = ±5%, n = 3) during the plateau. The recoil rate was 670 %/hr (S.E. = ±90 %/hr; n = 7) during the first phase of force increase (similar to the recoil rate of 600 %/hr seen in explants freshly cut from intact early gastrulae), compared to 390 %/hr (S.E. = ±32 %/hr; n = 3) during the plateau. These results show that during a tractor pull, explants, like the intact embryo, store considerable elastic strain-energy, more of which is recoverable during the first phase of force increase than during the subsequent plateau. This is consistent with the idea that ventrolateral tissues have reduced force accumulation during the plateau (Discussion). Alternatively, the rate of dissipation may increase during the plateau, e.g. because the tissue has reached its yield stress and is deforming plastically.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Structural stiffness increases in all tissues around the end of gastrulation</title><p>In order to develop better models for how embryonic tissues deform in response to the forces they generate, it is useful to measure embryonic tissue stiffness. As a general concept, stiffness is measured by asking how much a material stretches along the axis of tension (strains) when a known amount of tensile stress (force per unit area) is applied to it. Structural stiffness and the elastic modulus are different specific mechanical properties that describe a material’s stiffness and that can be measured experimentally with similar methods. The <bold>elastic modulus</bold> is a fundamental property of a particular type material, for example steel, independent of its specific geometry, and is measured by asking how much a uniform material of known cross-sectional area (orthogonal to the axis of tension) strains when a known amount of tensile stress is applied to it. By contrast, <bold>structural stiffness</bold> of a composite structure depends on the mechanical properties and arrangement of the individual elements that make up the structure, such as a bridge made of steel beams, or in our case, of the individual tissues and cell types and ECM that make up the explant. Elastic modulus of the individual elements may be inferred from a measurement of structural stiffness if the elements and architecture of the structure can be accurately modeled and the strains in each element measured, an approach that has been applied to embryonic tissues (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>), but is beyond the scope of the current work.</p><p>We could not measure a true elastic modulus of embryonic tissues because the tests are not isometric nor are the explants uniform or homogenous (see Appendix 5).

In our case, structural stiffness reflects the mechanical properties and organization of the individual tissues and cell types that make up the explant, as well as its overall geometry.

A standard 300 μm displacement from the probe produced an average 12% (range = 8% to 14%) strain of the mesodermal region between the sleds by 180 s, in giant explants initially at rest. The modulus estimated from structural stiffness’s along the mediolateral axis of giant explants rose significantly from 14 Pa (Pascals) at late gastrulation (G+4.8hr) to 21 Pa by mid neurulation (G+8.7hr) (p&lt;0.01, paired t-test, n = 6 vs. 6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). After release from tension, explants recoil rapidly and typically returned to near their initial width within three minutes, with about 25% of the initially applied strain lost to permanent, or plastic, deformation, leaving them about 3% longer, indicating that while they can store elastic strain energy, some dissipation occurs, for example by the rearrangement of cells or structural elements within them.</p><p>D180° and V180° sandwich explants also showed a trend of increasing stiffness from gastrula to neurula stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) with both showing an increase between stages 12 and 14 (G+4.3 and 7.6hr) but showed no significant differences from each other at any stage.

By late neurulation AC explants also showed plastic deformations of 25% of total strain. AC explants were substantially more plastic during gastrulation however, with about 65% of the total strain remaining as plastic deformation, suggesting a lesser ability to store elastic strain energy than during neurulation.</p><p>Although a bulk measure for the explant as a whole, our measures of structural stiffness provide baseline estimates for mechanical behaviors of embryonic tissues. Somewhat surprisingly, all explants types measured, although comprised of different sets of tissues, exhibit similar structural stiffness, and their stiffness increases by about the same amount from gastrulation to neurulation.</p><p>To understand how differential strain of tissues, as found above in our investigation of the plateau, relates to blastopore closure, we measured spring stiffness for each explant type over time. Tissue spring stiffness (force/strain) reflects the deformation or strain that a tissue of a specific cross sectional area will undergo in response to a force, and so can be used to predict the strain in different tissues across the explant when subjected to the same tension. Standard giants, D180°, V180° and AC explants all showed a trend of increasing spring stiffness between gastrula and neurula stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Standard giants did not differ significantly between gastrula stages but increased significantly from stage to stage thereafter (p&lt;0.01, n’s = 6 vs. 6; 6 vs. 3), doubling between G+4.8 and G+8.7. AC sandwich explants also increased significantly (p&lt;0.05, n = 3 vs. 3) between gastrula and neurula stages. Standard giants had significantly higher spring stiffness than AC sandwich explants by 5 to 6 fold at all stages (p&lt;0.05 during gastrulation, p&lt;0.01 during neurulation; n’s = 3 vs. 3 to 6), indicating that ectodermal tissues contribute little to the ability of the IMZ to resist tension along the mediolateral axis during tractor pulls. D180° explants showed greater increases compared to V180° explants and standard giants, but were not significantly different at any stage. V180° explants were similar to standard giants until after mid-neurulation when their spring stiffness was moderately (37%) but significantly lower (p&lt;0.01, n = 2 vs. 3). The greater spring stiffness of giants vs. ventral 180° explants by the end of neurulation is consistent with increased overall spring stiffness of giants as dorsal tissue differentiation progresses laterally. In the context of our sandwich explants by the time of the plateau, ventrolateral tissues undergo more strain than dorsal tissues, because dorsal tissues have a larger and increasing sectional area.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>The circumblastoporal tissues (IMZ and NIMZ) produce and maintain long-term, long range, consistent patterns of convergence force throughout early development</title><p>Giant sandwich explants (IMZ and NIMZ) generate and maintain a consistent pattern of convergence force throughout gastrulation, neurulation, and into the tailbud stage.

CT was described in the ventral sector of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> gastrula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Keller and Danilchik, 1988</xref>) but its force contribution to gastrulation and the fact that it occurred everywhere in the IMZ was unknown. Here, several results show that CT generates circumblastoporal tension early and throughout the IMZ. First, standard giant explants produce force early (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), before MIB and CE have begun (G+2hr, stage10.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shih and Keller, 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lane and Keller, 1997</xref>). Second, ventral 180° and ventralized giant explants that do not express CE also generate circumblastoporal force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which is likely due to their expression of CT. Third, unencumbered ventralized giants show uniform CT throughout the MZ (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Thus CT generates all the IMZ convergence prior to the onset of CE at the early midgastrula stage (stage 10.5, G+2hr). Although force from ventral and ventralized explants levels off during the plateau period of standard giants, it persists and contributes to blastopore closure throughout gastrulation by decreasing the circumference of the IMZ and directing it to the point of involution. CT may continue into neurulation and function in the late involution of the ventrally located, posterior paraxial mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Keller and Tibbetts, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wilson et al., 1989</xref>).

These results establish CT as a morphogenic machine independent of CE, and raise the question of how widely it occurs and how it is integrated with other movements, in amphibians as well as other species, (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The force profile reflects the transition from CT to CE and illuminates the mechanics of gastrulation</title><p>Analysis of the force profiles of the various explants, in the context of the degree to which they express CT and CE, illuminates much about the mechanics of gastrulation and blastopore closure. We represent the capacity of CT and CE to generate and transmit tensile force in the explants at different stages of expression of CT and CE (A-D) as a linear array of motors and springs (light ones representing CT, darker ones CE/MIB, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B’–D’</xref>)). First, the fact that these tissues can generate, transmit, and maintain tensile force across the millimeters of tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) indicates that there is a global, large-scale mechanical integration of forces, meaning that morphogenic movements anywhere throughout the 1.2 mm diameter embryo could affect one another mechanically. The tension generated by the motor and the stiffness of the spring determines the convergence or strain experienced by each element of the array as well as neighboring elements and, integrated across the explant, of the explant as a whole. Second, based on the mediolaterally uniform convergence during CT, prior to the onset of CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shook et al., 2018</xref>), we assume that mechanical properties and behavior within the IMZ are uniform before CE begins, and the evidence shows that CT is expressed uniformly across the mediolateral extent of the explant, prior to the onset of CE and thus accounts for all the measured force up to G+2hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B’</xref>, gray arrow to E, blue force trace of early giants). The same is true of ventralized embryos, expressing CT throughout the IMZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B’</xref>, gray arrow to E, black force trace of ventralized embryos). The timing of CT in explants argues that this force occurs in the pre-involution IMZ of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, gray arrow to 6F, embryonic preinvolution IMZ), and its uniform dorsoventral expression accounts for the relatively uniform convergence of the blastopore during early gastrulation of normal embryos and throughout gastrulation in ventralized embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,N</xref>, green arrows).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26944.030</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of how the convergence forces measured in the tractor pull are related to modules of cell behavior in explants and embryos.</title><p>Early convergence forces are generated largely by the CT machine (CT symbols, (<bold>B–D</bold>). The CT symbol implies ML tensile force, represented by the inward pointing arrows, and radial compressive force, represented by the dot and indicating force directed in and out along the radial axis of the embryo (see 3D representation of CT). As CE begins, MIB (fusiform, black cells) progressively replaces the CT machine from presumptive anterior to posterior (CE symbol: green convergence, blue extension arrows, (<bold>C, D</bold>) while CT continues in more posterior tissues (CT symbol, <bold>C, D</bold>). At or shortly after the onset of mesodermal MIB, MIB and CE begin in the posterior neural tissue (blue tissue, CE symbols, (<bold>C, D</bold>). Thus the IMZ tissues express a changing combination of CT and CE as development progresses. We represent CT and CE as modules, expressing distinctive spring constants (grey or black coils) and motor strengths (red and grey or black symbols), with the lighter spring and motor indicating CT and the darker CE (<bold>B’–D’</bold>). Force plots in (<bold>E</bold>) are means from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: blue = Early Giants; pink = Dorsal 180 s; green = Standard Giants, Probe #4; purple = Late Giants; black = ventralized giants). Initially, up to about G+2hr, the entire IMZ is comprised of CT-modules (<bold>B’</bold>), which represents the situation and generates the forces seen in the first two hours of early pulls (follow grey arrow from B’ to E, blue line). These forces likely approximate force generated in the preinvolution (uninvoluted) IMZ of the whole embryo (follow the gray arrow to F, CT symbols). As MIB begins, a CE module lies centrally, flanked by CT-modules in series (<bold>C’</bold>) with lateral edges attached to the strips (<bold>C</bold>), which represents the situation and generates the forces measured from G+2 to 10.5hr, including the period during the plateau in standard pulls (follow black/gray dashed arrows to E, green line), but with an increasing contribution from CE vs. CT modules after G+2hr. As more cells express MIB, the number pulling in parallel increases, increasing the spring constant and motor strength of the CE module. Because the VAZ forms as an arc it does not initially pull directly on the attachment strips (C; green arrows at edge) but on the intervening CT modules. The nascent CE module is initially small and weaker than the adjacent CT modules, but becomes larger over time, resulting in both increasing spring constant and motor strength. This eventually overpowers the shrinking CT modules, such that their convergence is reduced (C’, more open coils), which dissipates some of the tension generated by the CE module, and thereby contributing to the plateau. In contrast, in the embryo, the CE (MIB) module is, from the beginning, always anchored to the endoderm at both ends, with only an indirect connection to CT modules in the lateral and ventral portion of the MZ (not shown in F; see H, G, asterisks). Thus CT acts as a continuous but diminishing ring of converging tissue outside the blastopore, while CE-expressing tissue inside the blastopore, primarily in series with the relatively inert endodermal tissue, acts in parallel with this ring. The transient decline rather than plateau in the rate of force increase during late pulls (E, purple line) can be explained by a larger domain comprised of CE modules and smaller domains comprised of CT modules, compared to standard control pulls at the onset of the plateau, such that not all force generated by the CE domain was absorbed by reduced convergence in the CT domain. Once MIB progresses laterally to points of attachment with the strips (<bold>D, D’</bold>), the decline ends; this represents the situation during the second phase of force increase (follow black arrow to E, magenta line and to H, (<bold>G</bold>). At this point, all the force generated by CE and MIB in posterior tissues are transmitted to the attachment strips, while, with the progression of MIB posteriorly, force from more anterior tissues is transmitted progressively more indirectly, at an angle (green arrows; <bold>D</bold>). Dorsal pulls show no plateau, because they contain little or no tissue comprised of CT modules (<bold>D’</bold>) by the onset of the plateau (follow solid black arrow to E, pink line). Ventralized giant pulls show maximal force generation at the level of the plateau, being comprised of only CT modules (B’; follow the gray line to E, black line).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-26944-fig6-v2"/></fig><p>At stage 10.5, cells begin to undergo a progressive, patterned transition from CT to MIB (CE) as they involute, beginning in the presumptive anterior somitic mesoderm with formation of the Vegetal Alignment Zone (VAZ), and progressing medially and posteriorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shih and Keller, 1992b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). At this point the explant becomes morphogenically heterogeneous, with a presumptive anterior region of MIB driving CE located centrally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, black fusiform cells, green, blue arrows), and a presumptive posterior region of CT uniformly expressed across the remaining posterior of the IMZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, white symbols). In this phase, the central CE/MIB region is initially linked to the sled and anchor strips only via the lateral, CT expressing regions of the explant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,C’</xref>), and force generation by the central region of MIB results in the observed, continued convergence of this region while the lateral region expressing CT, with its lower spring stiffness, undergoes strain. The weaker spring-motor combination of the CT expressing regions thus limits the transmission of force to the measuring apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C’</xref>, gray +black arrow to E, plateau in green force trace), eventually leading to the observed plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), when the lower yield strength of the CT region (as reflected in its lower spring stiffness) is reached. As the transition of MIB/CE spreads further posteriorly, it reaches the sled and anchor strips at the end of the plateau (G+10.5hr), the weaker CT regions are replaced by stronger MIB/CE regions (as reflected by their higher spring stiffness), the weaker link is removed, and the force rises again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D,C’–D’</xref>, black arrow to E, green line in E). This interpretation is supported by our observations that ventral giant explants, which only express CT, reach but never advance beyond the same plateau level of force as standard giant explants containing the lateral regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, black and green force traces, respectively), that dorsal explants, which have MIB directly connected to the sleds, show no plateau and that late giants, which already express MIB across a greater mediolateral span of the marginal zone when initially placed under tension, show only moderately decreased force increase during the plateau period of standard explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, pink and purple force traces, respectively).</p><p>In the embryo, however, the stronger MIB/CE region never acts in direct series with an intervening, weaker CT region; instead MIB originates at the lateral boundary of the somitic mesoderm at its junction with the vegetal endoderm, and is anchored there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>, asterisks), thereby forming a continuous, uniform convergence mechanism based on CE (D’), which acts as a coherent system in the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D’</xref>, black arrow to G, H), a situation achieved in the post-plateau explant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, black line to 6E, post-plateau standard giant, green, dorsal 180 explants (pink), and late explants (magenta) force traces).</p><p>The influence of the post-involution expansion of MIB expression posteriorly from its onset in the VAZ is reflected in the progressively more anisotropic blastopore closure from stage 10.5 onward, and in the dorsal region of the IMZ dominating closure, something that cannot be accounted for by the isotropic convergence of pre-involution CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,D</xref>, green arrows).</p><p>Unlike CT, the total force generated by CE (MIB) is under-estimated by our measurements, because CE results in extension of many of the cells expressing MIB away from the zone directly between the sleds, and these cells therefore pull on the sled/anchor system at an increasing angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). However, the same is true in the embryo, as progressively more of the population of MIB expressing cells lie far anterior of the posterior progress zone of MIB at blastoporal lip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Keller, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Keller et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Keller and Tibbetts, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wilson and Keller, 1991</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>), and thus the force measured with the giant explant may reasonably approximate that generated at the blastoporal lip through the end of gastrulation.</p><p>The convergence of the somitic mesoderm during late neurulation involves MIB but also columnarization (thickening) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Keller et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wilson et al., 1989</xref>), which forms converging ‘somitic buttresses’ that may contribute to folding neural plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schroeder, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Keller, 1976</xref>). Our force measurements of convergence forces exerted by the intact embryo during this time are unquestionably a substantial underestimate (see also Estimates of Force/cell, below), both for the reasons listed above, and because embryos have assembled their mesoderm and neural tissues into laminar aligned structures that have undergone the full extent of normal convergence movements, in contrast to the retarded convergence of our explants.</p><p>Finally, when we explant tissue it expends its stored elastic energy as it converges rapidly, and consequently its subsequent convergence is slower than intact embryos and the additional force is measured. Observed force is further reduced by friction, perhaps by 0.2 μN, despite the slick agarose pad beneath the explant and by the glass beads beneath the sled. Therefore force measured here should moderately underestimate that generated at the instantaneous stall force or yield strength of the embryo, for a given extent of morphogenic progress.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Explant stiffness</title><p><italic>Xenopus</italic> embryonic tissues stiffen about two fold along their mediolateral axis around the end of gastrulation, regardless of the tissue type, suggesting a systemic mechanism. Such increases may have many causes, such as increased ECM deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davidson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Skoglund et al., 2006</xref>), increased cell-cell adhesion, or stiffness of cytoskeletal architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). The high plasticity after strain of the ectodermal tissue during gastrulation is consistent with its response to strain during epiboly, when its area is increased by about two fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Keller, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chien et al., 2015</xref>). Whatever the causes, the increase in the stiffness of all the tissues at the end of gastrulation may cause decreased plasticity, as well as the resetting of pseudo-elasticity to a thinner epithelial set point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Luu et al., 2011</xref>). Previous estimates of AP compressive stiffness of dorsal isolates at stage 11.5 (about 14 Pascals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Moore et al., 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>), are very similar to ML tensile structural stiffness at stage 11.5 (G+3.5hr) measured here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that the same mechanical elements may be resisting ML widening in both cases. In explants, the constant of spring stiffness for dorsal tissue continues to rise after early neurulation while that for ventral tissue does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), in part because the transverse sectional area of tissue between the attachment strips increases in the former but not in the later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). More reliable measurements will be required to properly resolve the relative stiffness of ventrolateral or posterior tissues expressing CT compared to dorsal tissues expressing CE. In any case, the observed transmission of forces across the full length of the IMZ makes it clear that tissue stiffness links the entire embryo into a mechanical ‘mechanome’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kamm, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lang, 2007</xref>) in which major regional morphogenic movements can affect one another. This accounts for the fact that molecular interdictions of epiboly of the animal cap can affect blastopore closure on the other pole of the embryo, although no molecular perturbation was made there, and that the blastopore closure defect can be rescued by cutting off the animal cap, thus breaking the mechanical link (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eagleson et al., 2015</xref>). Lastly, the tissue connectivity of force-producing regional morphogenic movements is an important parameter for successful embryonic morphogenesis. For example, direct linkage of MIB/CE to the sleds, rather than linkage through CT regions, eliminates the plateau in measured force increase, suggesting that the direct anchor-points of MIB in the vegetal endoderm in the embryo are an important aspect of its architecture.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Accommodation to load and stall force</title><p>Some evidence suggests that tissues modulate their force production in response to changes in load. The mechanical properties of embryonic tissues from different clutches vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">von Dassow and Davidson, 2009</xref>), yet gastrulation proceeds at roughly the same rate, suggesting that force production accommodates to the tissue properties encountered. Explants of dorsal tissues embedded in gels of increasing stiffness respond by producing more force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Time-lapse recordings of blastopore closure show occasional decreases in rate, including temporarily stalling out and then recovering rapidly, as if transient overloads of resistance were being overcome by increased force production (personal observation). However, in our experiments increasing tension did not result in greater convergence force, and instead, temporarily stalled force increase until further morphogenesis had occurred. We suggest that this is because our explants are already at their instantaneous stall force (see below and Appendix 6).</p><p>Our results suggest that explanted tissue builds tension relatively rapidly when initially encumbered, until it reaches its stall force. Further force increase is then limited by the rate at which the number of cells expressing MIB increases and by their rate of intercalation, such that more pull in parallel, rather than in series. Intercalation is in turn limited by the roughly 4 %/hr rate of convergence allowed by explant shear off the attachment strips, lateral strain, and, to a much smaller extent, probe movement. We predict that allowing more rapid convergence should allow force to rise more rapidly. It is not clear how force generation by CT would be expected to change as tissue thickens, but the ventral/ventralized tractor pulls show that force increase correlates with thickening, until both cease once reaching the plateau.</p><p>Mesodermal tissues in normal embryos are probably rarely at their stall force, since convergence occurs more rapidly. When convergence is impeded, tension comparable to that generated in tractor pulls accumulates around the blastopore during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feroze et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting these are also measures of force at their instantaneous stall force. A more accurate reflection of forces in the embryo might be obtained by looking at points along the force-velocity curve more closely resembling the situation in the embryo, e.g. by starting with about 0.2 μN of tension and moving the anchor strip toward the probe at 1 or 2 %/hr.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Estimation of forces generated per cell and tensional stress of convergence</title><p>To estimate the force generated per engaged cell, we determined the average effective sagittal-sectional area (SSA) of the deep mesoderm, the cell population we expect is effective in bulk force production during the tractor pull (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). We estimate that the mean mediolateral tensile force per cell rises during the first half of gastrulation and stabilizes by mid gastrulation at around 2.3 nN/cell, where it remains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). These values assume negligible contribution from neural tissues and give equal weight to each cell within the effective SSA, although different proportions of cells may express CT, CE or no force generating behavior and may direct force mediolaterally more or less efficiently. We assume a constant cell size, although some cell division occurs in the somitic mesoderm during gastrulation and neurulation. The constant force per cell is consistent with the idea that increasing stage-specific maximal force generation is limited primarily by morphogenesis, as it increases the SSA. We also calculated tensional stress within the effective SSA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), which was roughly 4-fold lower than the mediolateral tensile stress estimated from extension forces exerted by dorsal tissues in a gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), which is not surprising given that their measurements capture all of the force generated during late neurula stages in tissue that has undergone normal morphogenesis, compared to our which primarily capture forces generated around the blastopore, as described above.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26944.031</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Estimates of force per cell and tensional stress within effective sagittal section area (SSA) (deep mesoderm only).</title><p>Based on a mean cell sectional area of 625 nm<sup>2</sup>.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Time from onset of gastrulation (hours)</th><th valign="top">Force <break/>(μN (n,±SEM))</th><th valign="top">Effective SSA <break/>(mm<sup>2</sup> (n,±SEM))</th><th valign="top">Estimated force/cell <break/>(nN)</th><th valign="top">Force per effective SSA (Pascals)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">0.25 (3, 0.08)</td><td valign="top">0.12 (1, n/a)</td><td valign="top">1.3</td><td valign="top">2.1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2.1</td><td valign="top">0.31 (3, 0.09)</td><td valign="top">0.11 (4, 0.014)</td><td valign="top">1.7</td><td valign="top">2.8</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2.9</td><td valign="top">0.49 (4, 0.16)</td><td valign="top">0.13 (4, 0.018)</td><td valign="top">2.3</td><td valign="top">3.8</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">4.3</td><td valign="top">0.94 (4, 0.04)</td><td valign="top">0.27 (3, 0.024)</td><td valign="top">2.2</td><td valign="top">3.5</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">6.5</td><td valign="top">1.6 (5, 0.11)</td><td valign="top">0.41 (3, 0.020)</td><td valign="top">2.5</td><td valign="top">3.9</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">11.8</td><td valign="top">2.6 (6, 0.19)</td><td valign="top">0.68 (3, 0.051)</td><td valign="top">2.4</td><td valign="top">3.8</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>CT to CE, a major morphogenic, regulatory, and evolutionary transition in the Amphibia</title><p>The temporal, spatial parameters of the CT to CE transition, and its biomechanical implications, represent a major morphogenic and regulatory transition. The force traces show that CT-generated forces occur early and throughout the IMZ prior to its involution, whereas CE, and its underlying cell behavior, MIB, are expressed after involution and progressively, with increasing numbers of cells acting in parallel with time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shih and Keller, 1992b</xref>). This progressive CT to CE transition at involution in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) explains the dominance of the symmetric circumblastoporal forces of CT in the pre-involution region of the early gastrula, and the dominance of the asymmetric, CE forces in the post-involution region of <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos beginning from the midgastrula stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Keller and Danilchik, 1988</xref>). At the other end of the spectrum of CT-CE transition, <italic>Gastrotheca riobambae</italic> delays all CE until neurulation and has a completely symmetrical blastopore closure, both externally and internally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">del Pino, 1996</xref>). Others, such as the direct developing <italic>Eleutherodactylus coqui</italic> and <italic>Epipedobates tricolor</italic>, show intermediate CT-CE transitions (D. Shook, personal observations). In ongoing work, we are testing the idea that the deployment of CT and CE varies with the egg size and the amount and distribution of yolk and the mechanical challenges changes in these parameters present to the morphogenic machines of gastrulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings illustrate that CT is one of the morphogenic machines that contribute to blastopore closure, along with CE and Vegetal Rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Winklbauer and Schürfeld, 1999</xref>) and that CT is capable of closing the blastopore on its own in the absence of CE patterning, as in ventralized embryos. If we assume that the cell motility driving CT is not dependent on the PCP pathway, since it does not depend on polarized motility, it appears that CT clearly can not reliably close the blastopore in the presence of patterned but non-functional CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Djiane et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tada and Smith, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wallingford et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Habas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goto and Keller, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Habas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ewald et al., 2004</xref>), a hypothesis we test elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shook et al., 2018</xref>). Presumably, blocking CT while allowing CE to occur in an inappropriate context would also block blastopore closure. Normal blastopore closure is the result of the coordinated expression of this system of machines in an appropriately configured biomechanical context, and is thus a problem in systems biology. Our demonstration of the role of CT in this system furthers our understanding and ability to study this system. Failure of amphibian blastopore closure is not a ‘non-specific phenotype’, but results from a failure of some part of this system, which as we have shown here, can be teased apart biomechanically.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Embryo culture, manipulation and explant construction</title><p><italic>X. laevis</italic> embryos were obtained and cultured by standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kay and Peng, 1991</xref>), staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1967</xref>), and cultured in 1/3X MBS (Modified Barth’s Saline).

The anchor and sled were coated with fibronectin (Roche cat # 11 080 938 00, at 20 μg/ml, in 1/3X MBS for 30–60 min at 37°C) and inserted 0.5 to 1.0 mm (15–30% of the mediolateral extent of the explant) between the inner faces of the lateral ends of the sandwich to allow attachment (30–60 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

Using the stage controls, the cleat on the sled was moved adjacent to a calibrated optical fiber probe (40–50 mm by 120 μm, Mouser, Inc. stock 571–5020821) mounted on the end of an aluminum rod fixed to an XYZ micromanipulator attached to an IX70 Olympus inverted microscope. The spring constants of these cantilever probes were calibrated by measuring deflection upon hanging short lengths of wire of known length/mass on a reference probe, which was then used to calibrate other probes. Five probes were made; the first two were discarded because of damage or unsuitability, probes #3 and #4 were used for measurements here, while probe #5 was used as the reference probe. Tension on the explant was measured by probe deflection recorded in high-resolution movies from below the window (40x objective, Olympus IZ70) and its behavior recorded simultaneously by time-lapse imaging from above (Olympus stereoscope). Glass beads (106 μm diameter, Sigma Cat#G-4649) between the sled and the window and a 200 to 300 μm thick, 1% agarose bed between the explant and the window lowered friction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).

In others, the explant was ‘pre-strained’ about 25%, by moving the cleat against the probe, and then away from it, or the explant was left under a pre-tension. Measurements were made to tailbud stages (~20 hr) when the probe deflection generally ceased to increase significantly. The cleat was then backed off from the probe to determine the resting position of the probe.

friction:</title><boxed-text><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26944.033</object-id><p>Probes were placed in distilled water and imaged every 3 min. Force equivalents for the observed drift were calculated, for purposes of comparing different probes and the effect of drift on force measurements. Probe #3 showed minimal drift, within ±0.5μN over 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In most cases the most rapid drift occurred within the first 60 min. Probe #4 shows much greater drift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), especially when recorded from shortly after the dry probe was immersed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, in nearly all cases, within 30 min of immersion probe #4 showed drift that was near linear over the range of forces we consider. When probe #4 was allowed to soak overnight, it had reduced probe drift (turquoise line that reaches 0.5μN, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Drift for probe #4 may have to do with hydration and/or temperature equilibration of some element of the probe-holder assembly. By soaking the probes for 60 min prior to use and correcting for any remaining drift (as measured at the end of the tractor pull, upon the release of the explant from the probe) by interpolating over the period of force measurement, we minimized the error contributed by drift.</p><p>To evaluate the friction between the sled and the under-laying substrate, we moved the stage holding the tractor pull chamber such that the cleat on an unattached sled was pushed against a stationary probe, recorded the probe position every 100–200 s and calculated the force exerted on the probe at each time for 2–6 hr. We compared the friction of the sled with the substrate, (1) on bare glass, 2) with an agarose pad of roughly 50–100% larger area under the sled and (3) with a sparse layer of 100 μm glass beads under the sled. Tests were done in DFA, which contains 0.1% BSA. A representative example of test runs on different substrates is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Treatment of the glass beforehand (e.g. by acid-ethanol wash and/or coating with BSA) appeared to have minimal effect. For glass, agarose and beads (n’s = 4, 5 and 7), the average median forces were 0.41, 0.48 and 0.25 μN respectively. The average minimum forces were 0.27, 0.36 and 0.00 μN. The average standard deviation was 0.10, 0.07 and 0.14 μN. The force on the probe was below 0.32, 0.40, and 0.09 μN 10% of the time. And the fraction of the time forces were below 0.25 μN was 12, 23% and 64%. Although the 1.5 to 2-fold differences in the median friction force was only a moderate improvement, the difference in the time the friction force was at or near 0 μN on beads was dramatic. Rather than experiencing a fairly steady approximately 0.4 to 0.5 μN of friction in the case of glass or agarose, sleds over beads experienced lower friction much more frequently. For this reason, we used a sparse layer of beads in all force measurement and stress-relaxation tests. We assume that force measurements are approximately 0.2 μN below the force explants could produce at a given time.</p></boxed-text></sec></app><app id="appendix-2"><title>Appendix 2</title><sec id="s8" sec-type="appendix"><title>Immunohistochemistry and ventralized embryos.</title><boxed-text><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26944.034</object-id><p>For immunohistochemistry, embryos and explants were fixed at stage 26–28 in MEMFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kay and Peng, 1991</xref>) overnight at 4°C and transferred to methanol for storage at –20°C.

Notochord and somites in giants from tractor pulls were generally elongated orthogonal to the mediolateral axis, although to a lesser extent than in an unencumbered giant. In standard giant or D180° sandwich explants from tractor pulls, the posterior ends of the two notochords frequently did not fuse, and in some cases most of the notochords were separate, but co-linear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A–H</xref>).

The two methods highlight the fact that viscosity appears to be much lower during the first 10–15 s of stress relaxations than thereafter. This may reflect a change in the cellular elements that are viscously flowing over time, with very low viscosity elements flowing first, followed by successively higher viscosity elements.

Giant sandwich explants are composed of presumptive endodermal and mesodermal tissues vegetally and ectodermal tissues animally, of different presumptive mesodermal (notochord, somite, etc.), ectodermal (epidermal, neural) and endodermal (vegetal, suprablastoporal) along both mediolateral and animal-vegetal axes, and different basic tissue types (epithelial, mesenchymal) along their radial dimension (perpendicular to the plane of the explant) so are not homogeneous in any dimension. Additionally, especially after CE begins at stage 10.5 (G+2hr), the shape of the sagittal sectional area (SSA) begins to vary along the mediolateral extent of giant sandwich explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

Probably as a consequence, later stiffness measurements from D180° explants in particular are more variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Thus some threshold of unresolved tensile load may retard further convergence via intercalation and thus limit additional force production, whereas an increased compressive load driving extension, the output of convergence, may activate compression-sensitive accommodation mechanisms while not immediately limiting the progress of intercalation.

The results of the work address important, long-standing questions in the field regarding tissue mechanics of vertebrate development and the studies appear to be rigorously performed and analyzed. Overall the work is of high quality and should represent an important contribution to the literature provided that most of the suggested revisions by the reviewers can be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Much of the writing and presentation of the results is hard for non-specialized researchers to easily understand, thus revising the text throughout, and particularly the Introduction and Discussion, is needed to make the fundamental concepts more readily accessible and comprehensible. Consultation with a non-expert in the details of this work could help to make suggestions to the figures and text, or at least specifically point out elements that could benefit from some such clarification.</p><p>Validation and/or application of the proposed model should be performed to demonstrate its relevance to tissue morphogenesis.</p><p>The rationale for, and implications of, the stiffness calculations for CT/CE-driven morphogenesis should be further clarified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, the authors define the biomechanical basis of the convergence (tissue shortening) forces that drive blastopore closure and extension of the body axis in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos. They focus on two different morphogenetic machines believed to drive this convergence in the involuting marginal zone (IMZ) tissue of the gastrula: convergent thickening (CT) and convergent extension (CE).</p><p>Using a custom-built mechanical measuring device (a &quot;tractor pull&quot; apparatus, previously reported elsewhere) to directly quantify the forces generated by IMZ explants, the authors show that, during early gastrulation, CT generates circumblastoporal tension throughout the (pre-involution) IMZ. They then identify a transition point at mid-gastrulation, after which CE contributes progressively more force (via post-involution mediolateral intercalation behavior).</p><p>The manuscript also describes stress-relaxation tests to calculate the tensile stiffness of IMZ tissues (by modeling IMZ explants as viscoelastic materials). From these endeavors, the authors conclude that all tissues of the embryo gradually increase in stiffness by the end of gastrulation.</p><p>Previously, the relative contribution of CT vs. CE in convergence was not known, and CT was thought to be limited to only the ventral sector of the gastrula. The data presented in this manuscript clarifies the independent spatiotemporal influences of CT and CE on convergence, and quantifies the force dynamics involved at different stages of development. The authors conclude with an elegant model of the function of CT and CE as integrated spring (CE) and motor (CT) pulling mechanisms, offering a deeper, biomechanical understanding of the convergence forces likely acting in vivo during <italic>Xenopus</italic> gastrulation.</p><p>1) It is not entirely clear (to me) how the tensile stiffness calculations are related to the force measurements, nor how stiffness was used to inform the model in Figure 6. The rationale for, and implications of, the stiffness calculations for CT/CE-driven morphogenesis should be further clarified.</p><p>2) The conclusions regarding the timing and independence of CT vs. CE are interesting and could provide a reinterpretation and refinement of our understanding of the biomechanical mechanisms driving gastrulation. However, it is difficult to predict the impact and significance of this work without some sort of validation or application of the proposed model. For example, the tractor pull apparatus could be used to biomechanically tease apart a &quot;non-specific&quot; blastopore closure/gastrulation phenotype (e.g., elicited by PCP gene misexpression), thus testing the validity of the model and demonstrating its relevance for understanding morphogenesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper is a welcome addition to the canon of <italic>Xenopus</italic> gastrulation literature on three levels. First, it provides new data on the patterning of forces during gastrulation in one of the key model system for understanding this important developmental process. This is important, as the key role of mechanics is now well appreciated, but we still lack solid data on many aspects of gastrulation in vertebrates.</p><p>Second, it brings to the fore the previously under-appreciated process of convergent thickening, which relies on radial intercalation rather than mediolateral cell intercalation. Indeed, we are seeing in the last year something of a renaissance of interest in radial intercalation after over a decade of obsession specifically with the mediolateral variety. So this aspect sis quite timely.</p><p>Third, through the first two, the paper provides answers to several longstanding puzzles in the field, including but not limited to: why do ventralized <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos close their blastopores and how do other frogs – that express convergent extension only very late – close their blastopores.</p><p>Thus, the paper has impact on developmental and evolutionary issues, as well tissue mechanics.</p><p>The data appear solid throughout (I say &quot;appear&quot; only because I am not an expert in mechanics). And the while the writing is dense, so too are the data, so it seems reasonable here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript &quot;Large, long range tensile forces drive convergence during <italic>Xenopus</italic> blastopore closure and body axis elongation&quot; by Shook et al., provides direct evidence that two morphogenetic movements, convergent thickening (CT) and convergent extension (CE) of the marginal zone (MZ), generate tensile convergence forces to close the blastopore and elongate the body axis in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. The authors, measured these forces in several MZ explants (giants, dorsal 180°, ventral 180° and ventralized giants) that undergo CT and/or CE using a customized &quot;Tractor Pull&quot; device. The authors show that the tension developed by giant explants is increasing in two distinct phases separated by a plateau phase. Interestingly, the first phase of force increase is conserved in explants that do not undergo CE (ventral 180° and ventralized explants), suggesting that during this period (onset of gastrulation) CT is the main source of the circumblastoporal convergence tension, providing thus new insights into the yet non-well defined role of CT in <italic>Xenopus</italic> development. The second phase of force increase is at late neurulation which mainly coincides with CE behavior and stiffening of these tissues. Overall, this work confirms the long-standing notion that convergence tensile forces close the blastopore in amphibians. The finding that CT plays a major role in this process is interesting especially to the researchers of <italic>Xenopus</italic> developmental biology, since it is a morphogenetic movement that was not well-described before and it could provide a new avenue of interpreting phenotypes related to blastopore closure. The experiments are technically well performed and describe nicely the mechanical input of the two morphogenetic events (CT and CE) in <italic>Xenopus</italic> morphogenesis. However, the following major concerns need to be taken into consideration before publishing this study in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>A) Although the authors mention that CT and CE are evolutionary conserved, in order for this study to be highly appreciated by a wider audience beyond the field of <italic>Xenopus</italic> developmental biology, it would be valuable to characterize at the cell and molecular level the differences between CT and CE (i.e. which cell behaviors and which molecules can polarize the cells to first converge and thick the tissue and then switch to elongation). Such mechanistic insight will be extremely interesting for the field of mechanobiology, since it will explain how different cell/molecular behaviors lead to distinct force generating processes that shape differently the tissue (please see below).</p><p>B) Although the authors provide several diagrams to explain to the reader the complexity of blastopore closure, the manuscript and figures are still very hard to be understood by researchers non-specialized in <italic>Xenopus</italic> gastrulation (for specific comments please see below).</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) It was previously shown that inhibition of the PCP pathway in the dorsal MZ leads to inhibition of CE and defects in blastopore closure. In contrast, inhibition of the PCP pathway in the ventral MZ only leads to a slight delay of blastopore closure until mid-gastrula stages (until which CT is mainly occurring), indicating that CT might not rely on PCP signaling (Ewald, A.J. et al., 2004, Development). In order for the authors to provide cellular and molecular mechanistic insights, it would be worth to express Xdsh either dorsally or ventrally and examine if and how PCP signaling affects the convergence force generated by CT in all four types of explants, and how this can be correlated with defects in morphogenesis of the sibling embryos. Such experiments would not only support the impact of this study for the interpretation of the phenotypes associated with defective blastopore closure but will also provide evidence for differential molecular control of polarity during CT and CE (point A).</p><p>2) The giant explants exhibit two force increase phases separated by a plateau phase. Although the authors suggest that this could be associated with the progression of MIB, it would be relevant to show with high resolution time lapse imaging how cell behavior is changed in the different phases (i.e. cell polarity, protrusion formation) (point A).</p><p>3) As mentioned in the text, CT was previously described to take place at the ventral MZ and later in development (Keller, R., and Danilchik, M., 1988, Development), but here the authors show that it takes place in the whole MZ earlier in gastrulation. It would be useful to describe this finding further by showing images or time lapses of how CT progresses in both embryos and explants. Sagittal sections of ventral vs. dorsal explants will also be useful to address any differences in the timing and extent of CT in the two regions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Large, long range tensile forces drive convergence during <italic>Xenopus</italic> blastopore closure and body axis elongation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

In this paper, the authors illuminate the nature of this process with quantitative biomechanical analyses of explanted amphibian embryonic tissues.</p><p>The reviews of the original manuscript asked authors to 1) revise the text throughout to provide clarification for non-specialists in the field, 2) include an experimental application/validation of the model, and 3) explain the rationale for, and implications of, the stiffness calculations. Below I address the perceived effectiveness of the revised manuscript in addressing each of these points.</p><p>1) The Introduction and Discussion of the revised manuscript are not any more streamlined than the original; however, the flow of information is more accessible to the non-specialist.</p><p>My main concern is that the new version of the Introduction now refers to unpublished data/conclusions about CT in an as-yet-unfinished additional manuscript (cited as Shook et al., 2017, although not included in reference list).</p><p>For example:</p><p>- &quot;…our understanding of CT is that the underlying surface tension based mechanism does not require a polarized cell behavior, only motility to maximize high-affinity cell-cell contacts (Shook et al., 2017).&quot; - &quot;These events are based on…characterization of CT (Shook et al., 2017).&quot; - &quot;IMZ explants from ventralized embryos show a rapid, near uniform CT throughout the IMZ…(Shook et al., 2017).&quot;</p><p>Thus, some of the background information about CT now included as the foundation of the present <italic>eLife</italic> manuscript (and presented in Figure 1) is somewhat misleading as, technically, it is not peer reviewed, published knowledge. In general, it is difficult to discern what is known (published), unknown (unpublished), and perhaps known only by the authors (but still unpublished) about CT as a morphogenetic machine.</p><p>2) Rather than include application/validation studies in the present manuscript, the authors chose to refer reviewers to independent data contained in the as-yet-unpublished, second manuscript (Shook et al., 2017).</p><p>Although the existence of this manuscript in preparation provides confidence that relevant experiments are ongoing and feasible, readers of the current <italic>eLife</italic> manuscript, when published, would not have access to these data. It does not seem prudent to allow the validity of the CT/CE model in the current <italic>eLife</italic> article to rely on findings that (while promising) have not yet been formally peer-reviewed/published.</p><p>Unfortunately, the current organization of all the relevant data regarding CT into two highly interrelated and interdependent studies, one of which is still unfinished, is simply less than ideal. (One would have hoped that the authors would have found a way to integrate some of the additional data into the present manuscript.)</p><p>3) The rationale for performing the stiffness calculations, and the implications of stiffness for CT/CE-driven morphogenesis, are much clearer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This revision addressed my previous concerns, all of which were minor. I strongly support publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript has been revised along the lines suggested by the different referees. The revisions have substantially improved the manuscript – it is now much easier to read and the link to the other not yet published manuscript also helps in understanding the molecular and cellular basis of the described CT and CE mechanisms. That said, I now fully support publication of this manuscript as is.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26944.043</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Much of the writing and presentation of the results is hard for non-specialized researchers to easily understand, thus revising the text throughout, and particularly the Introduction and Discussion, is needed to make the fundamental concepts more readily accessible and comprehensible.

The relationship between CT and RI has also been clarified in the Introduction section; to be clear, they are to some extent opposite processes, driven by very different mechanisms, not two facets of the same process. The biomechanical measurements of stiffness have been better explained for understanding by non-specialists, as have their rationale and implications, in the Results and Discussion sections. The explanation of our model for the differential use of CT and CE (Figure 6) in the Discussion section has also been revised to clarify the model and its implications.</p><p>We welcome further suggestions from the reviewers for points that could be better clarified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Validation and/or application of the proposed model should be performed to demonstrate its relevance to tissue morphogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have performed the experiments suggested by reviewers and include them in the CT paper, along with other that serve to validate our model and demonstrate its relevance to morphogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The rationale for, and implications of, the stiffness calculations for CT/CE-driven morphogenesis should be further clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have included explanatory text for non-specialists, both more clearly explaining what we are measuring, why we are measuring it, and how we measure it, particularly in the portion of the Results section describing these experiments, and in the Discussion with our interpretation of these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) It is not entirely clear (to me) how the tensile stiffness calculations are related to the force measurements, nor how stiffness was used to inform the model in Figure 6.

The reason for making stiffness measurements, and their implications are now spelled out at the beginning and ends of the relevant sections.</p><p>Our model in Figure 6 is supported by our stiffness measurements in that the differential “spring stiffness” of dorsal vs. ventrolateral tissues is used to explain the plateau, and the increasing spring stiffness of standard giants and dorsal 180s, but not ventral 180s, between about 9 and 12 hours, is used to explain the end of the plateau, with the eventual transition from CT to MIB in the ventral tissues of a standard giant.</p><p>The section in the Discussion section titled “The force profile reflects the transition from CT to CE and illuminates the mechanics of gastrulation”, as well as minor elements of Figure 6 have been changed to better explain the implications of our understanding of the forces produced by and the stiffness of embryonic tissues, both for the behavior of explants in the tractor pull and in the intact embryo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The conclusions regarding the timing and independence of CT vs. CE are interesting and could provide a reinterpretation and refinement of our understanding of the biomechanical mechanisms driving gastrulation. However, it is difficult to predict the impact and significance of this work without some sort of validation or application of the proposed model. For example, the tractor pull apparatus could be used to biomechanically tease apart a &quot;non-specific&quot; blastopore closure/gastrulation phenotype (e.g., elicited by PCP gene misexpression), thus testing the validity of the model and demonstrating its relevance for understanding morphogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Experiments validating our model are now in the CT paper, as described above. MIB-driven CE clearly has a much greater dependence on PCP signaling than does CT. Further, CE is also more dependent on Myosin II B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The data appear solid throughout (I say &quot;appear&quot; only because I am not an expert in mechanics).

And as soon as Dr. Shook is able to obtain funding, this work will be carried forward, in <italic>Xenopus</italic> as well as other amphibian species, and ultimately in invertebrate species; Hemichordates appear to use some variation of CT to close their blastopore.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Although the authors provide several diagrams to explain to the reader the complexity of blastopore closure, the manuscript and figures are still very hard to be understood by researchers non-specialized in Xenopus gastrulation (for specific comments please see below).</p></disp-quote><p>We hope our new and improved Figure 1 and our explanation for it in the text addresses this problem. It is worth noting that amphibian gastrulation involves a complex set of morphogenic mechanisms, which one research paper cannot hope to thoroughly explain. We have however tried to distill the most important elements of these mechanism and explain them as clearly as possible, and to explain their relevance to blastopore closure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>1) It was previously shown that inhibition of the PCP pathway in the dorsal MZ leads to inhibition of CE and defects in blastopore closure.

Comparing normal to ventralized embryos, Xdd1 overexpression strongly interferes with blastopore closure in normal embryos, which express both CE and CT, but not in ventralized embryos, which rely on only CT to close their blastopore. Similar results were found with force measurements when comparing the effects of Xdd1 on D180 vs. V180 sandwich explants; Xdd1 strongly inhibits force production in D180s, which rely on both CT and CE to generate force, but only weakly inhibits force production in V180s, which rely on only CT.</p><p>This is a somewhat cleaner experiment than injecting Xdd1 ventrally in normal embryos, since this tissue will eventually express MIB-driven CE.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The giant explants exhibit two force increase phases separated by a plateau phase. Although the authors suggest that this could be associated with the progression of MIB, it would be relevant to show with high resolution time lapse imaging how cell behavior is changed in the different phases (i.e. cell polarity, protrusion formation) (point A).</p></disp-quote><p>The normal progression of MIB in the IMZ has been extensively documented by the Keller lab, in references listed in the introduction at the end of the explanation for Figure 1, as well as the failure of MIB to advance as rapidly as normal when CE is mechanically retarded, as in the tractor pull (but using other mechanisms). While it would be nice to be able to directly correlate the cell behaviors that are happening in explants in the tractor pull with force generation, the experimental preparations that allow high resolution imaging of cell behaviors are incompatible with force measurements. Technological advances may some day allow this, but it is not currently possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As mentioned in the text, CT was previously described to take place at the ventral MZ and later in development (Keller, R., and Danilchik, M., 1988, Development), but here the authors show that it takes place in the whole MZ earlier in gastrulation.

This has now been explicitly pointed out in the text. Video 1 shows whole embryos, but this provides little clarity on its own.
