increases hippocampal neurogenesis. The approaches for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using rodent models have focused on the extinction and reconsolidation of recent, but not remote, memories. Here we show that, following prolonged re-exposure to the conditioning context, enhancers of hippocampal neurogenesis, including MEM, promote forgetting of remote contextual fear memory. However, these interventions are ineffective following shorter re-exposures. Importantly, we find that long, but not short re-exposures activate gene expression in the hippocampus and induce hippocampus-dependent reconsolidation of remote contextual fear memory. Furthermore, remote memory retrieval becomes hippocampus-dependent after the long-time recall, suggesting that remote fear memory returns to a hippocampus dependent state after the long-time recall, thereby allowing enhanced forgetting by increased hippocampal neurogenesis. Forgetting of traumatic memory may contribute to the development of PTSD treatment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17464.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17464.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>remote fear memory</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aids for Scientific Research 15H02488</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kida</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aids for Scientific Research 23300120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kida</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aids for Scientific Research 20380078</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kida</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Challenging Exploratory Research 24650172</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kida</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Challenging Exploratory Research 26640014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kida</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aids for Scientific Research on Priority Area -

In experimental animals PTSD may be modeled using Pavlovian fear conditioning. Pavlovian fear conditioning generates fear memory, reflecting an association between the conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US). This CS-US association is stabilized and becomes a long-term memory (LTM) through gene expression dependent consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flexner et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis and Squire, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Silva et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McGaugh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the strength of fear memories may be modified following their formation via several distinct processes. First, repeated and/or prolonged re-exposure to the CS induces extinction. This is an inhibitory learning process that reduces fear while preserving the original fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pavlov, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rescorla, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Myers and Davis, 2002</xref>). Second, retrieval destabilizes a fear memory, necessitating protein synthesis restabilization (or reconsolidation). Accordingly, targeting protein synthesis following retrieval may prevent reconsolidation and weaken or even erase fear memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nader et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Debiec et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kida et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>). Third, forgetting processes may weaken established fear memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akers et al., 2014</xref>). While interventions to treat PTSD have focused on extinction and reconsolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bentz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mueller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Litz et al., 2012</xref>), interventions that promote forgetting may represent an alternative approach for modifying traumatic memories.</p><p>In this regard, recently it has been shown that neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus regulates forgetting of hippocampus-dependent memories. Increasing hippocampal neurogenesis following training accelerated forgetting, whereas reducing hippocampal neurogenesis following training stabilized or strengthened existing hippocampus-dependent memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Epp et al., 2016</xref>). Here we first replicate these findings and show that post-training elevation of hippocampal neurogenesis via memantine (MEM), which is a non-competitive inhibitor of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bormann, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seif el Nasr et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Müller et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Danysz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Volbracht et al., 2006</xref>), can weaken contextual fear memories. As contextual fear memories age, they become less dependent upon the hippocampus for their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim and Fanselow, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anagnostaras et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frankland and Bomtempi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wiltgen et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with this, MEM treatment at remote time points failed to induce forgetting of contextual fear memories. However, reminders treatments that re-engage the hippocampus render contextual fear memories susceptible again to MEM-induced forgetting. As one of the major challenges in PTSD is finding treatments to weaken traumatic memories for events in the remote past although most approaches to weaken or erase fear memory target reconsolidation and extinction of the recent, but not remote, memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nader et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Monfils et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaplan and Moore, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xue et al., 2012</xref>), these findings suggest targeting forgetting processes as a potentially viable alternative or adjunct to extinction and reconsolidation based approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Forgetting of contextual fear memory by after MEM treatments</title><p>Post-training memantine (MEM) treatment was previously shown to enhance forgetting of contextual fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akers et al., 2014</xref>). We first confirmed these results under using our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Mice were trained with a single foot shock (0.4 mA, Training), and 24 hrs later tested (Test 1). Twenty-four hrs after the Test 1, the mice received systemic injections of MEM (50 mg/kg body weight (bw)) or vehicle (VEH) once a week for four weeks (MEM-4 or VEH group). Another group received an injection of MEM only 24 hr after Test 1 (MEM-1 group). Contextual fear memory was assessed again four weeks after initial training (Test 2). All groups displayed comparable and high freezing response levels during Test 1. In contrast, the MEM-1 and -4 groups showed reduced freezing compared to the VEH group in Test 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), although this reduction was only statistically significant in the MEM-4 group. These observations were consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akers et al., 2014</xref>), and indicated that post-training MEM treatment enhanced forgetting in a dose-dependent manner.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17464.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Memantine (MEM) treatment enhanced forgetting of contextual fear memory through the increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MEM treatment enhanced forgetting of contextual fear memory in a manner dependent on the number of MEM treatments.

To determine if spontaneous recovery was observed after MEM treatment, fear memory was assessed again at four weeks after Test 2 (Sp. Test). The MEM-4 group showed freezing that was comparable with the Test 2 group, and still showed significantly less freezing than the VEH group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These observations suggested that spontaneous recovery does not occur following MEM treatment, supporting our conclusion that MEM enhances forgetting (rather than extinction).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Correlation between forgetting and increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis</title><p>MEM treatments enhance forgetting through increases in adult hippocampal neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maekawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishikawa 2014</xref>). Conversely, preventing MEM-associated increases in hippocampal neurogenesis blocks MEM-induced forgetting of contextual fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akers et al., 2014</xref>). We next examined the relationship between forgetting of contextual fear memory and increased hippocampal neurogenesis after MEM treatments. For this purpose, we examined the impact of different MEM doses on neurogenesis and forgetting. We performed a similar experiment to that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> except mice were treated with low (25 mg/kg bw) or high (50 mg/kg bw) doses of MEM or VEH. Mice also received systemic injections of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 50 mg/kg bw) to label proliferating cells, at two days after each MEM or VEH treatment, and then the number of BrdU-positive cells was quantified 24 hr after Test 2 by using immunohistochemistry. We found that MEM enhanced forgetting and hippocampal neurogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. The MEM-50 group showed significantly less freezing at Test 2, and significantly increased BrdU-positive cells compared to the VEH group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The MEM-25 group showed intermediate levels of freezing and BrdU-positive cells compared to VEH and MEM-50 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). We then performed correlational analyses by comparing the number of BrdU-positive cells with reductions in freezing scores (by subtracting freezing levels of Test 1 from Test 2) for the MEM-25 group since this group that showed mid-levels of both forgetting and neurogenesis. We found that there was a significant negative correlation between forgetting and neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results indicated that mice showing more neurogenesis also had more forgetting, and support the idea that MEM enhances forgetting through the increase in hippocampal neurogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Forgetting after MEM treatment is dependent on hippocampus</title><p>In the adult brain neurogenesis persists in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus and in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Therefore, MEM-induced forgetting should be limited to brain regions like the hippocampus that are remodeled with the addition of new neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frankland et al., 2013</xref>). To address this, we next trained mice in aversively-motivated tasks that are hippocampus-dependent and -independent, respectively. First, we used an inhibitory avoidance tasks that depends upon the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lorenzini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Twenty-four hours after training with a 0.1 mA foot shock, mice were treated with MEM for four weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and then crossover latency was assessed (Test). The MEM group showed significantly shorter crossover latencies than the VEH group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that MEM enhanced forgetting of inhibitory avoidance memory. We next used cued fear conditioning tasks that can generate an amygdala-dependent fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Phillips and LeDoux, 1992</xref>). Mice were presented a tone that co-terminated with a 0.4 mA foot shock in the training context (Training). Mice were assessed for their freezing responses to the tone in a different chamber at 24 hr (Test 1) and four weeks (Test 2) after the training.

Using the same logic here we ask whether reminders (i.e., context re-exposure) may make remote contextual fear memories susceptible to MEM-induced forgetting. In our previous reconsolidation experiment we found that long (10 min) but not short (3 min) re-exposures to the context were effective, and so here we used these long and brief reminders. Mice were trained as previously, and then re-exposed to the context for 3 or 10 min eight weeks later (re-exposure). Following re-exposure, MEM treatment was initiated and memory tested four weeks later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Therefore, we first evaluated whether extended context re-exposure make remote contextual fear memories freshly dependent on the hippocampus.

In this experiment, mice were trained and then re-exposed to the context 24 hr later for 3 min. Immediately following this re-exposure mice received a micro-infusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (ANI) or VEH into the dorsal hippocampus, and 24 hr later mice were assessed for freezing (Test).

It is possible that longer context reminders at remote time-points will induce c-fos expression in the hippocampus, a finding that would be consistent with our observation that longer context reminders render remote contextual fear memories sensitive to reconsolidation blockade by protein synthesis inhibition.</p><p>Therefore, we examined this possibility by measuring c-fos expression in the hippocampus and ACC following the retrieval of recent or remote memory, using immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Here we used MEM treatment to enhance hippocampal neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maekawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namba et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishikawa et al., 2014</xref>). We first demonstrated that MEM treatment promoted forgetting of 'recent' contextual fear memory that was hippocampus-dependent. We also showed that the enhanced forgetting induced by MEM correlated with increases in hippocampal neurogenesis. However, MEM failed to promote forgetting of amygdala-dependent fear memory. Furthermore, in contrast to recent memory, MEM had no impact on remote fear memory that was hippocampus-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dudai, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frankland and Bontempi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Squire and Bayley, 2007</xref>). Collectively, our observations suggest that increases in hippocampal neurogenesis promote forgetting of hippocampus-dependent recent memory, but not remote and/or hippocampus-independent memory.</p><p>In previous experiments we found that prolonged (10 min) context re-exposures may render even remote contextual fear memories labile and hippocampus-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>). Accordingly, using the same approach here, we found that MEM treatment following 10 min re-exposure enhanced forgetting of remote contextual fear memory. In addition, forgetting of remote contextual fear memory was promoted by exercise using a running wheel, another hippocampal neurogenesis enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Praag et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akers et al., 2014</xref>) following long (but not short) context re-exposures. It is important to note that this 10 min re-exposure did not appear to trigger the extinction of remote contextual fear memory for a number of reasons. First, decreased freezing responses were observed only when mice were treated with hippocampal neurogenesis enhancers (MEM or running). This suggests that this decrease of freezing scores depends on hippocampal neurogenesis-induced forgetting rather than extinction. Second, reconsolidation and extinction of contextual fear memory require longer re-exposure when memory becomes older or stronger, suggesting that 10 min re-exposure to the context is sufficient for reconsolidation but insufficient for extinction when memory is remote (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suzuki et al 2004</xref>, data not shown). Third, reconsolidation and extinction show contrasting biochemical signatures in the hippocampus (c-fos expression is observed in the hippocampus when memory is reconsolidated, but not extinguished) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mamiya et al., 2009</xref>). Consistently, 10 min re-exposure induces hippocampal c-fos expression and enables disrupt fear memory by protein synthesis inhibition, suggesting that this longer re-exposure induces reconsolidation but not extinction. Taken together, our findings suggest that forgetting of remote contextual fear memory is enhanced by the increase in hippocampal neurogenesis only after extended behavioral 'reminders'.</p><p>We hypothesize that extended context re-exposures enable remote memory to return to a hippocampus-dependent state, thereby allowing enhanced forgetting by increases in hippocampal neurogenesis. Our findings support our hypothesis as follows: (1) Hippocampus-dependent reconsolidation of remote memory is induced following the long, but not short context re-exposures, suggesting that extended 'reminders' recruit the hippocampus to help regulate remote memory. (2) The long, but not short context re-exposure at remote time points induces the expression of c-fos in the hippocampus, indicating that the prolonged retrieval of remote memory reactivates the hippocampus at the molecular and cellular levels. (3) The retrieval of remote memory is hippocampus-dependent when the memory is recalled 24 hr after these reminder treatments. Additionally, these findings suggest that the activation of hippocampus by longer context re-exposures open a window both to induce hippocampus-dependent reconsolidation and hippocampal neurogenesis-dependent forgetting by returning remote memory to a hippocampus-dependent state.</p><p>Retrograde amnesia is caused by damage or inhibition of hippocampal function. Remote memory can be recalled, while recent memory cannot, under the conditions of retrograde amnesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zora-Morgan and Squire, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim and Fanselow, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anagnostaras et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manns et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Squire et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frankland and Bontempi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wiltgen et al., 2006</xref>). In agreement with these studies, Frankland et al. showed that the expression of immediate early genes (<italic>c-fos, Zif 268</italic>) was induced when recent contextual fear memory was retrieved, while this expression was not observed when remote memory was retrieved, suggesting that the hippocampus is reactivated only when recent memory is retrieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frankland et al., 2004</xref>). However, our results indicated that the expression of c-fos in the hippocampus was induced only at remote time points following extended (but not brief) context re-exposure, in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frankland et al. (2004)</xref>. The hippocampus can, therefore, be reactivated following the retrieval of remote memory only when extended 'reminders' are given. In the future, it will be important to determine whether the same hippocampal neurons that are incorporated into the memory engram at the initial fear conditioning are reactivated when the hippocampus is reactivated by long-time retrieval of remote memory.</p><p>Reconsolidation is suggested to be a process not only to maintain memory, but also to enhance and/or update memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nader et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dudai, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tronel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fukushima et al., 2014</xref>). Previously, our study showed that reconsolidation of recent contextual fear memory was induced following 3 min context re-exposures, while similarly brief reminders failed to induce the reconsolidation when memory was remote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>). However, longer context re-exposures (10 min) enabled the induction of reconsolidation of remote memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the reconsolidation of remote memory required reactivation of the hippocampus, reflected by activated gene expression. Therefore, our observations suggest that reactivation of the hippocampus following extended 'reminders' may contribute to updating remote memory in order to add new information to the original remote memory. Additionally, the possibility still remains that the activation (but not reactivation) of hippocampus by longer re-exposure to the familiar context is required to generate new memory associated with this familiar context.</p><p>In this study, hippocampal neurogenesis enhancers (MEM and running) failed to completely abolish fear memories. This may be due to remaining fear memory that depends on brain regions other than hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). However, previous studies have shown that similar residual levels of freezing responses are still observed when consolidation or reconsolidation of fear memory is disrupted by amnestic drugs or gene manipulations and when fear memory is extinguished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kida et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wei et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mamiya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inaba et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that significant forgetting was observed following the treatments with neurogenesis enhancers. In addition, we found that c-fos expression was not induced in the ACC and hippocampus when c-fos expression was assessed after the retrieval test following the treatments with MEM for four weeks (data not shown), strongly suggesting that the MEM treatment induces forgetting of fear memory even though mice still showed low level of freezing.</p><p>Fear memory extinction is an inhibitory learning process used to reduce fear responses to fear memory retrieval. However, spontaneous recovery of fear responses is observed with time after fear memory is extinguished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pavlov, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rescorla, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schiller et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we showed that spontaneous recovery of the fear response is not observed over time following forgetting of contextual fear memory. This observation suggests that, in contrast to fear memory extinction, forgetting of fear memory through increases in neurogenesis permanently erases fear responses.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that forgetting of remote contextual fear memory was promoted by hippocampal neurogenesis following long (but not short) context reminders. Our findings identify forgetting as a targetable process for the treatment of PTSD. In the future, it will be important to extend our findings by examining effects of increased hippocampal neurogenesis on pathophysiological alterations linked with a PTSD-like state. Furthermore, it will be important to extend our findings to target hippocampus-independent traumatic memory since traumatic memory associated with PTSD must be more complex than contextual fear memory used in this study as the rodent PTSD model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Milad et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parsons and Ressler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">VanElzakker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Desmedt et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All experiments were conducted according to the <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> of <italic>the Japan Neuroscience Society</italic> and the <italic>Guide for the Tokyo University of Agriculture</italic>.

In general, this is an elegant study that confirms the role of the adult hippocampus in forgetting, and suggests that this approach can be used to target remote fear memories.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raised some concerns regarding the interpretation of some of the results as follows:</p><p>1) A constant issue in the fear conditioning literature is that extinction and forgetting/erasure have the same output (lack of freezing). In Mamiya et al., J. Neuroscience 2009 29:402, the same group submitting this paper showed that longer exposures to context (in this case 30 min instead of 10 min) activated extinction learning. While in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, a</xref> second test four weeks later showed that the decrease in freezing caused by increased neurogenesis did not spontaneously recover (as might be expected for extinction), this control was not done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, where extinction was more likely due to the increased exposure to the context. Some explanation of this is needed, and some discussion of whether the difference between the 10 minute and 3 minute exposures may have some contributions from increased extinction due to the increased exposure to context.</p><p>2) The increase in c-FOS seen in the hippocampus after longer re-exposure is interpreted as enabling &quot;remote memory to return to a hippocampus-dependent state&quot;. However, an alternative explanation could be that longer exposure to a previously familiar context generates a new memory, as opposed to reactivation of an old memory. This should be discussed. This may be what the authors are implying by pointing out the importance of whether the same hippocampal neurons are activated during the initial memory and the reactivation of the hippocampal memory by a prolonged exposure.</p><p>3) There is a concern that rodent PTSD models based solely on fear conditioning do not distinguish between a physiological response to a stressful event and the pathophysiological alterations that may more closely reflects a PTSD-like state (Desmedt et al. al Biol Psych 2015).

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we observed decreased freezing responses at the Test 4 weeks after the re-exposure to the context for 10 min only when mice were treated with MEM or running. In contrast, untreated mice did not show reduced freezing responses, suggesting that this decrease of freezing scores depends on increased hippocampal neurogenesis, but not due to memory extinction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). In addition, our previous studies have suggested that the induction of reconsolidation and extinction requires longer duration of re-exposure to the context when memory becomes older or stronger, suggesting that 10 min re-exposure to the context is sufficient to induce reconsolidation but fails to induce extinction when memory is remote (Suzuki et al. 2004, data not shown). Consistently, reconsolidation, but not extinction, was observed following 10 min re-exposure when memory is remote (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, our previous study (Mamiya et al., 2009) showed that c-fos expression is observed in the hippocampus when memory is reconsolidated in response to the context for 3 min, while this c-fos expression is not observed when memory is extinguished in response to the context for 30 min, indicating that reconsolidation and extinction shows contrasting biochemical signatures in the hippocampus. Thus, c-fos expression in the hippocampus is thought to be a biochemical marker of reconsolidation. Similarly, in this manuscript, c-fos expression was observed when remote memory is reconsolidated in response to 10 min re-exposure, suggesting that this longer re-exposure induces reconsolidation but not extinction. We believe that these 3 lines of evidence suggest that longer re-exposure to the context (for 10min) does not contribute to memory extinction, but helps to make the memory hippocampus-dependent again and therefore freshly vulnerable to the effects of neurogenesis-induced forgetting. According to the suggestions from review, we revised text in the Discussion (second paragraph).</p><p>“In previous experiments we found that prolonged (10 min) context re-exposures may render even remote contextual fear memories labile and hippocampus-dependent (Suzuki et al., 2004). […] Taken together, our findings suggest that forgetting of remote contextual fear memory is enhanced by the increase in hippocampal neurogenesis only after extended behavioral “reminders”.”</p><p><italic>2) The increase in c-FOS seen in the hippocampus after longer re-exposure is interpreted as enabling &quot;remote memory to return to a hippocampus-dependent state&quot;. However, an alternative explanation could be that longer exposure to a previously familiar context generates a new memory, as opposed to reactivation of an old memory. This should be discussed. This may be what the authors are implying by pointing out the importance of whether the same hippocampal neurons are activated during the initial memory and the reactivation of the hippocampal memory by a prolonged exposure.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for your important comment. We agree with the suggestion from the reviewer. According to this suggestion, we now mention the possibility raised by the reviewer (see below).</p><p>In addition, we have already mentioned to importance to examine “whether the same hippocampal neurons are activated during the initial memory and the reactivation of the hippocampal memory by a prolonged exposure”, as “In the future, it will be important to determine whether the same hippocampal neurons that are incorporated into the memory engram at the initial fear conditioning are reactivated when the hippocampus is reactivated by long-time retrieval of remote memory” at the end of 5<sup>th</sup> paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>“Reconsolidation is suggested to be a process not only to maintain memory, but also to enhance and/or update memory (Nader et al., 2000; Dudai, 2002; Tronel et al., 2005; Fukushima et al., 2014). […] Additionally, the possibility still remains that the activation (but not reactivation) of hippocampus by longer re-exposure to the familiar context is required to generate new memory associated with this familiar context.”</p><p><italic>3) There is a concern that rodent PTSD models based solely on fear conditioning do not distinguish between a physiological response to a stressful event and the pathophysiological alterations that may more closely reflects a PTSD-like state (Desmedt et al. al Biol Psych 2015). Furthermore, it appears that neurogenesis-promoting treatments would only be effective for hippocampal dependent memories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A-B</xref>). In this regard, PSTD memories are probably much more complex than those acquired during contextual-fear conditioning.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for your critical comment. We absolutely agree with these comments, and now acknowledge the limitations of contextual fear as a model of PTSD. Specifically we now acknowledge that PTSD like state also should include other pathophysiological alterations of brain and other organs (and certainly goes much beyond the hippocampus). According to the suggestions from the reviewer, we added a sentence in the Discussion (last paragraph).</p><p>“In conclusion, we showed that forgetting of remote contextual fear memory was promoted by hippocampal neurogenesis following long (but not short) context reminders. […] Furthermore, it will be important to extend our findings to target hippocampus-independent traumatic memory since traumatic memory associated with PTSD must be more complex than contextual fear memory used in this study as the rodent PTSD model (Shin et al., 2006; Milad et al., 2007; Parsons et al., 2013; VanElzakker et al., 2014; Desmedt et al., 2015).”</p><p><italic>4) The treatments (memantine and voluntary exercise) do not completely abolish the fear memories (recent or remote), reducing conditioned freezing from ~50-60% to ~ 20-30% (the latter appears to be greater than the baseline/unconditioned freezing in most experiments). There should be some discussion of what this remaining memory represents, and whether it is due to remaining fear memory, sensitization, or non-hippocampal representations of fear.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for your critical comments. As the reviewer pointed out, the treatments with neurogenesis enhancers failed to completely abolish the fear memories. As suggested, this may be due to remaining fear memory that depends on brain regions other than hippocampus. However, previous studies have shown that similar low levels of freezing responses are observed when consolidation or reconsolidation of fear memory is disrupted by amnestic drugs or gene manipulations and when fear memory is extinguished. Therefore, in this manuscript, we concluded that significant forgetting was observed following the treatments with MEM or running, but that the memory is not completely erased. Nonetheless, we found that c-fos expression is not induced in the ACC and hippocampus of mice received MEM treatments after the retrieval test compared to control groups (CS-US group without MEM treatments and no CS group, data not shown), suggesting that the forgetting observed is quite profound (above baseline levels of freezing, but no activation of ACC by retrieval at remote time point). According to the suggestions from reviewer, we added a paragraph to the Discussion.</p><p>“In this study, hippocampal neurogenesis enhancers (MEM and running) failed to completely abolish fear memories. […] In addition, we found that c-fos expression was not induced in the ACC and hippocampus when c-fos expression was assessed after the retrieval test following the treatments with MEM for 4 weeks (data not shown), strongly suggesting that the MEM treatment induces forgetting of fear memory even though mice still showed low level of freezing.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
