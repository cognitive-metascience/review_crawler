Spindle abnormalities correlate with cancer progression in germ line-derived tumors. We discover a macromolecular complex between the scaffolding protein Gravin/AKAP12 and the mitotic kinases, Aurora A and Plk1, that is down regulated in human seminoma. Depletion of Gravin correlates with an increased mitotic index and disorganization of seminiferous tubules. Biochemical, super-resolution imaging, and enzymology approaches establish that this Gravin scaffold accumulates at the mother spindle pole during metaphase. Manipulating elements of the Gravin-Aurora A-Plk1 axis prompts mitotic delay and prevents appropriate assembly of astral microtubules to promote spindle misorientation. These pathological responses are conserved in seminiferous tubules from <italic>Gravin</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice where an overabundance of Oct3/4 positive germ line stem cells displays randomized orientation of mitotic spindles. Thus, we propose that Gravin-mediated recruitment of Aurora A and Plk1 to the mother (oldest) spindle pole contributes to the fidelity of symmetric cell division.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09384.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09384.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09384.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genetic material inside our cells is contained within structures called chromosomes. When a cell divides, these chromosomes are copied and then must be correctly divided between the two daughter cells so that each cell has a complete set of genetic material. The correct separation of the chromosomes depends on a structure called the mitotic spindle whose location in the cell also determines where the point of division will be.</p><p>Two structures called centrioles are associated with the mitotic spindle and help to organize and direct cell division. The cell carefully controls how these structures are inherited by the daughter cells. For example, when a stem cell divides to produce one stem cell and one cell of a different type, the older centriole can be inherited by the new stem cell. Incorrect placement of the spindle can disrupt this process and is linked to the progression of cancers that affect reproductive organs, such as testicular seminomas.</p><p>Here, Hehnly, Canton et al. used biochemical and microscopy techniques to study how the spindle is positioned in cells from patients with testicular seminoma tumors. The experiments reveal that a protein called Gravin is found in lower amounts in the tumor cells than in normal cells. In mice that lack Gravin, the cells in a region of the testicle called the seminiferous tubule divide more rapidly, which is a hallmark of cancer. Gravin accumulates at the end of the spindle where the older centriole is present. This protein acts as a scaffold that holds two enzymes called kinases that regulate cell division in place at the end of the spindle. In the stem cells of the testicle, these kinases also appear to help to correctly position the spindle by organizing the proteins that anchor this end of the spindle to the membrane.</p><p>Hehnly, Canton et al.'s findings suggest that Gravin helps to guard against errors occurring during cell division by recruiting two particular kinase enzymes to the mitotic spindle. A future challenge will be to identify the proteins that these kinases affect while anchored to the spindle.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09384.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09384.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>cell regulation</kwd><kwd>mitotic spindle</kwd><kwd>testicular cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK105542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA174527</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wordeman</surname><given-names>Linda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK054441</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM107355</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hehnly</surname><given-names>Heidi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM069429</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wordeman</surname><given-names>Linda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A protein kinase complex that is important for cell division is lost in testicular seminoma, which is a common cancer in men.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitotic cell division is a process whereby genetic material is duplicated, separated, and packaged to yield two daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nigg and Raff, 2009</xref>).

We now report that Gravin is depleted in proliferating germ line-derived tumors from several patients diagnosed with testicular seminoma.

Testicular germ line tumors are the most frequently diagnosed solid cancers in men aged 15–40 years.

Although seminoma screening and treatment is well understood, much less is known about the molecular events in germ line stem cells that underlie oncogenesis. Surprisingly, immunoblot analysis of clinical samples from three seminoma patients detected a 9.15-fold reduction in Gravin protein compared to adjacent tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

In normal testis, Gravin is uniformly distributed throughout all cell types of the seminiferous tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, green). In contrast, the anchoring protein is regionally distributed in seminoma sections and the fluorescent intensity of the Gravin signal is markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, green). These differential protein expression patterns are clearly evident in magnified images of the indicated insets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Moreover, counterstaining with the mitotic marker phospho-Ser 10-Histone 3B (p-H3B) indicated that a 4.88-fold decrease in Gravin was observed in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>).

First, immunoblot analysis detected Aurora A and Plk1 in Gravin immune complexes isolated from mitotic cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lane 6). Control experiments confirmed that the closely related Aurora B kinase does not interact with Gravin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 4). Conversely, the RII subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) constitutively interacts with Gravin throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 4 and 6). Second, conventional immunofluorescent techniques demonstrate that Aurora A (red), Plk1 (green), and p766-Gravin (blue) are concentrated at mitotic spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Control experiments confirmed that total Gravin (red) organizes at mitotic spindle poles with a subpopulation dispersed throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), whereas Aurora B localizes to the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Third, structured illumination microscopy (SIM, resolution ∼100 nm) revealed that p-Gravin, Aurora A, and Plk1 decorated a higher-order lattice-like structure at mitotic spindle poles reminiscent of pericentriolar material (PCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawo et al., 2012</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Lastly, a proximity ligation assay (PLA) was used to pinpoint p766-Gravin association with either kinase during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>). This approach combines antibody recognition with amplification of a DNA hetero-duplex to mark discrete protein–protein interaction pairs that reside within 40–60 nm of each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Samelson et al., 2015</xref>). Quantification of PLA puncta indicated that p766-Gravin/Aurora A sub-complexes was enhanced 3.86-fold during metaphase when compared to interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). The p766-Gravin-Plk1 sub-complex was enriched 10.34-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). Thus, we conclude that p766-Gravin scaffolds Aurora A with Plk1 at a PCM-like structure on mitotic spindle poles during metaphase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Clustering Aurora A and Plk1 at spindle poles requires Gravin</title><p>Since p766-Gravin, Aurora A, and Plk1 decorate mitotic spindle poles, we reasoned that the anchoring protein may actively constrain both enzymes at this location.

One aspect of this vital process is the formation of astral microtubules that project out from mitotic spindle poles to the cell cortex to regulate spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kotak and Gönczy, 2013</xref>). Super-resolution analysis by SIM revealed a near complete loss of astral microtubules protruding from the spindle poles of Gravin null MEFs when compared to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>).

Upon closer inspection, we noted that p766-Gravin was unequally distributed between the spindle poles of metaphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). A technique known as ground state depletion microscopy followed by individual molecule return (GSDIM) was used to rigorously evaluate this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fölling et al., 2008</xref>). On the basis of signal overlap with the mother centriole marker Cenexin, we were surprised to discover that components of the Gravin kinase scaffold were selectively enriched at this location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>).

Likewise, p766-Gravin/Plk1 PLA pairs were enriched 2.35-fold at the mother spindle pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

Surprisingly, the location of Plk1 changed upon shRNA-mediated gene silencing of Gravin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Plk1 now predominated at the daughter spindle pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). This unexpected finding demonstrates that Gravin governs the preferential recruitment of Aurora A and Plk1 to mother spindle poles, one of their appropriate sites of action during mitosis. Additional control experiments in HEK293 cells revealed that cellular levels of both kinases were unaltered in absence of Gravin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). This latter observation argues that ablation of Gravin in tissue culture cell lines instigates the displacement of both kinases from the spindle pole but may not affect the cellular levels of each enzyme. However, on the basis of our analysis of clinical samples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we propose that unidentified mitigating factors contribute to the mislocalization and depletion of both kinases in human tissue.</p><p>We reasoned that one consequence of the aforementioned result could be that differential localization of the Gravin scaffold to the mother spindle pole favors more robust assembly of astral microtubules. In order to test this hypothesis, we evaluated astral microtubule abundance, length, and ultrastructure at super-resolution using SIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–I</xref>). Pericentrin served as a universal spindle pole marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Centrobin staining was selectively detected daughter spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J</xref>). In wild-type MEFs, we observed protrusion of astral microtubules from both spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). However, upon quantification of three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed SIM images, it was evident that astral microtubules protruding from the mother spindle pool were longer than those emanating from the daughter spindle pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Next, we investigated this process in Gravin null MEFs to ascertain whether the anchoring protein or its binding partners influence this phenomenon. Notably in Gravin null MEFs, the length of astral microtubules protruding from the mother spindle pool was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Therefore, on the basis of these findings, we can propose that Gravin or elements of its signaling scaffold contribute to the assembly of astral microtubules. Additional rescue experiments with a Gravin mutant (T766A) that is unable to interact with Plk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canton et al., 2012</xref>) were achieved at a low frequency but did not restore robust protrusion of astral microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1K</xref>).

In vitro binding studies using purified GST-Gravin fragments mapped a central region of the anchoring protein (amino acids 451 to 900) that directly interacts with Aurora A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> top panel, lane 4).

Mutation of Thr766 to Ala in the context of the Gravin 451-900 fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) created a cell-based ‘Aurora A disruptor’ that antagonizes Aurora A anchoring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) without impacting Plk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canton et al., 2012</xref>).

Therefore, we reasoned that manipulation of the Gravin scaffold could affect spindle orientation during cell division. To test this hypothesis, we used a spindle tilt assay to measure the angle of each mitotic spindle relative to the substratum ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delaval et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hehnly and Doxsey, 2014</xref>) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Ectopic expression of the Aurora A disruptor perturbed spindle orientation. Mislocalization of Aurora A promoted a 20° misalignment of the mitotic spindle when compared to control cells transfected with empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). Most control spindles were parallel to the substratum (averaging around 5–10°; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>). Yet in Gravin-depleted cells, the perturbation of spindle orientation was 40° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>). Notably, these more severe spindle angle defects were rescued upon expression of the mouse Gravin ortholog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>). In contrast, spindle angle defects were only partially rescued upon expression of the Plk1-binding defective Gravin T766A mutant (angles averaging around 20°; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>). The magnitude of this partial rescue is reminiscent of the results obtained upon mislocalization of Aurora A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Further support was provided upon analysis of 3D reconstructed images collected from wild-type and Gravin null MEFs. In wild-type MEFs, the alignment of the mitotic spindle was parallel to the substratum as assessed by the positioning of the spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>, left).

Self-renewing, parallel stem cell division produces two daughter stem cells, whereas perpendicular stem cell division yields one differentiating daughter cell and one stem cell ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siller and Doe, 2009</xref>] <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Basement membrane sections of the seminiferous tubules were identified with the stem cell marker Oct3/4 to investigate the angle of spindle orientation in germ line stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, magenta). Mitotic spindle orientation was established by counterstaining with tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, green). Indeed, two populations of dividing stem cells were observed: those with a mitotic spindle perpendicular (∼90°) to the basement membrane and those with a mitotic spindle parallel (∼10°) to the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Staining for p766-Gravin (green) and DNA (blue) confirmed that the phosphorylated anchoring protein was present in the few cells undergoing mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>, top and lower left panels). In contrast, mitotic cells from Gravin knockout mice displayed a randomized mitotic spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>, lower right panel). Importantly, this increased incidence of spindle angle randomization was evident in mitotic Gravin knockout germ line stem cells (average angle of 47.67°, n = 98; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). These findings indicate that interrupting spindle polarity may adversely affect the development within seminiferous tubules in Gravin knockout mice.</p><p>On the basis of our cell-based and biochemical studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3, 4</xref>, we postulated that the spindle misorientation phenotype observed in vivo is a consequence of displacing Plk1 from mitotic spindle poles. Therefore, we established the subcellular distribution of this kinase in seminiferous tubule sections from wild-type and Gravin knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I–L</xref>). Acetylated tubulin was used as a marker for mitotic spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>, left panels; red). In wild-type sections, the Plk1 signal was prominent at mitotic spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>, top mid panel; green). Conversely, in Gravin knockout sections, the Plk1 signal was more disperse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>, lower mid panel; green). Examination of representative cells from both genotypes at higher magnification best illustrates this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>). Line scan analysis detected an asymmetric distribution of Plk1 at one spindle pole in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref>, top panel). Conversely, a more uniform distribution of this kinase was detected in Gravin knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref>, lower panel). Quantitative analysis of multiple cells confirmed these findings further suggesting that Gravin functions to preferentially anchor Plk1 at one spindle pole in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>). Unfortunately, antibody compatibility issues precluded counterstaining with mother spindle pool markers.</p><p>Two possible outcomes can arise from the loss of Gravin expression in stem cells. Existing stem cell populations that undergo misoriented division may expand exponentially. Alternatively, germ line stem cells may prematurely differentiate thereby diminishing the total stem cell population. In order to delineate between these two possibilities, we counted the number Oct3/4-positive cells in seminiferous tubule sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8M</xref>). A 3.82-fold increase in Oct3/4-positive cells was observed in Gravin knockout sections (n = 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8M,N</xref>). Thus, randomized spindle angles and the concomitant over-proliferation of germ line stem cells may underlie the pathological abnormalities observed in Gravin knockout seminiferous tubule organization as well as human seminoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig8">Figures 1, 8</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Aurora A and Plk1 are two kinases generally considered to act together to promote spindle pole maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hannak et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee and Rhee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joukov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kong et al., 2014</xref>). We have discovered an additional role for both kinases in the establishment of spindle orientation during mitotic progression. A key element of our finding is that both active kinases must be associated with the scaffolding protein Gravin to fulfill this ancillary function. By combining biochemical approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) with quantitative super-resolution imaging and enzymology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3, 4</xref>), we have uncovered a unique kinase complex that assembles at the mother spindle pole during metaphase. Formation of a Gravin-Aurora A-Plk1 scaffold at this location may facilitate signal relay as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> to drive the spatial and temporal phosphorylation pattern of as yet unknown mitotic substrates.</p><p>Spindle maturation occurs during the transition from prophase to metaphase when dynein-mediated transport of PCM along the microtubules culminates in the formation of a mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Purohit et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mahen and Venkitaraman, 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed an asymmetric distribution of the Gravin kinase scaffold at the mother spindle pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Clustering of these enzymes at this location can either catalyze the efficient assembly of the PCM or alternatively coordinate the assembly of astral microtubules that orient the mitotic spindle. The super-resolution imaging analysis of Gravin null MEFs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> argues strongly for the latter as these cells are deficient in astral microtubules but contain equal amounts of a canonical PCM protein, pericentrin ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doxsey et al., 1994</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,G</xref>). This notion is also consistent with the anomalous spindle tilt angles that were measured in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These observations were further validated in vivo upon analysis of murine seminiferous tubule sections lacking Gravin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>One new concept that emerges from our studies is that Gravin-mediated clustering of Aurora A and Plk1 at the mother spindle pole provides a means to more precisely regulate symmetric cell division. We offer four lines of inquiry to support this new mechanism. First, data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref> indicate that loss of Gravin impacts the protrusion of astral microtubules. Second, data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> show that symmetric cell division is lost in Gravin null MEFs. Third, we measure increased mitotic spindle angles (&gt;20°) in Gravin shRNA-treated cells compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–E</xref>). Fourth, a logical and important mechanistic extension of this latter observation is our finding that astral microtubules are lost from the mother spindle poles in Gravin null MEFs. Moreover, we postulate that the sequestering these enzymes at the mother spindle pole ensures that each kinase is optimally positioned to play a role in the regulation of astral microtubule protrusion, a process that influences the correct orientation of mitotic spindles during cell division. This mechanism is compatible with two recent reports indicating that signaling events downstream Plk1 modulate the correct orientation mitotic spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanafusa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan et al., 2015</xref>). However, a vital new piece of this puzzle, uncovered solely from our work, is that Gravin functions as the anchor for these enzymes.</p><p>Another theme emerging from the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> is that the orientation of the mitotic spindle becomes increasingly important during stem cell division. These events influence cell fate determination and tissue organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siller and Doe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gillies and Cabernard, 2011</xref>). In keeping with this notion, Gravin knockout mice exhibit an increase in Oct3/4, a marker for stem cells within the seminiferous tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8M,N</xref>). This is evocative of clinical studies that detect a marked increase in Oct3/4-positive cells in solid-state tumors including seminoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singh et al., 2011</xref>). These clinical results are entirely consistent with the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> depicting a loss in tissue morphology observed in tissue sections from seminoma patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). At the molecular level, we also detect decreased Gravin, Aurora A, and Plk1 levels in several samples collected from seminoma patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Therefore, we postulate that abnormalities in Gravin expression that promote mislocalization of Aurora A and Plk1 contributes to defects in orientation of mitotic spindles to potentiate seminoma progression. However, Gravin knockout mice do not develop seminomas, yet some of the aforementioned abnormalities are evident in these animals. For example, these animals have difficultly breeding and upon aging display a tendency to develop prostate hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akakura et al., 2008</xref>). Both of these phenotypes may be indicative of developmental defects in polarized cell division. Therefore, we speculate that perturbation of Gravin-mediated signaling events during mitosis may promote a chronic decrease in organization of the seminiferous tubules with concomitant impairment of reproductive viability. Finally, when the mouse studies are considered in the context of our biochemical analysis and imaging of clinical samples, we can conclude that Gravin constrains Aurora A and Plk1 in an asymmetric manner to control spindle orientation during mitosis. Thus, we identify and define a new macromolecular signaling scaffold that drives stem cell maintenance and cell differentiation in seminiferous tubules.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>The following antibodies were used: mouse α-tubulin, FITC-conjugated α-tubulin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, United States), rabbit anti-pericentrin [M8; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doxsey et al., 1994</xref>)], goat anti-Aurora A (Sigma), rabbit anti-p-Aurora A T288 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, United States), mouse anti-Aurora B (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, United States), human anti-CREST (Antibodies Incorporated, 15–234), rabbit anti-cenexin (Protein Tech Group, Chicago, IL, United States), rabbit p-Gravin T766A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canton et al., 2012</xref>), mouse Gravin (Sigma; clone JP74), mouse anti-GAPDH (Sigma; GAPDH71.1), mouse anti-phospho-S10 Histone H3 (abcam; ab14955), rabbit anti-Plk1 (Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-Plk1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, United States), mouse anti-Plk1 (Millipore; 35–206, Billerica, MA, United States), rabbit anti p-Plk1T210 (Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-Flag and Flag-HRP (Sigma), mouse anti-Par3 (Sigma), rabbit anti-Oct3/4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), mouse anti-centrin (clone 20H5, EMD Millipore), mouse anti-acetylated tubulin (Sigma), mouse anti-centrobin (Abcam).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Hehnly et al. report that Gravin is required for proper spindle orientation in germ line stem cells during spermatogenesis and is depleted in seminomas. Using a combination of techniques in a variety of cell types, the authors have demonstrated that Gravin interacts with Aurora A and Plk1, and recruits these kinases at the mother spindle pole for proper assembly of astral microtubules. The data presented are interesting and the manuscript is well organized. However, the mechanisms by which Gravin scaffold accumulation at the mother spindle pole ensures proper spindle orientation in germline stem cells remain unclear.</p><p>1) The authors propose that Gravin ensures symmetric, but not asymmetric, cell division (Introduction). However, it is unclear whether Gravin is critical for successful symmetric or asymmetric stem cell division. First, Oct3/4 positive stem cells are increased in Gravin<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>). As symmetric stem cell division produces two daughter stem cells (subsection “Gravin contributes to spindle orientation of germline stem cells during spermatogenesis”), defects in parallel symmetric cell division would lead to detachment of one daughter cell from the basal membrane and an expected decrease in stem cell population. Second, if Gravin is required for symmetric cell division, the authors need to propose a mechanistic model by which Gravin-mediated asymmetric accumulation of Aurora A and Plk1 at the mother spindle pole contributes to a parallel-symmetric division. As mentioned in the Introduction, the mother centrosome contributes to the perpendicular asymmetric cell division in Drosophila germ line stem cell by linking the mother centrosome to the stem cell niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamashita et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>2) The authors demonstrate that there are two populations of dividing germ line stem cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K and 6M</xref>. It is critical to analyze which populations contain phosphorylated Gravin, although <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref> shows that p766-Gravin signals are detected in symmetrically dividing self-renewing cells. In addition, it is important to analyze if p766-Gravin accumulates at the mother spindle pole in the germ line stem cells similar to MEFs.</p><p>3) The authors demonstrate that p766-Gravin, Aurora A and Plk1 accumulate at the mother spindle pole in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, the exact contribution of spindle pole asymmetry to astral microtubule formation is still unclear. The authors need to compare the astral microtubules derived from mother and daughter spindle poles, respectively, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>.</p><p>4) The authors conclude that Gravin is important for mitotic progression. Gravin<sup>−/−</sup> MEF grew more slowly than wt MEF. In contrast, analysts of seminiferous tubule sections demonstrated cell with increased mitotic index. The authors need to clarify these observations – do both cell types grow slowly in the absence of gravin and the increased mitotic index simply a reflection of a mitotic delay. Or does Gravin have opposite phenotypes in the cells?</p><p>5) The immunoblot analysis of tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) shows loss of Gravin, but also loss of Plk1 and AuroraA. Are these related events? Do Gravin<sup>−/−</sup> MEF show decreased Plk1 and AuroraA? If so, does the loss of total protein explain the decreased spindle pole localization? Does loss of protein expression account for the role of Gravin to mediate interactions between Plk1 and AuroraA.</p><p>6) The rescue experiments using the T766A mutant of Gravin should be extended to demonstrate that it is unable to recruit Plk1 to the mother spindle pole to regulate astral microtubules.</p><p>7) The authors state data as xxx {plus minus} yyy in several places in the text. The numbers should be defined. Is xxx a mean or a median or something else? Is yyy the SD, SEM or something else? Also, do the statistics justify the precision of the numbers provided – for example, 64.57 {plus minus} 4.09 (in the first paragraph of subsection “Gravin anchoring of Aurora A and Plk1 is required for mitotic progression”).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09384.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors propose that Gravin ensures symmetric, but not asymmetric, cell division (Introduction).

Our contention is that loss of Gravin favors unregulated spindle orientation. This promotes an increased likelihood of randomized cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>; orange points). This concept is evident upon the analysis of germline stem cell populations in seminiferous tubule tissue sections from wildtype and <italic>Gravin</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. In wildtype cells quantitative analysis of tissue sections stained for tubulin reveals two distinct populations of spindle organization. In contrast, we detect a randomized spindle orientation in Gravin null tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8F and H</xref>). On the basis of these results we reason that loss of Gravin induces a higher incidence of cells that retain a stem cell phenotype.</p><p>In addition we have performed new experiments showing that that division angles are randomized in Gravin<sup>−/−</sup> MEFs as compared to wildtype controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F, G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). These videos underscore the quantitation of spindle angles measured in control and Gravin shRNA treated cells as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, E</xref>. These new data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> has been added as supplemental material. These data are discussed in subsection “The Gravin macromolecular complex is required for spindle orientation.”</p><p><italic>Second, if Gravin is required for symmetric cell division, the authors need to propose a mechanistic model by which Gravin-mediated asymmetric accumulation of Aurora A and Plk1 at the mother spindle pole contributes to a parallel-symmetric division. As mentioned in the Introduction, the mother centrosome contributes to the perpendicular asymmetric cell division in Drosophila germ line stem cell by linking the mother centrosome to the stem cell niche (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55"><italic>Yamashita et al., 2007</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>This is a valid point. There are now four lines of inquiry to support our notion that the Gravin kinase scaffold contributes to symmetric cell division. First, data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F, G</xref> indicate that loss of Gravin impacts the protrusion of astral microtubules. Second, data added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> show that symmetric cell division, is lost in Gravin<sup>−/−</sup> MEFs. Third, we measure increased mitotic spindle angles (&gt; 20°) in Gravin shRNA treated cells as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-E</xref>). Fourth, a logical and mechanistic extension of this latter observation was to establish if astral microtubules are preferentially lost from the mother spindle poles in Gravin<sup>−/−</sup> MEFs. New studies presented <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F-H</xref> measure a reduction in astral microtubule length from the mother spindle pole as compared to analogous structures protruding from the daughter spindle pole in these cells.</p><p>Thus, our combined biochemical, cellular and super-resolution imaging strategy allows us to propose that Gravin preferentially anchors two mitotic kinases, Plk1 and Aurora A, at the mother spindle pole. Moreover, we postulate that the sequestering of these enzymes at the mother spindle pole ensures that each kinase is optimally positioned to play a role in the regulation of astral microtubule protrusion, a process that influences the correct orientation of mitotic spindles during cell division.</p><p>This mechanism is also consistent with two recent reports (now cited in the revised manuscript) indicating that signaling events downstream of Plk1 modulate the correct orientation of mitotic spindles. However a vital new piece of this puzzle, solely uncovered from our work, is that Gravin functions as the anchor for these enzymes. Interpretation of the new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is introduced to the Results section. A succinct discourse of our proposed mechanism for Gravin action in “symmetric cell division” has been incorporated into the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) The authors demonstrate that there are two populations of dividing germ line stem cells in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6K and 6M</italic></xref><italic>. It is critical to analyze which populations contain phosphorylated Gravin, although</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6L</italic></xref> <italic>shows that p766-Gravin signals are detected in symmetrically dividing self-renewing cells. In addition, it is important to analyze if p766-Gravin accumulates at the mother spindle pole in the germ line stem cells similar to MEFs</italic>.</p><p>We have responded to the reviewers' suggestions in three ways: i) p766-Gravin is present in all germline stem cells and wildtype MEFs during mitosis, irrespective of which direction either cell-type divides. To emphasize this point we have included an additional representative image of p766-Gravin in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref> and modified the text (please see the subsection “Gravin contributes to spindle orientation of germline stem cells during spermatogenesis”).</p><p>ii) Perhaps not surprisingly, the asymmetric distribution of p766-Gravin between the mother and daughter spindle poles is most evident upon analysis by super resolution microscopy. In keeping with this statement we now include a comparison between data collected by conventional wide field microscopy and structured illumination microscopy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1C</xref>. Likewise ground state depletion microscopy provides a much better resolution as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A and 1B</xref>.</p><p>iii) Finally, we wish to point out that super resolution microscopy is technically challenging and often prohibitive when attempted on paraffin embedded tissue samples such as the sections used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>. Therefore a more feasible approach was to conduct super resolution analysis in wildtype and Gravin<sup>−/−</sup> MEFs. We contend these cell lines represent a valid model system that recapitulates elements of the in vivo environment. Particularly since we observe the same randomization of mitotic spindle angles upon loss or depletion of Gravin in all systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A-G</xref>, new <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8F, H</xref>). This new information is discussed in subsection “The Gravin macromolecular complex is required for spindle orientation”.</p><p><italic>3) The authors demonstrate that p766-Gravin, Aurora A and Plk1 accumulate at the mother spindle pole in MEFs (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3A</italic></xref><italic>). However, the exact contribution of spindle pole asymmetry to astral microtubule formation is still unclear. The authors need to compare the astral microtubules derived from mother and daughter spindle poles, respectively, as shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3F</italic></xref>.</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion, we have quantified the astral microtubule length and number at each spindle pole in wildtype and Gravin<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F-I</xref>). Using nanoscopic microscopy (SIM) techniques we detect a marked decrease in the number and length of astral microtubules at the mother spindle pole in Gravin<sup>−/−</sup> cells. Conversely, there is minimal change in astral microtubules at the daughter spindle pole. These new findings are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F-I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1K</xref>. These new data are discussed in the subsection “Clustering Aurora A and Plk1 at spindle poles requires Gravin”.</p><p><italic>4) The authors conclude that Gravin is important for mitotic progression. Gravin</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> <italic>MEF grew more slowly than wt MEF. In contrast, analysts of seminiferous tubule sections demonstrated cell with increased mitotic index. The authors need to clarify these observations – do both cell types grow slowly in the absence of gravin and the increased mitotic index simply a reflection of a mitotic delay. Or does Gravin have opposite phenotypes in the cells?</italic></p><p>We have added additional data to address this point. Time-lapse video microscopy of Gravin shRNA treated cells reveal a delayed progression through mitosis when compared to cells treated with shRNA controls. This information is now included as <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>. This new live cell imaging data is consistent with an increased mitotic index upon the depletion of Gravin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canton et al., 2012</xref>). These findings are also comparable to the increase in the mitotic index measured in murine Gravin<sup>−/−</sup> seminiferous tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1I-K</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) The immunoblot analysis of tumors (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref><italic>) shows loss of Gravin, but also loss of Plk1 and AuroraA. Are these related events? Do Gravin</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> <italic>MEF show decreased Plk1 and AuroraA? If so, does the loss of total protein explain the decreased spindle pole localization? Does loss of protein expression account for the role of Gravin to mediate interactions between Plk1 and AuroraA.</italic></p><p>Immunoblot data of clinical samples from seminoma patients presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A and B</xref> detect reduced levels of Gravin and concomitant reductions in the signals for Aurora A and Plk1. In an attempt to respond to the reviewers' request we further explore this phenomena in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and human HEK293 cells. These experiments were only partially successful.</p><p>Despite eleven independent attempts, immunobot detection of the murine Plk1 and Aurora A orthologs in MEFs was sporadic. A majority of the time we were unable to detect either kinase by immunoblot. Yet on the few occasions when we were able to detect any Plk1 signal in mitotic Gravin<sup>−/−</sup> MEFs the data were inconclusive. The Plk1 immunoblot signal was reduced once, constant in one instance, and slightly increased in the final attempts. Thus, we were forced to conclude that although the Aurora A and Plk1 antibodies are reliable for immunofluorescent detection of the human and murine kinases, they are less cross reactive with murine orthologs when used for immunoblot detection. As a backup approach we monitored the levels of the human Aurora A and Plk1 upon shRNA deletion of Gravin in HEK293 cells.</p><p>New data shows that gene silencing of Gravin had little or no effect on the levels of Aurora A or Plk1 during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1H</xref>, lane 2, middle panels). In addition we have modified the text stating: “Additional control experiments in HEK293 cells revealed that cellular levels of both kinases were unaltered in absence of Gravin. This latter observation argues that ablation of Gravin in tissue culture cell lines instigates the displacement of both kinases from the spindle pole but may not affect the cellular levels of each enzyme. However, on the basis of our analysis of clinical samples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> we propose that unidentified mitigating factors contribute to the mislocalization and depletion of both kinases in human tissue”.</p><p><italic>6) The rescue experiments using the T766A mutant of Gravin should be extended to demonstrate that it is unable to recruit Plk1 to the mother spindle pole to regulate astral microtubules</italic>.</p><p>We have previously shown that the Gravin T766A mutant is unable to bind Plk1 in a variety of cell types. This information has been added to the text and the appropriate papers citied. In addition new data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1K</xref> demonstrates that expression of the Plk1 binding mutant Gravin T766A in Gravin<sup>−/−</sup> MEFs is unable to rescue the number of astral microtubules protruding form the mitotic spindle. Rather, rescue with this Plk1-anchoring defective mutant may exacerbate the astral microtubule phenotype. These data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1K</xref> and discussed in the subsection “Clustering Aurora A and Plk1 at spindle poles requires Gravin”.</p><p><italic>7) The authors state data as xxx {plus minus} yyy in several places in the text. The numbers should be defined. Is xxx a mean or a median or something else? Is yyy the SD, SEM or something else? Also, do the statistics justify the precision of the numbers provided – for example, 64.57 {plus minus} 4.09 (in the first paragraph of subsection “Gravin anchoring of Aurora A and Plk1 is required for mitotic progression”)</italic>.</p><p>We have clarified these points. In all cases where a bar graph is presented or where a scatter plot is presented XXX represents the mean and the +/- demonstrates the range in standard error of the mean. We have checked all the exact means added to the text and made sure they are consistent with the data presented. In the cases where we present a Box and Whiskers plot, the box extends from the 25th to 75th percentiles using a standard method of computation via Prism software. The line in the middle of the box is plotted as the median.</p></body></sub-article></article>
