emitted in vast quantities into the atmosphere, with substantial effects on global carbon cycling. Yet, the molecular mechanisms regulating the balance between volatile and non-volatile isoprenoid production remain unknown. Isoprenoids are synthesised via sequential condensation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) to dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), with volatile isoprenoids containing fewer isopentenyl subunits. The DMAPP:IPP ratio could affect the balance between volatile and non-volatile isoprenoids, but the plastidic DMAPP:IPP ratio is generally believed to be similar across different species. Here we demonstrate that the ratio of DMAPP:IPP produced by hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate reductase (HDR/IspH), the final step of the plastidic isoprenoid production pathway, is not fixed. Instead, this ratio varies greatly across HDRs from phylogenetically distinct plants, correlating with isoprenoid production patterns. Our findings suggest that adaptation of HDR plays a previously unrecognised role in determining in vivo carbon availability for isoprenoid emissions, directly shaping global biosphere-atmosphere interactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>isoprenoids</kwd><kwd>BVOC</kwd><kwd>MEP pathway</kwd><kwd>Isoprene</kwd><kwd>HDR</kwd><kwd>monoterpenes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP140103514</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nielsen</surname><given-names>Lars K</given-names></name><name><surname>Vickers</surname><given-names>Claudia E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF10CC1016517</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schrübbers</surname><given-names>Lars</given-names></name><name><surname>Wulff</surname><given-names>Tune</given-names></name><name><surname>Sommer</surname><given-names>Morten O A</given-names></name><name><surname>Nielsen</surname><given-names>Lars K</given-names></name><name><surname>Bongers</surname><given-names>Mareike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-PEOPLE-2013-IOF.

The effects of isoprenoid emissions may be exacerbated by climate change and shifts in land use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peñuelas and Staudt, 2010</xref>), warranting a better understanding of how plants accomplish and regulate these vast emissions.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Simplified scheme of the plastidic MEP pathway, important volatile isoprenoids, and their atmospheric reactions.</title><p>The MEP pathway makes IPP and DMAPP simultaneously through the action of HDR (pink box), and produces the bulk of volatile isoprenoids, contributing &gt;80 % of total BVOCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sindelarova et al., 2014</xref>) . Non-volatile isoprenoids are essential and synthesised by all organisms, while volatile isoprenoid production is non-essential and highly species-dependent. The cytosolic MVA pathway contributes most sesquiterpenes (&lt;3 % of BVOCs), but is omitted here for clarity.

Two non-homologous metabolic pathways produce DMAPP and IPP in plants: the cytosolic mevalonic acid (MVA) and the plastidic methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways, the latter contributing almost all volatile isoprenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pulido et al., 2012</xref>). The final step of the MEP pathway is catalyzed by the enzyme hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate reductase (HDR/IspH), which produces both IPP and DMAPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Isoprenoid chain length is initially determined by how many units of IPP are condensed with one molecule of DMAPP, before terpene synthases and other modifying enzymes convert these intermediates into isoprenoids. The resulting compounds are classified by carbon chain length.</p><p>In plants, longer-chain isoprenoids (C<sub>15</sub> and higher) serve many essential roles, e.g. as membrane components and parts of the photosynthetic apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pulido et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Short-chain isoprenoids (C<sub>5</sub>, C<sub>10</sub>, and some C<sub>15</sub> compounds) are volatile under physiological conditions, and their functions are generally not essential for plant survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vickers et al., 2009</xref>). It is currently unknown how plants control carbon allocation between short-chain and long-chain isoprenoids in the chloroplast. While the demand for essential isoprenoids (for example, photosynthetic pigments) is assumed to be relatively similar across plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Monson et al., 2013</xref>), different species produce markedly different amounts of non-essential, short-chain volatile isoprenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wiedinmyer et al., 2020</xref>). For example, some oak (<italic>Quercus</italic>) species produce vast amounts of isoprene, while closely related oaks produce little or none at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wiedinmyer et al., 2020</xref>). Synthesis of isoprenoids with different chain lengths requires different DMAPP:IPP substrate ratios. Much more IPP than DMAPP is needed for long-chain isoprenoid production, so presumably high relative IPP concentrations are necessary for chain elongation while an excess of DMAPP and insufficient IPP could favour short-chain isoprenoid production. Isoprene synthase (IspS) uses only DMAPP, but not IPP, as a substrate.</p><p>Volatile isoprenoid emissions can represent a significant loss of carbon; for example, up to 20% of recently fixed carbon can be emitted as isoprene in high-emitting plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sharkey and Loreto, 1993</xref>). Isoprene synthase (IspS) has a high <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> for its substrate DMAPP (0.5–8 mM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">BRENDA, 2020</xref>); despite this, it successfully competes with prenyl phosphate synthases, which typically have <italic>K</italic><sub>M(DMAPP)</sub> values 10- to 100-fold lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">BRENDA, 2020</xref>). Similarly, monoterpene synthases, which also show lower affinity for the substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">BRENDA, 2020</xref>), compete with downstream prenyl phosphate synthases. Hence, the relative abundance of DMAPP may determine the balance between volatile and non-volatile isoprenoids.</p><p>Here we examined HDR as a potential mechanism to provide variability in the DMAPP:IPP ratio. Previous studies in diverse organisms (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the bacterium <italic>Aquifex aeolicus,</italic> red pepper chromoplasts, and cultured tobacco cells) all found that HDR produces DMAPP:IPP ratios between 1:4 and 1:6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rohdich et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altincicek et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tritsch et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, it has been assumed that HDR has a fixed product ratio of about 1:5. However, none of these species produce significant amounts of volatile isoprenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wiedinmyer et al., 2020</xref>). Isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI) interconverts DMAPP and IPP, but the reaction is slow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jonnalagadda et al., 2012</xref>) and IDI is rate-limiting for isoprenoid production generally, including isoprene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vickers et al., 2014</xref>). We hypothesised that HDR enzymes from species that emit large amounts of short-chain volatile isoprenoids produce a higher ratio of DMAPP to IPP, which could support production of volatiles like isoprene.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We selected <italic>HDR</italic> genes from the bacterium <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Synechococcus sp.</italic> strain PCC 7002 (a photosynthetic prokaryote) and eight species from diverse taxa of the plant kingdom (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Many plants harbour more than one annotated <italic>HDR</italic> gene, some of which may be pseudogenes. Therefore, we first identified functional HDR genes by their ability to complement an otherwise lethal knockout of the <italic>ispH/HDR</italic> gene in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altincicek et al., 2001</xref>).

Taken together, these data demonstrate that different HDR enzymes produce vastly different DMAPP:IPP ratios, with some plant HDRs producing a ratio significantly shifted towards more DMAPP than previously recognized.</p><p>To test whether an increased in vivo DMAPP:IPP ratio would favour isoprene production, we replaced the lycopene pathway with an overexpressed isoprene synthase (IspS) as a metabolic sink. A high DMAPP:IPP ratio was indeed closely associated with isoprene production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

While the absolute values shifted towards DMAPP (left y-axis; lycopene requires 6 IPP and 2 DMAPP) or IPP (right y-axis; isoprene is made only from DMAPP) depending on downstream requirements, the relative difference between HDRs remained similar, demonstrating that our experimental setup captures representative differences between the enzymes.</p><p>Isoprene was not produced in the presence of <italic>Theobroma cacao, Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>or <italic>E. coli</italic> HDR (all species that do not emit short-chain isoprenoids), presumably because the available DMAPP was insufficient for IspS to compete with downstream enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

Our data indicate that a high DMAPP:IPP ratio is a necessary, but not a sufficient requirement for volatile isoprenoid emission. This places HDR at a key junction in the evolution of isoprene emission, a trait that appeared and disappeared several times across the plant kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dani et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p><italic>Picea sitchensis</italic> (Sitka spruce) is a coniferous gymnosperm that emits both isoprene and monoterpenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayward et al., 2004</xref>), but contrary to our expectation <italic>Ps</italic>HDR1 produced the highest relative amount of IPP and showed very low isoprene production in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>). Recently, the HDR from another gymnosperm, <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> (<italic>Gb</italic>HDR1), was shown to produce an even lower DMAPP to IPP ratio in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shin et al., 2017</xref>). Most sequenced gymnosperms have two or more HDR isoforms which fall into two distinct classes based on sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, transcriptional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Celedon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2009</xref>) suggest that gymnosperm Type II <italic>HDRs</italic> are particularly abundant at the site of monoterpene-rich resin formation and are generally expressed at higher levels than Type I <italic>HDRs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Celedon et al., 2017</xref>) (such as <italic>PsHDR1</italic> and <italic>GbHDR1</italic>). It was therefore tempting to speculate that HDR adaptation in gymnosperms has resulted in paralogues with complementary functions: Type I HDRs, which primarily produce IPP, show basal expression throughout the plant, and are important for long-chain isoprenoid production; and Type II HDRs, which primarily produce DMAPP and are expressed where short-chain isoprenoids are made. This prompted us to investigate the Type II HDR from <italic>P. sitchensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–f</xref>).</p><p><italic>Ps</italic>HDR2 failed in our initial complementation assay (data not shown), most likely due to toxicity as no metabolic sink was present for IPP/DMAPP. Indeed, even in the presence of a sink, overexpression of <italic>Ps</italic>HDR2 reduced <italic>E. coli</italic> growth rate by about 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), a level of toxicity exceeding that of other high DMAPP-producing HDRs. Interestingly, <italic>Ps</italic>HDR2 produced a &gt; 10 fold excess of DMAPP over IPP, while <italic>Ps</italic>HDR1 had a ratio shifted towards more IPP (DMAPP:IPP = 0.447 +/- 0.19; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). <italic>Ps</italic>HDR2 also enabled higher isoprene production than <italic>Ps</italic>HDR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), albeit at a lower yield than the other high DMAPP-producing enzymes, which is most likely an effect of the high toxicity in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The complementary product ratios of <italic>Ps</italic>HDR1 and <italic>Ps</italic>HDR2 strongly suggest functional specialization of these genes, making them paralogues in <italic>P. sitchensis</italic>.</p><p>While many plants encode more than one <italic>HDR</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), these homologues are often closely related and thus likely arose from relatively recent large-scale genome duplications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saladié et al., 2014</xref>). In gymnosperms, the two HDR homologues are phylogenetically more distant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and likely define functionally specialised paralogues. Hence, we propose that two different strategies might have been employed to adapt HDR to isoprenoid production spectra: either using a single HDR and shifting the DMAPP:IPP ratio to allow production of specific isoprenoid profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), or having two functionally distinct HDRs each dedicated to the synthesis of one isomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Whether adaptation of HDR is a result of a change in the demand for DMAPP, or whether it is a driver of its release as isoprene and other volatile isoprenoids, is a fascinating question that remains to be answered.</p><p>The discovery of HDR enzymes with different product ratios has important implications for heterologous production of industrially valuable isoprenoids such as biofuels, fragrances and pharmaceuticals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vickers, 2015</xref>) in engineered microorganisms. We have shown that only certain HDR enzymes enable production of isoprene in our engineered <italic>E. coli</italic>, and our data indicate that the choice of HDR is important to ensure availability of DMAPP and IPP at appropriate relative concentrations to achieve balanced pathway flux towards the product of interest and to avoid DMAPP toxicity. The presented LC-MS/MS method for separation and absolute quantification of the two isomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) proved crucial for our discovery, and will enable a deeper understanding of the processes regulating isoprenoid biosynthesis in nature and biotechnology.</p><p>Demands from downstream metabolism may determine IPP and DMAPP requirements, and could form an evolutionary driver for enzymatic activities that impact their ratio. Our data suggest that the adaptation of HDR to generate different DMAPP:IPP ratios allows for the production of large amounts of short-chain isoprenoids in certain species or tissues. Our findings illuminate the molecular mechanism underlying how plants emit isoprene and suggest a central role for HDR in determining the spectrum of isoprenoids produced by plants, including isoprenoid BVOCs. Unravelling the mechanism by which plants distribute carbon between volatile and non-volatile isoprenoids will help resolve the complex interplay between BVOC emissions, land-use management and climate change.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td><italic>ispH/HDR</italic></td><td>NCBI ‘Gene’</td><td>Gene_ID:944777; EcoGene:EG11081; ECK0030; lytB</td><td>hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate reductase</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> W</td><td>ATCC</td><td>ATCC:9637</td><td>obtained from L.

Separation of the structural isomers IPP and DMAPP was achieved by adapting a method from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Köhling et al. (2014)</xref>, by injecting 5 μl onto an Astec Cyclobond I2000 chiral HPLC column (250 mm ×4.6 mm; 5 μm particle size) (Sigma Aldrich) with an injection loop size of 2 µL. The column oven temperature was controlled and maintained at 35°C throughout the acquisition and the mobile phases were as follows: 50 mM aqueous ammonium acetate (eluent A) and 90:10 (% v/v) acetonitrile:purified water (eluent B). The mobile phase flow rate was maintained at 600 μL/min and was introduced directly into the mass spectrometer with no split. The mobile phase gradient profile was as follows: Starting condition 100% eluent B, 0.0–1.0 min: 100% B to 25% B, 1.0–22.0 min: 25% B, 22.0–22.5 min: 25% B to 0% B, 22.5–23.0 min: 0% B, 23.0–24.0 min: 0% B to 100% B, 24.0–30.0 min: 100% B. The mass spectrometer was controlled by MS Workstation 8.2.1 software (Bruker Daltonics) using electrospray ionization operated in negative ion mode. The following parameters were used to acquire Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) data: spray voltage: 3.0 kV, cone temperature: 350°C, cone gas flow 20, probe gas flow: 50, nebulizer gas flow: 50, heated probe temperature: 350°C, exhaust gas: on, CID: 1.5 mTorr. The MRM scan time was set to 1000 ms for DMAPP and IPP, and 200 ms for MVA-P with standard resolution for all transitions. The collision energy (CE) was optimised for each transition. The quantifier was <italic>m/z</italic> 245.0 → 79 (CE: 16 eV) and qualifier <italic>m/z</italic> 245.0→ 159 (CE: 16 eV) for both DMAPP and IPP.

Initial retention times (RT) were 14.1 min (MVA-P) 19.2 min (DMAPP) and 23.6 min (IPP) but shifted to less retention as the column presumably deteriorated during the runs. For quality control (QC) and to ensure correct peak integration a 1 μM standard DMAPP/IPP mix was injected every 12<sup>th</sup> sample. The RTs decreased in a linear fashion from the first 1 μM QC standard to the last QC standard (n = 52) with 0.024 min, 0.044 min, and 0.061 min per injection for MVA-P, DMAPP, and IPP respectively (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.990, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.991, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.989).

Analyte stock solutions were prepared in 90% (v/v) acetonitrile and were diluted with blank matrix extract, extracted with 90:10 (% v/v) acetonitrile:Milli-Q water). The internal standard was added to the final HPLC vial at a concentration of 16 μM. The calibration curve ranged from 0.25 μM to 10 μM with R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.968 and 0.981 for DMAPP and IPP, respectively. For both calibration curves a 1/x<sup>2</sup> weighting factor was applied. Sample concentrations lower than the lowest standard were obtained through extrapolation of the calibration curve. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was approximated, using the lowest standard as reference (0.25 μM, n = 4), as 10x the signal-to-noise ratio. The LOQ estimate was 0.033 and 0.045 μM for DMAPP and IPP respectively. The 1 μM QC standard (n = 8) recovery was 85.6 (RSD 18.7%) and 93.2 (RSD 15.9%) for DMAPP and IPP respectively. Additionally, five standards with different DMAPP/IPP ratios were injected to verify the ratio accuracy. DMAPP:IPP ratios fortified were 10, 2, 1, 0.5, and 0.1, while ratios found were 11.1, 1.8, 0.96, 0.56, and 0.10 (bias ranging from −9.9 to 12.5% with a mean bias of 1.9%).</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Protein quantification</title><p>Cells were harvested for proteomics analyses at the same time point as metabolomics samples.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Adaptation of hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate reductase enables volatile isoprenoid production&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Based on the reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. While both reviewers found the work very interesting, they also expressed some major concerns. Reviewer 1 highlights a number of factors that would need to be better controlled to support the authors conclusions. To overcome these concerns additional experiments would be required.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The architecture of the isoprenoid pathway requires fusion of two different C5 intermediates, DMADP and IDP, to produce all but the simplest products. Since the formation of the growing prenyl diphosphate chains is initiated with the allylic substrate DMADP and followed by multiple additions of the homo-allylic IDP, different ratios of DMADP:IDP are needed for different length isoprenoid products. Thus the ratio of DMADP:IDP available could control the rate of formation of different isoprenoid classes.</p><p>The authors of this contribution have discovered that for C5 intermediates derived from the MEP pathway, the ratio of DMADP:IDP is not fixed at 1:5 by the last enzyme of the pathway (hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate reductase- HDR) as once believed. Different HDR enzymes in different species seem to make a range of ratios, which might be important in controlling the formation of various isoprenoids, especially the gaseous isoprene, which is a product of DMADP solely. The finding of two apparent HDR paralogs in some gymnosperms is also fascinating as it suggests that plants might regulate DMADP:IDP ratios in different ways in distinct cell types depending on the varying spectrum of isoprenoids needed. This is an exciting story, but I have two concerns with the results reported.</p><p>1) The major concern is that the authors have not really measured the direct product ratio of the enzyme in a standard way by characterizing the isolated enzyme in vitro. Instead they have measured the concentrations of DMADP and IDP in living <italic>E. coli</italic> cells in which the enzymes have been over-expressed. This is partly understandable as HDR, like other Fe-S cluster proteins, is oxygen-sensitive and considered hard to assay in vitro. However, many other processes affect the in vivo concentrations of DMADP and IDP in living cells, and so the authors might do a better job of controlling these factors to make a stronger case that the differences they see in the HDRs of various species are real.</p><p>The authors have over-expressed these HDRs in cells with over-expressed DXS (&quot;to achieve intracellular IDP and DMADP concentrations above the quantification limits&quot;, DXS is supposed to be the rate-controlling step of the pathway), and with a new IDI enzyme and an additional biosynthetic pathway for the carotenoid lycopene (apparently to provide a sink for all of the excess IDP and DMADP, which are toxic). The result seems a very artificial, high flux environment for any isoprenoid synthesizing process, and it is hard to know if the ratios measured really reflect the intrinsic properties of the HDR, particularly since the expressed HDR is always mixed with the <italic>E. coli</italic> HDR.</p><p>Each HDR was expressed in the same cassette with the same promoter, but the ratios could vary depending on the level of expression of the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme vs. the heterologous HDR. Can the authors verify (by proteomics) that the protein levels of the tested HDRs in each experiment were the same? This might help show that the in vivo pools reflect real differences among the enzymes. One might expect that the host <italic>E. coli</italic> HDR responds in a varying way to the expression of heterologous enzymes, and so its level should be measured also. Hopefully, its contribution is also constant.</p><p>Another approach might be to down-regulate the <italic>E. coli</italic> HDR when the foreign HDR to be tested is over-expressed. This might avoid the toxic effects, and allow the foreign HDR to be tested with less competition.</p><p>The authors might additionally determine not only the ratio of DMADP to IDP, but also the absolute amounts of the two compounds to see if they are in the range expected in a cell, considering all of the genetic manipulations being carried out.</p><p>I realise that all of these suggestions require additional work. Perhaps there is another way to validate such in vivo measurements as representing the real characteristics of the enzyme when tested in vitro. Maybe an attempt could be made to try expression, purification and in vitro assay of say two of the HDRs from opposite ends of the DMADP:IDP scale.</p><p>2) One of the authors' most impressive achievements was to develop an HPLC separation scheme for IDP and DMADP. But as this procedure has never been formally published in the refereed literature, the authors should provide chromatograms with accompanying mass spectra to verify their separation. Also, the previously published retention times vary greatly from those reported here (subsection “Quantification of IPP and DMAPP”), which seems to deserve some comment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes mechanistically interesting novel data on the important role of hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate reductase (HDR/IspH) regulating the ratio of DMAPP and IPP as prerequisite for enhanced metabolic flux to isoprene (and monoterpenes) or long-chain terpenoids such as lycopene.</p><p>The authors have chosen an elegant molecular biological approach for their investigations: In addition to HDR genes from <italic>E. coli</italic> and Synechococcus, they investigated 8 HDR genes from plant species of originating from different taxa of the plant. In a first step, functional HDR genes were identified by complementing lethal knockout mutants of HDR/IspH in <italic>E. coli</italic>. It was found that the overexpression of some HDR genes led to growth inhibition in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which was attributed to the toxicity of accumulating prenyl phosphates.</p><p>For the main investigations, the <italic>E. coli</italic> metabolism was modified in which an overexpressed DXR gene led to an increased metabolic flow of the MEP pathway; a lycopene synthase or an isoprene synthase were incorporated to produce a metabolic sink to higher terpenoids (C40) and volatile (C5) hemiterpenes. In addition, a heterologous IPP isomerase (IDI) was incorporated to ensure sufficient IPP for the biosynthesis of longer chain terpenoids.</p><p>DMAPP and IPP were measured with directed LC-MS/MS which is state-of-the-art.</p><p>It is impressive to see how different the DMAPP/IPP ratios are adjusted by the different HDR enzymes. Enzymes from plants with naturally high isoprene emission have very high DMAPP/IPP ratios. Enzymes from organisms without isoprene emission show very low ratios, similar to HDR enzymes from gymnosperms.</p><p>Very interesting is the result shown in Figure S4 that the DMAPP/IPP ratios in vivo depend on the end product of the metabolism: higher at isoprene emission, lower at lycopene accumulation. I would suggest to show this result in the main text. I would also like to see a more detailed discussion of this observation. A point that is also a bit neglected in the discussion is the role of IDI in the fine tuning of DMAPP/IPP ratios. As rightly noted, the DMAPP/IPP ratio measured in vivo does not correspond to the (not measured) in vitro ratio, but is changed by the activity of the IDI. For isoprene emitting oaks it was shown that the activity of the IDI correlates positively with ISPS and isoprene emission (Brüggemann and Schnitzler, 2002), which indicates a rate-limiting role of the IPI as mentioned.</p><p>To understand the fine tuning of the DMAPP/IPP ratio between HDR/IspH, IDI and the sinks towards the different soluble and volatile end products additional information on IDI is necessary: i.e. what is the in vitro (in vivo) ratio of the IDI used in the present experiments? I'm wondering why no experiments without overexpressed (and knocked out) IDI have been performed. How does the absence of this enzyme (absence of overexpression) influence the in vivo ratios of DMAPP/IPP in the different systems (lycopene vs isoprene)? I hope the authors can provide this information from experiments not yet shown.</p><p>Overall a very interesting novel work demonstrating the potential role of HDR/IspH to control the ratio of C5 terpenoid intermediates central for the channeling of metabolites to the higher terpenoids/isoprenoids and or volatile compounds, such as isoprene and monoterpenes. Beside understanding the metabolic regulation within the MEP pathway in natural systems knowledge on the ratio of the enzyme products of HDR/IspH also will provide the avenue for much more efficient biotechnological system for all type of terpenoids.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised article &quot;Adaptation of hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate reductase enables volatile isoprenoid production&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Your article has been reviewed by one of the two reviewers who have seen the original submission. The second reviewer was unfortunately no longer available to assess the revised paper. The evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor, Joerg Bohlmann, and Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor. The reviewer has opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>We find that paper has been substantially improved, but there are a few remaining concerns in the external reviewer's report.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have made extensive revisions and significantly improved their manuscript. In particular, the new proteomics measurements help to assure that the activity of the over-expressed HDR proteins is not affected by the native <italic>E. coli</italic> protein or the expression of the genes on the lycopene plasmid. Obtaining in vitro assay data on these proteins would clearly be the &quot;gold standard&quot; for comparison among them, but I can accept that this is just not yet technically attainable, and they have done what they can to increase the accuracy of their in vivo measurements. I also appreciated the chromatograms to verify the DMADP-IDP separation.</p><p>Two minor concerns that could be addressed:</p><p>1) Compared to the first submission, the DMADP:IDP ratio for <italic>Prunus persica</italic> has now decreased by 10 fold, while the ratios for other species have declined by more than 50%. Since these are the core data of the paper, such big changes do not inspire confidence in the analytical methods. Is there a reason for such variance from the previous version, such as a change in the analysis protocol or a change in calibrating factors?</p><p>2) In subsection “Isoprene production” it states that &quot;isoprene was quantified as described previously&quot;, but the reference given is incorrect.

Our initial experimental setup was guided mainly by two factors:</p><p>a) being able to directly compare a relatively large number of HDR enzymes to each other, which precludes in vitro characterization of these difficult-to-express proteins, or expression and analysis in plants</p><p>and</p><p>b) using <italic>E. coli</italic>, which has a very low native flux through the MEP pathway, low MEP pathway gene expression levels and no apparent transcriptional or other regulation of MEP pathway genes in response to pathway engineering (Bongers et al., 2015). In this previous study, we established that MEP pathway gene expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> is not affected by expression of the lycopene pathway plasmid (including idi). With this in mind, our <italic>E. coli</italic>-based experimental system provides a much ‘cleaner’ background to study differences between plant HDRs compared to their native hosts.</p><p>In this revised submission, we have used LC-MS/MS proteomics to quantify proteins that could influence the in vivo ratio of DMAPP:IPP (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). We have confirmed that:</p><p>· native HDR protein abundance is the same across all strains including the negative control (except for the <italic>E. coli</italic> HDR overexpression strain, as intended), demonstrating that there is no regulation of <italic>E. coli</italic> HDR expression in response to overexpressing the heterologous HDRs.</p><p>· The same is true for the native <italic>E. coli</italic> Idi, as well as CrtE, CrtB, CrtI and Hp<sub>Idi</sub>, expressed from the lycopene production plasmid. These data demonstrate that if these proteins affect the DMAPP:IPP ratio measured in our setup, their influence is constant across all strains.</p><p>· <italic>E. coli</italic> HDR peptide counts increase &gt;50-fold in the EcHDR overexpression strain compared to all others. In the absence of a dedicated standard curve for the quantified peptides, counts cannot be assumed to increase linearly with protein abundance; however, these data strongly indicate a dramatic increase in HDR abundance upon overexpression compared to the baseline. The heterologous HDRs from other species (though not directly comparable, see comments below) show similarly strong expression levels as the overexpressed EcHDR. This further strengthens the view that the low and constant native EcHDR expression plays a minor role in determining the observed DMAPP:IPP ratios.</p><p>Expression of high DMAPP-producing HDRs causes severe toxicity in <italic>E. coli</italic>, making the co-overexpression of a metabolic sink (and, in some cases, idi) necessary to prevent cell death (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). No growth defect was caused by overexpression of the native <italic>E. coli</italic> HDR, or by any HDRs that favour the production of IPP over DMAPP. This further supports the argument that the observed differences in DMAPP:IPP ratio cannot be sufficiently adjusted by <italic>E. coli</italic>’s native metabolism or available Idi activity.</p><p>We have now quantified both IPP and DMAPP in the manuscript (Figure 2—figure supplement 3), and calculated the intracellular concentrations of these compounds (using an accepted method for calculating cell count and volume based on culture density: Volkmer 2011, PloS One). The generated intracellular concentrations of DMAPP and IPP range between 0.5 – 8.7 μM, which may be high for <italic>E. coli</italic>, but certainly seems within physiologically relevant boundaries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Each HDR was expressed in the same cassette with the same promoter, but the ratios could vary depending on the level of expression of the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme vs. the heterologous HDR. Can the authors verify (by proteomics) that the protein levels of the tested HDRs in each experiment were the same? This might help show that the in vivo pools reflect real differences among the enzymes.</p></disp-quote><p>Direct quantitative comparison between HDR expression levels is technically challenging because there are no proteotypic peptides that are shared between all HDRs in this set. The only way we could conceive to directly compare different HDR protein levels would be to use protein fusion tags such as His- or FLAG-tag and quantify based on those. We discarded this option because fusion tags may influence protein activity, and because (re-) cloning of high-DMAPP producing HDRs is very time-consuming due to toxicity issues. We now present LC-MS/MS-based proteomics data for all tested HDRs (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C), showing that all are highly expressed on the basis of total normalized counts and the number of peptides detected (between 28-52 peptides detected for each HDR). Using this method, it is not valid to compare counts for non-identical peptides because their different physicochemical properties affect behavior in the mass spectrometer, making results not quantitatively comparable. Since there is no single peptide shared by all tested HDRs, the presented data can only be seen as approximate indications of protein abundance. However, the data suggests that all HDRs are strongly overexpressed, and Pearson’s correlation analysis showed that there is no correlation between HDR ‘abundance’ and DMAPP:IPP ratio. This is now also explained in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One might expect that the host <italic>E. coli</italic> HDR responds in a varying way to the expression of heterologous enzymes, and so its level should be measured also. Hopefully, its contribution is also constant.</p></disp-quote><p>See above: EcHDR expression is constant, and relatively low unless it is specifically overexpressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another approach might be to down-regulate the <italic>E. coli</italic> HDR when the foreign HDR to be tested is over-expressed. This might avoid the toxic effects, and allow the foreign HDR to be tested with less competition.</p></disp-quote><p>See above: <italic>E. coli</italic> HDR is expressed at low levels, and overexpressing this gene does not cause any toxicity. The toxicity is only linked to high DMAPP-producing HDR enzymes. The argument that <italic>Ec</italic>HDR has a limited influence in our experimental setup is further supported by Figure 2C, showing that overexpression of <italic>Ec</italic>HDR shifts the ratio slightly towards more IPP compared to the ‘no HDR overexpression’ control. This is in agreement with all previous studies showing a 1:5 DMAPP to IPP ratio for the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors might additionally determine not only the ratio of DMADP to IDP, but also the absolute amounts of the two compounds to see if they are in the range expected in a cell, considering all of the genetic manipulations being carried out.</p></disp-quote><p>Without enhancing MEP pathway flux through engineering, we have found that metabolite measurements (isoprene and lycopene, as well as MEP pathway intermediates) are at or below the detection limit with mass spectrometry-based analytic methods.</p><p>Compared to plants, which can redirect up to 20% of recently fixed carbon into isoprenoids and produce many essential isoprenoid compounds, <italic>E. coli</italic> has minimal requirements for isoprenoids and naturally very low MEP pathway flux. Indeed, two decades of metabolic engineering of the MEP pathway have demonstrated its reluctance to sustain high flux and it remains challenging to produce high yields of isoprenoid compounds using this pathway in <italic>E. coli</italic> (DOI: 10.1093/femsle/fny079). The high demand for redox equivalents, which in plants is met by electrons coming from photosynthesis, may be one of the reasons for this. Hence, overexpressing <italic>dxs</italic> (as done in our study) is only the first step of several required to engineer high flux through the MEP pathway in <italic>E. coli</italic>. On this basis, and with our new observations that intracellular concentrations are in the low μM range, we do not think that the metabolite levels generated in this work are outside of physiologically relevant ranges.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I realise that all of these suggestions require additional work. Perhaps there is another way to validate such in vivo measurements as representing the real characteristics of the enzyme when tested in vitro. Maybe an attempt could be made to try expression, purification and in vitro assay of say two of the HDRs from opposite ends of the DMADP:IDP scale.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that demonstrating the differences in HDR production ratios is most relevant in an in vivo setting with realistic reaction conditions and redox partners, where their effect on downstream isoprene production can be directly observed. Achieving suitable in vitro reaction conditions for oxygen-sensitive FeS-cluster HDRs, as well as finding a physiologically relevant redox donor is documented to be very challenging (DOI: 10.1021/ja903778d), and requires specialist facilities which we do not currently have access to. We acknowledge that data from in vitro assays of selected HDRs could be valuable in future studies, but for this study we feel that we have sufficiently improved our in vivo analysis and interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Very interesting is the result shown in Figure S4 that the DMAPP/IPP ratios in vivo depend on the end product of the metabolism: higher at isoprene emission, lower at lycopene accumulation. I would suggest to show this result in the main text. I would also like to see a more detailed discussion of this observation.</p></disp-quote><p>This result might indeed be better presented in the main text, as it addresses the question raised by both reviewers of how robust and context-independent the observed differences in HDRs are. We have now included this data in Figure 2C, and discuss it in the main text (Results and Discussion paragraph four). We show that when using a different metabolic sink (isoprene synthase instead of lycopene), the relative differences between at least a subset of the tested HDRs, stay constant. Even though the absolute ratio of DMAPP:IPP shifts depending on the downstream sink, differences between the tested HDRs can be captured with both experimental setups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A point that is also a bit neglected in the discussion is the role of IDI in the fine tuning of DMAPP/IPP ratios. As rightly noted, the DMAPP/IPP ratio measured in vivo does not correspond to the (not measured) in vitro ratio, but is changed by the activity of the IDI. For isoprene emitting oaks it was shown that the activity of the IDI correlates positively with ISPS and isoprene emission (Brüggemann and Schnitzler, 2002), which indicates a rate-limiting role of the IPI as mentioned.</p><p>To understand the fine tuning of the DMAPP/IPP ratio between HDR/IspH, IDI and the sinks towards the different soluble and volatile end products additional information on IDI is necessary: i.e. what is the in vitro (in vivo) ratio of the IDI used in the present experiments? I'm wondering why no experiments without overexpressed (and knocked out) IDI have been performed. How does the absence of this enzyme (absence of overexpression) influence the in vivo ratios of DMAPP/IPP in the different systems (lycopene vs isoprene)? I hope the authors can provide this information from experiments not yet shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We found that IDI is absolutely required when studying any of the high DMAPP-producing HDR enzymes in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Figure 2F, and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, and data not shown). Any attempts to clone, express or analyze these high DMAPP HDRs in the absence of IDI have resulted in mutated, nonfunctional HDR genes. We agree that the influence of IDI on the DMAPP:IPP ratio is an important question that warrants further investigation, particularly in vivo in plants which likely use regulation of IDI expression as a further mechanism to control isoprenoid production.</p><p>In the present study, the important question is whether IDI co-expression artifactually influences our results. In our revised submission we have validated that IDI expression is constant across all strains (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and 2D). Therefore, the different HDR enzymes must be the primary driver of the 40-fold differences in in vivo DMAPP:IPP ratios between different HDRs. While the IDI enzyme must affect DMAPP and IPP concentrations to some extent, it does not appear to have a major impact on our observations.</p><p>Furthermore, our proteomics data suggest that IDI expression is overall very low, based on both the total counts, number of peptides detected (1 peptide for Ec<sub>Idi</sub>, 3 peptides for Hp<sub>Idi</sub>, compared to 28-50 peptides detected for each HDR protein) and the normalized rank (Ec<sub>Idi</sub> ranks at around 2300 out of 2500 quantified proteins in our samples). These data have to be seen in light of the inherent limitations of non-targeted proteomics, yet they strongly suggest low relative protein abundance for both IDIs present in our system.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We find that paper has been substantially improved, but there are a few remaining concerns in the external reviewer's report.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have made extensive revisions and significantly improved their manuscript. In particular, the new proteomics measurements help to assure that the activity of the over-expressed HDR proteins is not affected by the native <italic>E. coli</italic> protein or the expression of the genes on the lycopene plasmid. Obtaining in vitro assay data on these proteins would clearly be the &quot;gold standard&quot; for comparison among them, but I can accept that this is just not yet technically attainable, and they have done what they can to increase the accuracy of their in vivo measurements. I also appreciated the chromatograms to verify the DMADP-IDP separation.</p><p>Two minor concerns that could be addressed:</p><p>1) Compared to the first submission, the DMADP:IDP ratio for Prunus persica has now decreased by 10 fold, while the ratios for other species have declined by more than 50%. Since these are the core data of the paper, such big changes do not inspire confidence in the analytical methods. Is there a reason for such variance from the previous version, such as a change in the analysis protocol or a change in calibrating factors?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s observations are correct, but the reason for the difference is that we have substantially improved the analytical method. It is important to note that the ranked order of HDR proteins has not changed in the new data set (ranked in terms of their DMAPP:IPP ratios), and the improvements to the analytical method give us confidence that the DMAPP and IPP quantification is more accurate.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48685-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In our earlier dataset we reported DMAPP and IPP as a ratio of their LC-MS/MS peak areas. The accuracy of these ratios was limited by the fact that we had not managed to achieve full baseline separation of DMAPP and IPP.
