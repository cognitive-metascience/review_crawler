Working with citizen scientist volunteers to survey mammals at 1427 sites across two development gradients (wild-rural-exurban-suburban-urban) and four plot types (large forests, small forest fragments, open areas and residential yards) in the eastern US, we show that developed areas actually had significantly higher or statistically similar mammalian occupancy, relative abundance, richness and diversity compared to wild areas. However, although some animals can thrive in suburbia, conservation of wild areas and preservation of green space within cities are needed to protect sensitive species and to give all species the chance to adapt and persist in the Anthropocene.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38012.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Humans transform natural ecosystems worldwide into towns and cities, replacing natural habitat with human-built surfaces. This loss of habitat and increase in human activity make suburban areas difficult for some species to survive in, raising concerns that developed areas become ecologically unbalanced as they lose biodiversity. However, the preservation of urban green space and lack of hunting could also open the door for some species to thrive in the midst of large human populations. Indeed, some animals, mammals in particular, have grown more tolerant of humans and appear to have adapted to suburban landscapes around the world. Some species that have been exclusively living in the wilderness, such as a small carnivore called the fisher, are even moving back into cities.</p><p>Research into how mammals are coping with the urbanization of their habitats has produced conflicting results. Studies that explore a variety of cities and habitats would help to clear up this confusion.</p><p>Parsons et al. worked with citizen scientist volunteers to survey the mammals at 1,427 sites across Washington DC and Raleigh, North Carolina. The volunteers set up motion-triggered cameras in these sites, which covered a full range of urban and wild habitats, including back yards and large nature preserves.</p><p>The cameras detected similar or higher numbers of mammal species in suburban sites compared to wild areas. Indeed, most species appear to use suburban areas at least as much as wild land. Urban green space is especially important; it is used by less urban-adapted species like coyotes to navigate areas that are densely populated by humans.</p><p>The results presented by Parsons et al. suggest that many mammals have indeed adapted to the suburban environment over the last few decades, resulting in more balanced urban ecosystems. More testing in other cities will help to determine how general this pattern of adaptation is, and provide us with knowledge that could help us to conserve many different species. However, some species were still most abundant in wild areas, emphasizing the need to also conserve wildlands and to minimize our impact on natural ecosystems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>urban-wild gradient</kwd><kwd>mammal</kwd><kwd>camera trap</kwd><kwd>citizen-science</kwd><kwd>diversity</kwd><kwd>relative abundance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#1232442</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McShea</surname><given-names>William J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kays</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#1319293</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McShea</surname><given-names>William J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kays</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011237</institution-id><institution>VWR Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McShea</surname><given-names>William J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kays</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006509</institution-id><institution>International Programs, US Forest Service</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McShea</surname><given-names>William J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kays</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000014</institution-id><institution>Smithsonian Institution</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McShea</surname><given-names>William J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005825</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Food and Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>McIntire Stennis project , WVA00124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rota</surname><given-names>Christopher T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011483</institution-id><institution>North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kays</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Citizen science camera trapping showing suburban and wild areas maintain similar levels of mammalian diversity and relative abundance, challenging conventional thoughts about the impacts of urbanization on wildlife.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Global loss of biodiversity leads to disruption of ecosystem services around the world, ultimately threatening human well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cardinale et al., 2012</xref>). Vertebrate species loss is typically considered to be worst in the most developed landscapes, where urbanization serves as an intense and long-term disturbance that permanently alters habitat and truncates food webs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lombardi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McKinney, 2006</xref>). However, for some species, urbanization can offer abundant nutrient-rich food that is less ephemeral compared to wild areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bateman and Fleming, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Whether this food is enough to counteract the negative effects of disturbance (i.e. higher road mortality, fragmentation) depends on a speciesâ ability to adapt to the stressors of urban living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Witte et al., 1982</xref>). Mammal species, especially those with large home ranges, are arguably most at risk from development, leading some to suggest that developed areas have a dearth of predators, and that prey species could benefit by using humans as a shield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crooks, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">OrdeÃ±ana et al., 2010</xref>). Previous studies have shown cities to be depauperate of bird life, supporting the traditional view that development and biodiversity cannot coexist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keast, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Strohbach et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>However, recent evidence has shown that some mammal species previously thought mal-adapted to urban landscapes (i.e. mountain lion [<italic>Puma concolor]</italic>, fisher [<italic>Martes pennanti</italic>]) are thriving in them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bateman and Fleming, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">LaPoint et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting an evolutionary trend that could be important for conservation in the Anthropocene. Existing research on mammal communities across urbanization gradients has focused on single cities, yielding conflicting results, perhaps due to variation in city structure and characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lombardi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saito and Koike, 2013</xref>). Given the rapid expansion of urban areas worldwide, and the recent case studies of urban adaptations by wildlife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">LaPoint et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Riley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), more large-scale studies are needed to evaluate the response of wildlife communities to urban development if we are to understand urban ecology, conservation, and evolution in the Anthropocene.</p><p>Here, we present the results of a large-scale mammal survey of two urban-wild gradients. Our objectives were to determine how diversity, richness, detection rate, and occupancy of the mammal community change as a function of human disturbance. We hypothesized that the availability of supplemental food at higher levels of development would positively affect mammalian populations and outweigh the negative effects of disturbance, except for the most sensitive species. Specifically, we predicted that mammalian relative abundance would increase with developmental level but that species richness and diversity would decrease. Furthermore, we predicted that occupancy of the most sensitive species (i.e. large and medium carnivores) would be highest in wild areas both in our study area and around the world.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study sites</title><p>Washington, District of Columbia, USA (hereafter DC) is a city of approximately 177 km<sup>2</sup> with an estimated human population size of 681,000, thus a density of 3847 people/km<sup>2</sup>.

Each individual camera was considered a 'camera site' and volunteers ran cameras at an average of two sites each. Following Hammer et al. (2004), we used the Silvis housing density dataset with 1km grid cells to define five development levels of the gradient for sampling stratification (excluding open water): urban (&gt;1000 houses/km<sup>2</sup>), suburban (147.048<underline>â</underline>1000 houses/km<sup>2</sup>), exurban (12.64<underline>â</underline>147.047 houses/km<sup>2</sup>), rural (0.51<underline>â</underline>12.63 houses/km<sup>2</sup>) and wild (&lt;0.5 houses/km<sup>2</sup>). Within those gradient levels, camera placement was also stratified between residential yards, open areas (&gt;0.001 km<sup>2</sup> absent of trees), small forest fragments (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mo>â¤</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>1 km<sup>2</sup>) and large forest fragments (&gt;1 km<sup>2</sup>)Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Forest fragment size was verified using the 2006 US National Landcover Dataset (NLCD) and Landscape Fragmentation Tool v2.0 (Vogt et al., 2007) in ArcMap (Version 10.1, ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA) which defines forest fragments by size. Yards were not available for sampling in the urban or wild levels of the gradient. Urban areas were not sampled in Raleigh and open areas were not sampled in DC. All adjacent cameras were spaced at least 200 m apart. Camera placement was randomized as much as possible using ArcMap (Version 10.1) to randomly generate points within polygons while following certain rules. For example, we selected sites within forests that volunteers were permitted to access and were within a reasonable hiking distance (i.e. &lt; 11 km hike round trip) with terrain that was not too steep to traverse safely (i.e. &lt;45 degree slope). Within yards, cameras were placed as randomly as possible while avoiding the highest human traffic areas (i.e. walkways, doors, gates and driveways).</p><p>No explicit power analysis was used to predetermine sample size. Our sample size goal was 20 spatial replicates (equating toÂ ~420 trap nights), which has been found to maximize precision for estimating detection rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kays et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rowcliffe et al., 2008</xref>). Camera sites are biological replicates, parallel measurements capturing random biological variation. This study did not include technical replicates.</p><p>Volunteers used Reconyx (RC55, PC800, and PC900, Reconyx, Inc. Holmen, WI) and Bushnell (Trophy Cam HD, Bushnell Outdoor Products, Overland Park, KS) camera traps attached to trees at 40 cm above the ground. Cameras were deployed for three weeks and then moved to a new location without returning, with sampling taking place continuously throughout the year. Cameras recorded multiple photographs per trigger, at a rate of 1 frame/s, re-triggering immediately if the animal was still in view. We grouped consecutive photos into on sequence if they wereÂ &lt;60 s apart, and used these sequences as independent records, counting animals in the sequence, not individual photos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parsons et al., 2016</xref>). We then collapsed these independent records into daily detection/non-detection for occupancy modeling. Initial species identifications were made by volunteers using customized software (available freely from eMammal.org, source code proprietary) and all were subsequently reviewed for accuracy before being archived at the Smithsonian Digital Repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McShea et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>DiversityÂ </title><p>We used package iNEXT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hsieh et al., 2016</xref>) in R (Version 3.1.0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">R Development Core Team., 2008</xref>) via R Studio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">RStudio Team, 2015</xref>) to calculate Hill numbers (i.e. the effective number of species, incorporating relative abundance and richness) of species richness and Shannon diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao et al., 2014</xref>) between gradient levels (urban-suburban-exurban-rural-wild) and plot types (yard, open, small forest, large forest). iNEXT calculates the Shannon diversity as Hill number qÂ =Â 1, equal to the exponential of Shannon's entropy index, thus the natural log of those results was used for display purposes. We used detection/non-detection data to compute diversity estimates and the associated 95% confidence intervals via rarefaction, plotting the diversity estimates while accounting for sample size. We fit a curve to diversity estimates between gradient levels using a generalized additive model with a polynomial term.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Model covariates</title><p>We modeled variation in occupancy (Ï) and detection rate using 13 covariates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) representing development level, the amount of core forest, small scale forest cover, prey relative abundance and whether hunting was allowed. We added year as a covariate to account for population changes over time. We used the Landscape Fragmentation Tool v2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vogt et al., 2007</xref>) and the NLCD (2006) land use dataset in ArcMap (Version 10.1) to create a landcover layer representing the percent of large core forest (forest patches larger than 1 km<sup>2</sup>) in a 5 km radius around camera locations which we considered best approximated the home range size of our target species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bekoff, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fritzell and Haroldson, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lariviere and Pasitschniak-Arts, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lariviere and Walton, 1997</xref>). Forest patches did not necessarily fall entirely within the buffer. We considered road density as an additional covariate at the 5 km scale but initial evaluations showed it to be highly correlated with housing density (87.1%) so we chose to eliminate it from the analysis. We used a 100 m radius for small-scale forest cover to best represent small forest patches within suburban neighborhoods (e.g. small vacant lots with trees, greenways). We represented deer and rodent+lagomorph relative abundance using site-specific detection rate (the number of detections divided by the total number of camera-nights). We included an indicator (0/1, no hunting/hunting) to categorize whether a site allowed hunting or not. We modeled detection probability (p) using five covariates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Because both ambient temperature and undergrowth can affect the cameraâs ability to detect an animal, we included daily covariates for temperature and NDVI (Moderate Resolution Imaging Land Terra Vegetation Indices 1 km monthly, an average value over the month(s) the camera ran) obtained from Env-DATA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dodge et al., 2013</xref>). To complement NDVI, we also considered site-specific detection distance, a measure of how far away the camera was able to detect a human, which is influenced by both understory and site topography. We included an indicator (0/1, not yard/yard) to categorize whether a site was a residential yard or not. In Raleigh, two different camera models were used (both Reconyx and Bushnell) so we added a 0/1 (Bushnell/Reconyx) covariate to account for potential difference in detection probability between the two brands. We diagnosed univariate correlations between covariates using a Pearson correlation matrix, and used a restrictive prior for beta coefficients where correlation wasÂ &gt;0.60 (i.e. logistic(0,1); a prior with reduced variance to induce shrinkage, similar to ridge regression; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hooten and Hobbs, 2015</xref>). All covariates were mean-centered.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Detection rate modelsÂ </title><p>We used a Poisson count model (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kays et al., 2017</xref>) to assess differences in total mammal detection rate (i.e. the intensity with which a site was used, count/day) between the five gradient levels (urban, suburban, exurban, rural, wild) and four plot types (large forest, small forest, open, yard).

However, Shannon diversity was significantly lower at the urban level in DC, possibly due to low sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Diversity in yards was significantly higher or not statistically different from large and small forest fragments in both cities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplements 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). Most (92.3%) of the 13 mammal species detected &gt;20 times occupied all levels of development below the urban level. Two of the largest predators, coyotes and bobcats, were absent from the highest development level (urban) but were detected at all other levels in both cities. Black bears (<italic>Ursus americanus</italic>), which are actively discouraged from colonizing central North Carolina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, 2011</xref>), were not detected in Raleigh and were detected in DC at all levels of the gradient except suburban and urban, though were predominantly in the wild level. These results indicate that the extant mammal guild exploits all levels of the urban-wild gradient and that no species are entirely relegated to the wild gradient level. However, some species appear less adapted to habitation in human-dominated areas, spending most of their time at the wild levels of the gradient (i.e. bobcat, bear; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We recognize that the current community represents species that survived the initial arrival of high-density human settlement.

These models show a greater association of carnivores with green space when housing density is high (e.g. coyote and gray fox, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">7</xref>), consistent with other studies finding urban green space important in maintaining biodiversity in cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lombardi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matthies et al., 2017</xref>). It is likely that shyer species are not avoiding regions of high human density, but require patches of forest to navigate residential areas that are freely used by more commensal species, such as red foxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tigas et al., 2002</xref>), which we frequently detected in yards. Indeed, we found a gradient of responses in carnivore use of human-dominated environments, from red fox which are the most urban adapted (i.e. negatively associated with local large forest fragments and the only species to have a positive association with yards) to bobcats which appear to be the most human-averse (i.e. rarely detected in the suburban level of the gradient) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence for a negative impact of suburban and exurban development on extant native mammal diversity, richness, and occupancy and detection rate of carnivores. In fact, all metrics were significantly greater than, or equal to, wild areas. We suspect that developed areas offer good food resources for wildlife through direct and indirect feeding (i.e. bird feeders supplementing prey, pets), accidental feeding (i.e. garbage), and ornamental plantings (for herbivores), but testing this hypothesis will require additional diet studies in urban landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Contesse et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the structure of mature suburbia (i.e. older, established neighborhoods with large trees, wooded riparian areas, small parks) contributes to a more diverse and varied landscape than wild areas with more homogenous forest cover, which is potentially beneficial for many generalist species. Developed areas where hunting is limited or prohibited also offer a safe haven for game species, presuming they can navigate the road networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collins and Kays, 2011</xref>) and avoid direct human conflict.</p><p>Our discovery of a wild suburbia suggests high levels of adaptation by mammals to developed landscapes over the last few decades, including predators and prey. The resilience of these species gives hope for wildlife in the Anthropocene, but the generality of this pattern needs to be tested in other cities to understand how habitat type, development patterns, apex predators, and hunting regulations influence urban mammal communities, as there are examples of far more drastic impacts of urbanization on other taxa and in other places around the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keast, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKinney, 2008</xref>). Indeed, in Tokyo, Japan, the relative abundance of mammals declined with urbanization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saito and Koike, 2013</xref>) and avian communities in Quebec, Canada and Rennes, France showed a similar decline in richness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clergeau et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saito and Koike, 2013</xref>). This suggests that city structure, size and human density may influence mammalian distribution along urban-wild gradients with large, sprawling New World cities showing different patterns than the smaller more concentrated cities of the Old World. Although our study provides a less dire picture of urban ecosystem function than previously thought, we do not suggest abandoning mitigation of urbanizationâs negative impacts, or conservation of completely wild areas. Factors such as urban green space, connectivity and availability of completely wild areas give species the time and space to adapt to changing habitats and climates. Further understanding of how urban wildlife navigates human-dominated areas and factors that contribute to the adaptation of species to the Anthropocene will be critical to maintaining diversity in a rapidly urbanizing world.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank our 557 volunteers for their hard work collecting camera trap data for this study.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Wild suburbia: mammal communities are larger and more diverse in moderately developed areas&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Bernhard Schmid as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marc KÃ©ry (Reviewer #3) and Ingolf KÃ¼hn (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The value of this paper is that it addresses a question of broad relevance with novel methods. The question is whether human population density near two US cities reduces the occurrence of large mammals in four types of habitats, large forests, forest fragments, open areas and yards.

See Dorazio et al. (2006) for how this can be done. Also, please cite the important work of Dorazio and Royle (2005) and Dorazio et al.

These should also be cited.</p><p>- Subsection âOccupancy modelsâ: âWe assumed all species occurred independentlyâ¦â. Does this fit with what was just said âIt contains single-species (first order)â¦â?</p><p>Subsection âData reportingâ: The first part of this paragraph is a bit weird to me. If you have to have a formal paragraph like this for the journal specifications, please ignore. As of now it reads like you are trying to convince the reader why an observational study was chosen instead of a true experiment. I think it is given that a camera trap study is going to be more of an observational study â we just try to standardize our sampling design as much as possible. If this paragraph is not required, I would just go straight into your methods â i.e. study design, site selection, sample size, etc.</p><p>Subsection âData reportingâ: How did you randomize your sites? Did you use GIS and place random points within some bounds of a polygon (e.g. yard or forest preserve)? Did you place a grid across the city and chose sites closes to a random intersect? Please be more specific.</p><p>Subsection âCitizen science camera trap surveysâ: Please report the mean number of cameras deployed per volunteer (as an aside, please be consistent with the use of volunteer and citizen scientist).</p><p>Subsection âCitizen science camera trap surveysâ: 200 m seems close together for mammal occupancy. Please justify the independence between sites, or, consider changing your terminology from true occupancy and maybe use habitat use instead.</p><p>Subsection âCitizen science camera trap surveysâ: Were cameras rotated continuously throughout the year or did sampling only occur during a particular season. Please clarify? If they were rotated throughout the year, did you revisit sites or are some sites sampled in the earlier part of the calendar year being compared to sites sample later (letâs say early spring vs. late fall). If this is the case I would be worried that the sampling periods would violate the assumption of closure for your occupancy models. Please clarify and or address the issue.</p><p>Throughout the statistical analyses: It is clear that multiple authors wrote the different sections. Please take the time to be consistent in your tone, terminology, and methods descriptions throughout. For, example R is cited 3 different ways.</p><p>Subsection âModel covariatesâ: Please justify why you decided to use a single season occupancy model for multiple seasons with a year covariate instead of a dynamic occupancy model. The way you did it is not wrong but does not consider the dynamics between years. If you are violating closer (see comment above), you could sub-divide your data into appropriate seasons (considering closure) and use a multi-season occupancy model instead.</p><p>Subsection âModel covariatesâ: Please specify if you used NLCD land use data set and used an open space category or used the NLCD canopy cover dataset.</p><p>Subsection âModel covariatesâ: I am a bit confused here. So, you used the percentage of forested area within the 5 km buffer that was at least connected to a large continuous forest patch larger than 1km? Could that linkage continue outside the patch? For example, would a small 5m<sup>2</sup> patch on the edge of the buffer be counted if it were connected to a larger forest patch that continues outside the buffer? Itâs just a bit confusing, please clarify.</p><p>Subsection âModel covariatesâ: Also confused here. So now you measured the percentage of forest cover within a 100m radius? But it didn't have to be connected to continuous forest cover? So, a small vacant lot with some trees would be counted?</p><p>Subsection âModel covariatesâ: I have concerns about using number of detections/trap night as a metric of prey abundance (even just relative abundance). In our system, we get rabbits just sitting in front of the camera all day. How can you tease apart that a single rabbit didn't sit in front of the camera continuously triggering it at one site, but not another. For example, what if in a single night one rabbit sat in front of a camera for 100 minutes (100 detections) at site A and 100 rabbits passed in front of the camera a single time (100 detections) at site B? Very different abundance, but you get the same answer.</p><p>Subsection âModel covariatesâ: Does NDVI get at understory? Will a cell with really dense canopy cover but no understory give a different value than one with really dense canopy cover and thick understory? From what I have experienced, dense canopy cover in an urban park (with no understory) will often show up the same as a forested area if there are few gaps in the tree.</p><p>Subsection âModel covariatesâ: Did you use monthly NDVI, did you pick a month with peak greenness, or did you average across the month? I am assuming you used one value since you did not use a dynamic occupancy model, but please clarify.</p><p>Subsection âModel covariatesâ: Indicate which camera model was the reference.</p><p>Subsection âDetection rate modelsâ: Did you have adequate fit for both your Poisson and occupancy models? Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 has huge error bars, which could be a result of over parameterizing the model. Maybe report results from PPC in supplemental table. However, PPC checks for occupancy models are tough as they have trouble accounting for the correcting of detection. Cross validation is probably best. See Hooten and Hobbs (2015).</p><p>Subsection âOccupancy modelsâ: I think you need to mention that you ran an occupancy model for a subset of species (and mention species) somewhere here. Unless you ran a multi-species model for all the species, in which case I don't see any mention of the rest of the species in the Results section.</p><p>Subsection âOccupancy modelsâ: I am assuming that the city indicator is a 1 or a 0 based on your table in supplemental material, but this is not clear in the text. Please clarify how that interaction is formulated. You also need to report which city is represented by 1 and which city is represented by 0. Without this your tables don't mean much. You also need to report the intercept value of your model in your supplemental tables, so the reader can interpret results for the reference city.</p><p>Subsection âComparison with global occupancy dataâ: Here is where the global comparison is first mentioned. I think you need a justification and a bit of a background in the introduction. Until I got to the Discussion section and saw the results, I was left wondering what the point of this analysis was.</p><p>Subsection âStudy sitesâ: This passage is written a bit unclearly. As is, it sounds like you deliberately avoided urban areas in both cities. I suggest rephrasing for clarity.</p><p>Subsection âModel covariatesâ: I am assuming 'hunting' means hunting was allowed or hunting was recorded during the sample period? Be more specific.</p><p>Subsection âModel covariatesâ: I suggest putting the covariate abbreviation that you use in your models and tables in parentheses after each time they are mentioned in the text. I think this will help the reader follow along.</p><p>Subsection âModel covariatesâ: I suggest rephrasing to &quot;We included an indicator (0 or 1) to categorize whether a site allowed hunting or not.&quot; Also, I assume that 0 indicates no hunting? But please be explicit in the text.</p><p>Subsection âDetection rate modelsâ: Change 'count' to Poisson.</p><p>Subsection âDetection rate modelsâ: I think you should say what your thinning rate was instead of just ith.</p><p>Subsection âOccupancy modelsâ: What about plot type and all the other covariates?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38012.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The value of this paper is that it addresses a question of broad relevance with novel methods.

We added that clarification as well: âWe used a 100m radius for small scale forest cover to best represent small forest patches within suburban neighborhoods (e.g. small vacant lots with trees, greenways).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection âModel covariatesâ: I have concerns about using number of detections/trap night as a metric of prey abundance (even just relative abundance). In our system, we get rabbits just sitting in front of the camera all day. How can you tease apart that a single rabbit didn't sit in front of the camera continuously triggering it at one site, but not another. For example, what if in a single night one rabbit sat in front of a camera for 100 minutes (100 detections) at site A and 100 rabbits passed in front of the camera a single time (100 detections) at site B? Very different abundance, but you get the same answer.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that use of detections/day can be a problematic index of relative abundance, especially where individual photos are considered. To deal with this we considered only photographs separated by more than 1 minute as temporally independent records (see Parsons et al., 2016, for an analysis of the adequacy of this 1 minute interval for independence). Thus, if a rabbit sat in front of the camera for 100 minutes, it would still be counted as 1 rabbit, not 100. If 100 rabbits passed in front of the camera, assuming they did not pass in continuous succession without periods of time between of at least 1 minute, they would be counted as 100 rabbits. We have included this language in the Materials and methods section: âWe grouped consecutive photos into on sequence if they were &lt;60 seconds apart, and used these sequences as independent records, counting animals in the sequence, not individual photos (Parsons et al., 2016).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection âModel covariatesâ: Does NDVI get at understory? Will a cell with really dense canopy cover but no understory give a different value than one with really dense canopy cover and thick understory? From what I have experienced, dense canopy cover in an urban park (with no understory) will often show up the same as a forested area if there are few gaps in the tree.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer points out, NDVI will not always reliably reflect understory, especially where canopy cover is dense. However, we felt that this was the best remote-sensing measurement available to try and account for this, however we also measured detection distance on the ground which accounts for thick undergrowth as well as the unique topography of each site which influenced detection probability. We have clarified this in the Materials and methods section: âTo complement NDVI, we also considered site-specific detection distance, a measure of how far away the camera was able to detect a human, which is influenced by both understory and site topography.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection âModel covariatesâ: Did you use monthly NDVI, did you pick a month with peak greenness, or did you average across the month? I am assuming you used one value since you did not use a dynamic occupancy model, but please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added some clarification âBecause both ambient temperature and undergrowth can affect the cameraâs ability to detect an animal, we included daily covariates for temperature and NDVI (Moderate Resolution Imaging Land Terra Vegetation Indices 1km monthly, an average value over the month(s) the camera ran) obtained from Env-DATA (Dodge et al., 2013).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection âModel covariatesâ: Indicate which camera model was the reference.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this clarification: âIn Raleigh, two different camera models were used (both Reconyx and Bushnell) so we added a 0/1 (Bushnell/Reconyx) covariate to account for potential difference in detection probability between the two brands.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection âDetection rate modelsâ: Did you have adequate fit for both your Poisson and occupancy models? Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 has huge error bars, which could be a result of over parameterizing the model. Maybe report results from PPC in supplemental table. However, PPC checks for occupancy models are tough as they have trouble accounting for the correcting of detection. Cross validation is probably best. See Hooten and Hobbs (2015).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the results of goodness-of-fit tests as a supplement (Supplementary file 3), using PPC for both. Since current methods of PPC with occupancy models have difficulty handling detection, as the reviewer points out, we derived a novel (to our knowledge) method for posterior predictive checks of the occupancy model and have included that proof as Supplementary file 4. We have added this to the Materials and methods section: âWe assessed model fit with posterior predictive checks (PPC) (Gelman et al., 2014; Kery and Schaub, 2012) by calculating the sum of squared Pearson residuals from observed data (<italic>T(y</italic>)) and from data simulated assuming the fully parameterized model was the data-generating model (<italic>T(y<sub>sim</sub></italic>)). We calculated a Bayesian <italic>p</italic>-value as <italic>p<sub>B</sub></italic> = Pr(<italic>T(y<sub>sim</sub></italic>) &gt; <italic>T(y</italic>)) from posterior simulations and assumed adequate fit if 0.1 &lt; <italic>p<sub>B</sub></italic> &lt; 0.9. To our knowledge, the squared Pearsonâs residual has not been derived in the context of occupancy models, so we present our derivation of this test statistic in Supplementary file 4. We added a random effect on detection/non-detection for the coyote portion of the model since initial assessments of fit for this species were inadequate (i.e. p<sub>B</sub>&gt;0.9).â</p><p>Subsection âDetection rate modelsâ: âBoth of our models fit well, with Bayesian p-values between 0.1 and 0.9 (Supplementary file 3).â The additional random effect placed on coyote detection/non-detection to improve fit did not substantially change estimates of psi or associated uncertainty.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection âOccupancy modelsâ: I think you need to mention that you ran an occupancy model for a subset of species (and mention species) somewhere here. Unless you ran a multi-species model for all the species, in which case I don't see any mention of the rest of the species in the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added: âWe used the multispecies occupancy model of Rota et al., (2016) to estimate the probability of occupancy of four predator species: bobcat, coyote, red fox and gray fox.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection âOccupancy modelsâ: I am assuming that the city indicator is a 1 or a 0 based on your table in supplemental material, but this is not clear in the text. Please clarify how that interaction is formulated. You also need to report which city is represented by 1 and which city is represented by 0. Without this your tables don't mean much. You also need to report the intercept value of your model in your supplemental tables, so the reader can interpret results for the reference city.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added that clarification: âWe considered interactions (i.e. city*covariate) between each occupancy covariate and city (0/1, DC/Raleigh).â</p><p>We have also added the intercepts into Supplementary file 5, where they were missing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection âComparison with global occupancy dataâ: Here is where the global comparison is first mentioned. I think you need a justification and a bit of a background in the introduction. Until I got to the Discussion section and saw the results, I was left wondering what the point of this analysis was.</p></disp-quote><p>We have attempted to add some more clarity of structure and purpose to the end of the Introduction, including about our comparison with global wildlands: âOur objectives were to determine how diversity, richness, detection rate, and occupancy of the mammal community changes as a function of human disturbance. We hypothesized that the availability of supplemental food at higher levels of development would positively affect mammalian populations and outweigh the negative effects of disturbance, except for the most sensitive species. Specifically, we predicted that relative abundance and occupancy of mammals would increase with developmental level but that species richness and diversity at these higher levels would be lower. Furthermore, we predicted that the occupancy of the most sensitive mammal species (i.e. large and medium carnivores) would be lower at the highest development levels compared to wild areas both in our study area and around the world.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection âStudy sitesâ: This passage is written a bit unclearly. As is, it sounds like you deliberately avoided urban areas in both cities.
