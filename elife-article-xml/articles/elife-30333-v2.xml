This suggests they may play a critical role in spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP). Consistent with this idea, EPSPs in both cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons were suppressed by preceding APs in an SK-dependent manner. In cortical pyramidal neurons EPSP suppression by preceding APs depended on their precise timing as well as the distance of activated synapses from the soma, was dendritic in origin, and involved SK-dependent suppression of NMDA receptor activation. As a result SK channel activation by backpropagating APs gated STDP induction during low-frequency AP-EPSP pairing, with both LTP and LTD absent under control conditions but present after SK channel block. These findings indicate that activation of SK channels in spines by backpropagating APs plays a key role in regulating both EPSP amplitude and STDP induction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Action potential</kwd><kwd>EPSP</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>SK channel</kwd><kwd>NMDA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stuart</surname><given-names>Greg J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stuart</surname><given-names>Greg J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The John Curtin School of Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stuart</surname><given-names>Greg J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The activation of small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels in spines by action potentials regulates the induction of spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity during low-frequency single action potential–EPSP pairing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (SK channels) in spines regulate the amplitude of EPSPs in pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloodgood and Sabatini, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Faber et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ngo-Anh et al., 2005</xref>). This earlier work has shown that calcium influx into spines during EPSPs leads to SK channel activation, which acts to reduce NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation presumably by promoting voltage-dependent magnesium block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mayer et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nowak et al., 1984</xref>). These studies indicate that during EPSPs in pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and amygdala SK channels in spines form a negative feedback loop controlling EPSP amplitude and calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloodgood and Sabatini, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Faber et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ngo-Anh et al., 2005</xref>). In addition to their impact on EPSPs, we recently showed in cortical pyramidal neurons that SK channels in spines also act to limit calcium influx into spines and dendrites during backpropagating APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jones and Stuart, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Given the central role of NMDAR activation and calcium in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bliss and Collingridge, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 1999</xref>), the capacity of SK channels to influence NMDAR activation and calcium influx into spines during EPSPs and APs is likely to have consequences on the induction of synaptic plasticity. Consistent with this idea, blocking SK channel activation, and thereby the impact of SK channels on NMDAR function, can promote and enhance long-term potentiation (LTP) evoked by tetanic stimulation in pyramidal neurons from the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behnisch and Reymann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stackman et al., 2002</xref>) and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Faber et al., 2005</xref>). Loss of SK channels from spines has also been shown to contribute to LTP expression in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, a recent study observed that mGluR activation facilitates LTP induction during STDP in hippocampal neurons via inhibition of SK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tigaret et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here we investigate the impact of SK channels activated by backpropagating APs on subsequently evoked EPSPs as well as the induction of STDP. We find that EPSPs in both cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons are suppressed by preceding APs if these APs are evoked in a brief time window before EPSP onset. EPSP suppression by preceding APs required activation of dendritic SK channels, with the magnitude of EPSP suppression dependent on the distance of activated synapses from the soma. Furthermore, we show the extent of EPSP suppression was NMDAR dependent. Finally, we show that SK channel activation by APs acts to gate the induction of STDP during low-frequency single AP-EPSP pairing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effect of SK channel activation on EPSPs paired with APs</title><p>To investigate the acute impact of SK channel activation by backpropagating APs on subsequently evoked EPSPs, unitary EPSPs were evoked with and without preceding postsynaptic APs during recordings from synaptically connected layer 5 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Postsynaptic APs generated on their own were interleaved between trials and digitally subtracted from the AP-EPSP waveform to reveal the impact of preceding postsynaptic APs on unitary EPSPs. Generation of single APs 10 ms before EPSPs (−10 ms timing) suppressed EPSP peak by approximately 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>; n = 6). This EPSP suppression was significantly reduced by bath application of the SK channel blocker apamin, indicating a role of SK channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). The magnitude of SK-dependent EPSP suppression was dependent on the precise timing of EPSPs and postsynaptic APs, with EPSP suppression only observed when postsynaptic APs were evoked within a brief time window before EPSP onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>; n = 6).

We therefore investigated the dependence of EPSP suppression by APs on synapse location. To do this, we used somatic EPSP rise-time as a proxy for synapse location. Previous work indicates that somatic EPSP rise time is positively correlated with the distance of active synapses from the soma of layer 5 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Letzkus et al., 2006</xref>), as expected due to dendritic filtering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jack et al., 1971</xref>). The range of EPSP rise times in our experiments was similar to that observed in a previous study using paired recordings from layer 5 pyramidal neurons in somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Markram et al., 1997a</xref>), with this earlier work finding that synaptic connections between layer 5 pyramidal neurons are made between 80 and 585 µm from the soma (mean: 147 µm; median: 105 µm), with the majority of inputs on basal dendrites. Consistent with our earlier study showing that the impact of SK channels on calcium influx during backpropagating APs is greater at more distal dendritic locations, we found that the impact of SK channel block on EPSP suppression by preceding APs (−10 ms timing) was positively correlated with EPSP rise-time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>; n = 16). These data suggest that SK channels activated by backpropagating APs lead to greater suppression of EPSPs when they are generated at more distal dendritic locations.</p><p>To determine if AP-induced SK channel-dependent suppression of EPSPs also occurs in other neuronal cell types and brain regions, we investigated if APs could suppress EPSPs in cortical layer 2/3 and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. These experiments indicated that preceding postsynaptic APs suppressed EPSPs in both cortical layer 2/3 and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in an SK-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a-d</xref>), as observed in layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Interestingly, these experiments also revealed that blocking SK channels had no impact on the amplitude of EPSPs alone in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), while it increased the amplitude of EPSPs evoked on their own in CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), as observed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloodgood and Sabatini, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ngo-Anh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Blocking SK channels also had no impact on unitary EPSPs in layer 5 pyramidal neurons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). These observations suggest that, in contrast to CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), calcium influx via NMDARs is not sufficient to activate SK channels in cortical layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons, and that this requires AP generation. In summary, these data show that preceding postsynaptic APs reduce the amplitude and duration of EPSPs in both cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons, with the extent of EPSP suppression dependent on SK channel activation, AP timing and EPSP location.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30333.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>APs suppress EPSPs in an SK-dependent manner in cortical layer 2/3 and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.</title><p>(<bold>a,b</bold>) EPSPs evoked alone (black) and 10 ms after APs (blue and red) in control (left) and apamin (right) in layer 2/3 (<bold>a</bold>) and CA1 pyramidal neurons (<bold>b</bold>).

To test if somatic SK channels also contribute to EPSP suppression we investigated AP-induced suppression of EPSP-like waveforms generated by current injection via the somatic recording pipette. These experiments were performed in layer 5 pyramidal neurons with somatic artificial EPSPs (aEPSPs) evoked alone or with preceding APs at various timing intervals. As the origin of aEPSPs is somatic, AP-induced suppression would be expected to be primarily via mechanisms close to the soma. Artificial EPSPs of 1 mV amplitude were used in these experiments to mimic the average unitary EPSP amplitude observed in layer 5 paired recordings (0.82 ± 0.08 mV; n = 28).</p><p>Preceding APs suppressed aEPSPs during pairing at −10 ms, however, the extent of AP-induced suppression of aEPSP peak was much smaller than that observed during unitary EPSPs and was insensitive to apamin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>).

We have recently shown that this blocks somatic SK channels in layer 5 pyramidal neurons, while preserving the function of SK channels in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jones and Stuart, 2013</xref>). This effect is not due to poor diffusion of the calcium chelator to dendritic locations, but is likely to result from differences in the localisation of dendritic compared to somatic SK channels with their calcium source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jones and Stuart, 2013</xref>). Consistent with these earlier observations, low concentrations of BAPTA completely abolished the SK-mediated component of the somatic mAHP in layer 5 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Under these conditions preceding APs suppressed unitary EPSPs to a similar extent to that observed in the absence of BAPTA in an apamin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e–h</xref>; n = 6; compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

As SK channels in the model were constrained to dendritic spines these simulations show that activation of dendritic SK channels by backpropagating APs has minimal impact on somatic EPSPs, supporting the conclusion from the aEPSP experiments that the impact of SK channels on unitary EPSPs is dendritic. We next used the model to determine the changes in AMPA and NMDA synaptic current when APs are evoked before EPSPs (−10 ms timing). Preceding APs had opposing effects on current flow through AMPA and NMDA channels, leading to a decrease in AMPA current due to a reduction in driving force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), but an increase in NMDA current due to the impact of spine depolarisation during backpropagating APs on NMDA channel activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Switching SK channels off in these simulations had minimal impact on AMPA current flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), but further increased NMDA current due to increased depolarisation of dendritic spines following broadening of backpropagating APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5j</xref>). Switching off SK channels also led to an increase in NMDA current during pairing of EPSPs with APs at positive timings (+10 ms; not shown).

To test this idea, we induced STDP during recordings from synaptically connected layer 5 pyramidal neurons using single AP-EPSP pairing (60 repetitions at 0.2 Hz) at −10 ms and +10 ms in the absence and presence of apamin. When bi-directional connections were obtained, the impact of AP-EPSP pairing at −10 ms and +10 ms was tested simultaneously.

These data indicate that dendritic SK channels play a key role in regulating the induction of STDP in layer 5 pyramidal neurons in somatosensory cortex during single AP-EPSP pairing, presumably through their capacity to limit NMDAR activation. Finally, given that EPSP suppression by backpropagating APs is greater at EPSPs located at distal dendritic locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>), we investigate the dependence of STDP observed after blocking SK channels on EPSP location.

In layer 5 pyramidal neurons, EPSP suppression by backpropagating APs was dependent on the distance of activated synapses from the soma, was dendritic in origin, and involved SK-dependent suppression of NMDA receptor activation. Together, these effects of SK channel activation gate STDP induction during low-frequency AP-EPSP pairing, with both LTP and LTD absent under control conditions but present after SK channel block.</p><p>Previous work in both cortical pyramidal neurons as well as cerebellar Purkinje neurons have described an inhibitory action of postsynaptic APs on EPSPs, due to different mechanisms from those described here. APs evoked after EPSP onset have been shown to shunt EPSPs at the soma of cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje neurons, reducing their amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Häusser et al., 2001</xref>). This effect is due to conductances near the soma activated during the AP itself, and is only observed when APs are generated after EPSP onset. It is therefore quite different from the EPSP suppression described here, which is dendritic in origin, requires SK channel activation and is observed when the AP occurs before EPSP onset.</p><p>More relevant to our observations is the work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Froemke et al. (2005)</xref>, who showed that preceding APs lead to EPSP suppression in cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. This effect was generated when postsynaptic APs were evoked before EPSP onset, and had a similar time window to the EPSP suppression described here in layer 5 pyramidal neurons. In contrast to our findings, however, this study attributed EPSP suppression to calcium-dependent NMDAR desensitisation, due to its dependence on NMDAR activation and intracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Froemke et al., 2005</xref>). As we show SK-dependent EPSP suppression by preceding APs In layer 5 pyramidal neurons is also dependent on NMDAR activation and presumably intracellular calcium, given the requirement for SK channel activation. However, in contrast to the observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Froemke et al. (2005)</xref>, we find that EPSP suppression by preceding APs in both layer 2/3 and layer 5 cortical pyramidal neurons was largely blocked by apamin. Based on these observations, we predict that the EPSP suppression described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Froemke et al. (2005)</xref> is likely to be mediated by the same SK-dependent mechanism described here, rather than via calcium-dependent NMDAR desensitisation.</p><p>Previous work indicates that SK channels in hippocampal CA1 neurons can be activated by EPSPs alone, regulating NMDAR activation and EPSP amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloodgood and Sabatini, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ngo-Anh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with these earlier observations, we also observed that blocking SK channels increased EPSPs evoked on their own in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Interestingly, this does not occur in cortical layer 2/3 or layer 5 cortical pyramidal neurons, despite the presence of SK channels in spines on basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jones and Stuart, 2013</xref>). The reason for this difference is unclear, but may involve differences in the properties or level of expression of NMDARs and/or SK channels in the cortex compared to the hippocampus. Alternatively, differences in the site of synaptic input onto pyramidal neurons in these brain regions may lead to different extents of NMDAR activation. Synaptic connections between layer 5 neurons are dispersed onto multiple basal dendritic branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Markram et al., 1997a</xref>), reducing the voltage change at individual inputs. In contrast, synapses in other brain regions may cluster, leading to more localised dendritic depolarisation and enhanced NMDAR activation. It is also possible that the calcium source for SK channel activation is different in cortical compared to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Activation of SK channels in spines on basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal during backpropagating APs has recently been shown to be dependent on only R-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jones and Stuart, 2013</xref>). In contrast, SK channels in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons are thought to be activated by calcium influx through NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ngo-Anh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloodgood and Sabatini, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The SK-dependent component of EPSP suppression by preceding APs was absent when NMDARs were blocked, indicating a critical role of NMDARs. Surprisingly, these experiments revealed that blocking NMDARs increased EPSP suppression. This increase in AP-induced EPSP suppression arises because under control conditions the extent of EPSP suppression due to reduced current flow through AMPA receptors is offset by increased NMDAR activation. As a result blocking NMDARs increases EPSP suppression. In addition, we observed that following NMDAR block SK channels had no impact on EPSP suppression. This is presumably the case as SK channels predominately modulate NMDAR activation, and have little impact on current flow through AMPA receptors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,c</xref>). In the absence of NMDARs blocking SK channels therefore has little impact on EPSP suppression.</p><p>In summary, these data suggest that NMDAR activation is enhanced by preceding APs, with the extent of NMDAR activation kept in check by dendritic SK channels. Blocking NMDAR activation therefore both increases EPSP suppression, and removes its dependence on SK channels. This idea was supported by our model. These simulations showed that backpropagating APs lead to significant depolarisation of dendritic spines on basal dendrites, with the extend of spine depolarisation controlled by SK channel activation. This effect of SK channels on spine voltage presumably also underlies their capacity to regulate spine calcium influx during backpropagating APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jones and Stuart, 2013</xref>). Depolarisation of dendritic spines by backpropagating APs not surprisingly increases NMDAR activation due to relief of magnesium block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kampa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mayer et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nowak et al., 1984</xref>), while at the same time reduces current flow through AMPA receptors due to a reduction in electrochemical driving force. As SK channels control spine voltage during backpropagating APs they regulate the extent of NMDAR activation, which presumably also explains their capacity to gate STDP induction.</p><p>The model also revealed that EPSP suppression was not due to SK channel activation localised solely to active spines, but required SK channel activation along the entire dendritic branch. As a result the impact of SK channel activation on backpropagating AP width and thereby spine depolarization is greater at more distal dendritic locations. This can explain why the extent of AP-induced EPSP suppression was greater for more distal synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>), and may also explain the great impact of preceding APs on distal compared to proximal EPSPs in earlier work in layer 2/3 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Froemke et al., 2005</xref>). This dependence of EPSP suppression on synapse location also impacted on STDP, with the absolute magnitude of STDP observed during AP-EPSP pairing at both positive and negative times positively correlated with somatic EPSP rise time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>).</p><p>STDP is a form of synaptic plasticity where the strength of synaptic connections is modified by the precise timing of synaptic input and postsynaptic APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bi and Poo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Markram et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sjöström et al., 2001</xref>). While there are many demonstrations of LTP induced by low-frequency pairing of single pre- and postsynaptic APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bi and Poo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dan and Poo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Froemke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nevian and Sakmann, 2006</xref>), in some neuronal cell types more intense stimuli such as high AP frequency bursts are required for plasticity to occur. For example, unitary synaptic connections between layer 5 pyramidal neurons do not display LTP when EPSPs are paired with APs at positive timings (+10 ms) in both somatosensory and visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kampa and Stuart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Markram et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sjöström et al., 2001</xref>). Multiple pre- and postsynaptic AP pairings at high frequencies (10–40 Hz) or pairing single presynaptic APs with additional postsynaptic depolarisation or a postsynaptic AP burst is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kampa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Markram et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sjöström and Häusser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sjöström et al., 2001</xref>). Low-frequency single AP pairing of unitary EPSPs between layer 5 pyramidal neurons also does not produce LTD in somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kampa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Markram et al., 1997b</xref>), although this does lead to LTD in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sjöström et al., 2001</xref>). These data suggest that the depolarisation associated with backpropagating APs is in some cases insufficient for STDP induction, which has lead some to question the physiological relevance of STDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lisman and Spruston, 2005</xref>).</p><p>As we show here, activation of SK channels by backpropagating APs gates the induction of both LTP and LTD during low-frequency single AP-EPSP pairing at unitary connections between layer 5 pyramidal neurons in somatosensory cortex, presumably by restricting NMDAR activation. Why blocking SK channels is not required for LTD induction at unitary connections between layer 5 pyramidal neurons in visual cortex is unclear, but may have to do with region-specific differences in input resistance. The input resistance of layer 5 pyramidal neurons is significantly higher in visual compared to somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sjöström et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Williams and Stuart, 1999</xref>). As a result, under control conditions backpropagating APs may lead to sufficient depolarization of dendritic spines to cause LTD induction in visual cortex layer 5 pyramidal neurons even in the presence of SK channel activation. Alternatively, regional differences in SK channels expression or activation may be involved, as presumably underlie the different impact of SK channels on EPSPs evoked on their own in cortical compared to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.</p><p>The capacity of SK channels to gate the induction of STDP during low-frequency single AP-EPSP pairing provides a means to negate the impact of accidental or spurious AP-EPSP pairings on synaptic plasticity. In addition, it provides a mechanism to regulate the extent of STDP induction given that the availability SK channels is under the control of both metabotropic acetylcholine and glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buchanan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giessel and Sabatini, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tigaret et al., 2016</xref>), as well as plasticity itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>When APs are evoked shortly after EPSP onset (e.g. +10 ms), while EPSPs at the soma will be shunted, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Häusser et al., 2001</xref>), at the level of individual spines the depolarization associated with backpropagating APs will increase NMDAR activation and associated calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koester and Sakmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nevian and Sakmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schiller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yuste and Denk, 1995</xref>), which would be expected to be regulated by SK channel channels, as occurs when APs are evoked before ESPs. Consistent with this idea, simulations using our model indicated that when APs were generated 10 ms after EPSP onset turning SK channels off in the model increased NMDAR activation, while having essentially no impact on AMPA current (not shown). This effect presumably underlies the capacity of SK channels to gate STDP at both positive and negative spike timings.</p><p>In summary, we find that backpropagating APs have opposing effects on the currents generated during EPSPs. APs evoked just before EPSP onset reduce the electrochemical driving force for current flow through AMPA receptors, leading to EPSP suppression. At the same time, the depolarisation associated with backpropagating APs increases NMDAR activation, opposing the reduction in AMPA current. As the extent of NMDAR activation is controlled by dendritic SK channels, blocking these channels increases NMDAR activation, reducing AP-induced EPSP suppression and leading to STDP induction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation</title><p>Wistar rats (16–18 days old) of either sex were anaesthetized by inhalation of isofluorane and decapitated according to guidelines approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of the Australian National University.

For experiments performed with BAPTA added to the intracellular solution, whole-cell recordings were initially established without BAPTA added to the intracellular solution. After a connection was identified, the patch pipette on the postsynaptic neuron was withdrawn and the neuron repatched with a pipette containing BAPTA in the intracellular solution, which was then allowed to dialyse into the neuron for 30 min before experiments commenced. For STDP experiments, EPSPs were evoked at 0.2 Hz (every 5 s) and plasticity induced by 60 repetitions of single pre- and postsynaptic APs at a time interval of +10 or −10 ms at 0.2 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Artificial voltage waveforms</title><p>Somatic current injection with an exponential rise and decay of 0.3 ms and 3 ms, respectively, was used to generate somatic artificial EPSPs (aEPSPs). These kinetics were chosen to mimic spontaneous EPSCs measured at the soma of layer 5 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stuart and Sakmann, 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Pharmacology</title><p>SK channels were blocked by apamin (100 nM; Sigma Aldrich, Australia) and NMDARs blocked by D(-)−2-amino-5-phosphono-pentanoic acid (AP5; 100 μM; Tocris Bioscience, UK).

Steady-state concentrations in the recording chamber were achieved within 5 min after the commencement of drug wash in, and the impact evaluated after 20–30 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All data were analysed using Axograph X.

A reduced layer 5 pyramidal neuron model that displays realistic AP kinetics and firing was used to reduce computational time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bahl et al., 2012</xref>). A fully reconstructed basal dendritic branch obtained from a morphologically realistic layer 5 pyramidal neuron model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stuart and Spruston, 1998</xref>) was attached to the soma of this model. Specific membrane resistance (R<sub>m</sub>; 15,000 Ω.cm<sup>2</sup>), capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>; 1 μF/cm<sup>2</sup>) and internal resistance (R<sub>i</sub>; 105 Ω.cm) were uniformly distributed throughout the reconstructed basal dendritic branch based on previously published values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nevian et al., 2007</xref>). A total of 365 spines were explicitly modeled and placed at ~2 μm intervals along the reconstructed basal dendrite, starting 50 µm from the soma. Each spine consisted of a head and neck segment. Spine heads had diameters and lengths of 500 nm. Spine necks were 1 μm long and had diameters of 160 nm, producing a spine neck resistance of approximately 50 MΩ. In addition to adding spines explicitly, R<sub>m</sub> was decreased and C<sub>m</sub> increased by a factor of 1.73 in dendritic compartments greater than 50 μm from the soma of the reconstructed basal dendritic branch to account for the impact of spines not explicitly modeled on membrane properties. This correction adjusts for the fact than only ~25% of the expected number of spines on the reconstructed basal dendritic branch were explicitly modeled, and assumes that spines effectively double the surface area of dendritic compartments in which they are present. The resting membrane potential of the model was set to −79.4 mV.</p><p>Voltage-activated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aradi and Holmes, 1999</xref>) were included in spine heads at the same density at all dendritic locations, with the density scaled to give a free calcium concentration of 20 µM in proximal spines during backpropagating APs, as observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cornelisse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sabatini et al., 2002</xref>). The spine calcium concentration in individual spines was evaluated by summing the calcium currents through all voltage-gated calcium channels in the spine head. Calcium removal from the spine head was modeled by a single exponential decay with a time constant of 9 ms, similar to experimental observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sabatini et al., 2002</xref>). The calcium-dependence of SK channel model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Somjen et al., 2008</xref>) used a Hill function:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>gskbar</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>1+</mml:mtext><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac bevelled="true"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>K</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>D</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Ca</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>i</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Hill</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>gskbar</italic> is the SK conductance, <italic>Ca<sub>i</sub></italic> is the intracellular calcium concentration, <italic>Hill</italic> is the Hill coefficient (4.7) and <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> is the calcium dissociation constant (300 nM see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xia et al., 1998</xref>). SK channels were only included in spine heads at a uniform density of 20 pS/µm<sup>2</sup>. This value was chosen to replicate experimental data on the impact of SK channels on calcium influx into spines during backpropagating APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5l</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jones and Stuart, 2013</xref>). It over-estimates the required SK conductance per spine as only ~25% of the spines in the reconstructed dendrite were explicitly modeled. As we observed no impact of somatic SK channels on EPSP amplitude, no SK channels were included at the soma. Also, as our experimental observations indicated that SK channels in cortical pyramidal neurons are not activated by NMDARs, SK channel activation was coupled solely to calcium flux through voltage-dependence calcium channels. No other voltage or calcium-activated conductances were included in the reconstructed basal dendrite.</p><p>Excitatory synapses were made onto spines on the reconstructed basal dendritic branch at different locations, as indicated in the Results. At each location two synapses within a selected region were randomly chosen. The conductance change at these synapses had both AMPA and NMDA components. The AMPA conductance had exponential rise and decay of 0.2 and 2 ms, respectively, a peak of 500 pS and a reversal potential of 0 mV. The NMDA conductance (2.9 nS) was based on a published model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moradi et al., 2013</xref>) with modified kinetics and voltage dependence. It had an exponential rise time (1 ms) and double exponential decay (5 and 30 ms). The voltage dependence of the NMDAR model was described by:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mtext>Mg</mml:mtext><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>V</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mtext>= </mml:mtext><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>1</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>1 + </mml:mtext><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>0.0501e</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>-0.105V</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The NMDAR model had a V<sub>1/2</sub> of −28.5 mV and a slope of 0.0262 mV<sup>−1</sup>, and has similar voltage dependence to a kinetic model developed from experimental data in layer 5 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kampa et al., 2004</xref>). The amplitude, kinetics and voltage-dependence of the NMDAR model were tuned to reproduce the impact of preceding APs on EPSP peak and width, as well as the increase in EPSP suppression observed after NMDAR block.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank Dr. Tobias Bock for assistance with MATLAB programming.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Stefan Remy (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors applied paired whole-cell recordings of cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons in combination with computational modeling to investigate the role of small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (SK channels) in the regulation of EPSP amplitudes by back-propagating action potentials (APs) and their potential effects on spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP). The main finding is that back-propagating APs reduced EPSP size in a distance-dependent manner. The suppression was more effective with higher distances from the soma and was mediated by dendritic – and not somatic – SK channel activation. One important requirement for this SK-mediated effect is, that back-propagating APs are evoked ~10 ms prior to EPSP induction. Pharmacological block of SK channels increased NMDAR activation which in turn reduced AP-mediated EPSP suppression and led to the expression of long-lasting synaptic plasticity. Moreover, SK channel activation served to suppress the induction of spike timing-dependent plasticity during low-frequency single-AP-EPSP pairings. In addition, the authors report potentially important functional differences between cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. This is an important study on the role of the neurons' excitability on EPSP amplitude and synaptic plasticity on the basis of the interaction between SK channels, NMDARs and back-propagating APs. It is a technically well performed and well written study. However, the reviewers have some main concerns which are summarized below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please clarify the wording 'distance-dependent'. On the basis of previous work of the authors and the rise times of EPSPs presented in this study, the authors should be able to give more precise statements on distance between dendritic EPSP induction and the somatic recording site. The morphology of the cells and synapse location (in case intracellular labelling is available) should be helpful in this context.</p><p>2) Please give more explanations in the Discussion on the nature of the potential influence of perisomatic conductances on the shape of EPSPs. The authors propose that the SK-insensitive component of EPSP suppression is somatic in origin and very likely caused by conductance's related to spike after hyperpolarization. The argument for this conclusion is only indirect and based on similar sizes in EPSP amplitude modulation, but not shown directly by for example blocking the potentially underlying conductances. Either provide additional explanations on which conductances underlie EPSP attenuation or tone down this conclusion.</p><p>3) Please discuss whether non-linear specific membrane resistances and gradients in dendritic SK channel densities may also be factors influencing the shape of dendritically evoked EPSP.</p><p>4) Please make any code you have developed for data analysis as well as modelling and which is essential to reproduce the results of the study, publicly available.</p><p>5) Please give more explanations on the potential conductance's which may explain why in the absence of NMDAR activity action potential-induced EPSP suppression increased. Moreover, what is your explanation for why SK had no effect on action potential-induced EPSP suppression in the presence of NMDAR blockers but slightly increased the EPSP half-width? These questions require discussion.</p><p>6) The authors should compare their data with previous studies on the conditions of LTP and LTD induction using STDP protocols. In particular induction protocols from this study should be compared with previous ones, in particular from Markram et al., 1997b; Sjostrom et al., 2001 and Kampa et al., 2006. Markram et al. 1997b does show bidirectional up and down regulation of STDP but not necessarily low frequency induced plastic changes. Similarly Sjostrom et al. 2001 show that LTD was observed for 0.1 – 20 Hz. Thus, some clarification would be helpful.</p><p>7) Finally, the authors should examine the relationship of control STDP as a function of EPSP rise-time.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30333.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please clarify the wording 'distance-dependent'.

In the case of SK-dependent EPSP suppression we observed that EPSPs with longer rise times were suppressed more by preceding APs than EPSPs with shorter rise times. As longer EPSP rise times are typically associated with EPSPs generated at more distal locations we conclude that SK-dependent EPSP suppression is greater at more distal locations (that is, is “distance dependent”). We observed the same effect in our model. To avoid confusion associated with the term “distance-dependent” we have removed it from the revised manuscript and reworded the appropriate sections of the text.</p><p>In terms of the actual distance of synaptic inputs from the soma it is hard for us to be precise. Cells were not filled with biocytin to allow reconstruction and localization of synaptic contacts. The location of synaptic inputs between synaptically connected layer 5 pyramidal neurons in somatosensory cortex has been examined in detail previously by Markram et al. (1997; J. Physiol.). The range of rise times given in Markram et al. (~1 to 7 ms) is similar to that described in our study (~1.5 to 5 ms). The study of Markram et al. (1997) indicated this range was associated with synaptic connections 80 and 585 μm from the soma (mean: 147 μm; median: 105 μm), with the majority of these connections on basal dendrites. We have added this information to the revised manuscript, and directly compare our EPSP rise time data with that of Markram et al. (1997) so as to give the reader an approximate indication of the physical distance of synaptic connections from the soma.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please give more explanations in the Discussion on the nature of the potential influence of perisomatic conductances on the shape of EPSPs. The authors propose that the SK-insensitive component of EPSP suppression is somatic in origin and very likely caused by conductance's related to spike after hyperpolarization. The argument for this conclusion is only indirect and based on similar sizes in EPSP amplitude modulation, but not shown directly by for example blocking the potentially underlying conductances. Either provide additional explanations on which conductances underlie EPSP attenuation or tone down this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree our evidence that the SK-insensitive component of EPSP suppression is somatic is indirect. As suggested by the reviewer we have therefore toned down this conclusion in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please discuss whether non-linear specific membrane resistances and gradients in dendritic SK channel densities may also be factors influencing the shape of dendritically evoked EPSP.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not test the role of non-linear specific membrane resistance or gradients in dendritic SK channel densities, but neither were necessary to explain our experimental observations. The SK channel density in the model was uniform. We now state this explicitly in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please make any code you have developed for data analysis as well as modelling and which is essential to reproduce the results of the study, publicly available.</p></disp-quote><p>Once published we will make all code publicly available, as we have done for previous publications via the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/">https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://neuromorpho.org/">http://neuromorpho.org/</ext-link> websites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please give more explanations on the potential conductance's which may explain why in the absence of NMDAR activity action potential-induced EPSP suppression increased. Moreover, what is your explanation for why SK had no effect on action potential-induced EPSP suppression in the presence of NMDAR blockers but slightly increased the EPSP half-width? These questions require discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The increase in AP-induced EPSP suppression observed following block of NMDARs arises because under control conditions the extent of EPSP suppression, due to reduced current flow through AMPA receptors, is offset by increased NMDAR activation. As a result blocking NMDARs increases EPSP suppression. This result was reproduced in the model and did not require conductances other than AMPA and NMDA receptors. We have reworded sections of the revised manuscript to make this point clearer.</p><p>The absence of an impact of blocking SK channels on AP-induced EPSP suppression in the presence of NMDAR blockers arises because SK channels predominately modulate NMDAR activation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). With regard to the slight increase in EPSP half-width observed after SK channel block in the presence of NMDAR blockers, this effect is analogous to the increase in artificial EPSP half-width observed following block of SK channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We think this effect is likely to result from blocking somatic SK channels activated during the mAHP, although have no direct evidence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors should compare their data with previous studies on the conditions of LTP and LTD induction using STDP protocols. In particular induction protocols from this study should be compared with previous ones, in particular from Markram et al., 1997b; Sjostrom et al., 2001 and Kampa et al., 2006. Markram et al. 1997b does show bidirectional up and down regulation of STDP but not necessarily low frequency induced plastic changes. Similarly Sjostrom et al. 2001 show that LTD was observed for 0.1 – 20 Hz. Thus, some clarification would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their comments and have reworded sections of the revised manuscript where the studies by Markram et al. (1997b), Sjostrom et al. (2001) and Kampa et al. (2006) are cited. We also thank the reviewers for calling our attention to the fact that the study by Sjostrom et al. (2001) showed that LTD can be induced during low-frequency pairing in their recordings from visual cortex. We now discuss differences between our observations and those of Sjostrom et al. (2001) explicitly. As the input resistance of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in visual cortex is significantly higher than in somatosensory cortex, dendritic spines in visual cortex are likely to be more depolarised than spines in somatosensory cortex during low-frequency pairing at negative times, despite SK channel activation. This may explain why LTD can be induction in visual cortex by low-frequency pairing at negative times, whereas this is not seen in somatosensory cortex. Alternatively, regional differences in SK channel expression or activation may be involved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Finally, the authors should examine the relationship of control STDP as a function of EPSP rise-time.</p></disp-quote><p>We include this analysis in the revised version of the manuscript (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). As predicted from the observation that SK channels have a greater impact on EPSPs with slower rise times, we observed that the impact of apamin on STDP was also greater for these EPSPs. We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to include this additional analysis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
