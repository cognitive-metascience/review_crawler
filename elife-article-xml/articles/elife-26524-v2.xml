Here, we show that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase 4 controls three processes essential to progress from a single haploid microgametocyte to the release of eight flagellated microgametes in <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>. A myristoylated isoform is activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> to initiate a first genome replication within twenty seconds of activation. This role is mediated by a protein of the SAPS-domain family involved in S-phase entry. At the same time, CDPK4 is required for the assembly of the subsequent mitotic spindle and to phosphorylate a microtubule-associated protein important for mitotic spindle formation. Finally, a non-myristoylated isoform is essential to complete cytokinesis by activating motility of the male flagellum. This role has been linked to phosphorylation of an uncharacterised flagellar protein. Altogether, this study reveals how a kinase integrates and transduces multiple signals to control key cell-cycle transitions during <italic>Plasmodium</italic> gametogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26524.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26524.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26524.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Malaria is caused by parasites called <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, which are carried between humans by infected mosquitoes.The parasite needs to move between its insect and human hosts to complete its life cycle, and efforts to stop the spread of malaria are now focussed on blocking this movement.</p><p>In the blood of infected humans, the parasite exists in a form known as a gametocyte, which can be male or female. When a mosquito bites and ingests the blood of a person with malaria, the gametocytes experience a sudden drop in temperature, which stimulates them to develop into sex cells. In less than ten minutes, each male gametocyte replicates its genetic material three times, divides this material into eight sex cells, and these new cells make lash-like appendages called flagella. The flagella allow the male sex cells to “swim” around the mosquito’s blood meal in search of female sex cells.</p><p>Several signalling molecules help to control the development of male gametocytes. One such molecule is a protein known as CDPK4. Drugs targeting this protein inhibited the spread of a malaria parasite that infects rodents, yet a full understanding of how the CDPK4 protein controls the development of male gametocytes remains a mystery.</p><p>Here, Fang et al. reveal that in the ten minutes following a parasite entering a mosquito, CDPK4 controls three distinct events required for the development of male gametocytes. CDPK4 is required to stimulate the replication of the parasite DNA and to separate the duplicated genetic material into the new cells. CDPK4 influences both events within 30 seconds of the parasite sensing a drop in temperature, which was unexpected because these events are not usually directly connected in other organisms. Shortly after, CDPK4 is required to stimulate the sex cells’ flagella to move.</p><p>Further experiments analysing the effect of CDPK4 on over 2,000 proteins show that CDPK4 controls the activity of multiple proteins in the parasite. Three of these proteins had not been characterized before and Fang et al. found that they are involved in critical stages leading up to the movement of the flagella.</p><p>Along with inhibiting the spread of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, drugs that target CDPK4 can inhibit the spread of many related parasites, including the parasite that causes a disease called toxoplasmosis. These findings provide a first insight into how this protein works at a molecular level and may aid the development of more effective drugs in the future.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26524.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26524.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>signalling</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd><italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BSSGI0_155852</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brochet</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CDPK4 is a pleiotropic regulator controlling initiation of DNA replication, mitotic spindle assembly and flagellar activation during the early stages of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> transmission.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria is caused by vector-borne protozoan parasites of the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic> that cycle between mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts. Malaria pathology is linked to the proliferation of asexual blood stage parasites, whereas transmission to the mosquito is mediated by an obligatory sexual life cycle phase. Differentiation from asexually replicating stages into non-dividing male and female gametocytes takes place inside red blood cells. Following a period of maturation, the sexual precursors are available to initiate transmission when ingested by a mosquito. Gametocytes resume their development by responding to environmental signals including a small mosquito molecule, xanthurenic acid (XA), and a simultaneous drop in temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Billker et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Upon ingestion by a mosquito vector, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> male gametocyte undergoes explosive development. Within 10 min, it completes three rounds of genome replication followed by endomitosis within a single nucleus, assembles the component parts of eight axonemes, and escapes the red blood cell in a process called exflagellation. Circulating microgametocytes are arrested at a G<sub>0</sub>-like stage of the cell cycle at the haploid level. After 15 s of induction by XA, eight basal bodies are assembled from a single microtubule organising centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sinden et al., 1976</xref>). After 1 min, the first genome replication is completed and the spindle of mitosis I is formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billker et al., 2002</xref>). At the same time each basal body nucleates one of the eight axonemes from large quantities of tubulin contained in the cytoplasm. By six minutes, the four spindles of mitosis III have formed and chromatin condensation only sets in at the end of mitosis III. In parallel gametocytes escape their host cell following the exocytosis of specialised secretory vesicles containing proteins with membranolytic activities. At the onset of exflagellation, axonemes become motile and swim out of the residual gametocyte body. As each basal body remains attached to a mitotic spindle pole, they drag a haploid genome that is incorporated into the exflagellating gamete.</p><p>Malaria parasites are highly divergent from model organisms and significant differences in the composition and properties of cell cycle regulators have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerald et al., 2011</xref>). As a consequence little is known about how progression through the cell cycle is regulated in these parasites. Gametocyte stimulation by XA is followed by Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilisation from internal stores after a lag phase of ~10 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billker et al., 2004</xref>) which requires active cGMP-dependent protein kinase G, PKG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brochet and Billker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brochet et al., 2014</xref>). In activated microgametocytes, the plant-like Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase 4 (CDPK4), which belongs to a family absent from the human genome, is required to enter S-phase in the rodent parasite <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billker et al., 2004</xref>). Selective inhibitors of CDPK4 were shown to block exflagellation of <italic>P. berghei in vivo</italic> and of the human parasite <italic>P. falciparum in vitro</italic> placing CDPK4 as a promising drug target to reduce transmission of malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ojo et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2012</xref>).</p><p>Despite the importance of CDPK4 for transmission to the mosquito vector, its molecular functions remain unknown and none of its substrates have been identified. In this study, we took advantage of the highly synchronised nature of <italic>P. berghei</italic> gametogenesis to exactly identify when CDPK4 activity is required. By combining reverse and chemical genetics with molecular and cellular phenotyping, we found that CDPK4 plays at least three distinct roles during male gametogenesis and we identified three effectors mediating each of these roles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A chemical genetic approach to modulate CDPK4 activity with a high time resolution</title><p>Small bumped-kinase inhibitors targeting <italic>Plasmodium</italic> CDPK4 were recently developed by capitalising on a small serine gatekeeper residue in the active site of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ojo et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2012</xref>). One of these, compound 1294, was found to inhibit <italic>P. falciparum</italic> exflagellation through CDPK4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ojo et al., 2014</xref>). To ascertain for 1294 specificity in <italic>P. berghei</italic>, we set out to replace <italic>cdpk4</italic> with a drug-resistant allele, <italic>cdpk4</italic><sup>S147M</sup>-3xHA to prevent binding of 1294 to the ATP binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> parts 1 to 5). We however discovered that introduction of both a C-terminal 3xHA epitope tag and a S147M substitution imposed a fitness cost on CDPK4 function preventing exflagellation. Investigation of the effect of each single modification revealed exflagellation is delayed in CDPK4-3xHA but not in CDPK4<sup>S147M</sup> parasites. This indicates that a S147M substitution only imposes a minor cost that, on its own, does not impact on exflagellation. Compared to the parental wild-type strain, CDPK4<sup>S147M</sup> transgenic parasites showed a ~ 50 fold decrease in exflagellation susceptibility to 1294. Importantly, 1 µM 1294 blocked exflagellation by specifically targeting CDPK4 and this concentration was further used this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26524.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A chemical genetic approach reveals CDPK4 activity is required to initiate the first round of DNA replication, assemble the first mitotic spindle and initiate axoneme motility.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A line expressing a CDPK4<sup>S147M</sup> allele is 50 times more resistant to compound 1294.

In non-activated parasites, around 85% of male gametocytes were haploid. A majority of diploid parasites could be observed between 30 s and 1 min after XA activation, while tetraploid microgametocytes were mainly detected between 2 and 5 min. The three rounds of genome replication seemed to be completed by 6 min when 75% of male parasites were octoploid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> part 8).</p><p>We then investigated the requirement for CDPK4 activity to control genome replications by adding 1294 at different time points during gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Addition of 1294 prior to activation dramatically reduced the ability of male gametocytes to replicate their genome as previously described for CDPK4-KO parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billker et al., 2004</xref>). We were however able to detect 25% of microgametocytes progressing to the diploid state but not further to the tetra- or octoploid levels. When 1294 was added 20 s after activation, no inhibition of DNA replication was observed. Altogether, this reveals that CDPK4 activity between 0 and 20 s post-activation is important for the 1N/2N and subsequent 2N/4N transitions but not for DNA replication per se.</p><p>Interestingly, almost no diploid parasites reached the tetraploid state suggesting that CDPK4 plays a second role between the first and second rounds of genome replication. To test this hypothesis, parasites treated with 1294 or DMSO were imaged 1 min after activation, when the first mitotic spindle is observable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In DMSO treated parasites, 64% of male gametocytes showed spindle-like structures while this proportion decreased to 7% in parasites treated with 1294 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) indicating that CDPK4 activity is also required for mitotic spindle formation.</p><p>We further took advantage of the versatility of the chemical approach to test whether CDPK4 is required later during male gametogenesis. To do so, we added 1294 30 s after activation, a time point at which CDPK4 is not required to initiate DNA replication anymore. With such a treatment, parasites normally developed to the 8N state and assembled axonemes. However, DNA did not condense, axonemes remained around the nucleus and no exflagellation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>). A similar phenotype was observed when 1294 was added only seconds prior to the initial exflagellation events at 9 min post-activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E–F</xref>). However, when added at 15 min post-activation, 1294 did not inhibit flagellar beating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) or ookinete formation and motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> parts 9 and 10). Altogether, this shows that CDPK4 activity seems to be redundant between 30 s and 9 min after activation but is further required at a late stage immediately preceding the onset of axoneme motility, DNA condensation and cytokinesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CDPK4 is part of the MCM complex in non-activated gametocytes and mainly interacts with cytoskeletal proteins in late gametogenesis</title><p>To gain further insights into how CDPK4 regulates these transitions, we first aimed at identifying its interacting proteins in non-activated gametocytes.

We found 103 proteins interacting with CDPK4-3xHA, CDPK4-2xmyc and MCM5-3xHA indicating that CDPK4 and MCM5 share an overlapping molecular environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Cytoskeletal proteins predicted to be components of the microgamete axonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Talman et al., 2014</xref>) were the most abundant and significantly enriched cellular components (p-value=5.10<sup>−4</sup>). It is however important to note that most of this cellular component was also enriched in non-activated gametocytes and that cytoskeletal proteins are abundant in male gametocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khan et al., 2005</xref>). It is currently unclear whether these proteins represent relevant or specific interactors. Nuclear proteins involved in DNA replication were nevertheless much less abundant compared to earlier time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

In eukaryotes, ORC1-6 proteins bind to origin sequences and associate with Cdc6. Cdc6 subsequently recruits the licensing factor Cdt1 and the heterohexameric MCM helicase complex. To investigate the dynamics of the CDPK4/MCM2-7/Cdt1 complex, we compared the CDPK4 interactome in non-activated gametocytes and in 15 second-activated gametocytes in the presence or absence of 1294. For 215 out of the 221 proteins immunoprecipitated with CDPK4-3xHA under all conditions, no obvious differences were detected between the three conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> part 8). However six proteins showed up to 8-fold increase in abundance upon gametocytes activation which was not observed when CDPK4 was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). A similar result was observed when using the CDPK4-2xmyc line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> part 8). Among these proteins were ORC1, ORC2, and ORC5, while the three remaining proteins were not functionally annotated. Sequence analysis indicated that these three proteins likely correspond to homologues of Cdc6, ORC4 and ORC3. PBANKA_110290 contained an AAA ATPase domain and a HMM profile analysis indicated that its closest homologue in human and yeast was Cdc6. Similarly, the closest homologue of PBANKA_134880 was ORC4 in human and yeast. Finally, homologues of PBANKA_051390 were only found in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Babesia</italic> but encoded a PF07034 PFAM domain corresponding to the N-terminus of ORC3. We then determined the relative abundance of MCM5-3xHA in chromatin-enriched NaCl fractions between non-activated and 15 second-activated gametocytes. Western blot analysis showed that 30% of MCM5-3xHA was present in the high salt fraction in non-activated gametocytes. This ratio almost doubled 15 s after activation but remained unchanged in the presence of 1294 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Altogether, this suggests that loading of the MCM2-7/Cdt1 complex onto ORC1-5/Cdc6 complex happens around 15 s after activation of gametogenesis and requires active CDPK4.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Myristoylation of CDPK4 is required to initiate DNA replication but not for axoneme activation</title><p>CDPK4 has previously been shown to be myristoylated in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wright et al., 2014</xref>).

In CDPK4<sup>G2A</sup>-2xmyc extracts, the large isoform migrated slower. In some instances myristoylation has been shown to accelerate electrophoretic mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Demetriadou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>) suggesting that the large isoform is myristoylated. Conversely, the 55 kDa band did not show a different mobility. Proteins can undergo additional post-translational covalent modifications with one or more palmitoyl groups after <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation. Using an acyl-RAC assay, we were however not able to detect significant evidence of CDPK4 palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> part 3). To investigate how myristoylation could regulate CDPK4 function, we first determined its importance for protein localisation and protein-protein interactions. Immunofluorescence assays on CDPK4-2xmyc and CDPK4-3xHA, revealed that CDPK4 showed a broad cellular distribution in microgametocytes at 0 and 15 s after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> part 4). We were however not able to detect any obvious difference in CDPK4<sup>G2A</sup>-2xmyc localisation at both time points. Similarly, immunoprecipitation of CDPK4-2xmyc and CDPK4<sup>G2A</sup>-2xmyc did not reveal any significant changes in interacting partners under the tested conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> parts 5 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Myristoylation is also crucial to promote weak and reversible protein-membrane interactions. The CDPK4-2xmyc 55 kDa isoform was fully solubilised during hypotonic lysis while 90% of the CDPK4-2xmyc large isoform was solubilised during hypotonic lysis and fully released with a subsequent carbonate treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, the large isoform in CDPK4<sup>G2A</sup>-2xmyc lysates was fully solubilised during hypotonic lysis. In parallel we also asked whether CDPK4 could be identified in a chromatin-enriched NaCl fraction. We found a minor population of myristoylated CDPK4-2xmyc in the NaCl fraction which was not observed for CDPK4<sup>G2A</sup>-2xmyc. Altogether this highlights that a major population of CDPK4 is soluble whereas a minor population of the large CDPK4 isoform is associated with membranes and possibly with chromatin.</p><p>As the short CDPK4 isoform did not appear to be myristoylated, we hypothesised it may correspond to a shorter protein whose translation could be initiated at a second start codon. The only possible second start codon upstream the catalytic domain was methionine +57, which we replaced by a codon coding for an alanine residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> part 1). The resulting CDPK4<sup>M57A</sup>-2xmyc line only expressed the large isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) confirming that the translation of the 55 kDa isoform is initiated at a second start codon and cannot be myristoylated. Phenotyping of this line revealed that microgametocytes only expressing the large 63 kDa myristoylated isoform, progressed to the octoploid stage, assembled axonemes but showed a dramatic reduction in exflagellation compared to a control line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Altogether this demonstrates that the large CDPK4 isoform is mainly required to initiate the first round of DNA replication while the short non-myristoylated isoform is essential to complete late gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Interestingly, either short or long CDPK4 isoforms seem to support mitotic spindle assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>CDPK4 phosphorylates multiple proteins in gametocytes</title><p>To better understand how CDPK4 regulates these distinct biological processes we set out to identify its substrates using an analogue sensitive kinase (AS-kinase) engineered to contain a small gatekeeper residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2007</xref>). Bulky ATP analogues have been used to specifically label the targets of such modified kinases.

This suggests that these three proteins are likely to represent CDPK4 physiological substrates to regulate early gametogenesis and were retained for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Eukaryotic homologues contained SAPS domains that have been found to be involved in G<sub>1</sub> to S-phase transitions by associating to SIT4 phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Luke et al., 1996</xref>). SOC1 is also expressed in asexual blood stages and its deletion was associated with a slight fitness cost in these stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> part 2) suggesting its role is conserved in multiple stages of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> life cycle.</p><p>The SOC2-KO line showed a dramatic reduction in exflagellation. Unlike SOC1-KO, proportions of haploid microgametocytes in 10 min activated microgametocytes were similar in the KO and its WT counterpart indicating that SOC2 is not required for initiation of DNA replication and DNA replication per se (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, 47% of the parasites remained diploid and 20% and 16% reached the 4N and 8N levels, respectively. SOC2 could thus represent a CDPK4 effector required to complete mitosis in order to enter the subsequent round of replication. This prompted us to image mitotic spindles in the SOC2-KO line one minute after activation. As opposed to the 820cl1 parental line, we were rarely able to observe incorporation of α-tubulin into distinct mitotic spindles at 1 min post-activation, a phenotype similar to what was observed when control parasites were treated with 1294 prior to activation by XA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). At 10 min post-activation, SOC2-KO showed normal axonemes encircling the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This 623 kDa protein appeared to be specific to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> part 1) and is predicted to encode six transmembrane domains and six sialidase penultimate C-terminal domains. C-terminal 3xHA tagging of SOC2 only allowed detection of a c.a. 140 kDa protein, 70% of which was extracted in PBS. Interestingly, this protein contained the peptide phosphorylated by CDPK4. Immunoprecipitation of SOC2-3xHA recovered peptides mapping on the last 1137 amino acids suggesting SOC2 is processed into at least two different isoforms. The 3xHA tagged C-terminal end of SOC2-3xHA was found to colocalise with mitotic spindles further suggesting a role in their assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Similarly to SOC1, SOC2 is also expressed in asexual blood stages and its deletion was associated with a strong fitness cost in these stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> part 2) suggesting a conserved role in mitotic spindle assembly during the atypical schizogony of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites.</p><p>Finally, SOC3-KO clone did not exflagellate but defects neither in DNA replication nor in axoneme assembly could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) suggesting it represents a crucial effector of CDPK4 to complete cytokinesis. Concordantly, SOC3-3xHA was found to partially colocalise with axonemal α-tubulin in exflagellating microgametes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). As opposed to SOC1 and 2, SOC3 is mainly expressed in the male gametocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Otto et al., 2014</xref>) and deletion of its coding gene was not associated with any growth defect of asexual blood stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> part 2). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that SOC3 is restricted to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species suggesting that the molecular function of SOC3 is highly specific to control the activation of male gametocyte axonemes.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26524.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Functional characterisation of three identified substrates of CDPK4.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A SOC1-KO line shows a strong reduction in exflagellation (n = 3).

The subsequent assembly of mitotic spindles also requires (i) CDPK4 activity within the 30 fist second of gametogenesis and (ii) SOC2 which is a microtubule-associated protein phosphorylated by CDPK4 within the twenty fist seconds of gametogenesis. Between 30 s and 9 min, CDPK4 activity is neither required for the three successive rounds of genome replication and endomitosis nor for the assembly of the eight axonemes.

In eukaryotes, developmentally programmed polyploidy involves the selective loss of mitotic cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) activity and bypassing many of the processes of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zielke et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we have found that CDPK4 represents a pivotal kinase to enter S phase in response to mosquito ingestion by promoting the recruitment of the MCM2-7/Cdt1 complex onto origins of replication. We identified SOC1 as an important effector of CDPK4 in the first twenty seconds of activation for the 1N/2N transition. Although this protein does not contain recognisable domains, conserved eukaryotic homologues of SOC1 contain a SAPS domain (Sit4-associated proteins). In yeast, SAPS proteins function in G<sub>1</sub> to promote timely DNA replication by regulating G1 cyclin transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Luke et al., 1996</xref>). Given the time frame of microgametogenesis it is possible that SOC1 regulates initiation of DNA replication through different mechanisms in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>.</p><p>Genome replications alternate with three endomitotic divisions. We found that SOC2, a second protein that is phosphorylated by CDPK4 within 20 s of activation, is not necessary to reach the 2N level but is important to progress to the 4N state, suggesting this early substrate is not involved in DNA replication but is required to complete the first mitosis. Accordingly, SOC2 localised at the mitotic spindles during mitosis and deletion of its coding gene was associated with marked defects in mitotic spindle formation. It is likely that SOC2 represents a <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-specific microtubule-associated protein required for chromosome segregation by controlling mitotic spindle assembly during the atypical cell cycle of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites. Interestingly most SOC2-KO microgametocytes did not reach the 4N state suggesting a checkpoint might be operational to ensure that the second genome replication is initiated only after successful completion of the first mitosis. This is in agreement with recent findings showing that down-regulation of the cyclin-related kinase 4 leads to defects in both DNA replication and mitotic spindle formation during schizogony of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ganter et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, we show here that regulation of DNA replication and mitotic spindle assembly are simultaneously controlled by a single kinase suggesting that, in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, some S- and M-phase events may be simultaneously co-regulated. However, previous findings showed that small molecules affecting mitotic spindle stability did not impair DNA replication in asexual erythrocytic stages and in microgametocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sinou et al., 1998</xref>) and it remains unclear how cell cycle transitions are regulated in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites. On the other hand, we were able to observe fully formed axonemes in SOC2-KO gametocytes indicating that once initiated, axoneme assembly proceeds independently from some cell cycle checkpoints. Further studies will be required to investigate how S- and M-phase transitions are regulated during the atypical cell cycle of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> microgametes.</p><p>It is only during the final steps of gametogenesis that the eight genomes are incorporated into the eight exflagellating haploid gametes. This is achieved when the forming gamete swims out of the residual gametocyte body and drags a haploid genome that remains attached to a mitotic spindle pole. Here, we have found that CDPK4 activity is also required to initiate axoneme motility and hence, to complete cytokinesis. We have linked this late role to an axoneme associated protein, SOC3. Its deletion did not impair genome replication nor axoneme assembly but blocked axoneme activation. Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is known to be important to initiate axoneme motility but the cause-and-effect relationship between phosphorylation and motility remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wirschell et al., 2011</xref>). From this study, we propose that SOC3 represents a <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-specific phosphoprotein required to initiate axoneme motility and consequently cytokinesis during microgametogenesis.</p><p>Deletion of <italic>soc1</italic> and <italic>soc2</italic> did not block the 1N/2N and 2N/4N transition as drastically as CDPK4 inhibition. This strongly suggests that other identified or non-identified CDPK4 substrates cooperate with SOC1 and SOC2 to load the pre-replicative complex and assemble mitotic spindles. In addition, multiple kinases and phosphatases have been shown to control male gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guttery et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tewari et al., 2010</xref>) and changes in phosphorylation levels between 0 and 18 s after activation highlighted a broad phospho-dependent response. It is thus likely that a plastic phosphorylation-dependent network underlies regulation of the initiation of DNA replication and mitotic spindle assembly and the exact molecular roles of SOC1 and SOC2 and of their phosphorylation remains to be elucidated. Conversely, deletion of <italic>soc3</italic> completely blocked exflagellation suggesting that SOC3 may be a focal component for the activation of axoneme motility.</p><p>During microgametogenesis, CDPK4 activity is essential only during two short time windows: within 10 to 30 s after activation and seconds prior to exflagellation. This highlights that CDPK4 is likely integrating multiple signals to be active at the right time and place. During the first window, the kinase is activated by a PKG-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilisation that occurs ten seconds after XA stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brochet et al., 2014</xref>). Myristoylation of the large CDPK4 isoform is another signal required to initiate the first round of DNA replication but not to initiate axoneme motility. Interestingly, both large myristoylated and short non-myristoylated isoforms seemed to support mitotic spindle assembly. This indicates that myristoylation per se is not essential for CDPK4 activity <italic>in vivo</italic> in the absence of the 56 amino acids upstream of methionine +57. <italic>In vitro</italic>, full length non-myristoylated recombinant CDPK4 proved to be an active enzyme suggesting myristoylation is important for <italic>in vivo</italic> regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ojo et al., 2012</xref>). We were however not able to provide evidence that CDPK4 myristoylation is required for specific cellular targeting nor for protein-protein interactions. Intriguingly, global profiling of protein myristoylation in human revealed that a large part of <italic>N</italic>-myristoyltransferase substrates are localised to the nucleus and mediate nuclear processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Thinon et al., 2014</xref>). Collectively, this suggests that the additional 56 amino acids upstream the second start codon not only serves as an extra sequence to accommodate N-terminal myristoylation but may also represent a regulatory domain to control CDPK4 nuclear functions.</p><p>CDPK4 is regarded as a potential target for a transmission blocking strategy and proof of principle that chemical inhibition of CDPK4 by bumped kinases inhibitors such as 1294 can block <italic>Plasmodium</italic> transmission <italic>in vivo</italic> has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ojo et al., 2012</xref>). It is likely that CDPK4 strict essentiality during malaria transmission is explained by its multiple functions identified in this study. Bumped kinase inhibitors such as 1294 appear to have a broad-spectrum anti-protozoal activity by targeting functional orthologues of CDPK4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Van Voorhis et al., 2017</xref>) and this study provides a first insight into the molecular functions of this atypical Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase. Remarkably, CDPK4 has been previously reported to be important for sporozoite motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Govindasamy et al., 2016</xref>) and oocyst formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billker et al., 2004</xref>), two processes unrelated to male gametogenesis. Similarly, in the related apicomplexan parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, the functional orthologue of CDPK4 (TgCDPK1) is essential for host cell egress and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lourido et al., 2010</xref>). It thus likely that this kinase not only represents a pleiotropic regulator of the cell cycle during gametogenesis but also a broad spectrum regulator of multiple other biological processes in the Apicomplexa.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Parasite maintenance and transfection</title><p><italic>P. berghei</italic> strain ANKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vincke et al., 1966</xref>) derived clone 2.34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billker et al., 2004</xref>), clone 820cl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mair et al., 2010</xref>) and derived transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>) were maintained in CD1 outbred mice.

Co-immunoprecipitation of CDPK4-3xHA, CDPK4-2xmyc, MCM5-3xHA, SOC1-3xHA protein complexes were performed with gametocytes fixed for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde, lysed in RIPA buffer and the supernatant was subjected to affinity purification with magnetics beads conjugated with anti-HA antibody (Roche) or anti-c-myc antibody (Sigma). A WT control was included in parallel and proteins for which we recovered peptides in the WT control were not retained for further analysis.</p><p>In CDPK4-3xHA interaction experiments at 0 and 15 s post-activation, 1 µl/mL of benzonase nuclease was added prior to immunoprecipitation. Magnetic beads were then resuspended in 50 µl of 1x NuPAGE LDS sample loading buffer containing 5 mM TCEP and incubated at 70°C for 10 min. Alkylation was carried out by addition of 2 mM iodoacetamide and incubation at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Samples were separated by polyacrylamide electrophoresis, stained with colloidal Coomassie and processed for mass spectrometry analysis as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pardo et al., 2010</xref>), with each gel lane excised into eight slices. Samples were re-dissolved in 0.5% FA before LC -MS/MS analysis. Samples were re-dissolved in 0.5% FA before LC -MS/MS analysis on LTQ Orbitrap Velos coupled with Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system. Peptides were loaded and desalted on a peptide trap (Acclaim PepMap C18, 100 μm i.d. x 20 mm, 100 Å, 5 μm) at 10 µl/min and then separated on a nano-analytical column (Acclaim PepMap C18, 75 μm i.d. x 250 mm, 100 Å, 3 µm) at a linear gradient of 4–32% ACN/0.1% FA in 60 min (cycle time 95 min) at 300 nl/min. The HPLC, mass spectrometer and columns were all from ThermoFisher (United Kingdom). The Orbitrap mass spectrometer was operated in the standard ‘top 15’ data-dependant acquisition mode while the preview mode was disabled. The MS full scan was set at m/z 380–1600 with the resolution at 30,000 at m/z 400 and the lock mass at 445.1200 and AGC at 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> with a maximum injection time at 200 msec. The 10 most abundant multiply-charged precursor ions, with a minimal signal above 3000 counts, were dynamically selected for CID fragmentation (MS/MS) in the ion trap, which had an AGC set at 5000 with the maximum injection time at 100 msec. The dynamic exclusion duration time was set for 45 s with ±10 ppm exclusion mass width. Raw data was processed with Proteome Discoverer 1.4 and searched with Mascot (MatrixScience) against a combined mouse and <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA database (P.bergheiANKA.proteome, v2 May 2015) with the following parameters: trypsin/P as enzyme, maximum of 2 missed cleavages, 10 ppm parent ion mass tolerance, 0.5 Da fragment ion mass tolerance, and variable modifications of oxidized M, carbamidomethyl C, deamidated NQ, Gln to pyroGlu (N-terminal Q), N-terminal acetylation and N-terminal formylation. Database search results were refined using Mascot Percolator (significance threshold &lt;0.05, FDR &lt; 1%). High confidence peptides were apportioned to proteins using Mascot Protein Family summary. Protein identification required at least three high-confidence unique peptide (FDR &lt; 1%).</p><p>For all other interaction experiments, magnetic beads were suspended in 100 μl of 6 M Urea in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (AB). To this solution, 2 µl of DTT (50 mM in LC-MS grade water) were added and the reduction was carried out at 37°C for 1 hr. Alkylation was performed by adding 2 µl of iodoacetamide (400 mM in distilled water) during 1 hr at room temperature in the dark. Urea concentration was lowered to 1M with 50 mM AB, and protein digestion was performed overnight at 37°C with 15 µL of trypsin Promega (0.2 µg/µl). After beads removal, the sample was desalted with a C18 microspin column (Harvard Apparatus), dried under speed-vacuum, and re-dissolved in H<sub>2</sub>O/CH<sub>3</sub>CN/FA 94.9/5/0.1 before LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. LC-ESI-MS/MS was performed on a Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United Kingdom) equipped with an Easy nLC 1000 system. Peptides were trapped on an Acclaim pepmap100, C18, 3 μm, 75 μm x 20 mm nano trap-column and separated on a 75 μm x 500 mm, C18, 2 μm Easy-Spray column. The analytical separation was run for 90 min using a gradient of H<sub>2</sub>O/FA 99.9%/0.1% (solvent A) and CH<sub>3</sub>CN/FA 99.9%/0.1% (solvent B). The gradient was run as follows: 0–5 min 95% A and 5% B, then to 65% A and 35% B in 60 min, then to 10% A and 90% B in 10 min, and finally stay at 10% A and 90% B for 15 min. The entire run was at a flow rate of 250 nL/min. ESI was performed in positive mode. For MS survey scans, the resolution was set to 70000, the ion population was set to 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> with a maximum injection time of 100 ms and a scan range window from 400 to 2000 <italic>m/z</italic>. For MS2 data-dependent acquisition, up to fifteen precursor ions were selected for higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD). The resolution was set to 17500, the ion population was set to 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> with a maximum injection time of 50 ms and an isolation width of 1.6 m/z units. The normalized collision energies were set to 27%. Peak lists were generated from raw data using the MS Convert conversion tool from ProteoWizard. The peaklist files were searched against the Plasmodium Berghei_ANKA database (<italic>Plasmodium</italic> Genomic Resource, release 28, 5076 entries) using Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.5.1). Trypsin was selected as the enzyme, with one potential missed cleavage. Fragment ion mass tolerance was set to 0.020 Da and parent ion tolerance to 10.0 ppm. Variable amino acid modification was oxidized methionine and fixed amino acid modification was carbamidomethyl cysteine. The mascot search was validated using Scaffold 4.7.3 (Proteome Software). Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability and contained at least three unique identified peptides.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Acyl-resin-assisted capture of S-acylated proteins.</title><p>Purified CDPK4-3xHA gametocytes were lysed in 20 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, 1.5% triton X-100 and protease inhibitor at pH 7.4.

Pellets were solubilised and denatured in 8 M urea/100 mM TEAB/45 mM TCEP at 37°C for 15 min and further diluted to just under 4 M urea with 100 mM TEAB/9 mM TCEP. Proteins were digested with Lys-C (1:300, Wako) at 37°C for 2 hr and further diluted to 1 M urea with 100 mM TEAB/9 mM TCEP and digested with trypsin (1:30, Thermo Fisher) at 37°C for 14 hr. Peptides were desalted on C18 Sep-Pak cartridges (Waters) and dried in SpeedVac, then resolubilised in 20 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.0/50% ACN/1 mM TCEP. The thiophosphopeptides capture used SulfoLink Coupling resin as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hertz et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, the SulfoLink Coupling resin was washed with 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0/50% ACN (binding buffer) then blocked with BSA in the dark for 10 min. The resin was incubated with peptides overnight at 21°C in the dark, then washed sequentially for ten minutes with 50% ACN, H<sub>2</sub>O, 5M NaCl, 50% ACN, 5% FA, 10 mM DTT and H<sub>2</sub>O. Samples were then treated with 1 mg/ml oxone (Sigma) for 2 min (twice) to elute the bond thiophosphopeptides which were converted to phosphopeptides in this step. The eluted peptides were desalted in SDB-XC tip. Phosphopeptides were enriched on TiO<sub>2</sub> tip (Thermo Fisher) and sequentially eluted with 1.5% NH<sub>3</sub> and 5% pyrrolidine (Sigma). Both eluates were treated with 10 mM TCEP for 10 or 15 min, respectively, and acidified before LC-MS/MS analysis on a LTQ Orbitrap Velos coupled with Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher) as for CDPK4-3xHA samples with the following differences: peptides were separated at a linear gradient for 95 min, the mass spectrometer was operated in the standard top 15 data dependent acquisition mode, and ions with a signal above 3000 counts were selected for CID fragmentation. Raw data was processed in Proteome Discoverer 1.4 with both SequestHT and Mascot search engines. The dynamic modifications set in Mascot were Acetyl (Protein N-term), Deamidated (NQ), Iodo(Y), Phospho (STY) and Oxidation (M) with fragment mass tolerance set at 0.8 Da, while in SequestHT the selected dynamic modifications were Deamidated (NQ), Iodo(Y), Phospho (STY) with fragment ions mass tolerance set at 0.5 Da. Precursor mass tolerance was set at 20ppm for both. The peptide list was filtered with Percolator where the q-value was set at 0.01, and the search results were merged.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;CDPK4 is a pleiotropic regulator of Plasmodium transmission with short-lived activity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Markus Meissner (Reviewer #1); Pietro Alano (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a comprehensive, elegant and well-conducted reverse/chemical genetics study on the biochemical functions of CDPK4, a Plasmodium calcium-dependent kinase that was previously shown to be essential for male gametogenesis in both <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and the rodent malaria parasite <italic>P. berghei</italic>. The authors use a gatekeeper mutant enzyme that is resistant to the 1294 inhibitor, providing an exquisite control for the assignment of any phenotype to the kinase itself. Interactomics / biochemical data pertaining to potential substrates are nicely complemented with a phosphoproteomics analysis. Using these approaches, the authors identify three distinct, temporally defined steps, where CDPK4 activity is required during gametogenesis, define the spatiotemporal resolution of CDPK4 action and provide a detailed mechanistic characterisation of the CDPK4 interaction partners and their role during these processes.</p><p>This is a very thorough and well performed characterisation of CDPK4 functions during sexual development. All experiments are well performed and most conclusions correspond to the presented data. This manuscript is a major step towards dissecting the activities of the pleiotropic CDPK4 enzyme in <italic>P. berghei</italic> male gamete activation. It is experimental soundness and originality together with the significance of the obtained results expand its interest beyond the field of malaria parasites.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is a very complex manuscript, which would benefit from rearranging some of the figures/data. For example, the manuscript proposes distinct roles of CDPK4 in controlling an early and a late phase of the increase in ploidy. The supporting data derive from experiments, described in different parts of the manuscript, i) testing effects of the CDPK4 inhibitors at t=0 and 20 seconds from gamete activation, ii) analysing phenotypically the SOC-2 mutant and iii) investigating the morphology of mitotic spindles and axonemes in SOC-2 gametes and in 1294 treated wild type gametes. It is suggested to merge these parts to more clearly and coherently link the relevant supporting data. Further, it would be good to provide an overview table of all the different mutants, their purpose and phenotype (otherwise one is forced to switch constantly between main figures and supplement).</p><p>2) In the analysis of the CDPK4 -myc and -HA interactomes 10 minutes post activation an additional role of CDPK4 in flagellar beating, beyond the one in replication initiation, is emphasized, based on the overrepresentation of cytoskeleton/microtubule associated proteins in this interactome. However, these were top ranking proteins also in the above 15 second interactome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), a finding that was not emphasized in the description of that experiment. The second argument to support the role of CDPK4 in flagellar beating was the comparatively lower abundance of replication associated proteins in this interactome compared to the ones described above, which raises similar questions as above as the total number of CDPK4 peptides in these experiments is significantly lower than those used for the analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.</p><p>3) The text related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> states that the data in these figures depict association of MCMs and CDPK4 with chromatin. Such a conclusion would require additional data, e.g. the use of accepted marker for the chromatin fractions, and/or CHIP/chromatin immunoprecipitations. The data allow to conclude that tagged MCMs/ CDPK4 are enriched in specific solubility fractions, but it seems to me that assign them to chromatin is a bit of an over-interpretation. The text around <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> mentions only chromatin (&quot;we found a minor population of myristoylated CDPK4-2xmyc in the chromatin fraction&quot;, while the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> legend, more accurately, says &quot;a minor population of CDPK4<sup>G2A</sup>-2xmyc i63 is partly associated with membrane or chromatin fractions&quot;. The statement pertaining to chromatin association should be softened throughout, unless additional data are provided.</p><p>4) A general observation is that most of the key conclusions are based on abundance/relative abundance/enrichment of given gene products in the mass spectrometry analysis of the co-IP complexes. Mention of unique and razor peptides and of the normalization procedure are restricted to the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Phosphoproteome profiling” (Methodology) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> does not indicate what numbers are listed (unique peptides?). A synthetic description of the rationale for protein quantification in this label-free proteomics approach would be expected also in the Results section.</p><p>5) The data to support the model that CDPK4 is needed to mediate MCM recruitment to bind the ORC/Cdt1 complex is based on the analysis of the three CDPK4 interactomes i) before gamete activation; ii) 15 seconds after activation with a functional CDPK4 and iii) with a 1294 inhibited CDPK4. How is the overrepresentation of some peptides in the CDPK4 sample at 15 seconds affected by the fact that the total number of peptides in this sample is higher (4000; with those for CDPK4 itself: 255) than that before activation (3879; CDPK4: 238) and in the 1294 inhibited CDKP4 (3415; CDPK4: 207)?</p><p>6)Subsection “CDPK4 activity is required for loading the MCM complex onto chromatin and the ORC”, first paragraph. &quot;…three proteins correspond to Cdc6, ORC3 and ORC4; no ORC6 homologue was identified in the Plasmodium genome&quot;. The fact the three protein were not automatically annotated indicates that they do not conform to the relevant HMM profiles. Please provide the evidence (and the bioinformatics approaches used to generate it) that these three proteins are actually homologues of Cdc6, ORC3 and ORC4 (e.g. phylogenetic trees in Supplementary Information).</p><p>7) Subsection “CDPK4 activity is required for loading the MCM complex onto chromatin and the ORC”, first paragraph. &quot;…suggest that CDP4 activity is required for loading MCM/Cdt onto ORC/Cdc6&quot;. The following sentence reads as an overstatement; the data show that CDPK4 can be co-IPed with Cdc6 and ORC proteins upon activation, but one cannot conclude from these data that &quot;CDP4 activity is required for loading MCM/Cdt onto ORC/Cdc6&quot;. First, there are not data here that pertain to activity; second, an equally valid hypothesis is that CDPK4 is recruited after ORC/Cdc6 have been loaded onto chromatin. Both points are addressed in the following paragraph, which ends with a very similar statement. Consider deleting the first one (&quot;This suggests that CDPK4 activity is required for the loading of the MCM2-7/Cdt1 complex onto ORC1-5/Cdc6 complex within 15 seconds following gametocyte activation by XA&quot;.</p><p>8) The authors generate functional and non-functional versions of CDPK4 and nicely demonstrate the role of CDPK4 during different steps using a gatekeeper mutant and convincingly demonstrate that CDPK4 acts during a ~15 second window. However, they then use the HA-tagged version to identify specific interaction partners, though this version appears to be not functional during this time. This needs to be discussed accordingly. Do the authors obtain similar results using the functional myc-tagged version?</p><p>9) The authors used AS-kinase to identify substrates of CDPK4. Are these substrates also interaction partners identified in the Co-IPs? Could the author discuss this in more detail?</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. The imaging (in general) needs to be substantially improved. Please indicate what exactly we are looking at.</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. As the authors acknowledge themselves, the identified proteins are not necessarily indicating direct interactions with CDPK4, especially since later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The primary targets were identified using AS-kinase. As such this panel is rather distracting from the core message of the study.</p><p>12) In the analysis of CDPK4 myristoylation, the mobility shift of the higher band of the CDPK4 G2A mutant in the Western Blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) does not seem sufficient to support the major conclusion that CDPK4 in <italic>P. berghei</italic> is myristoylated as in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. In the first paragraph of the subsection “Myristoylation of CDPK4 is required for its nuclear functions but not to complete gametogenesis”, discussing these results, is very confusing. &quot;In CDPK4<sup>G2A</sup>-2xmyc extracts, the large isoform migrated slower, as expected in the absence of myristoylation&quot;. Does it imply that myristoylation is known to accelerate electrophoretic mobility of proteins? If so, a reference would be useful. If not, the paragraph should be re-worded and the point made clearer.</p><p>13) The authors use a G2A mutant, which cannot be myristoylated. For the localisation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) they then use cross-reactive antibodies that appear to stain the surface. This will not lead to any conclusive results and therefore this analysis needs to be repeated with non-cross-reactive antibodies (or alternatively a different tagged version of CDPK4). Is CDPK4 also palmitoylated? On the same point, in the absence of any obvious mislocalisation of the CDPK4 G2A mutant protein in the microgametocyte compared to the wild type, putatively myristoylate enzyme, it could be interesting to observe if changes of localization occur (and differ between wild type and the G2A mutant) upon gamete activation.</p><p>14) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: The use of the AS-kinase is very elegant and one of the strength of this paper. The authors identify 19 peptides. Are any of the proteins in their interactome analysis also found in this approach.</p><p>15) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>.

In the light of the reviewers’ comments we agree this might be confusing and make it difficult to link the three phenotypes of CDPK4 inhibition. We have now grouped the description of the three identified roles of CDPK4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and subsequently describe the interactomes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. We have modified the text accordingly. As suggested by the reviewers we have added a supplemental table listing all the different mutants, their purpose and main phenotype.</p><p><italic>2) In the analysis of the CDPK4 -myc and -HA interactomes 10 minutes post activation an additional role of CDPK4 in flagellar beating, beyond the one in replication initiation, is emphasized, based on the overrepresentation of cytoskeleton/microtubule associated proteins in this interactome.

The microtubule cytoskeleton is indeed enriched in most immunoprecipitates from gametocytes and may represent non-relevant or even non-specific interactions. To avoid any confusion we have removed the panel D of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The number of total peptides that were recovered in these experiments were indeed lower as peptides were directly digested on the beads and not after gel separation. To avoid such bias, we only use relative protein abundance in our quantification (please see point 5 for more details).</p><p><italic>3) The text related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> states that the data in these figures depict association of MCMs and CDPK4 with chromatin.

We calculate the relative abundance of each protein by dividing the number of spectral counts for each protein by the number of total spectral counts in the respective immunoprecipitate.</p><p>Due to technical reasons, the number of spectral count is indeed variable across the different conditions. However, for the vast majority of identified proteins, the relative abundance is similar between the three conditions as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref> with correlation coefficients of ca 0.95 between each condition. For example, CDPK4 represents 6.3, 6.1, and 6.0% of total spectral counts, at 0 sec, 15 sec + XA and 15 sec + XA + 1294, respectively. Similarly, the relative abundance of the MCM complex is similar across the three conditions representing 5.7, 6.0 and 5.4% at 0 sec, 15 sec + XA, and 15 sec + XA + 1294, respectively. However, the ORC/Cdc6 complex is relatively more abundant in activated gametocytes with 3.1% at 15 sec + XA compared with 1.0 and 1.6% at 0 sec, and 15 sec + XA + 1294, respectively.</p><p><italic>6)Subsection “CDPK4 activity is required for loading the MCM complex onto chromatin and the ORC”, first paragraph. &quot;…three proteins correspond to Cdc6, ORC3 and ORC4; no ORC6 homologue was identified in the Plasmodium genome&quot;.

We now explain in more detail in the main text and in the Methods that HMM profiles and/or domain analysis strongly suggest that these three proteins likely correspond to Cdc6, ORC3 and ORC4. However, this would have to be experimentally confirmed. This also holds true for all the other components of the pre-replicative complex.</p><p><italic>7) Subsection “CDPK4 activity is required for loading the MCM complex onto chromatin and the ORC”, first paragraph. &quot;…suggest that CDP4 activity is required for loading MCM/Cdt onto ORC/Cdc6&quot;.

We tried to C-terminally tag ORC2 with a 3xHA epitope to test this hypothesis but such a modification prevented exflagellation (data not shown). However inhibition of CDPK4 activity by 1294 prevents the stronger interaction between CDPK4/MCM2-7/Cdt1 with ORC1-5/Cdc6 and the enrichment of MCM5 in the NaCl fraction pertaining to activity. We do agree that CDPK4 may have additional functions independent of its kinase activity and may, for example, also serve as a chaperone for the pre-replicative complex.</p><p><italic>8) The authors generate functional and non-functional versions of CDPK4 and nicely demonstrate the role of CDPK4 during different steps using a gatekeeper mutant and convincingly demonstrate that CDPK4 acts during a ~15 second window.

We observed delayed exflagellation for this line. This suggests that although the enzyme activity may be affected it does not dramatically affect DNA replication. A stronger interaction at 15 sec compared with 0 sec was also obtained using a CDPK4-2xmyc line which does not show delayed exflagellation.

We have now included these references in the text. It will unfortunately be very difficult to investigate incorporation of radioactively labelled myristate in this model as <italic>P. berghei</italic> gametocytes are produced in vivo, and down-regulation of NMT with a tetracycline-inducible system strongly affected parasite replication and consequently gametocytogenesis (PMID 23245327).</p><p><italic>13) The authors use a G2A mutant, which cannot be myristoylated.

As a role in mitotic spindle assembly was only found late in our project we did not quantify this aspect. We have now quantified the percentage of cell showing mitotic spindle structures at 1 min for WT, WT + 1294, and SOC2-KO lines. We also took this opportunity to check the formation of mitotic spindles in CDPK4<sup>G2A</sup>-2xmyc at 1 min post-activation. As the CDPK4<sup>M57A</sup>-2xmyc mutant which only encodes for the myristoylable isoform was able to go through the first mitosis we expected the CDPK4<sup>G2A</sup>-2xmyc line to be defective for mitotic spindle assembly. However, the analysis revealed that CDPK4<sup>G2A</sup>-2xmyc mutant did not show any defect for this process indicating that both short and long isoforms could support mitotic spindle assembly. We have now included this finding in the Results and Discussion sections.</p></body></sub-article></article>
