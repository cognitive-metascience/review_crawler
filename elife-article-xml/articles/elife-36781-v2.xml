behaviors. Most experimental work on this subject has focused on forebrain mechanisms. Using a novel evidence-accumulation task for mice, we performed recording and perturbation studies of crus I of the lateral posterior cerebellum, which communicates bidirectionally with numerous forebrain regions. Cerebellar inactivation led to a reduction in the fraction of correct trials. Using two-photon fluorescence imaging of calcium, we found that Purkinje cell somatic activity contained choice/evidence-related information. Decision errors were represented by dendritic calcium spikes, which in other contexts are known to drive cerebellar plasticity. We propose that cerebellar circuitry may contribute to computations that support accurate performance in this perceptual decision-making task.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>decision-making</kwd><kwd>evidence accumulation</kwd><kwd>working memory</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH115577</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deverett</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS090541</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deverett</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name><name><surname>Koay</surname><given-names>Sue Ann</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Samuel S-H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS104648</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deverett</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name><name><surname>Koay</surname><given-names>Sue Ann</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Samuel S-H</given-names></name><name><surname>Oostland</surname><given-names>Marlies</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH115750</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Samuel S-H</given-names></name><name><surname>Oostland</surname><given-names>Marlies</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS045193</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Samuel S-H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007429</institution-id><institution>Nancy Lurie Marks Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Samuel S-H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In a new evidence-accumulation decision-making task, activity of the lateral posterior cerebellum is necessary for accurate performance, and somatic and dendritic activity in Purkinje cells contains choice/evidence and error-related information.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although the cerebellum is best known for its role in controlling movement, clinical and experimental evidence have long indicated that the posterior cerebellum regulates a wide range of cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Konarski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schmahmann and Sherman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stoodley et al., 2012</xref>), including decision-making and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blackwood et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Desmond et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ernst et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kansal et al., 2017</xref>). For example, focal cerebellar lesions in humans lead to impairment in working memory performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gottwald, 2004</xref>), and cerebellar fMRI activation increases with working memory demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">KÃ¼per et al., 2016</xref>). However, very little is known about the circuit mechanisms supporting these roles.</p><p>In the domain of movement control, the cerebellum is thought to use sensory and internal information as a means of adjusting action on a subsecond scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krakauer and Shadmehr, 2006</xref>). The cerebellar cortex consists of highly characteristic circuitry occurring in repeating modules which are likely to perform similar manipulations on information irrespective of whether the information is sensory, motor, or neither (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Popa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reeber et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, well-established models of cerebellar motor learning may be expanded to support the control of cognitive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ito, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Neuronal correlates of the perceptual decision-making process have been studied using behavioral tasks in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carandini and Churchland, 2013</xref>) including evidenceÂ accumulation paradigms in which animals must continuously update the contents of working memory to guide a decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morcos and Harvey, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pinto et al., 2018a</xref>). Behavioral performance in these tasks develops over time and can be marked by decision side biases, history effects, and error rates that diminish with training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pinto et al., 2018a</xref>). The detailed mechanisms by which accurate decisions are formed and errors are reduced remain unsolved.</p><p>Neurons in multiple brain structures across species have been found to represent various stages in the transformation from sensory information to decision signals. These regions include prefrontal, premotor, parietal, and primary and secondary sensory cortices, striatum, midbrain structures, and possibly others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akrami et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brody and Hanks, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Scott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yartsev et al., 2018</xref>).

Like previously developed decision-making tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morcos and Harvey, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</xref>), our task demands dynamic manipulation of working memory and decision-making under uncertainty, which recruit cerebellar activation in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blackwood et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kansal et al., 2017</xref>), as well as the correction of errors, a cerebellar role that may extend beyond the motor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ito, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A decision-making task for cerebellar investigations</title><p>To study decision-making in the cerebellum, we developed a task with five key properties: (1) integration of evidence over seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Scott et al., 2015</xref>), (2) minimal movement until presentation of a readout cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</xref>), (3) task structure to match established decision-making frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>), (4) sensorimotor engagement of the lateral posterior cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Manni and Petrosini, 2004</xref>), and (5) amenability to head-fixed conditions to facilitate two-photon imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dombeck et al., 2007</xref>). In our evidenceÂ accumulation task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), each trial contains a 3.8 s cue period in which a series of air puffs (pieces of evidence) is delivered to the left and right whiskers. Then, following a short delay period with no stimuli, lick ports are brought into the animalâs reach and mice lick leftward or rightward to indicate which side received the greater number of stimuli, with a correct response leading to a water reward to end the trial.

Behavioral regression analysis demonstrates that mice used evidence throughout the entire cue period to guide decisions, with a bias for evidence toward the end of the cue period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), similar to some recency strategies that have been documented in human evidence accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Lange et al., 2010</xref>). Like other tasks in which movement is minimal until a go cue is presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Scott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</xref>), mice learned not to lick during evidence presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This task can therefore be used to study working memory, evidence accumulation, and decision-making under head-fixed conditions.</p><p>We focused our study on the ansiform area (crus I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Luo et al., 2017</xref>) of the posterior hemispheric cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), a region that evolutionarily expandedÂ inÂ tandem with prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balsters et al., 2010</xref>) and communicates bidirectionally with forebrain regions including prefrontal, parietal, and somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kelly and Strick, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Prevosto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Proville et al., 2014</xref>). This cerebellar region represents orofacial features under anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Manni and Petrosini, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shambes et al., 1978</xref>), suggesting that it might aid in processing complex task-related information. First, to determine whether activity in this cerebellar region participates in the decision-making behavior, we injected the GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist muscimol bilaterally into crus I. Inactivations reduced choice accuracy while leaving intact the ability to lick and perform trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). To quantify the behavioral effects of the perturbation, we fit the inactivation data to a logistic regression model that considers the animalâs choice on a trial-by-trial basis as a function of current evidence, the previous trial choice and outcome, and a bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Busse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Licata et al., 2017</xref>).

These classifiers accurately decoded the upcoming choice and the side with greater evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), indicating that as a population, the imaged neurons encode behaviorally relevant features of the decision-making process.</p><p>Because choice and evidence are correlated when mice successfully perform the task, we asked whether choice- or evidence-related information existed independently at the population level in the neuronal signals. To separate the two, we determined how decoding accuracy changed after removing information about one of the variables, by shuffling its identity across trials while holding the other variable constant. For example, when the choice on each trial was randomly assigned to another trial with the same sensory evidence, choice decoding accuracy dropped significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, top panel, top two traces). The difference in decoding accuracy between the original and shuffled data indicates the magnitude of independent choice-related information in the population-level neural activity. We performed the converse test as well, shuffling evidence while holding choice constant, and found that evidence-related information is also represented independently in population-level neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, bottom panel). Therefore, somatic signals encode both choice- and evidence-related information.</p><p>The encoding of choice and evidence variables suggests that these neurons might play a role in decision-making computations. However, in an alternative hypothesis, the somatic signals we observed might represent motor behaviors that occur as an independent consequence of the decision-making process, for example by encoding motor commands for licking or other movements. The imaged region is known to encode primarily orofacial features in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bosman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Manni and Petrosini, 2004</xref>).

Of these choice-selective cells, 63% (162/256) exhibited greater activity in left-choice trials, compared with 37% (94/256) in right-choice trials. While recordings from a single (left) hemisphere might have been expected to produce strongly lateralized representations, these mixed representations of left and right choices are consistent with neocortical recordings in decision-making, particularly in frontal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Erlich et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We next asked how Purkinje cells represented evidence. We observed cells in which cue-period activity was modulated by the strength of evidence presented, and responses to individual sensory events were apparent in some cells as puff-triggered averages that rose and fell in approximately 1 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Therefore, to quantify the extent to which the strength of evidence affected the activity of each neuron, we used linear regression to fit trial-by-trial dependence of pre-decision fluorescence on evidence quantity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), where evidence was defined as the total number of right puffs (#R) or left puffs (#L) in a trial. Based on the significance and coefficients of these fits, each cell was categorized as having either a positive (+) or negative (-) relationship between fluorescence and evidence on the left (#L), right (#R), or both (#L,#R) sides. We found significant relationships in 26% (216/843) of neurons, with most cells exhibiting a correlation with single-sided evidence (+L, -L,Â +R, and -R; 178 cells), and a smaller number showing a correlation with a linear sum or difference of evidence (Â±(L,R)/Â±(L, -R), 38 cells). Therefore, individual cells were predominantly but not exclusively sensitive to evidence presented on one side, consistent with properties of some neocortical neurons in evidence accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Scott et al., 2017</xref>).

This convergence of task-relevant information onto Purkinje cells suggests that cerebellar activity may play important roles in decision-making, consistent with established hypotheses of cerebellar function in complex domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ito, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Cerebellar crus I communicates with numerous forebrain structures including somatosensory, frontal, and parietal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Prevosto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Proville et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Strick et al., 2009</xref>) via the ventral dentate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parker et al., 2017</xref>) and thalamic intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asanuma et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dum and Strick, 2003</xref>). Posterior hemispheric cerebellar cortex and its principal target, the dentate nucleus, show sensorimotor activity relating to whisker sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bosman et al., 2010</xref>), licking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gaffield et al., 2016</xref>), and reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wagner et al., 2017</xref>), as well as preparatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Middleton and Strick, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Popa et al., 2017</xref>) and firing rate ramps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashmore and Sommer, 2013</xref>) that can influence thalamocortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parker et al., 2017</xref>). The cerebellum is thought to use information from elsewhere in the brain to form internal models that predict and modulate brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ito, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marr, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>). In the context of our decision-making task, the lateral posterior cerebellum may receive evidence/decision-related efference copy from forebrain regions, where evidence and decision-related variables have been observed and proposed to support decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ding and Gold, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Licata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morcos and Harvey, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</xref>). Thus, the cerebellum is positioned to be part of a closed feedback-loop circuit in which it both receives and sends task-related information.</p><p>Previous studies have established a sophisticated conceptual framework for understanding the computational basis for evidence accumulation and decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Juavinett et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morcos and Harvey, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Scott et al., 2017</xref>). Our results are a first stage of discovery suggesting that the cerebellum may constitute an additional node in the distributed network of regions that support this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pinto et al., 2018b</xref>). Muscimol disrupted the proportion of correct choices without disrupting the ability to make a choice. This suggests that the lateral posterior cerebellum modulates not the mechanics of action, but rather processes that precede the brainâs commitment to act. Our fits to a behavioral choice model indicate that reduced performance was accompanied by a decreased weighting of evidence and increased weighting of choice history parameters. The increased dependence on trial history is interesting in light of recently reported sensory history effects in parietal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akrami et al., 2018</xref>). Complementary to association areas in the neocortex, signals emerging from the cerebellum are known to reach thalamic targets which send widespread projections throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Strick et al., 2009</xref>), situating the cerebellum in a position to modulate one or many components of forebrain processing.</p><p>Our imaging of Purkinje cell somata revealed ramps of fluorescence. Cytoplasmic calcium acts as a temporally filtered readout of firing rate, limited by calcium removal times that are slower in Purkinje cells (seeÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Konnerth et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lev-Ram et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fierro and Llano, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rokni and Yarom, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ramirez and Stell, 2016</xref>) than in neocortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Preliminary electrical recordings also showed ramps, consistent with the idea that temporally filtered firing rate ramps may account for the observed fluorescence signals.</p><p>These somatic signals represented task-relevant information related to choice and evidence variables, although it remains an open question as to whether these signals precisely track accumulated evidence over time. They could exhibit firing ramps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</xref>), steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Latimer et al., 2015</xref>), or more complex response profiles that form a temporal basis for evidence accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Scott et al., 2017</xref>). The evidence representations we observed were primarily of single-sided evidence, consistent with neural recordings in PPC and FOF of rats performing a similar task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Scott et al., 2017</xref>). This could indicate that cerebellar involvement is upstream of the calculation of the decision variable (#R-#L), and we consider this a likely possibility. It is also notable that some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Scott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Scott et al., 2015</xref>) have suggested that the decision-making process may be supported by two weakly coupled single-sided accumulators, which may modify the interpretation of our results. Whichever the case may be, the neural activity we observed contains task-relevant information that may be used during evidence accumulation and decision-making.</p><p>Cerebellar theories propose that the mossy fiber-granule cell pathway encodes contextual or efference-copy signals which are used to generate short-term predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shadmehr et al., 2010</xref>). Climbing fiber activity may shape the processing of granule cell inputs by inducing plasticity at multiple cerebellar sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albus, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marr, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Medina and Lisberger, 2008</xref>). For example, climbing fiber-derived error signals may modify synaptic weights at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, providing a mechanism for weighting the contextual signals entering the cerebellum. This motivated us to ask whether in this task, signals may be observed in this pathway that report errors, for example of the outcome of the animalâs choice. We observed an excess of dendritic calcium events coincident with decision errors, which has not been previously reported in the cerebellum. If the error-associated response were analogous to dopamine reward prediction errors, one might have expected strong modulation of the error response magnitude by trial difficulty, with the easiest trials producing the largest error response. However, no such trend was apparent.</p><p>We suppose that these dendritic signals might not represent graded information but rather a more categorical signal for updating the cerebellar representation. It might alternatively be the case that the slight but non-significant trend weÂ did observe, which appears inverted relative to traditional reward error signals, could be an example of inverted reward signalling seen elsewhere in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2007</xref>). In all cases, the consequences of this error signalling could be reflected in the behavioral learning of the animal, as found via trial-by-trial analyses in some motor tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Medina and Lisberger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Ten Brinke et al., 2017</xref>), but such effects are difficult to resolve in decision-making tasks like ours where learning is slow, spanning a period of many days or weeks.</p><p>The involvement of the cerebellum, with its clearly delineated cell types and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dean et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ito, 2012</xref>) opens many attractive avenues for future studies in decision-making. The data presented in this study suggest multiple possible roles for cerebellar involvement in evidence-accumulation-based decision-making. For example, output signals from the cerebellum may be combined with signals in sensory circuits to control the input gain of sensory information into accumulators elsewhere in the brain. This model would be consistent with observations of cerebellar involvement in gating sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apps et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ozden et al., 2012</xref>) and inputs to working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sobczak-Edmans et al., 2016</xref>). In a second possibility, the cerebellum may modulate dynamics of the accumulation process. Finally, cerebellar signals may modulate activity that converts the accumulator value into a decision. Such a post-categorization influence has been observed in prefrontal regions during evidence accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Erlich et al., 2015</xref>). Detailed inactivation studies with high spatial and temporal precision can resolve these alternatives. In all cases, activity from the cerebellum may be combined with activity in forebrain structures to produce a refined signal that is more likely to yield a reward.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Experimental procedures were approved by the Princeton University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and performed in accordance with the animal welfare guidelines of the National Institutes of Health.

After surgery, dummy cannulas were kept in guide pedestals at all times when injections were not being performed, and were changed approximately every 3 days. For electrophysiology experiments, headplates as described above were implanted, and a 2 mm craniotomy was drilled over crus I and the dura removed. Per animal, one 64-channel silicon probe (Neuronexus, Buzsaki64-H64LP_30 mm in two mice and A4 Ã 16-Poly2-5mm-23s-200â177 H64_30 mm in one mouse) was placed on a custom-printed probe holder (designed in Blender and printed on a Formlabs Form2 3D printer), and lowered into crus I.

Ground and reference wires were attached to two stainless steel screws (000â120 Ã 1/16 SL bind machine screws, Antrin miniature specialties, Inc) above the forebrain. Absolute Dentin (Parkell) was used to secure the probe to the skull, and to create a well which was filled with silicone gel (Dow Corning 3â4680) and ophthalmic ointment (Puralube) to cover the craniotomy before being further secured using dental cement (C and B Metabond, Parkell Inc.) and dental acrylic (Jet Denture Repair, Lang Dental Manufacturing Co.).

For two mice in one session each, the mice stood on a cylindrical treadmill instead of the tube. Mice were head-fixed using custom head bars screwed into the head plate, angled with the anterior end downward at 18.5 degrees from the horizontal.

Licks were detected via completion of one of two parallel electrical circuits for the left and right ports. Puff ports and lick ports were positioned in individual custom-machined polyoxymethylene brackets. The lick port bracket was mounted to a linear actuator (Actuonix, L16/P16 Mini linear actuator with feedback) which enabled retraction of the ports to and from the reach of the animalâs tongue (within approximately 300 ms). The ports, brackets, and actuator were mounted via a custom-machined bracket to a micromanipulator (Sutter Instrument Company, MP-285 motorized micromanipulator) for precise positioning of the apparatus in a unique position for each animal. The entire experimental apparatus was mounted on a translatable stage (Danaher Precision Systems) atop a rotating optical breadboard (Thorlabs, RBB12A) to allow custom positioning in the x, y, and rotational axes for imaging.

Mice were trained and imaged in 40- to 70 min behavioral sessions, corresponding to 200â300 trials. A session consisted of trials each ranging from 10 to 20 s in duration. In the first phase of the trial, a start tone was presented, followed by a 1 s delay. Next, in the âcue period,â puffs of air (40 ms duration) were delivered to the whiskers over a period ranging from 1 to 5 s (for all but two sessions, this duration was 1.5 or 3.8 s with 0.15 and 0.85 probability respectively), randomly selected in each trial. The total number of puffs presented was determined by a Poisson process with a rate of 2.5 Hz, a ratio of 1:4 puffs on the two sides, and constrained to a minimum inter-puff interval of 200 ms on each side. In addition to these puffs, bilateral puffs were simultaneously delivered at the start and end of the cue period of every trial. The correct side for a given trial was defined as the side with more puffs, regardless of the generative rates for the two sides. This was followed by a delay period of 200 ms. Then, in the decision phase, the lick ports were brought into the range of the mouseâs mouth, and the mouse made a decision by licking the left or right port at any point over a period of 3 s. The decision was defined as the side of the port licked first, regardless of subsequent licks. If the animal licked the correct port, a water reward (4 ÂµL) was immediately dispensed from that port. If the animal licked the incorrect port, an error sound played and no water was delivered. Following the decision was a 3 s phase for the consumption of the reward, if the animal received one. In most experiments, ports were maintained in the lick position for the same duration even in the absence of a reward, but in some sessions, ports were immediately retracted after errors. Following the reward phase was a intertrial interval of 3.5 or 6 s for correct and error trials, respectively. If the mouse made contact with either lick port at any point before the decision phase of the trial, an auditory tone was played, and the trial was cancelled and excluded from analyses. If the mouse made no decision lick, the trial was excluded from analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Training</title><p>Mice were trained to perform the task through a behavioral shaping procedure which typically spanned a period of 10â20 days. In the first stage of training, trials consisted of a 1 s cue period with the same puff rates as the final task, except all puffs following an initial bilateral puff were presented on the correct side only. A water reward was delivered on the correct side in each trial regardless of the actions of the mouse. When a mouse consumed 14 consecutive rewards, it was advanced to the next stage. In the next stage, trial structure remained similar to the previous stage, except rewards were delivered only if the mouse licked the port on the correct side for a given trial at any point in the 3 s response window. In addition, the delay period was extended to 1.3 s during which periodic (2.5 Hz) guide puffs were delivered on the correct side from the end of the cue period until the animal made a decision. To advance, mice completed at least 100 trials at this stage, with 55% correct in a window of 40 consecutive trials, where a correct trial was defined as a match between the side licked first and the correct side for that trial. In the next stage, trial structure remained similar, except bilateral puffs were included at the end of the cue period. In this stage, rewards were only delivered if the first detected lick was on the correct side. As in the final version, error trials included a buzzer sound and a prolonged inter-trial interval. To advance, mice completed at least 200 trials at this stage, with at least 80% correct trials in a consecutive window of 50 trials. In the next stage, the cue period duration was selected randomly as either 2, 2.8, or 3.8 s, with 0.4, 0.3, and 0.3 probability respectively, with a delay period of 200 ms, and guide puffs were no longer delivered. After 100 trials at this stage, and at least 75% correct in a window of 40 trials, mice were advanced. In the next stage, the cue period was its final 3.8 s duration. After a minimum of 125 trials at this stage, and at least 80% correct trials in a window of 25 consecutive trials, mice were advanced to the next stage. In this stage, mice were required to accumulate evidence, with a generative evidence rate ratio of 1:9 for the two sides. When mice completed at least 300 trials and at least 80% correct in 40 consecutive trials, they were advanced to the final task (described above).</p><p>Four anti-biasing procedures were implemented during the behavior. First, the probability of drawing a trial on a given side was weighted to produce more trials on the side with worse performance. This mechanism was implemented if in a window of 6 consecutive trials on each side, performance (fraction correct) on one side was 1.5x greater than on the other. In that case, the draw probability of a trial on the worse side was set equal to the ratio of performances on the better to the worse side within the six-trial anti-biasing window. Second, when the same bias metric exceeded 2x, a larger water reward volume (either 1.2 or 1.4 Âµl, chosen randomly) was given with 60% probability. Third, if bias persisted at the 2x threshold for five consecutive trials, the experimental apparatus was shifted 50 Âµm toward the side of better performance to bring the stimuli and lick ports of the worse side closer to the animal. At the start of each session, a set of 15â30 warm-up trials were delivered drawing from one or two stages preceding the current one in the shaping procedure, and in warm-up trials of the first four shaping stages, the correct side, instead of being randomized, was alternated. Mice were trained for a maximum of 70 min and a minimum of 40 min unless the animal stopped licking for extended periods of time sooner, in which case they were dismounted early. Occasionally, manual rewards were delivered to encourage licking, and stage advancements or decrements were performed manually to suit animal performance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Muscimol inactivation experiments</title><p>Mice were trained until they achieved at least 70% correct on the final version of the task in two consecutive sessions. Mice were then subjected to injection sessions, corresponding to saline or muscimol in a randomized order across mice. On injection days, mice were anaesthetized using isoflurane (2â3% for induction and maintenance) for approximately 20 min, during which 100â120 nL of either muscimol (Sigma M1523, 2 mg/ml in sterile saline) or saline were delivered through the injection cannulas (Plastics One, Internal 33GA, 0.9 mm proj) at a rate of 50 nL/min, using an automated injection system (World Precision Instruments Micro4). The injection cannula was left in place for 3 min following each injection to allow diffusion of the solution into the brain. Approximately 1 hr post-injection, mice were mounted on the rig and performed a behavioral session. On at least 2Â days prior to the first injection, mice were anesthetized with the same protocol prior to their behavioral sessions in order to acclimatize them to anesthesia. When mice performed below 65% on a session, one or two recovery sessions with no injections were subsequently given such that the animal returned to at least 70% performance, before any additional injection sessions. Confidence intervals for performance in each session were computed as binomial proportion confidence intervals using the Jeffreys method.</p><p>Following the completion of the study (by approximately 3 weeks), mice were injected under the identical protocol with a fluorescent solution (1.8 mg/mL fluorescein (Fisher Scientific S25328) and 0.5 mg/mL CTB-555 (Invitrogen C22843) in sterile saline) to recover the location and spread of the muscimol injection site.

The manually selected dendritic ROI were subsequently refined using the following procedure: for each ROI, the mean activity of all pixels inside the ROI was extracted for each frame in the behavioral session, yielding a single time series. The Pearson correlation coefficient was computed between this time series and every pixel in the dataset. These correlation coefficients were assembled into a correlation coefficient image with the same dimensions as an imaged frame, and regions of interest were automatically extracted from this image by applying a median filter, followed by thresholding the image at two standard deviations above the mean, then detecting and selecting the connected component that most overlapped with the manual ROI. The resulting ROI was excluded if it contained less than 0.5 or greater than 3.5 times the number of pixels in the manually selected ROI. After all ROI were refined in this way, a second processing step merged overlapping and highly correlated ROI to ensure that the resulting ROI corresponded to unique physiological sources. First, mean activity time series traces were extracted for each refined ROI. Next, the pairwise correlation coefficients of traces from each ROI were computed, and an undirected graph was constructed where each ROI composed a node, and edges were placed between nodes with correlation values exceeding a threshold of 0.5. Next, connected component clusters in the graphs with greater than one node were subjected to the following procedure: for each pair of ROI within the cluster, the two ROI were merged ifÂ &gt;50% of either ROIâs pixels was contained within the otherâs boundaries. A similar graph-based approach was used to detect neighboring ROI with high correlations corresponding to a single cellular origin; if the correlation values of two ROI exceeded 0.8 and they fell within 5 micrometers of each other, they were merged. Finally, pixels within the motion boundaries of the motion-corrected images were removed from all ROI.</p><p>For each ROI, the mean activity of all pixels in the ROI was computed for each frame, yielding raw time series data. âF/F<sub>0</sub> was then computed from these raw traces, with baseline F<sub>0</sub> being computed as the minimum of a median-filtered (1 s kernel) 12 s sliding window preceding each time point. Somatic data analysis was restricted to trials with matching 3.8 s cue periods, which comprised 85% of trials. Dendritic data analysis included trials of all cue period durations.</p><p><italic>Modulation index r</italic> was defined as Pearsonâs correlation between the somatic calcium signal of a given cell and a uniform time vector (âcue-period timeâ).

For other analyses, <italic>r</italic> was computed over the mean somatic signal in the specified time period. For comparison of <italic>r</italic> in the pre-cue period and cue period, <italic>r</italic> was computed over a 2 s period immediately preceding, or in the middle of the cue period, respectively. For all other analyses, <italic>r</italic> was computed over the duration of the cue period. Significance of this modulation was computed by comparing the fraction of cells for which |r<sub>cue period</sub>| exceeded |r<sub>pre-cue period</sub>|. The 95% confidence interval for this fraction was computed using bootstrapping: cells were randomly sampled with replacement to create resampled datasets (nÂ =Â 10,000), and the same fraction was computed for each of these datasets. Boundaries of the confidence interval were then computed as the 5th and 95th percentile of these bootstrapped fractions. Return to baseline was computed by comparing the mean activity of each cell before the cue period and after the inter-trial interval; in total, 198,542 such comparisons were made for all cells in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-6"><title>Analysis of electrophysiological recordings.Â </title><p>High-pass filtering of the raw data at 300 Hz, common median referencing, and automatic spike sorting was achieved using Kilosort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">cortex-lab, 2018</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cortex-lab/Kilosort">https://github.com/cortex-lab/Kilosort</ext-link>).

Each trial was segmented into 400 ms time bins, in which the mean activity of each cell (somatic decoding) or the mean movement index for each movement feature (behavioral decoding) was computed. For each time point, the vector of these mean values was used to predict the behavioral variable (upcoming choice or side with more total evidence at end of trial) by logistic regression. Each regression was scored by k-fold cross validation with kÂ =Â 5. Because choice and evidence are correlated in the behavioral task, we employed a procedure to investigate their effects separately. First, to determine whether evidence-related information was contained in the neural activity independently of choice-related information: we compared evidence-decoding accuracy with accuracy on a shuffled dataset in which the side of evidence on each trial was randomly assigned to another trial in which the same choice was made as the original trial. In this shuffled dataset, all evidence-decoding accuracy arises from correlated choice-related information, since evidence-related information was removed; therefore, any excess decoding performance relative to this baseline exhibited by the unshuffled dataset arises from independent evidence information. We also did the converse to test for independent choice-related information: thatÂ is, shuffled choice across trials within the same evidence category (where evidence was binned into four groups based on the magnitude [#R-#L] of evidence, to account for the relationship between evidence magnitude and choice probability), and evaluated choice decoding accuracy. These âindependentâ shuffles constitute the âIndâ condition for choice and evidence decoding. In addition, complete shuffles were performed in which choice/evidence was shuffled across trials with no regard for the other variable. These shuffles constitute the âShuffleâ condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-8"><title>Linear model for evaluating puff-fluorescence relationship</title><p>To determine the relationship between somatic signals and puff number on a trial-by-trial basis, a two-factor linear model was constructed for each cell. The factors corresponded to the number of left-sided and right-sided puffs in each trial, and the dependent variable to the mean pre-decision fluorescence (500 ms preceding the decision phase) of the given cell in each trial. The best-fit coefficients were interpreted as the relationship between fluorescence and puff number for that cell. Significance of these coefficients was scored by the p-value associated with each coefficient in the model (two-tailed unpaired t-test of regression weight values). Cells with p&lt;0.05 for a given coefficient were considered to have ramps significantly correlated with puffs on the corresponding side. Significance cells were grouped into categories according to the sign of the coefficient (+ or â), and the side of the puffs with significant coefficients (L, R, or LR for both). In the shuffle condition, the puff numbers were shuffled across trials while holding the animalâs choice constant, and the same analysis was run.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-9"><title>Movie-based behavior measurements</title><p>Movements of the mouth, whiskers, nose, and paws were made using the behavioral movies acquired during all behavioral sessions in which calcium imaging was performed. For each movie from each animal, regions of interest (ROI) were manually selected corresponding to the aforementioned regions in the field of view. Full-session traces were extracted as the mean pixel value within the ROI in each frame. Mouth movements were measured using the laterally positioned camera, where deviation of the mouth and chin was best detected. Full-session traces corresponding to mouth movement were mean-subtracted and normalized from 0 to 1. For those measurements, the normalized licking measure was computed as the absolute value of the mouth-movement trace, with a median-filtered (0.5 s kernel) drifting baseline signal subtracted off, normalized from 0 to 1. Deviations in overall image brightness were normalized by a fiducial measurement in the field of view not involving the animal that reliably tracked field-of-view brightness. The remaining movement measurements (nose, left whiskers, right whiskers, left paw, and right paw) were extracted from the camera positioned below the animalsâ faces. For these measurements, traces were extracted in the same manner as above, and the normalized movement index was computed as absolute value of the trace derivative, normalized from 0 to 1.</p><p><italic>Dendritic events</italic> were detected using the OASIS autoregressive deconvolution algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Friedrich et al., 2017</xref>), with AR(1) and an L<sub>0</sub> sparsity penalty, and binarized with a threshold of 0.1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-10"><title>Analysis of dendritic responses</title><p>To test the hypothesis that dendritic signalling encoded motor events, we computed the mean dendritic response to a number of specific motor actions, and compared this response across error and correct contexts on a cell-by-cell basis. In these analyses, lick initiation (âstart lickingâ) and cessation (âstop lickingâ) were defined as licks that were preceded or followed by, respectively, at least 250 milliseconds without licking on that side. For the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, activity was measured in a 1-second window centered at this event. In addition, supplementary analyses measure the signal instead in the 200 ms preceding or following the event to account for the possibility that signals encode specifically preparatory or response signals to the events, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). For licking magnitude analyses, trials were categorized according to the quantity of licks in the same time window in which the dendritic response was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), and the dendritic response was measured in the same manner as the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>. For analyses of orofacial movements, the onset times of distinct movements in each orofacial region were determined, according to frames at which the time series data for that feature exceeded 2.5 standard deviations above the mean, and activity was measured in the one-second window centered at these events.</p><p>For all of the above movement measurements, movement events were split into those which occurred in error contexts (i.e. the time window for which the dendritic response was measured for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, in error trials), and those which occurred outside error contexts (in correct trials). Mean dendritic activity events were computed for both contexts for every movement measurement, and the error:correct activity ratio was then computed for each individual cell. To compare dendritic responses at varying trial difficulties, the difference was computed on a session-by-session basis between the mean dendritic response in the strongest and weakest evidence (|#R-#L|) trials, and the significance of this difference was compared using a two-tailed paired t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-11"><title>Outcome decoding</title><p>Dendritic activity was used to decode the outcome (correct or error) on a trial-by-trial basis.

The outcome of each trial was predicted by logistic regression using these values as predictors. For each session analyzed, 1000 batches of trials were randomly sampled in which the number of correct and error trials were matched, and a regression was performed on each, scored by k-fold cross validation with kÂ =Â 3.

Your article has been reviewed Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting study describing a potential role for the lateral posterior cerebellum in a novel decision-making task. The cerebellum has received much less focus than cortex in decision-making research despite clear evidence from, among other sources, human imaging and lesion studies that the cerebellum is involved in a wide range of cognitive processes. There is also a rich tradition of theoretical modeling inspired by the cerebellum's unique circuit organization and role in sensorimotor coordination that appears potentially relevant to many cognitive operations, raising interesting questions about what the cerebellum might contribute to decision-making. Therefore, the approach and data reported in the current manuscript are promising and could provide meaningful novel insight into the neural basis of decision-making. Despite this potential, and that it does report some interesting observations, the main limitation of this work is that it is hard to say what the cerebellum is doing during the task. In particular, it is not clear that it is possible to conclude that the cerebellum is truly involved in evidence accumulation. The concern about the support for evidence accumulation holds for the inactivation experiments as well as for the imaging.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Inactivation results: Inactivation results are suggestive of an important role for the cerebellum in this task. However, from the data presented, it is not clear that it is possible to conclude that the cerebellar inactivations are interfering with evidence accumulation itself, and not just somatosensation or motor output. At a minimum, the authors should show psychometric curves for the 5 individual muscimol-treated animals. Assessing the effects on the slopes and offsets of the individual psychometric curves might be more revealing about which aspects of task performance were affected by inactivation of crus I. Further, there is the possibility that with this experimental design, muscimol inactivation may not be adequate to determine whether the cerebellum is accumulating evidence, because changes in the psychometric function can also be explained by a decrease in sensory sensitivity alone. Careful modeling of the data may help.</p><p>2) Evidence for evidence accumulation signals from imaging of somatic calcium in Purkinje cells: The authors report that appear similar to evidence-dependent and choice-selective ramping responses previously reported in many cortical and subcortical areas of primates and rodents. The manuscript reports temporal dynamics of Purkinje cell somatic calcium signals that, in many cells, manifest as a gradual ramping response during the cue period that is correlated with both the number of pulses on one or the other side (evidence) and/or the animal's eventual response (choice). These responses are interpreted with analogy to the ramping responses in trial-averaged spike rates recorded from parietal cortex (along with other forebrain regions) that are thought to encode the time-integral of sensory evidence. However, the manuscript does not convincingly demonstrate that cerebellar neurons are actually encoding accumulated evidence. In general, given the uncertainty about the origin of these signals, more caution is warranted in interpretation of the apparent ramping signals. Specifically:</p><p>a) While there appear to be lots of time-modulated signals, the link to evidence accumulation and choice is not clear. It is apparent that the most salient feature of the recorded cerebellar population is a constant modulation, either upwards or downwards, with the passage of time in the trial. The presence of this signal complicates the interpretation of any ramping activity as being attributable to evidence accumulation. However, the statistical analyses (i.e. the linear model reported in subsection âNeuronal signatures of choice and evidence in Purkinje cellsâ) ignore this component of the responses. This might be valid if the representation of time were truly independent from the representation of evidence. But no such independence is established. For example, cells that are more strongly driven by evidence might also be more strongly driven by time, or more likely to be driven by time in one direction or another. The authors should more carefully consider the relationship between the different components of the cerebellar responses and/or formally control for potentially confounding effects of the time-related responses in the statistical models.</p><p>b) Given the temporal resolution of the calcium indicator, it is difficult to interpret any evidence-related signal dynamics as reflecting an underlying ramp in neuronal firing rate. The original description of the use of somatic calcium imaging to track changes in Purkinje cell simple spike rate (Ramirez and Stell, 2016) found that these signals were so slow that step changes in simple spike rate could result in ramps of fluorescence like those seen here. This technical concern would best be addressed by at least some recordings comparing the calcium signals to simple spike rate with electrophysiology. Although the authors have tried to be careful in their writing, the text currently leaves plenty of room for misinterpretation by less technical readers. They should clarify the text further to be much more clear about the limitations of interpreting the temporal dynamics of the calcium signals.</p><p>c) The relevant decision variable in the pulse accumulation task is the *difference* in pulses between the two sides. The authors seem to know this point well based on how they plot the psychometric functions. Yet at best a small minority of Purkinje cells encode this value. Subsection âNeuronal signatures of choice and evidence in Purkinje cellsâ reports that 39/843 cells (less than 5%) encode either a sum or difference of the number of pulses on each side. The specific figure for the number of cells encoding a difference is not reported, but Figure 3 suggests that it is about 5 cells (so ~2% of evidence-modulated cells or ~0.5% of all cells). These numbers question strong conclusions about the representation of the decision variable and accumulated evidence in cerebellum. Further, this result could be taken to show that responses in rodent cerebellum are different from those in primate cortex that are often interpreted as a representation of the decision variable for perceptual discrimination. Notably, it also indicates a dissociation between rodent cerebellum and neocortex, as Scott et al., estimate that as many as 1/3 of evidence-modulated cortical cells are better explained by the difference between sides. Therefore, the data strongly suggest that the critical decision-making operations are actually implemented downstream of the recorded cerebellar population. This strikes me as highly relevant to how the overall results should be interpreted, and it should be emphasized more strongly in the summary and discussion.</p><p>d) The analysis of the representation of accumulated evidence (subsection âNeuronal signatures of choice and evidence in Purkinje cellsâ and Figure 3) ignores the time course of representation, focusing on a short window immediately before the decision. Even if we disregard technical problems explained above in 2a-c, it is unclear whether the cerebellar neurons represent integration of evidence over time or merely its final outcome. Note that the population analysis for the representation of evidence (Figure 2F) does not answer this question (and is generally not quite informative) because evidence is defined as the &quot;correct&quot; choice in that analysis rather than the magnitude of evidence (#R-#L).</p><p>3) &quot;Error-related&quot; dendritic responses</p><p>In addition to somatic calcium signals, the authors analyzed dendritic calcium signals and found that these were higher on error vs. correct trials. The implications of this observation are emphasized heavily; for example, the Discussion section concludes that &quot;the cerebellum, which learns from error to guide action, may help in the learning and tuning of accurate responses&quot;. This is an interesting proposal, but one might have had the same belief prior to seeing the results reported here (given existing human data and theories about the cerebellum), and it's not clear how the data should update it.</p><p>a) There is speculation about how the observed error responses could be used as error signals to guide learning, in line with existing models of cerebellar learning. However, it was not clear to the reviewers how that would work, especially given that the error responses observed were not directional. Typically, Purkinje cell complex spikes are thought to provide a directional signal for learning, not just a correct/ incorrect signal. There are no analyses to support the proposed functional role of these error related responses as being involved in &quot;tuning&quot; responses or correcting errors. Yet, it should be possible to provide a more thorough analysis of the error signals:</p><p>What do error signals predict about future behavior? An obvious analysis would be to ask whether the magnitude of the error signal on trial nâ1 influences choice accuracy on trial n. This seems to be a clear prediction from the proposal that the cerebellum &quot;tunes&quot; behavior or &quot;corrects errors&quot;.</p><p>c) How do the error signals relate to the strength of evidence on each trial? This is briefly mentioned at the end of the Results section and in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1, but without any statistical tests or interpretation. Whether and how the error signals are modulated by the strength of evidence seems key to determining their functional role in updating behavior, if any. In particular, we would have expected that true &quot;error&quot; responses would be higher for easier trials, but the opposite appears to be true.</p><p>4) Ruling out sensory and motor confounds as potential sources of somatic and dendritic calcium signals</p><p>a) Figure 3B indicates that isolated puffs produce a calcium response that gradually rises and falls over ~1 s. On trials with strong evidence, these signals will overlap. Assuming that they sum reasonably linearly, overlapping calcium responses from neurons that encode only the transient presentation of evidence would nevertheless give the impression of a gradual ramp with a slope that depends on the quantity of evidence. Note that this is a different issue from the point raised in the Discussion section about distinguishing single-trial ramps from steps. Rather, it makes it unclear whether the evidence-related cerebellar responses correspond to a representation of the momentary sensory evidence or to the magnitude of accumulated evidence that drives choice. This distinction is critical to interpreting proposed neural implementations of evidence accumulation models. One possible way to address this would be to record responses during stimulus presentation from animals that are not engaged in making a decision.</p><p>b) The authors attempt to rule out that the somatic signals are related directly to movement of the animal and less related to the &quot;cognitive&quot; variables. The analysis in the supporting figures is in line with the level of detail often applied in the field currently. But, is it possible that the activity is related to other movements of the animal rather than in the orofacial region? The authors should either cite strong evidence showing that these are the only relevant regions for the area of cerebellum examined or provide additional videography results from other parts of the body (e.g. paws). This is of course a significant point to make as strong as possible given the cerebellum's long-established role in motor behaviors.</p><p>c) The analyses in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 do not convincingly rule out the possibility that the difference in dendritic calcium signals on error trials resulted from differences in licking on error trials. That figure clearly shows that cessation of licking proceeds at different rates on error trials compared to other times. How does trial type (correct vs error) affect the relationship between licking (or changes of rate in licking) and dendritic calcium signals?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A cerebellar role in evidence-guided decision-making&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Ivry (Senior Editor), Megan Carey (Guest Reviewing Editor), and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have made a concerted effort to clarify the text of their paper and have provided reasonable responses to many of the points raised. As was noted in the first round of reviews, rebuttal, and in the text, it remains unclear what the cerebellum's specific role or computation is during the task, and the reviewers were somewhat disappointed that most of the key questions are deferred to future studies. However, the reviewers also felt that defining cerebellum's exact role in the task may be asking too much for a first study, particularly given the limitations of the dataset and the conceptual and analytical complexities that prevent the authors from specifying the nature of neural representations and the source of the behavioral deficit following cerebellar inactivation.</p><p>Overall, there are several interesting leads about the role(s) of cerebellum in perceptual decisions in this paper. While none of these are firmly established by the current study, the reviewers agree that the writing and presentation of the results is generally fair and not greatly over-stated, and favor publication so that the results can be evaluated by the field and followed up in future studies from other groups.</p><p>The reviewers note that in the process of clarifying what can and cannot be claimed based on the existing data, the scope of the paper is limited to three points: successful training of mice to do the task, reduced accuracy following cerebellar inactivation, and representation of task-relevant variables in cerebellar neural population without specifying the exact nature of the represented variables. Before publication, the reviewers agree that it is important to ensure that after toning down its claims, the manuscript does not leave behind any statements that could mislead readers as to what is actually shown. The reviewers have identified the following statements from the Title, Abstract, and Discussion section that are potentially misleading and should be restated with more specific statements that more accurately match the conclusions that can be supported by the data.</p><p>Title</p><p>A cerebellar role in evidence-guided decision-making.</p><p>Impact Statement</p><p>The lateral posterior cerebellum participates in evidence-accumulation-based decision-making, and Purkinje neurons in this region encode choice-, evidence-, and error-related variables.

We have added new data, analyses, and substantial clarifications that we think improve the quality of the study. In some cases, we think the objections raised by reviewers were consequences of our failure to properly convey the scope of our study.</p><p>We fully agree that a tremendous amount stands to be resolved with respect to the cerebellar role and computations in our decision-making behavior. Our findings are at an early stage relative to the decision-making field. It is not our intent at this time to dissect precisely the evidence integration process as many studies have, but rather to study the whole perceptual decision-making process with a more agnostic view about cerebellar roles. We cannot yet make strong claims about the particular computational aspect of decision-making to which the cerebellum contributes. In light of this and of the reviewer suggestions, we have emphasized more strongly the extent to which many questions remain unanswered.</p><p>Of specific note with respect to a number of reviewer comments: we do not interpret our findings as evidence that the cerebellum performs the integration computation in evidence accumulation. Furthermore, we are aware that the particular roles of brain regions in the evidence-accumulation process are intricate, deeply studied, and yet still unresolved (Brody and Hanks, 2016).</p><p>In that light, our goal was to probe for an involvement of cerebellar activity in the perceptual decision-making process, which to the most basic extent has not been previously shown. We asked three fundamental questions: (1) Can we train mice on a new evidence-accumulation decision-making task? (2) Does cerebellar inactivation affect behavioral performance? (3) Are task-relevant variables represented in any way in cerebellar neuronal populations? We reasoned that these three demonstrations would constitute novel and interesting findings and would be a basis for substantially larger-effort endeavors (which we are now pursuing).</p><p>To make this clearer in the manuscript, we have adjusted the text to emphasize the result: i.e. demonstration of a cerebellar role in perceptual decision-making, using evidence accumulation as a paradigm, but where the cerebellar role may or may not be directly in the computations of updating an evidence integrator per se. We were careful to present it this way in the manuscript and have attempted to clarify it more. We consider follow-up studies with detailed high-resolution measurements and inactivations an important and interesting next step, and we are pursuing that.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Inactivation results: Inactivation results are suggestive of an important role for the cerebellum in this task. However, from the data presented, it is not clear that it is possible to conclude that the cerebellar inactivations are interfering with evidence accumulation itself, and not just somatosensation or motor output.</p></disp-quote><p>We view the inactivation experiment as an initial demonstration of cerebellar necessity, and not a comprehensive modelling effort. Rather, we add a new region of interest to the emerging brainwide view of perceptual decision-making, noting that the inactivations demonstrate a causal role for the cerebellum in effectively converting sensory evidence into a decision at some stage of that complex process. This could correspond to sensory input gain biases, post-categorization biases, or other non-accumulation-specific biases. We have now noted this important distinction more clearly in the Discussion section. Below we address our thoughts on the possibilities of specific roles for the cerebellum but we do not believe to have resolved those yet using this study.</p><p>First, to address the possibility of interference with motor output: we were particularly mindful of the possibility of a strictly motor deficit, and we believe the licking measurements and control trials we included (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B) address this.</p><p>Regarding the possibility of sensory deficits and other non-accumulation impairments: as we explain in the initial section of our response, we completely agree: the evidence-accumulation process, as opposed to related sensory gain and premotor processes, is difficult to pin down and we are aware of recent findings in rodent decision-making which indicate non-accumulation roles for regions that have been long studied in decision-making (Erlich et al., 2015; Katz et al., 2016). We do not intend to claim that the cerebellum performs specifically evidence integration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At a minimum, the authors should show psychometric curves for the 5 individual muscimol-treated animals. Assessing the effects on the slopes and offsets of the individual psychometric curves might be more revealing about which aspects of task performance were affected by inactivation of crus I. Further, there is the possibility that with this experimental design, muscimol inactivation may not be adequate to determine whether the cerebellum is accumulating evidence, because changes in the psychometric function can also be explained by a decrease in sensory sensitivity alone. Careful modeling of the data may help.</p></disp-quote><p>In the submitted version of the manuscript, the evidence sensitivities, biases, and trial history effects of individual animals were represented by the session-by-session fits in the logistic regression model shown in Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C (and subsection âA decision-making task for cerebellar investigationsâ). This behavioral model has been used in multiple published decision-making studies, it considers more variables than a psychometric fit does, and it provides a highly useful view of the effects introduced by the inactivation.</p><p>Psychometric curves</p><p>Nevertheless, we now include psychometric curves that similarly demonstrate the reduced sensitivity presented quantitatively in the aforementioned modelling (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D). We also more strongly highlight the findings of the behavioral modelling, which indicate significant changes in animalsâ usage of evidence and trial history in guiding decisions (subsection âA decision-making task for cerebellar investigationsâ).</p><p>From our data and modelling at this stage, we consider deficits at all stages of the decision-making process (ex. input sensory gain biases, integration impairments, post-categorization/premotor biases) possible and interesting to report. Thus, we do not claim that the cerebellum controls evidence integration per se. We have made this point clearer in the Results section and Discussion section.</p><p>Some of the shifts in psychometric curves may arise from asymmetry of injections (and we include specific evidence suggesting that such an asymmetry can account for some of the biases we see). We are currently doing experiments with newer technologies that we believe will resolve these questions in a more detailed manner.</p><p>However, we do note that the trend in our psychometrics is broadly consistent with effects seen in (Erlich et al., 2015), which shows that curves with this general phenotype (compression and bias) could conceivably be explained by a number of hypotheses ranging from sensory and premotor deficits to accumulation deficits. While it is beyond our current goal in this manuscript to perform this level of modelling, we use it just to demonstrate that our phenotype does not rule out interesting possibilities.</p><p>Drift diffusion models</p><p>Fits to drift diffusion models are an interesting direction for these data, yet also not necessary for our aim to demonstrate general causality for the region in the task.

The manuscript reports temporal dynamics of Purkinje cell somatic calcium signals that, in many cells, manifest as a gradual ramping response during the cue period that is correlated with both the number of pulses on one or the other side (evidence) and/or the animal's eventual response (choice). These responses are interpreted with analogy to the ramping responses in trial-averaged spike rates recorded from parietal cortex (along with other forebrain regions) that are thought to encode the time-integral of sensory evidence. However, the manuscript does not convincingly demonstrate that cerebellar neurons are actually encoding accumulated evidence. In general, given the uncertainty about the origin of these signals, more caution is warranted in interpretation of the apparent ramping signals. Specifically:</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out that our claims on this topic came across stronger than intended. As suggested, we have edited our interpretations to be more cautious. Our adjustments clarify what we now intend to claim and eliminate vagueness. We agree, as we note in the responses below, that (1) we have not demonstrated that cerebellar neurons precisely encode the stepwise accumulation of evidence, (2) the coding strategy within the cerebellum may be different than that of neocortex, and (3) our measurements are limited in the ability to answer (1) and (2). The analogy to more finely resolved neocortical signals is intriguing but not crucial to our claims, being more of a discussion point. We have therefore re-worded our conclusions to emphasize these distinctions.</p><p>On that note, some of the reviews in this section are concerned with how evidence is specifically represented, and how that may relate to specific evidence-accumulation models. As we note at the start of our response, an accumulation role per se for the cerebellum is possible but beyond our data to support. In this first contribution to the study of the cerebellum in this task, we focus on findings that precede such a claim. We consider our main finding to be that choice- and evidence-related information is present with sufficient fidelity to play a role in decision-making computations.</p><p>(Note that point 2a and our accompanying response is found below alongside point 2d).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Given the temporal resolution of the calcium indicator, it is difficult to interpret any evidence-related signal dynamics as reflecting an underlying ramp in neuronal firing rate. The original description of the use of somatic calcium imaging to track changes in Purkinje cell simple spike rate (Ramirez and Stell, 2016) found that these signals were so slow that step changes in simple spike rate could result in ramps of fluorescence like those seen here. This technical concern would best be addressed by at least some recordings comparing the calcium signals to simple spike rate with electrophysiology. Although the authors have tried to be careful in their writing, the text currently leaves plenty of room for misinterpretation by less technical readers. They should clarify the text further to be much more clear about the limitations of interpreting the temporal dynamics of the calcium signals.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the text to emphasize the limitations in interpreting our calcium signals (subsection âPurkinje cell somatic calcium encodes task-relevant informationâ, Discussion section). We have more strongly noted that step changes in firing rate are indeed possibly the underlying representation.</p><p>While simultaneous calcium and electrical recordings are beyond our current technical abilities, we have obtained electrical recordings of Purkinje cells during performance of the task in trained animals. These recordings substantiate our primary findings of task-modulated signalling and suggest that the trial-averaged calcium signals we observe indeed correspond to ramps in firing rate. These recordings are now included in Figure 2âfigure supplement 2. We include these important data, but nevertheless remain conservative in our interpretations of calcium data (Discussion section), especially since the nature of these signals remains unresolved at the single-trial level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The relevant decision variable in the pulse accumulation task is the *difference* in pulses between the two sides. The authors seem to know this point well based on how they plot the psychometric functions. Yet at best a small minority of Purkinje cells encode this value. Subsection âNeuronal signatures of choice and evidence in Purkinje cellsâ reports that 39/843 cells (less than 5%) encode either a sum or difference of the number of pulses on each side. The specific figure for the number of cells encoding a difference is not reported, but Figure 3 suggests that it is about 5 cells (so ~2% of evidence-modulated cells or ~0.5% of all cells). These numbers question strong conclusions about the representation of the decision variable and accumulated evidence in cerebellum. Further, this result could be taken to show that responses in rodent cerebellum are different from those in primate cortex that are often interpreted as a representation of the decision variable for perceptual discrimination. Notably, it also indicates a dissociation between rodent cerebellum and neocortex, as Scott et al., estimate that as many as 1/3 of evidence-modulated cortical cells are better explained by the difference between sides. Therefore, the data strongly suggest that the critical decision-making operations are actually implemented downstream of the recorded cerebellar population. This strikes me as highly relevant to how the overall results should be interpreted, and it should be emphasized more strongly in the summary and discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is true that a subset of cells in (Scott et al., 2017) represented the #R-#L quantity, a key conclusion of that study was that left and right evidence may be accumulated mostly independently. See their first discussion paragraph: âBehavioral Analysis and Neural Recordings Support the Existence of Two Weakly Coupled Accumulators.â In this light, we think that representations of single-sided evidence could possibly be important contributors to a decision-making circuit.</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that cerebellar computations might not be the site of accumulation per se but possibly a filtering step preceding or following accumulation, as a node in a complex decision-making circuit. It may be the case, for example, that the cerebellar contribution is related to the individual accumulators proposed by (Scott et al., 2017), and that the weak coupling occurs in neocortex or elsewhere. We have now emphasized this point (Discussion section).</p><p>(We respond to the following two reviews, 2a and 2d, together below):</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) While there appear to be lots of time-modulated signals, the link to evidence accumulation and choice is not clear. It is apparent that the most salient feature of the recorded cerebellar population is a constant modulation, either upwards or downwards, with the passage of time in the trial. The presence of this signal complicates the interpretation of any ramping activity as being attributable to evidence accumulation. However, the statistical analyses (i.e. the linear model reported in subsection âNeuronal signatures of choice and evidence in Purkinje cellsâ) ignore this component of the responses. This might be valid if the representation of time were truly independent from the representation of evidence. But no such independence is established. For example, cells that are more strongly driven by evidence might also be more strongly driven by time, or more likely to be driven by time in one direction or another. The authors should more carefully consider the relationship between the different components of the cerebellar responses and/or formally control for potentially confounding effects of the time-related responses in the statistical models.</p><p>d) The analysis of the representation of accumulated evidence (subsection âNeuronal signatures of choice and evidence in Purkinje cellsâ and Figure 3) ignores the time course of representation, focusing on a short window immediately before the decision. Even if we disregard technical problems explained above in 2a-c, it is unclear whether the cerebellar neurons represent integration of evidence over time or merely its final outcome. Note that the population analysis for the representation of evidence (Figure 2F) does not answer this question (and is generally not quite informative) because evidence is defined as the &quot;correct&quot; choice in that analysis rather than the magnitude of evidence (#R-#L).</p></disp-quote><p>Points 2a and 2d are each distinct and important points, which concern the temporal representations observed in Purkinje cells in our study. We address the specifics of these concerns below, but we note generally that their relevance is contingent on an assumption that we are claiming cerebellar neurons represent integration of evidence per se. While we are aware of studies that have made strong claims about the precise representations of accumulated evidence in single-neuron signals, we are not making claims as strong. We have modified the text in the manuscript to clarify this (subsection âDynamics of choice- and evidence-related information in Purkinje cellsâ, Discussion section).</p><p>Our intention is to demonstrate that we observe evidence-related information in neuronal activity. Specifically, we make 2 points about evidence representation in our data:</p><p>(1) Stimulus information is present throughout the cue period: evidence-side decoding in Figure 2F demonstrates population-level encoding of evidence-related information throughout most of the cue period (which, as noted by the reviewer, is not necessarily of the #R-#L value, and we refer to review 2c where we have responded to this point).</p><p>(2) The magnitude of single-sided evidence is present in some neurons (via an unresolved temporal encoding scheme): shown by linear model for evidence strength effects in Figure 3C.</p><p>These analyses are comparable to the type shown in Figure 5 of (Scott et al., 2017), which demonstrates the presence of task-relevant information but does not resolve its time course. Further, based on new data given in response to review 4a, we know that these representations are task-specific.</p><p>Notably, we do notclaim that:</p><p>(1) cerebellar modulation is entirely driven by evidence. Some level of time modulation, as suggested in review 2a is likely in our view, though we note that our signals cannot be exclusively a time representation because of the analyses mentioned above.</p><p>(2) cerebellar signals represent the integration of evidence on a moment-to-moment basis. Our resolution and signal-to-noise does not allow us to answer this yet. Even if our neuronal population encodes evidence by, for example, a distributed temporal basis, the presence of the necessary information at all is an important finding.</p><p>Additionally, we know from our upcoming study of neural correlates in the primary and secondary visual cortices that even apparently simple sensory responses (time-locked to individual stimuli) are modulated by time and numerous other factors (Koay et al., 2018). The slow calcium time dynamics of Purkinje cell somata makes disentangling time and evidence effects very difficult, and this is better addressed by specific experiments e.g. with carefully designed sampling of stimulus times, which is beyond the scope of our current study.</p><p>In summary, we think that the concern in 2a (evidence and time modulations may be intertwined) and the concern in 2d (neuronal signals may not directly track evidence over time) are interesting questions we have not resolved, but that our core conclusions do not depend on the answers. Finally, we note that we are currently performing electrical-recording experiments that address this important issue as part of a follow-up study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) &quot;Error-related&quot; dendritic responses</p><p>In addition to somatic calcium signals, the authors analyzed dendritic calcium signals and found that these were higher on error vs. correct trials. The implications of this observation are emphasized heavily; for example, the Discussion section concludes that &quot;the cerebellum, which learns from error to guide action, may help in the learning and tuning of accurate responses&quot;. This is an interesting proposal, but one might have had the same belief prior to seeing the results reported here (given existing human data and theories about the cerebellum), and it's not clear how the data should update it.</p></disp-quote><p>In this work we focused on reporting what is, to our knowledge, the first observation of error-related signalling in the Purkinje cell dendritic pathway during a cognitive, decision-making context. We agree with the reviewers that we did not resolve many interesting details of this signalling, in some part due to limitations of the experiment as explained in the specific replies below. Nevertheless, we feel that our result builds a bridge between known roles of error signals in motor contexts and hypothesized but never-observed roles in the domain of decision-making.</p><p>Beyond describing the finding, at this time we feel limited in our ability to propose specific roles of the observed dendritic signalling. We have therefore removed the heavy emphasis (like that referenced by the reviewer above). We still consider these findings an important result to include as they motivate future studies that we are currently pursuing, and we hope that they will also be of use to others given the current interest in this topic (Sendhilnathan et al., 2018; Wagner et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) There is speculation about how the observed error responses could be used as error signals to guide learning, in line with existing models of cerebellar learning. However, it was not clear to the reviewers how that would work, especially given that the error responses observed were not directional. Typically, Purkinje cell complex spikes are thought to provide a directional signal for learning, not just a correct/ incorrect signal. There are no analyses to support the proposed functional role of these error related responses as being involved in &quot;tuning&quot; responses or correcting errors. Yet, it should be possible to provide a more thorough analysis of the error signals:</p><p>What do error signals predict about future behavior? An obvious analysis would be to ask whether the magnitude of the error signal on trial nâ1 influences choice accuracy on trial n. This seems to be a clear prediction from the proposal that the cerebellum &quot;tunes&quot; behavior or &quot;corrects errors&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the trial-by-trial analysis suggestion and we are very interested in knowing the answer to this question as well, especially given the success of similar analyses in recent cerebellar work on head movements (Brooks, Carriot and Cullen, 2015), eye movements (Medina and Lisberger, 2008), and eyeblink conditioning (Ten Brinke et al., 2017). We attempted this analysis, and encountered an issue of statistical power that is related to slow learning in this behavior and therefore prohibitively low trial counts.</p><p>To illustrate the point, we have performed a power analysis considering the number of correct and error trials in our dataset. To detect a 10% difference from mean performance (at Î±=0.05) in fraction correct choices, one needs approximately 16x the number of trials we collected in our imaging study. We also note that this is under a very generous assumption that there would be a 10% difference in performance as a result of dendritic signalling within a session, but we know that in our task, small improvements in performance take place over weeks (learning occurs on the order of thousands of trials with gradually diminishing error rates). This is in contrast to the behaviors used in studies that have successfully performed such analyses, where learning is substantially faster and can thus be expected to be accompanied by robust neural correlates in just tens of trials.</p><p>We are encouraged to have found this elevated signalling and now that we know it exists, it may be possible to design a study to test this, but it would best involve a new or modified experimental design. We have added text to the Discussion on this topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) How do the error signals relate to the strength of evidence on each trial? This is briefly mentioned at the end of the Results section and in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1, but without any statistical tests or interpretation. Whether and how the error signals are modulated by the strength of evidence seems key to determining their functional role in updating behavior, if any. In particular, we would have expected that true &quot;error&quot; responses would be higher for easier trials, but the opposite appears to be true.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added statistics to the reporting of these results, which proved to be not significant despite a possibly interesting trend. If the trend had been significant, it may have been compatible with inverted reward signalling which is known to occur in some other brain regions (Cohen, 2007; Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2007). We now comment on this in the manuscript (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Ruling out sensory and motor confounds as potential sources of somatic and dendritic calcium signals</p><p>a) Figure 3B indicates that isolated puffs produce a calcium response that gradually rises and falls over ~1 s. On trials with strong evidence, these signals will overlap. Assuming that they sum reasonably linearly, overlapping calcium responses from neurons that encode only the transient presentation of evidence would nevertheless give the impression of a gradual ramp with a slope that depends on the quantity of evidence. Note that this is a different issue from the point raised in the Discussion section about distinguishing single-trial ramps from steps. Rather, it makes it unclear whether the evidence-related cerebellar responses correspond to a representation of the momentary sensory evidence or to the magnitude of accumulated evidence that drives choice. This distinction is critical to interpreting proposed neural implementations of evidence accumulation models. One possible way to address this would be to record responses during stimulus presentation from animals that are not engaged in making a decision.</p></disp-quote><p>We see the importance of the suggested control, and we have included new data from mice subjected to trials under identical conditions but not trained in the decision-making behavior. These data can be seen in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1 (and subsection âDynamics of choice- and evidence-related information in Purkinje cellsâ), and they indicate an absence of ramping, evidence-side decoding, or puff count representation in these signals. We cite this, and the electrical recordings given in response to review 2b as evidence that the calcium modulation we observe is not a result of simple sensory responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The authors attempt to rule out that the somatic signals are related directly to movement of the animal and less related to the &quot;cognitive&quot; variables. The analysis in the supporting figures is in line with the level of detail often applied in the field currently. But, is it possible that the activity is related to other movements of the animal rather than in the orofacial region? The authors should either cite strong evidence showing that these are the only relevant regions for the area of cerebellum examined or provide additional videography results from other parts of the body (e.g. paws). This is of course a significant point to make as strong as possible given the cerebellum's long-established role in motor behaviors.</p></disp-quote><p>We now cite evidence of primarily orofacial representations in crus I (subsection âPurkinje cell somatic calcium encodes task-relevant informationâ). In particular, we note here that âin rats, the largest whisker projection area in the cerebellar cortex is located in crus 1, occupying the largest part of that foliumâ (Bosman et al., 2010) (and crus 1 features are well conserved in rodents (Sugihara, 2018)), and that a comprehensive review of cerebellar representations concludes âthe physiological role of crus I and crus II in controlling forelimb and hindlimb muscles could no longer be maintainedâ (Manni and Petrosini, 2004).</p><p>Nevertheless, we now include more movie-based measurements of forepaws, which also support the conclusion that movements do not account for the somatic signals (subsection âPurkinje cell somatic calcium encodes task-relevant informationâ, Figure 2âfigure supplement 4, Video 3).</p><p>We appreciate the reviewersâ concerns and do not believe we can extensively rule out all movements in the body (including other body parts not visible, and other more subtle movements). That said, it is a less likely explanation than the one we propose, given the known roles of this region and our inactivation results. We have demonstrated that the strongest expected movement-related signals, orofacial movements, are not responsible for the somatic activity that we observe. By adding forepaw analyses, we have furthermore shown that less-likely movement-related signals are also not an explanation. This standard of proof is comparable that rest of the field of evidence accumulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The analyses in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 do not convincingly rule out the possibility that the difference in dendritic calcium signals on error trials resulted from differences in licking on error trials. That figure clearly shows that cessation of licking proceeds at different rates on error trials compared to other times. How does trial type (correct vs error) affect the relationship between licking (or changes of rate in licking) and dendritic calcium signals?</p></disp-quote><p>We take this concern very seriously and we have thought hard about what analysis properly addresses it. We believe the reviewerâs question is addressed by our analyses in Figure 4F and Figure 4âfigure supplement 1. We now explain our rationale more thoroughly in the text (subsection âError-associated signalling in Purkinje cell dendritesâ), as well as include an additional panel in Figure 4F to visually demonstrate the rationale of the analysis.</p><p>To our understanding, the specific null hypothesis we need to reject is that the elevation in dendritic signalling with errors is reflective not of an error event but rather of a specific motor event that tends to co-occur with errors. The most likely such motor event would be the cessation of licking, since this is the one that reliably occurs at the moment of errors (as the reviewer notes that we show in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A), but others, such as initiationof licking (perhaps toward the other direction) or movements of other sorts are possible too.</p><p>The reasoning of our analysis is as follows: consider first the hypothesis that dendritic activity increases not specifically with errors but rather when animals stop licking, an event that nearly always occurs when animals make errors. If this were true, then the cessation of licking, whether or not it occurs at the moment of error, would elicit this elevated signalling. We take advantage of the fact that we have many additional instances where lick cessation occurred <italic>not</italic> at the moment of errors. These ânon-errorâ lick cessations occur in all correct trials, as noted by the reviewer. We computed the dendritic responses at all such moments of lick cessation, in both error contexts and non-error contexts (i.e. correct trials). We then compared the responses on a cell-by-cell basis across these two contexts, yielding an error:correct activity ratio. If the best explanation for the elevated signalling were a lick cessation-related signal, then these lick cessation events should elicit responses of similar magnitude (i.e. error:correct activity ratio of 1), but we find a statistically elevated level of signalling specifically when lick cessation occurs with errors, as compared to when it occurs elsewhere. This implies that signalling is specifically elevated at moments of error beyond what is expected just when animals stop licking in non-error contexts. In other words, lick cessation in error trials elicits more dendritic response than lick cessation in correct trialsâa direct response to the question âHow does trial type (correct vs error) affect the relationship between licking and dendritic calcium signals?â</p><p>We apply the same logic to various definable motor events, such as moments of low, medium, and high rates of licking, as well as lick initiation and orofacial movements. We also apply the lick initiation and cessation analyses over differing time windows, including the dendritic activity preceding and following the lick initiation/cessation, to account for the possibility that a lick-related signal in the cerebellum temporally precedes or follows the licking measurement.</p><p>We consider this to be the most thorough approach we can take to answer whether there exists elevated error-related dendritic signalling beyond what is expected from specific motor hypotheses.</p><p>To clarify this analysis for readers, we have added an additional panel (in Figure 4F) illustrating this type of measurement, and relabelled the descriptions to align with the âcorrect vs errorâ phrasing given by the reviewer (Figure 4F, Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have made a concerted effort to clarify the text of their paper and have provided reasonable responses to many of the points raised. As was noted in the first round of reviews, rebuttal, and in the text, it remains unclear what the cerebellum's specific role or computation is during the task, and the reviewers were somewhat disappointed that most of the key questions are deferred to future studies. However, the reviewers also felt that defining cerebellum's exact role in the task may be asking too much for a first study, particularly given the limitations of the dataset and the conceptual and analytical complexities that prevent the authors from specifying the nature of neural representations and the source of the behavioral deficit following cerebellar inactivation.</p><p>Overall, there are several interesting leads about the role(s) of cerebellum in perceptual decisions in this paper.

However, in our view, the &quot;suggests/ consistent with&quot; was not the only problem with this sentence. There is also a problem with &quot;sufficient&quot;. The electrophysiological evidence in Figure 2âfigure supplement 2 is anecdotal and non-quantitative. For this statement to be left in, it would need to be adequately supported. In our view, this would require a quantitative comparison between imaging and electrophysiology results. In particular, we would want to know:</p><p>- How many Purkinje cells in total were recorded from electrophysiologically? How many of these showed ramping?
