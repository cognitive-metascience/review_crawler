Kupffer’s vesicle (KV), a transient organ with a fluid-filled lumen, provides a simple system to investigate the interplay between intrinsic cellular mechanisms and external forces during epithelial morphogenesis. Using 3-dimensional (3D) analyses of single cells we identify asymmetric cell volume changes along the anteroposterior axis of KV that coincide with asymmetric cell shape changes. Blocking ion flux prevents these cell volume changes and cell shape changes. Vertex simulations suggest cell shape changes do not depend on lumen expansion. Consistent with this prediction, asymmetric changes in KV cell volume and shape occur normally when KV lumen growth fails due to leaky cell adhesions. These results indicate ion flux mediates cell volume changes that contribute to asymmetric cell shape changes in KV, and that these changes in epithelial morphology are separable from lumen-generated forces.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Kupffer's Vesicle</kwd><kwd>epithelial cell shape changes</kwd><kwd>cell volume regulation</kwd><kwd>mechanical influence on cell shapes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#446222</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merkel</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name><name><surname>Manning</surname><given-names>M Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009494</institution-id><institution>Research Corporation for Scientific Advancement</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cottrell Scholar program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merkel</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name><name><surname>Manning</surname><given-names>M Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merkel</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name><name><surname>Manning</surname><given-names>M Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM117598</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manning</surname><given-names>M Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL095690</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amack</surname><given-names>Jeffrey D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During Kupffer's vesicle morphogenesis, cell volume anisotropy impacts cell shape changes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In an embryo, epithelial cells undergo tightly regulated shape changes to drive tissue remodeling and organ development. Changes in epithelial cell morphology can be mediated by intrinsic mechanisms, such as rearrangements of the actomyosin cytoskeleton that often occur in response to biochemical signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fuss et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Escudero et al., 2007</xref>). Extrinsic biophysical forces can also influence epithelial morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Navis and Nelson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Navis and Bagnat, 2015</xref>). For example, the mechanical properties of neighboring cells can help shape how an epithelium develops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sedzinski et al., 2016</xref>). Another source of extrinsic force found in many organs is a fluid-filled lumen. Forces generated by increased fluid pressure during lumen expansion can have an impact on individual cell shapes and the overarching epithelial architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bagnat et al., 2010</xref>). Conversely, movements of fluids from epithelial cells to the lumen have been proposed to regulate both lumen growth and thinning of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoijman et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, exactly how intrinsic molecular mechanisms and extrinsic mechanical forces interact to regulate epithelial cell shape changes during organogenesis remains an open and intriguing question.</p><p>In this study, we used the zebrafish Kupffer’s vesicle (KV) as a model organ to investigate mechanisms that regulate shape changes of single cells during epithelial morphogenesis. KV, which functions as a ‘left-right organizer’ to determine left-right asymmetry of the zebrafish embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Essner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kramer-Zucker et al., 2005</xref>), is a transient organ comprised of a single layer of ~50 epithelial cells that surround a fluid-filled lumen. Each KV cell extends a motile monocilium into the lumen to generate asymmetric fluid flows that direct left-right patterning signals. Fate mapping studies have identified precursor cells, called dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs), which differentiate into epithelial KV cells at the end of gastrulation stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Melby et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper and D'Amico, 1996</xref>). These cells then form the KV organ in the tailbud at the embryonic midline (marked by notochord) during early somitogenesis stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similar to other organs that develop a fluid-filled lumen—such as the gut tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvers et al., 2014</xref>) or pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Villasenor et al., 2010</xref>)—KV cells form a rosette-like structure to give rise to a nascent lumen that expands over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amack et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oteíza et al., 2008</xref>). Previous 2-dimensional (2D) analyses of KV cells revealed that during expansion of the KV lumen, KV cells at the middle focal plane undergo asymmetric cell shape changes along the anteroposterior (AP) axis that sculpt the architecture of the mature KV organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). A transgenic strain developed in this study, <italic>Tg(sox17:GFP-CAAX)</italic>, provides bright labeling of KV cell membranes with green fluorescent protein (GFP) that shows the AP asymmetric architecture of the whole organ (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) and the 2D shapes of epithelial KV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). KV cells have similar shapes at early stages of development, whereas at later stages the cells in the anterior half of KV (KV-ant cells) develop columnar morphologies that allow tight packing of these cells and posterior KV cells (KV-post cells) become wide and thin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This morphogenetic process, which we refer to as ‘KV remodeling’, results in an AP asymmetric distribution of cilia that is necessary to drive fluid flows for left-right patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, KV is a simple and accessible organ that is ideal for probing the relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that drive epithelial morphogenesis.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30963.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mosaic labeling of KV cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A dorsal view of the tailbud in a live zebrafish embryo at the 8-somite stage (8 ss) of development.

Experimental results and mathematical simulations from our group indicate that actomyosin contractility and differential interfacial tensions between KV cells mediate asymmetric cell shape changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Additional studies identified an AP asymmetric deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) implicated in restricting anterior KV cell shape during KV lumen expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Compagnon et al., 2014</xref>). We reasoned that these mechanisms likely work in concert with yet additional mechanisms to fully instruct epithelial morphogenesis during KV organ formation. Here, we developed methods to analyze single KV cells in 3-dimensions (3D) and created novel mathematical vertex models of KV development to identify mechanisms that contribute to AP asymmetric epithelial cell shape changes in KV. 3D analyses revealed that KV-ant cells increase their volume and KV-post cells decrease their volume during KV morphogenesis. These asymmetric cell volume changes occur at the same time as asymmetric cell shape changes. At the molecular level, KV cell volume and shape changes are mediated by ion channel activity that regulates ion flux and fluid transport. We next tested whether extrinsic biophysical forces had an impact on these cell morphology changes. Mathematical models indicate that mechanical properties of external tissues surrounding the KV can impact cell shape changes in the KV. Models predicted that when external tissues are solid-like, asymmetric cell volume changes in KV cells contribute to cell shape changes even in the absence of lumen expansion. Consistent with mathematical model predictions, experimental perturbations of lumen expansion indicated that changes in KV cell volume and shape can occur independent of forces associated with lumen growth. Together, our results suggest ion channel mediated fluid flux serves as an intrinsic mechanism to regulate epithelial cell morphodynamics that create asymmetry in the KV organ. These findings shed new light on the interplay between lumenogenesis and epithelial morphogenesis and provide an example of cell morphology changes that can be uncoupled from mechanical forces exerted during lumen expansion.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-30963-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30963.003</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>KV organ architecture in 3D in a live <italic>Tg(sox17:GFP-CAAX)</italic> embryo at 8 ss.</title><p>The membrane-localized GFP marks all cells in KV.

This transgene marks all cells in the KV and is useful for delineating 2D cell morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, due to difficulties in determining exact cell-cell boundaries in the KV (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), this strain is not ideal for visualizing individual KV cells in 3D. Therefore, we next developed a Cre-<italic>loxP</italic> based mosaic cell labeling method to visualize single KV cells. For this approach, we generated transgenic <italic>Tg(sox17:Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>)</italic> zebrafish that expresses Cre recombinase in the KV cell lineage that has inducible activity through the addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feil et al., 1997</xref>).

Double transgenic <italic>Tg(sox17:Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>); Tg(ubi:Zebrabow)</italic> embryos were briefly treated with 4-OHT from the dome stage (4 hr post-fertilization or hpf) to the shield stage (6 hpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) to induce low levels of Cre activity that resulted in a switch from the default RFP (red fluorescent protein) expression to YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) expression in a subset of KV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This strategy reliably created mosaic labeled KVs containing a few YFP<sup>+</sup> KV cells with boundaries that are easily distinguished from surrounding RFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Images of mosaic labeled KVs in living <italic>Tg(sox17:Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>); Tg(ubi:Zebrabow)</italic> embryos were volume-rendered using Imaris (Bitplane) software to generate 3D reconstructions of the lumen and KV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To assess the 3D morphology of individual KV cells residing in either the anterior or posterior region of the KV organ, we used the lumen surface as a reference point to ensure that all 3D datasets were analyzed from the same perspective. To make morphometric measurements, we defined three axes of KV cells: (1) cellular ‘height (H)’ is the length of the axis connecting dorsal and ventral surfaces of the cell, (2) cellular ‘length (L)’ is the length of the axis connecting apical (associated with the lumen) and basal surfaces of the cell, and (3) cellular ‘width (W)’ is the length of the axis connecting two lateral sides of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). The combination of mosaic labeling, live imaging and 3D cell morphometrics provides a new approach to investigate the cellular and mechanical mechanisms underlying KV epithelial morphogenesis at single cell resolution.</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-30963-video2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30963.004</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>3D projection of KV in a live mosaic labeled <italic>Tg(sox17:Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>); Tg(ubi:Zebrabow)</italic> embryo at 8 ss.</title><p>Stochastic Cre-mediated recombination labels only few cells with YFP expression with clear boundaries that are easily distinguishable from non-recombined RFP<sup>+</sup> cells.

Time-lapse images from these stages indicated KV cells are highly dynamic during KV morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). To quantify KV cell dynamics, we took several precautions in subsequent experiments to avoid artifacts. First, to avoid potential photobleaching from time-lapse imaging, live embryos were imaged only once at one stage of development—not continuously or at multiple stages. Second, to avoid differences in fluorescence signal due to differences in imaging depth, all KVs were visualized laterally (YZ orientation) and only mosaically labeled cells from the middle plane of the KV organ that is perpendicular to the dorsoventral axis were selected for analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We define the middle plane as the plane with the largest lumen diameter when viewed dorsally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Finally, we determined that the Cre activity was not spatially biased, but rather randomly labeled cells throughout the KV. By analyzing enough embryos, we sampled KV cells from all positions along the middle plane of KV at different stages of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30963.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>3D morphometric analysis of single cells reveals asymmetric cell volume changes during asymmetric KV cell shape changes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A lateral view of a mosaic labeled KV in a <italic>Tg(sox17:Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>); Tg(ubi:Zebrabow)</italic> at 2 ss.

We measured the height, length and width of KV cells from several wild-type embryos to determine the average parameters for KV-ant and KV-post cells. The results showed cell-to-cell variability, but pooling measurements from multiple cells at a specific developmental stage identified trends and statistically significant differences during KV morphogenesis. First, cell height of both KV-ant cells and KV-post cells increased from 2 ss to 8 ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), reflecting the expansion of the apical surface of cells (see dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) to accommodate lumen growth. There were no significant differences in cell height between KV-ant cells and KV-post cells during these stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Second, cell length decreased in both KV-ant cells and KV-post cells during KV morphogenesis, but a sharp reduction was observed from 4 ss to 6 ss in KV-post cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This resulted in the cell length of KV-post cells to become significantly different from KV-ant cells after 4 ss. Importantly, it is between 4 ss to 6 ss when cell shape changes associated with KV remodeling were previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Compagnon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Third, analysis of cell width indicated KV-ant cells remained relatively constant during KV morphogenesis, whereas KV-post cells showed a distinctive increase in width between 4 ss and 6 ss that resulted in significant differences between KV-ant cells and KV-post cells after 4 ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In order to make comparisons with previous 2D studies, we calculated length-to-width ratios (LWR) to describe cell morphology. We found that both KV-ant and KV-post cells had similar morphologies at 2 ss and 4 ss and that these morphologies changed after 4 ss such that KV-ant cells had a significantly larger LWR than KV-post cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This analysis of individual KV-ant and KV-post cell shapes is consistent with asymmetric cell shape changes associated with KV remodeling that were previously identified using 2D measurements of KV cell LWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) and provides for the first time a 3D quantification of epithelial cell morphodynamics that occur during KV development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>3D analysis of single cells reveals asymmetric cell volume changes during KV morphogenesis</title><p>We next used mosaic labeling to address whether the volume of individual KV cells changes during development. Since the cells are not regularly shaped, their volume is not simply given by the product of the length, width and height. Measuring the volume of 3D reconstructed KV cells revealed striking dynamics in cell size that mirrored changes in cell shape. At 2 ss and 4 ss, KV-ant and KV-post cells showed similar cell volumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). However, between 4 ss to 6 ss—when KV cells change shape—the volume of KV-ant cells increased and the volume of KV-post cells decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These dynamics were visualized in real time by tracking individual KV-ant and KV-post cells continuously for a brief time window (55 min) via time-lapse imaging during the critical period between 4 ss and 6 ss in live mosaic labeled embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Our results indicate cell volume becomes significantly different between KV-ant and KV-post cells after 4 ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Thus, differential cell volume changes along the AP axis occur during the same stage as cell shape changes. Overall, between 2 ss and 8 ss, KV-ant cells increased volume from 2106 ± 1014 μm<sup>3</sup> to 2547 ± 693 μm<sup>3</sup> (shown are mean ±one standard deviation) and KV-post cell decreased volume from 2180 ± 1034 μm<sup>3</sup> to 1564 ± 539 μm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The considerable standard deviations here likely reflect the high degree of variability in KV size among wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gokey et al., 2016</xref>). It is important to note that while the cell sizes are variable, the direction of size changes during development is constant. KV-ant cells always increase in volume and KV-post cells always decrease in volume. We refer to these regional changes in KV cell size along the AP body axis as asymmetric cell volume changes, which provide new insight into the mechanics of epithelial morphogenesis in KV.</p><media id="video4" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-30963-video4.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30963.010</object-id><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Time-lapse imaging of KV cells in a live mosaic labeled <italic>Tg(sox17:Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>); Tg(ubi:Zebrabow)</italic> embryo treated with 4-OHT from dome stage to shield stage.</title><p>Images were collected every 5 min from 4 ss to 6 ss.

Volume measurements indicated that both ‘total KV-ant cellular volume’ and ‘total KV-post cellular volume’ were similar at 2 ss, but then were significantly different at 8 ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Overall, ‘total KV-ant cellular volume’ increased from 1.4 × 10<sup>5</sup> μm<sup>3</sup> to 1.7 × 10<sup>5</sup> μm<sup>3</sup> and ‘total KV-post cell volume’ decreased from 1.2 × 10<sup>5</sup> μm<sup>3</sup> to 0.98 × 10<sup>5</sup> μm<sup>3</sup> between 2 ss and 8 ss stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Thus, consistent with volume changes in single cells at the middle plane of KV, we observed asymmetric volume changes along the anterior and posterior axis of KV when the entire cellular component of the organ was analyzed. These results suggested that asymmetric cell volume changes might contribute to lumen growth and/or cell shape changes during the concurrent processes of lumen expansion and epithelial morphogenesis in KV.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Inhibiting ion flux disrupts asymmetric cell volume changes, lumen expansion and cell shape changes in KV</title><p>We next sought to identify a mechanism that mediates KV cell volume changes between 2 ss and 8 ss.

To test whether cell volume changes in KV cells are mediated by ion flux, we inhibited either the sodium-potassium pump (Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) or the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (Cftr). Both have previously been shown to play a role in KV lumen expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Navis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Compagnon et al., 2014</xref>). We first treated mosaic-labeled (e.g. 4-OHT treated) <italic>Tg(sox17:Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>); Tg(ubi:Zebrabow)</italic> embryos with the small molecule ouabain to inhibit the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Compagnon et al., 2014</xref>). The Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase has a central role in generating an electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane that drives transport of water and solutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Damkier et al., 2013</xref>). Ouabain treatments are known to disrupt ion flux, resulting in an increase in intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations. To block Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase during the critical stages when cells change volume, we treated mosaic-labeled embryos with ouabain starting at 4 ss (11 hpf) and then imaged KVs at 6 ss (12 hpf). However, these brief treatments did not reduce KV lumen expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) as expected from previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Compagnon et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, embryos treated with ouabain from the bud stage (10 hpf) to 8 ss (13 hpf) did show reduced KV lumen expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,E</xref>) relative to vehicle (DMSO; dimethyl sulfoxide) treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,E</xref>). This indicated pharmacological treatments from the bud stage are more effective at blocking the lumen expansion process. Similar to wild-type embryos, mosaic labeled KV cells in control embryos treated with DMSO from bud stage to 8 ss underwent normal AP asymmetric changes in cell volume and shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). KV-ant cells increased volume from 2019 ± 668 μm<sup>3</sup> to 2304 ± 618 μm<sup>3</sup> and KV-post cells decreased volume from 1811 ± 422 μm<sup>3</sup> to 1479 ± 323 μm<sup>3</sup> between 2 ss and 8 ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Cftr is an apically localized chloride channel that moves Cl<sup>-</sup> ions out of the cell and establishes electrochemical gradients, which drive water into the lumen through osmosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Navis and Bagnat, 2015</xref>). Cftr activity can also modulate several other ion-channels and transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vennekens et al., 1999</xref>), making it a key driver of ion flux and fluid secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braunstein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Valverde et al., 1995</xref>).

To test whether Cftr has a role in modulating KV cell size, we performed a 3D analysis of mosaic labeled single cells. Similar to ouabain treatments, CFTRinh-172 treatments eliminated asymmetric volume changes in KV cells. In contrast to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), KV-post cells in CFTRinh-172 treated embryos did not lose volume, but rather increased in volume from 1878 ± 361 μm<sup>3</sup> to 2123 ± 632 μm<sup>3</sup>. KV-ant cells increased in volume from 1513 ± 289 μm<sup>3</sup> to 1944 ± 483 μm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Reducing Cftr expression by injecting embryos with <italic>cftr</italic> MO had effects that were similar to CFTRinh-172 treatments: KV lumen failed to expand and asymmetric cell volume changes were disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). In <italic>cftr</italic> MO treated embryos both KV-ant and KV-post cells increased their volume from 1872 ± 726 μm<sup>3</sup> to 2252 ± 842 μm<sup>3</sup> and from 2082 ± 637 μm<sup>3</sup> to 2367 ± 770 μm<sup>3</sup> respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This suggests that in both CFTRinh-172 and <italic>cftr</italic> MO treated embryos KV-post cells fail to undergo volume loss due to inhibition of fluid efflux from these cells. Taken together (for statistical power analysis, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), these results indicate ion flux regulated by Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and Cftr activity is a mechanism that drives asymmetric changes in KV cell volumes along the AP axis.</p><p>We next evaluated the impact of perturbing ion flux on cell shape changes during KV remodeling.

Since the effect of loss of Cftr function on KV has already been determined genetically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Navis et al., 2013</xref>), we focused on the effects of ouabain treatments on external cells. The overall morphology of ouabain treated embryos was similar to controls at 8 ss, except the KV lumen was smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>), indicating ouabain treatments did not cause severe developmental defects.

These results indicate that ouabain does not alter the shapes of cells surrounding KV and suggest that defects in KV cell shape changes result from altered ion flux in KV. This is consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Compagnon et al., 2014</xref>), in which blocking ion flux suggested forces associated with lumen expansion drive KV remodeling. However, because our 3D analyses showed that altering ion flux disrupts both lumen expansion and KV cell volume changes, it remained unclear whether failed cell shape changes were due to defects in lumen expansion or asymmetric cell volume dynamics or both.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mathematical simulations of KV cell shape changes</title><p>To begin to tease apart how intrinsic cell size changes and extrinsic lumen expansion forces contribute to asymmetric KV cell shape changes, we developed and simulated a mathematical vertex model for cell shapes in KV.

For each pair of interfacial tensions, the APA was computed from the average of 100 separate simulation runs. When KV cells are solid-like, the standard error of the mean APA is typically on the order of 0.05. However, for fluid-like KV cells standard error of the mean APA can become much larger, which is reflected by the large mean APA fluctuations in this regime.

(<bold>G,H</bold>) Illustrations of how mechanical properties of external cells affect APA values in our simulations. For solid external cells, the interface between KV-ant and KV-post cells is prevented from moving posteriorly upon decreasing KV-post cell cross-sectional areas between 2 ss and 8 . As a consequence, the posterior KV cells flatten and obtain a smaller LWR-post value, which results in a positive APA. Conversely for fluid external cells, a decrease in KV-post cell cross-sectional area is accommodated by a posterior sliding of the interface between KV-ant and KV-post cells. Consequently, the APA does not increase and may even decrease. These mechanisms work both for increasing lumen cross-sectional area (<bold>G</bold>) and for constant lumen cross-sectional area (<bold>H</bold>).</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig4sdata1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30963.021</object-id><label>Figure 4—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Percentage differences of cell volume, cell cross sectional area, and cell height between anterior and posterior cells [(Post – Ant)/Post] at 2 ss and 8 ss for DMSO control embryos.</title><p>The cell volume is proportional to the product of cross-sectional area and height.

To understand how the volume changes between 2 ss and 8 ss affect cell shape, we do not take into account the full time-dependent evolution of the system. Rather, we performed quasi-static simulations consisting of two parts. Initially, preferred area values <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> for lumen, KV-ant cells, and KV-post cells were set equal to the respective 2 ss values reported in the first column of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>, and the system was relaxed to a force-balanced state using our computer algorithm (upper panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>).

Such a quasi-static approach is appropriate if in the zebrafish KV, relaxation to mechanical equilibrium is faster than the volume changes of lumen and KV cells. In other developing epithelia, this relaxation timescale has been measured using laser ablation and is on the order of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</xref>), which is significantly faster than the rate of lumen volume expansion, which is on the order of hours.

Note that because the definition of the APA is based on length-to-width ratios, it is size-independent. In our in vivo measurements, wild-type embryos at 8 ss correspond to an APA value of ~0.9. For the simulation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, we found an APA value of 0, suggesting no asymmetry, while the simulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> has APA value of 0.29, which is clearly asymmetric but not as high as in wild-type experiments.</p><p>Because the interfacial tensions <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf32"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf33"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> cannot be determined from our experimental data, an obvious question is whether there is <italic>any</italic> choice of those tension values in our model that would allow area changes alone to drive the observed shape changes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> is a plot of APA as the interfacial tension in KV cells and external cells are varied.

Blue areas indicate a positive APA corresponding to regions where KV-ant cells are more radially elongated than KV-post cells are, while red regions indicate negative APA corresponding to regions with more elongated KV-post cells. A first observation is that the APA is never above 0.31, which is much smaller than wild-type experimental observations. This suggests that changes to cross-sectional area may be an important contribution to shape remodeling, but alone they are not sufficient to generate the observed shape changes.</p><p>A second observation is that there are coherent regions in parameter space with similar values of APA, which suggests that our model may be able to identify a simple mechanism for how changes to cross-sectional area drive shape change. It has recently been discovered that as cells increase their interfacial tension <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> or increase their preferred area <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf36"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, the tissue transitions from fluid-like to solid-like behavior, undergoing a so-called rigidity transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bi et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Park et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, some of us have recently reported that a similar fluid-solid transition also occurs in bulk three-dimensional tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Merkel and Manning, 2017</xref>). Therefore, we expect that if we can identify a simple mechanism for 2D shape asymmetry that depends on the fluidity of the surrounding tissue, that same mechanism will also be present in 3D.</p><p>To do so, we map the results for 2D fluid-solid transitions onto our model, where black dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> indicate phase boundaries between solid and fluid. In the upper right quadrant of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>, both the KV cells and external cells are solid-like (SS), in the lower right quadrant external cells are fluid-like while KV cells are solid-like (FS), in the upper left quadrant KV is fluid-like and external tissue is solid-like (SF), and in the lower left quadrant both tissues are fluid-like (FF). There is also a small, hatched region of parameter space where KV-ant cells are solid-like while KV-post cells are fluid-like. To test the significance of our APA values, we computed the standard error of the APA mean for each <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf37"><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> parameter pair. We found that for solid-like KV cells, the error is typically on the order of 0.05, indicating that our results are robust in this regime. Conversely, for fluid-like KV cells, the standard error of the mean can become much larger, which is reflected in the higher APA fluctuations in this regime. They are a direct consequence of softer or floppier KV cells, leading to large fluctuations in their LWRs.</p><p>Interestingly, our model predicts that cross-sectional area changes drive the observed shape changes primarily in the solid-solid region, and our understanding of the fluid-solid transition helps us to understand this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). When the external cells are fluid-like, the KV cells are able to slide past the external cells, so that the interface between the KV-ant and KV-post cells (indicated by a thick black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) moves towards the posterior as the area of the KV-post cells is reduced. In contrast, when the external cells are solid-like, the interface between the KV-ant and KV-post cells is pinned. In this second case, when the KV-post cells lose area they must maintain their lateral width and so the apico-basal extension must decrease. We note that this proposed mechanism works equally well in 3D as in 2D -- solid-like external tissue would pin the anterior-posterior interface so that cell volume changes would affect the area of lateral interfaces between KV cells but not the apical area in contact with the lumen. Therefore, in 3D asymmetric cell volume changes would lead to asymmetric cell shape changes and similar APA values to the ones we identified in our 2D model. Although we cannot rule out a more complex model for KV cell shape changes (e.g. with additional parameters characterizing the mechanical heterogeneities in each cell), our simple model suggests that asymmetric cell volume changes contribute to cell shape changes, though additional mechanisms are necessary to explain the very high APA values that are observed in experiments.</p><p>The number of epithelial cells in KV can vary in a wild-type population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gokey et al., 2016</xref>), therefore we checked the robustness of our result (APA values) with respect to small changes in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf38"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. In particular, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows the simulation results for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf39"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula> KV-ant and KV-post cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref> show the corresponding results for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf40"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>8</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf41"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>12</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>, respectively. In particular, independent of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf42"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, we observe positive APA only in the regime where both KV and external cells are solid-like. Moreover, there is a general trend of higher APA for a smaller KV cell number. Note that in addition to the mechanism creating the AP cell shape asymmetry illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, which works largely independent of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf43"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, we have also discovered a quite different mechanism, which only works for small <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf44"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> if KV-ant cells are solid and KV-post cells are fluid (for details, see Materials and methods). In this case, KV-post cells are more easily deformed and accommodate the lumen expansion by increasing their apical lumen interface, which leads to flatter KV-post cells and thus a high APA at 8 ss (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Note however that this mechanism depends on lumen expansion (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F</xref>).</p><p>Another benefit of the model is that we can test specific hypotheses prior to exploring them experimentally. First, to investigate whether lumen expansion is necessary to create an asymmetry in KV cell elongation, we repeated the numerical simulations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B,E</xref> — which included both asymmetric cell cross-sectional area changes and increase in lumen cross-sectional area between 2 ss and 8 ss — except in this simulation we kept the lumen cross-sectional area fixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D,F</xref>). The APA values, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> are generally smaller (max. APA value of 0.23) than those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> (max APA value of 0.31). However, most of the regimes where both KV and external cells are solid-like still show positive APA values. These results suggest that in an environment in which cells have solid-like mechanical properties, asymmetric volume changes in KV cells can partially drive asymmetric KV cell shape changes even in the absence of lumen expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>Second, using our model, we can explore whether heterogeneous mechanical properties of the external cells can have a significant effect on KV cell shape changes. So far, we have in our model described all external cells using the same parameters. However, given the presence of morphogenetic gradients along the AP axis within the presomitic mesoderm that include FGF and Wnt signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oates et al., 2012</xref>), it is plausible that the mechanical properties of the tailbud cells surrounding the KV may also show an AP-oriented gradient. Moreover, the KV is anteriorly abutting the notochord with likely different mechanical properties from the tailbud cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). We thus wondered how our simulation results would depend on such heterogeneities of the external cells. To study this question, we performed simulations similar to that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> where we additionally allowed all external cells on either the posterior side or the anterior side to be fluid-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>, respectively). These fluid-like subsets of the external cells have an interfacial tension of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf45"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>120</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula> (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). All other parameters were chosen as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, which included asymmetric cell cross-sectional area changes and lumen expansion. In particular, the solid-like external cells had <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf46"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>150</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>. We found that AP cell asymmetry was much more pronounced if only the anterior external cells were solid-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>) than if only the posterior external cells were solid-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>). For the solid-like anterior external cells, the average APA computed from 100 simulations was 0.39 with a standard error of the mean of 0.03. Thus, solidity of only anterior external cells can be sufficient to introduce an asymmetry in KV cell shapes that can be slightly stronger than if all external cells were solid-like. Conversely, with solid-like external cells only in the posterior region the average APA was 0.07 with a standard error of the mean of 0.04. Thus, if there are solid-like cells present only in the posterior region, the induced AP asymmetry in KV cell shape was much weaker. Hence, asymmetry in the mechanical properties of the cells (and/or material) surrounding the KV can support asymmetric cell shape changes in KV.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Interfering with junction plakoglobin function inhibits KV lumen expansion</title><p>We were intrigued by our modeling results that predicted that given the right environment of surrounding cells, changes in KV cell volumes contribute to changes in KV cell shapes even when the lumen fails to expand. To test this prediction experimentally, we wanted to take an approach that would allow us to monitor cell shape changes in KVs in which ion flux and cell volume changes occur normally but lumen expansion is inhibited. Since coordinated remodeling of adherens junctions between epithelial cells plays important roles during lumen formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvers et al., 2014</xref>), we chose to interfere with junctions between adjacent KV cells to disrupt lumen growth. The adherens junction component E-cadherin has been linked to cell junction stability and barrier function that maintains lumenal and tubular structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tunggal et al., 2005</xref>). E-cadherin is expressed in KV cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matsui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tay et al., 2013</xref>), but loss of E-cadherin function in mutant embryos leads to early developmental defects during epiboly that preclude analysis of KV formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kane et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore needed tools that allow junctions to form, but with weakened integrity that allows fluid to leak out of the lumen. Transcriptome analysis of zebrafish KV cells (unpublished data) indicated that Junction plakoglobin (Jup; also called γ-catenin) is expressed in KV cells. Jup interacts in complexes at cell-cell adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fukunaga et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lewis et al., 1997</xref>) and is thought to link cadherins to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kowalczyk et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leonard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holen et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies in cell cultures indicated Jup plays an essential role in maintaining cell-cell adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fang et al., 2014</xref>) and that perturbing Jup function results in increased epithelial permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nottebaum et al., 2008</xref>).

Reduction of Jupa expression was also confirmed using immunobloting. Jupa antibody detected a prominent band (arrowhead) around 75 kDa—consistent with Jupa proteins (~75–80 kDa) in other vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McKoy et al., 2000</xref>)—that was significantly reduced in <italic>jupa</italic> MO injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Delivering <italic>jupa</italic> MO specifically to the DFCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amack and Yost, 2004</xref>) that give rise to KV also disrupted lumen expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>), indicating Jup functions cell-autonomously during KV morphogenesis. Importantly, the effect on KV lumen expansion caused by MO injection was significantly rescued by co-injection of full-length <italic>jupa</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>), indicating specificity for this phenotype. As a second approach to compromise Jupa function, we injected a human <italic>JUP</italic> mRNA with a mutation that causes naxos disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McKoy et al., 2000</xref>). This mutant ‘<italic>JUP</italic>-naxos’ mRNA has previously been shown to encode a dominant-negative protein that interferes with Jup function in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asimaki et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to <italic>jupa</italic> MO treatments, expression of the <italic>JUP</italic>-naxos mRNA reduced KV lumen expansion without inducing other overt defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Importantly, the number of ciliated cells in KV in <italic>jupa</italic> MO and <italic>JUP</italic>-naxos mRNA treated embryos was similar to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>), which demonstrates that small KV lumen area was due to reduced lumen expansion rather than a reduced number of KV cells.</p><p>We next tested our prediction that loss of Jupa weakens cell-cell adhesions that are necessary for KV lumen expansion. First, we found that reducing Jupa expression moderately reduced E-cadherin enrichment (~22% decrease) along KV cell lateral domains relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), which is consistent with previous results in cell culture studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fang et al., 2014</xref>). This finding suggested that although E-cadherin is maintained at levels sufficient for epiboly movements and KV formation, the cell-cell adhesions in KV might be weaker in Jupa depleted embryos than in wild-type. To test this functionally, we treated embryos with a small molecule activator of the Cftr channel (CFTRact-09) that increases Cl<sup>-</sup> ion flux and can over-inflate the KV lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gokey et al., 2016</xref>). Treatment of control MO embryos with CFTRact-09 significantly increased KV lumen area (~50%) as compared to DMSO, but a similar increase was not observed in Jupa depleted embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This suggested that fluids entering the lumen were leaking out through compromised cell-cell junctions. To test this directly, we injected a solution containing fluorescent dextran into the KV lumen. In 4 out of 5 control MO embryos the dextran remained in the lumen over a 1 hr time period. Conversely, in most Jupa depleted embryos the dextran gradually leaked out and only 1 out of 5 embryo retained significant amounts of dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Together, these results indicate Jupa functions to maintain KV cell-cell adhesion integrity that is critical for KV lumen expansion, and suggest Jupa depletion could provide a useful approach to block lumen expansion without affecting ion flux mediated cell volume changes in KV.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Asymmetric KV cell shape changes occur independent of lumen expansion</title><p>We next used Jupa depleted embryos as a tool to test our hypothesis that KV cell volume changes impact KV cell shape changes in the absence of forces exerted by the process of KV lumen expansion.

Studies of developmental processes in animal models have provided important insights into the biochemical signals and mechanical forces that regulate epithelial morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Quintin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schock and Perrimon, 2002</xref>). The zebrafish Kupffer’s vesicle (KV) is a simple organ that provides a useful model system to investigate mechanisms that regulate epithelial cell shape changes in vivo. Using a mosaic labeling approach and 3D morphometric analyses of single KV cells, we identified dynamic epithelial cell volume changes during morphogenesis that are asymmetric along the anteroposterior body axis: KV-ant cells become larger during development, whereas KV-post cells become smaller. Results from experimental perturbations (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) indicated that interfering with ion flux prevents KV lumen expansion, asymmetric changes in KV cell volume, and asymmetric changes in KV cell shape during KV remodeling. This indicated that KV cell shape changes depend on (1) lumen expansion, (2) KV cell volume changes or (3) both. Results from mathematical simulations (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>) indicate that mechanical properties of external tissues surrounding the KV can impact cell shape changes in the KV, and that when external tissues are solid-like, asymmetric cell volume changes in KV cells contribute to cell shape changes even in the absence of lumen expansion. Experimentally, we found that when we leave ion flux and asymmetric KV cell volume changes intact and only inhibit lumen expansion with leaky KV cell-cell junctions (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), AP asymmetric KV cell shape changes occur normally. Together, these studies identify asymmetric cell volume regulation as an intrinsic mechanism that guides cell shape changes during epithelial morphogenesis in KV. We propose this is a genetically programmed process that depends on the properties of surrounding cells, but can be separated from the biophysical forces of lumenogenesis.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30963.030</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary and working model for epithelial cell shape changes during KV morphogenesis.</title><p>Results from experiments and modeling suggest AP asymmetric cell volume changes contribute to asymmetric cell shape changes in the KV epithelium. Inhibiting ion flux blocks asymmetric cell volume changes, lumen expansion and shape changes in KV-ant (blue) and KV-post (red) cells. Vertex simulations predict that asymmetric volume (cross-sectional area) changes in KV cells can introduce AP asymmetry in KV cell shapes without lumen expansion. Consistent with this prediction, asymmetric changes in KV volume and shape occurred in the absence of lumen expansion in embryos with weakened KV cell junction integrity. These results suggest a model in which asymmetric cell volume changes contribute to cell shape changes in KV and that this process is separable from lumen growth.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30963-fig7-v2"/></fig><sec id="s3-1"><title>Asymmetric changes in cell size during KV epithelial morphogenesis</title><p>The finding that KV cells change volume during development is insightful for thinking about mechanisms of epithelial morphogenesis in KV since previous analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Compagnon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) that were limited to 2D did not predict differences in KV cell size. Our previous analysis of 2D cell cross-sectional area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) suggested cells slightly reduce their size during morphogenesis, but did not detect differences between KV-ant and KV-post cells. It is therefore striking that 3D analysis shows that KV cells do indeed change volume, and do so asymmetrically along the AP axis. We recently reported that the size of the KV organ is not under tight control during development, but rather must only exceed a size threshold to function normally during left-right patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gokey et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, KV size can vary among wild-type embryos. Consistent with these findings, we observed variable KV cell sizes. However, it is clear that wild-type KV cells always change size in an asymmetric way along the AP axis. Anterior KV cells always increase their size, whereas posterior cells always decrease their size. Interfering with the asymmetry of these size changes by blocking ion flux prevents asymmetric cell shape changes that we know from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Compagnon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) are critical for KV function. These results indicate the AP asymmetry of volume changes is important for KV morphogenesis and function.</p><p>The decrease in KV-post cell volume is mediated by ion channel activity that regulates fluid movement. Decrease in cell volume has also been observed during morphogenesis of zebrafish otic vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoijman et al., 2015</xref>), where it was suggested that movement of fluids from epithelial cells into the lumen contributes to lumen expansion. It is generally thought that ion flux in epithelial cells sets up a transepithelial flow of fluids from outside the tissue into the lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frizzell and Hanrahan, 2012</xref>). When ion flux was blocked in KV via Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase or Cftr inhibitors between the bud stage and 8 ss, KV-post cells did not shrink (but swelled) and the lumen failed to expand. This finding is consistent with a model in which intraepithelial fluid movement directly from KV-post cells into the lumen promotes lumen expansion. Since the amount of volume lost by KV-post cells does not fully account for the increase in lumen size, we propose ion flux in KV establishes both transepithelial flows and intraepithelial flows from KV-post cells to fill the lumen. Interestingly, brief treatments with the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase inhibitor ouabain between 4–6 ss did not block lumen expansion. This may be because ouabain needs more time to penetrate deep inside the embryo to effectively block ion channel function in KV. Alternatively, these results may suggest ion channel function early in KV development (between bud stage and 4ss) is sufficient for lumen expansion or there are additional mechanisms independent of ion flux that contribute to lumen expansion and cell volume changes.</p><p>What makes KV-ant cells behave different from KV-post cells? This asymmetry likely results from a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that differentially regulate KV-ant and KV-post cells. The increase in KV-ant cell size could involve cell growth. Previous studies have uncovered a role for TOR signaling in cell growth (hypertrophy) in non-dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guertin and Sabatini, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, TOR signaling has been implicated in the morphogenesis of KV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casar Tena et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DiBella et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>). It will be interesting in future work to test for asymmetric expression/function of TOR pathway components in KV cells. Another possible intrinsic mechanism is that different KV cells develop different mechanical properties. Our previous mathematical models suggest that differential cell-cell interfacial tensions along the AP axis can generate AP asymmetric cell shape changes in KV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> showed that contractile force induced cell shape changes are instituted via cell volume reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saias et al., 2015</xref>), which indicates a link between cell volume regulation and mechanical force generation. In the KV system, it will be interesting to test in future work whether AP asymmetric volume changes result in differential cytoskeletal contractility between KV-ant and KV-post cells. Another possible contributing factor to asymmetric KV cell size is differential activation of ion channels in KV-ant and KV-post cells. For example, it is known that the Cftr localizes to the apical surface of all KV cells at all stages of KV development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Navis and Bagnat, 2015</xref>). A recent study has uncovered mechanosensitive activation of Cftr in response to membrane stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Stretching the plasma membrane increased ion conductance and also the probability of open Cftr channels at cell membranes. During KV remodeling, apical membrane stretch in KV-post cells may lead to increased Cftr activity and higher ion-efflux with a loss of volume in these cells. An alternative possibility is that different KV cell fates (e.g. KV-ant and KV-post cells) may be determined early in development. By tracking the DFCs that give rise to KV, we have found that these cells maintain their relative spatial positions throughout KV development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dasgupta and Amack, 2016</xref>). This suggests subpopulations of KV cells may differentiate early in development and become biochemically distinct during KV morphogenesis. Additional studies are warranted to test the hypothesis of distinct KV-ant and KV-post subpopulations of cells that have differential gene expression and/or ion channel activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The impact of mechanical forces on KV epithelial morphogenesis</title><p>Our vertex model simulations suggest that asymmetric volume changes are not alone sufficient to fully induce KV cell shape changes. In addition to cell-intrinsic mechanisms, biophysical forces likely guide the formation of the KV epithelium. These mechanical forces can also arise from extrinsic sources that stem from the mechanical properties of surrounding tissues or extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campàs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chanet and Martin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Serwane et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Etournay et al., 2015</xref>). Localized deposition of the ECM molecules laminin and fibronectin around anterior region of KV has been found to be important for asymmetric cell shape changes during KV morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Compagnon et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, our simulations indicated that asymmetric cell shape changes are more pronounced when anterior external cells had solid-like properties and posterior external cells were fluid-like. In this case, the solid-like cells on the anterior side are able to ‘pin’ the interface between the KV-ant cells and the KV-post cells. An AP gradient of ECM, such as fibronectin (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>), may help prevent neighbor exchanges and give rise to solid-like behavior only in anterior external cells. It is also possible that the solid-like ECM directly physically pins the KV-ant cells, so that the mechanism we have identified may operate even if the anterior cells beyond the ECM are fluid-like. Another possibility is that the notochord—which physically interfaces with KV-ant cells—may be a solid-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>) and this may provide the pinning mechanism. To further investigate these possibilities, important and technically challenging future work should focus on developing vertex models that interface with models for ECM fiber networks. In addition, fully three-dimensional models for confluent tissues, which have very recently been mechanically characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Merkel and Manning, 2017</xref>) should also be adapted for organogenesis.</p><media id="video5" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-30963-video5.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30963.031</object-id><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>3D projection of KV in a fixed <italic>Tg(sox17:GFP)</italic> embryo stained with anti-fibronectin antibody at 8 ss.</title><p>Fibronectin (red) shows enrichment around the notochord and anterior region of the KV (green)..

Tissue fluidity in the tailbud plays an important role in controlling body elongation in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lawton et al., 2013</xref>) and may have an impact on KV. Our mathematical modeling suggests that solid-like behavior of surrounding tissue may play an important role in KV remodeling. In a previous study, we used DFC/KV specific knockdown of the Rho kinase Rock2b to test whether actomyosin contractility in KV cells vs. surrounding cells is involved in KV cell shape changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). KV cell shape changes failed to occur in embryos with Rock2b knocked down in KV cells, even though surrounding cells were normal, indicating that cell-autonomous actomyosin activity is important for KV cell shape changes. However, future studies are needed to explore how the mechanical properties of neighboring cells impact the establishment of asymmetric KV-ant and KV-post cell behaviors.</p><p>Lumen expansion occurs synchronously with changes in epithelial cell shapes during KV morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Compagnon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), which raises the possibility that contractile forces and/or intraluminal pressure contributes to KV cell shape changes. This idea is supported by the observation that blocking lumen expansion with ion channel inhibitors prevents KV shape changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Compagnon et al., 2014</xref>). However, blocking ion channel activity also disrupts the previously unrecognized KV cell volume changes, making it unclear whether the lack of cell shape changes are due to reduced luminal forces or absence of cell volume changes. Our mathematical models suggest that KV cells can undergo asymmetric cell shape changes even in the absence of forces associated with lumenogenesis. This prediction was experimentally tested by perturbing KV junctions, which allowed us to block lumen expansion without altering ion channel activity or cell volume changes. 3D morphometric analyses revealed KV lumen expansion involves extension of apical surfaces of both KV-ant and KV-post cells in dorsoventral axis (represented here as cell height). But, lateral extension (represented here as cell width) happens only in KV-post cells, not in KV-ant cells due to tight packing and other mechanical influences. Interestingly, lateral extension of KV-post cells can be uncoupled from the dorsoventral extensions, which play a critical role in lumen expansion. Inhibiting lumen expansion by altering junctional integrity hinders dorsoventral expansion of apical surfaces of all KV cells, but KV-post cells still lose their volume via ion channel mediated fluid efflux and undergo lateral extension to facilitate asymmetric KV cell shape changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, ion channels mediate asymmetric cell shape changes via lateral extension of KV-post cells even when overall lumen expansion is inhibited. These results provide new mechanistic insight into KV epithelial morphogenesis and suggest a working model in which asymmetric KV cell shape changes depend on intrinsic ion flux-mediated fluid movements and do not depend on extrinsic forces generated by lumen expansion.</p><p>We propose that luminal forces have a nominal impact on KV cell shape changes. Previous experimental results support this idea. First, KV cells can fail to change shape even when lumen expansion is normal. Inhibiting Rock2b function or non-muscle myosin II activity had no effect on KV lumen expansion, but prevented cell shape changes during KV remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). This indicates that the mechanical forces generated during lumenogenesis are not sufficient to drive KV cell shape changes without active cytoskeletal contractility. Second, the degree of KV lumen expansion is highly variable in a population of wild-type embryos. Correlations between KV lumen size and KV function show that the lumen only needs to exceed a relatively low size threshold for the KV to be functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gokey et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these findings suggest forces exerted by expansion of the lumen play a minor role in cell shape changes during KV epithelial morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cell volume changes in epithelial morphogenesis</title><p>Cell size is regulated by ion flux, but can also depend on progression through the cell cycle. Thus it is important to note that KV cells are post-mitotic epithelial cells that assemble a cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amack et al., 2007</xref>). As discussed above, we consider the robust AP asymmetric changes in KV cell size that occurs with precise developmental timing (between 4 ss and 6 ss) as regulated cell volume changes that control KV organ architecture. In the zebrafish KV epithelium, we propose that cell volume changes work in concert with other mechanisms to drive KV remodeling. Other recent studies have also identified links between cell volume changes and epithelial morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kolahi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saias et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoijman et al., 2015</xref>). However, little is known about the influence of cell volume changes on cell shape regulation. As mentioned previously, during zebrafish otic vesicle development epithelial cells become thinner, suggesting intraepithelial fluid movement contributes to both lumen growth and cell/tissue shape change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoijman et al., 2015</xref>). This finding is consistent with studies in cell culture systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braunstein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vázquez et al., 2001</xref>) that have shown that epithelial cells indeed undergo cellular fluid loss to regulate cell volume and cell shape. In the mouse embryo, a group of nonproliferative epithelial cells in the tooth primordium also decrease their volume and become thinner during tooth budding morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahtiainen et al., 2016</xref>). Another recent study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> uncovered that during dorsal closure cells within the amnioserosa lose their volume by ~30% and change their shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saias et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, in the egg chamber of <italic>Drosophila</italic> the follicle cell epithelium undergoes volume changes during oocyte development to attain distinct cell shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kolahi et al., 2009</xref>). Taken together with our experimental results and mathematical models in KV, these examples suggest that cell volume change might be a common mechanism that impacts cell shape during epithelial morphogenesis in several tissues and organs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (zebrafish)</td><td valign="top"> <italic>junction plakoglobin a (jupa), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr), lethal giant larvae homolog 2 (lgl2)</italic></td><td valign="top">PMID: 19101534, 23482490,23487313</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (zebrafish)</td><td valign="top">Zebrafish (Danio rerio).

The radius of this circle is computed as the estimated lumen radius plus half of the estimated KV cell height. The positions for the 100 external cells are drawn randomly from a uniform distribution with the condition of having at least a distance of lumen radius plus estimated KV cell height from the lumen cell position. Then, preferred cell areas are set to their 2 ss values and the system is relaxed by minimizing the energy functional. Afterwards, the preferred areas are set to their respective 8 ss values and the system is relaxed again. Note that the Voronoi tessellation is only used to facilitate the initialization. The subsequent energy minimizations are carried out using varying vertex positions. Also note that the dimensions of the periodic box were also allowed to vary during the minimizations. We use the conjugated gradient algorithm from the GSL library (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/</ext-link>) for the energy minimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Press, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Computation of the KV cell length-width ratio (LWR) in the simulations</title><p>We compute the LWR of a given KV cell as the quotient of its length L divided by its width W (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We define the width W as the distance between the midpoints of the respective interfaces with the two adjacent KV cells. The length L is defined as the distance from the midpoint of the interface with the lumen to the midpoint between points P and Q, which are the respective endpoints of the interfaces with the adjacent KV cells. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref> we plot the respective average LWR. During the energy minimizations, KV cells occasionally lose contact with the lumen. For the averaging, we thus only take into account the KV cells that are in still contact with the lumen.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Definition of separation of solid from fluid regimes</title><p>Earlier work on the vertex model suggested that a shape index computed from cell perimeter and area can be used to differentiate between solid and fluid regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bi et al., 2015</xref>). However, these simulations only studied vertex model tissues with a single cell type randomly arranged, while in our simulations, there are several cell types and a very distinct geometrical arrangement. Thus, to differentiate solid cell from fluid ones, we choose a different measurement, which is based on the actual cell perimeter <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf82"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and the interfacial tensions <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf83"><mml:mi>Λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>.

This mechanism is at work for instance in the hatched region in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>, where anterior KV cells are solid-like and posterior KV cells are fluid-like. This difference arises even though both anterior and posterior KV cells have the same interfacial tension <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf89"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>, because anterior KV cells have a much higher preferred area at 8ss than posterior KV cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). Because the condition of fluidity in the vertex model depends on both preferred area and interfacial tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bi et al., 2015</xref>), there is an intermediate regime when increasing <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf90"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> where anterior KV cells are already solid, but posterior KV cells are still fluid. When the lumen area increases in this regime, both anterior and posterior cells together have to accommodate a larger total apical interface with the lumen. However, because the anterior cells are solid while the posterior cells are fluid, the latter are more easily stretched laterally. This induces an asymmetry in cell shape that corresponds to a positive APA. Note that the effect of this mechanism appears to extend further into the region where also the posterior KV cells are solid, likely because close to the hatched region they are still more easily deformable than the anterior KV cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Simulations with asymmetric properties of the external cells</title><p>To simulate asymmetric properties of external cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), we proceeded as before with the following changes.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Asymmetric cell volume changes regulate epithelial remodeling of the left-right organizer&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior/Reviewing Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, all three reviewers were enthusiastic about many aspects of your manuscripts but also asked for rather detailed changes that are likely to take considerable time. This includes improving the illustrations, improving the quality of the results, increasing statistical significance, and improving the writing. It is the policy of <italic>eLife</italic> to reject papers if it would take longer than two months to make the necessary revisions. Therefore, we have no choice but to decline the present version of your manuscript. However, if you feel you can address the comments of the reviewers, detailed below, we would be happy to consider a new version of the paper as a new submission and every effort would be made to return the paper to the same reviewers. I hope you find the attached reviews useful in revising the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper describes experiments and a model exploring the relationships among geometric changes and the forces of morphogenesis, an understudied topic that deserves more exposure. I believe this paper could be a model of an important way to study morphogenesis. My recommendation is for this elegant series of hypothesis-driven experiments, which combine mechanics with molecular tools and mathematical hypothesis generation, to be published with some revision.</p><p>Strengths: Adding the third dimension to studies of morphology changes raises the bar in an important way. The study itself examines interactions among the players, including an epithelium, a lumen, and the surrounding cells, rather than characterizing a single component of the system, such as one ion channel. The trajectory of the paper, from observations of 3D morphology, to a model used to generate hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms including force generation and material properties, to explicit tests of those hypotheses using modern molecular techniques, is a good model of how these types of experiments can be conducted.</p><p>Weaknesses: the illustrations are not as clear as they need to be, and labels are inconsistent making it difficult to follow, particularly the first half, (up through the description of the model). The first half of the document is difficult to read in a way that I associate with an author who knows a subject so well that she or he forgets to provide the reader with the &quot;obvious&quot; background needed.</p><p>1) There is no discussion of total system volume. I wanted to know what is getting pushed where as the lumen increases in volume. I quickly counted the number of external cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, and there were fewer at 8ss. Where did they go? It doesn't seem like the decrease in volume of posterior KV cells would be sufficient for the KV as whole to have a constant volume. A clearer explanation of the boundary conditions is needed in the text.</p><p>2) I think it is imperative that they add a description of the effect of the drugs and the MOs on the rest of the embryo, especially the external cells. That, plus the differences in the apparent extent of the KV in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A – E</xref>, also made me want to know about total volumes and relative versus absolute changes in shape and size.</p><p>3) It was not clear to me why knocking out E-cadherin directly is lethal, but knocking out its accumulation is not. Is it just a dosage effect, or is something else going on?</p><p>4) The manuscript should be revised one more time, preferably by someone not intimately familiar with the project, who can identify where and why clarity is lacking. I've made some specific suggestions below, but it needs to be revised for consistency in terms (x,y,z or l,w,h or apical-basal etc.) and illustrations (line graphs vs. bar graphs, consistency of colors – in different places red means lumen, untransformed KV cell, anterior cells only, etc.). The section describing the model, in particular, needs to include more information up front – even with long experience interpreting models, I had to go back and forth to the supplements many times before finding the background I needed to understand the model and its predictions.</p><p>Highly recommended: Since the authors have the 3D data, I was disappointed that the model was nevertheless simplified to 2D. I have to assume the authors are heading in that direction, so I was torn about whether to list this under required. I chose to recommend it highly on the basis that the model as is clearly provides useful testable predictions, which are cleverly explored experimentally in the latter half of the paper. But, it would be great if the model could be that much more representative of the actual geometry.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The study by Dasgupta and colleagues show for the first time asymmetric volume changes in the KV and argue that this asymmetry contributes to the asymmetric cell shape changes contribute to KV cell shape changes. They also provide experiments to show that inhibiting lumen expansion does not affect cell shape changes associated with KV morphogenesis. Although asymmetric volume change represents an interesting potential mechanism, the paper is severely hampered by the quality of the results, and specifically, the huge standard deviations for some experiments. I also have some doubts about the impact of the study considering that the described process lead to change in 20% of the size of the KV and that the Amack group showed that left-right patterning occurs normally even though KV size can change vary more than 30% between embryos (see Gokey et al. 2015).</p><p>First main point of paper: There are asymmetric cell volume changes that correlate with asymmetric cell shape changes.</p><p>The presented data are not completely convincing. The reason is the approach used by the authors is not validated. For example the authors never made sure that the results are not simply due to photobleaching, changes in depth, etc. The authors should perform alternative cell volume measurements in KVs where cells are labeled in a mosaic with a membrane marker either by late mRNA injection, DNA injection or even cell transplantation and assess if the signal and therefore the cell volume measurements affected by the location of cells within the KV or by the stage of the embryos (the organ is deeper?) or by photo-bleaching (prolonged imaging). These points need to be addressed since the volume change reported here is only of about 20% between 2 and 8 ss. Overall the best would be to provide a comprehensive analysis of cell surface or volume and present convincing results (and significant data for statistical analysis) of cell volume changes throughout the KV. At present the authors are dependent on mosaic experiments where the cells location is random and we are left with data presenting huge variability with scales on the plots that are not consistent and comparable between conditions (see Figures: 1, 2 and 5).</p><p>Given that their simulations are in 2D, it might help to also perform a simpler experiment where they label cells exactly as they did in Wang 2012, and see if they see the expected differences in cross-sectional area between anterior and posterior cells. They could also see if their cross-sectional area measurements match up with their volume data (i.e. assume that the cells are columnar and calculate volume).</p><p>In addition, the authors need to clarify the following points:</p><p>- Sample size and number of independent experiments;</p><p>- Experimental design; e.g. cell volume changes between 2 and 8 ss: did they follow the same cells overtime and therefore show single cell growth or shrinkage or simply measured the volume of different cells in embryos at different stages and compared average cell volumes?</p><p>- Explain better the statistical tests and how the analysis was done; e.g. How was the cell volume change quantified?</p><p>They write in the Discussion:</p><p>&quot;The finding that KV epithelial cells change volume during development is surprising and insightful since previous 2D analyses had not identified any statistically significant changes in KV cell size.&quot;</p><p>Their previous study showed that cells reduced their cross-sectional area during morphogenesis (Wang 2012), suggesting that cells reduced their volume, but this study shows for first time that these volume changes are asymmetric. This point should be clarified.</p><p>Second main point of paper: Inhibiting ion channels inhibits cell shape changes.</p><p>Large error bars and inconsistent scales are a problem.</p><p>Third main point of paper: In simulations, asymmetric cell volume changes could account partially for cell shape changes, provided that the mechanical properties of the cells satisfy certain conditions.</p><p>The issue about mechanical properties of cells is important. It is unclear if the anterior and posterior mechanical properties of the KV environment are different and how this contributes to KV morphogenesis. If the mechanical properties of surrounding cells are important, could they simulate what happens when there are asymmetric differences in the environment (e.g. If the anterior surrounding cells are solid like, but basal surrounding cells are fluid like, etc.), or when there are asymmetric differences in the KV cells (when anterior KV cells are solid like, but basal KV cells are fluid like, etc.).</p><p>Given that the effect of cell volume changes relies on the condition that surrounding cells are solid like, it would be important to perform an experiment to test that. It brings a different light to the Wang et al., 2012 paper, which used blebbistatin and MOs to disrupt mechanical properties of KV cells. Could some of the effects they saw be due to the changes in mechanical properties of surrounding cells rather than the KV cells themselves?</p><p>Given that their simulations show that cell volume changes alone could not account for cell shape changes, it is weird that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> cell shape changes are completely gone.</p><p>Is cell volume change somehow a prerequisite for cell shape changes via actomyosin contractility? They suggest there could be a link in the Discussion, referencing Saias et al., 2015.</p><p>Considering the importance of actomyosin in the process of KV morphogenesis, it is important to show what happens to KV cell volume (anterior and posterior) when myosinII/rock2b is inhibited. It might be also good to check phosphorylated myosin via antibody staining (as they did in Wang 2012) to see if inhibiting ion channels somehow affects actomyosin contractility.</p><p>Repeat experiments in Figure.5 with DFC specific knockdown and possibly in lgl mutant, which is available.</p><p>Fourth main point: Lumen expansion does not affect KV cell shape change.</p><p>This is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Once again, the huge error bars and differences between controls are problematic.</p><p>Fifth and concluding point: Inhibiting cell volume changes disrupts cell shape changes.</p><p>Here key experiments are missing. The authors never demonstrate that asymmetric (anterior-posterior) cell volume changes are necessary or contribute KV morphogenesis. The authors should directly test the impact of cell volume change on KV morphogenesis and in particular the impact of asymmetric volume change between anterior and posterior. Photomorpholinos could provide temporal and spatial specificity. If they can get it to work, blocking cftr in anterior vs. posterior cells, and blocking cftr in left vs. right cells to see if an additional axis of asymmetry arise (they could also input this into their simulations) would be necessary.</p><p>Finally, the authors need to rethink their final drawing because it is really misleading.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The work of Dasgupta et al. uses the Kupffer's vesicle of zebrafish as a model to study the epithelial morphogenesis, in particular the possible role of programmed cell volume changes and the relationship between lumenogenesis and epithelial remodeling.</p><p>Positive aspects of the manuscript include: Methodology: the use of an elegant mosaic labelling approach to perform 3D volumetric and shape analysis of single epithelial cells in vivo. Results: (a) The description of AP asymmetry in cell volume in the KV, with A cells increasing while P decreasing volume between 2 and 8 somites (this data add to the previously described AP asymmetry in cell shape, seen in 2D, which the authors called &quot;tissue remodeling&quot;). (b) The finding that ion flux is required not only for KV lumen expansion (as previously described) but also for the establishment of AP polarity in cell volume. (c) The experimental separation of AP changes in cell shape and volume from lumen expansion, which indicate that the former changes might be autonomous and not a response to external forces generated during lumen expansion. Results from a-c led show that changes in KV cell volume might contribute to epithelial remodeling independent from the forces generated by lumen expansion.</p><p>My main concerns of the paper are:</p><p>Methodology:</p><p>a) The authors mix results and discussion of experimental data of cell shape (measured in 2D) with volume changes (in 3D). This is not correct and could lead to wrong interpretations. For making a clearer connection between the two, parameters of cell shape should incorporate the 3 principal axes. Also, the authors equal the term &quot;epithelial remodeling&quot; with the changes in cell shape in 2D. The authors should restrict the use of the term epithelial remodeling when addressing the epithelial changes in a broader manner, for example, in the introduction and discussion, and use &quot;changes in cell shape&quot; in the other cases.</p><p>b) The authors developed a mathematical approach using a 2D vertex model to test the relationship between changes in cell shape and volume and lumen expansion. The model works well for testing the relationship between cell shape changes and lumen expansion in 2D. However, the authors extend the interpretation of the results to the changes in cell volume, assuming that changes in cell cross sectional areas (2D) are equivalent to the changes in cell volume (3D). However, this is not necessarily the case, and thus all the conclusions and predictions that involve changes in cell volume are not valid. The authors should be very careful and make more explicit the limitations of the model. Although the use of 2D models for 3D data is in many cases useful, it is not in this particular case, where the changes of cell volume are central for the mechanisms.</p><p>Results:</p><p>It remains unclear what the main conclusions of the paper are. The authors propose that changes in cell volume work upstream of the changes in tissue remodeling but there is no direct evidence of this, nor they explore the mechanisms that could mediate this process.</p><p>Also, it remains unexplored what makes the changes in cell volume to be AP asymmetric, and whether these changes are really &quot;programmed autonomously&quot; or if the mechanisms that control cell volume are symmetric but modulated in an asymmetric manner by non-autonomous forces (e.g. asymmetric ECM deposition).</p><p>Finally, the lack of requirement of lumen expansion for KV tissue remodeling and changes in cell volume is an interesting finding, but again this is not explored further.</p><p>In summary, the paper provides interesting methodology and data, but in its current state has a lack of focus, which makes unclear its main contribution to our understanding of epithelial morphogenesis.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Asymmetric cell volume changes regulate epithelial morphogenesis in zebrafish Kupffer's vesicle&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior and Reviewing Editor.

We hope you find their comments useful and look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The clarity of the manuscript is greatly improved, and extra data that I requested has been collected, analyzed thoughtfully, and integrated. I believe it is a strong paper that makes a contribution to our understanding of KV development and, more generally, the interplay of different forces during morphogenesis. I also believe it makes a strong argument for the importance of addressing questions about morphogenetic forces and shape generation, and I think the structure of the project could serve as a useful model for how to conduct such studies. Specifically, the sequence they present, careful description of 3D morphology at multiple time points, followed by hypothesis generation (in their case using modeling), followed by experimental testing of those hypotheses, is a useful outline for these kinds of studies. I look forward to following this project, especially if these authors are able to expand their models into 3D the way they have expanded their descriptions. I recommend publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Dasgupta et al. describes how asymmetric cell shape changes between the anterior and posterior cells of the zebrafish Kupffer's vesicle (KV). Using 3D analysis of single cells at defined single time points, the authors show that asymmetric cell shape changes in length, width and volume (but not in height, xz) occur between 4 and 6 somite-stages (ss) and that lumen expansion does not primarily contribute to asymmetric cell shape changes.</p><p>Although the conclusion from the latter part is convincing, what drives asymmetric cell shape changes is largely unclear from the 3D analysis other than involvement of ion channels. The authors emphasize that live embryos are imaged at one stage to avoid potential photobleaching. This approach is good to initially identify the crucial parameters and duration. However, to identify the mechanisms underlying asymmetric cell shape changes requires the analysis of single cell behavior continuously during the critical time points (from 4ss to 6ss) based on time-lapse movies.</p><p>There are several concerns to be clarified.</p><p>1) It is confusing about the term &quot;asymmetric cell volume changes&quot;, which reflects asymmetric cell shape changes in length and width but not in height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). What is the biological significance of asymmetric cell volume changes from a mechanistic point of view? Would it be all explained by changes in length and width (2D)? Also, it is ambiguous to include this term in the title.</p><p>2) Despite the fact that the authors found out the crucial time point in this process between 4 ss and 6 ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the majority of their analyses have been done at 2 ss and 8 ss stages. The problem is that the experiments using ion channel inhibitors have been treated from tailbud to 2ss or tailbud to 8ss. Because of the effects of those ion channel inhibitors on height of both anterior and posterior cells at 2 ss, the authors should treat with those inhibitors from 4ss to 6ss to see if there is the effect only on the morphometric properties of posterior cells. How could ion channels mediate asymmetric cell shape changes if lumen expansion (apical expansion) were not important in this process?</p><p>3) I am uncertain about how informative the modeling part is (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The vertex model simulations are basically done in 2D without measurements for the tensions in anterior and posterior cells and the external forces during the transition between 4ss and 6ss. The limitation is there is no data showing shape changes of a single cell in the anterior or posterior KV during this crucial transition (4ss to 6ss) based on time-lapse movies. However, I cannot assess on the mathematical modeling using solid-like or fluid-like cells that eventually leads to the conclusion that cell shape changes do not depend on lumen expansion.</p><p>4) There is inconsistency of the data upon ouabain treatment at 2ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The former shows a reduction of the lumen size, whereas the latter shows that the lumen size looks unaffected.</p><p>5) What is the biological significance of cell height changes at 2 ss in embryos treated with ion channel inhibitors or lgl2-morphant embryos? It is confusing, as cell height does not significantly change between anterior and posterior cells from 2ss to 8ss.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The study by Dasgupta and colleagues show for the first time asymmetric volume changes in the KV and argue that this asymmetry contributes to the asymmetric cell shape changes contribute to KV cell shape changes. They also provide experiments to show that inhibiting lumen expansion does not affect cell shape changes associated with KV morphogenesis. The authors use a nice combination of experiments and modeling to assess this interesting issue. This study proposes a new process that could at work in the process of KV morphogenesis that promises to start exciting new avenues of investigation. Overall the article is a great piece of work and has been significantly improved since the last revision. We have a few comments.</p><p>1) Inhibiting ion channels inhibits cell shape changes/asymmetric cell changes in KV are separable from lumen expansion.</p><p>The statistical analysis. Ouabain treatment and cftr knock down lead to similar conclusion which is great. However, both experiments are based on the fact that the results are not significant in the treated embryos at 2SS and 8SS. For this type of analysis, the authors should provide a power analysis to demonstrate that the sample size is enough to conclude about not significant results. Similar comment for jupa and igl2 treatments.</p><p>2) Mechanical properties of the surrounding cells. In simulations, asymmetric cell volume changes could account partially for cell shape changes, provided that the mechanical properties of the cells satisfy certain conditions.</p><p>The issue about mechanical properties of cells is important. The mechanical properties of surrounding cells are important and need to be solid like at least anteriorly. Please provide reasonable explanation as to why anterior and posterior could be solid like and more generally, what are the arguments implying that mesodermal cells are solid like (this can be part of the Discussion). The 'pinning' hypothesis is interesting in that aspect and could be discussed. Lance Davidson’s work could be discussed as it seems that the notochord is a pretty rigid structure from his work. In addition, could the fact that fibronectin is enriched in the anterior side of the KV could increase the possibility that cells are solid like anteriorly?</p><p>3) Cell volume changes and actomyosin. Given that their simulations show that cell volume changes alone could not account for cell shape changes, it is weird that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> cell shape changes are completely gone. A way to interpret these data is that ouabain does not specifically target cell volume but also affects elements modulating cell shape, such actomyosin. This raises the question of the effect of ouabain on the actomyosin network. The demonstration is that the actomyosin network is not altered by the treatment. The authors should check it with phosphorylated myosin via antibody staining (as they did in Wang 2012) to see if inhibiting ion channels somehow affects actomyosin contractility. Or is it a problem with the model?</p><p>4) The conclusion 'Asymmetric cell volume changes regulate epithelial morphogenesis'. It should be toned down providing that we do not know if the surrounding cells are solid like and that we do not know how the actomyosin network is compromised by the treatments used. The term 'regulate' seems too strong at this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30963.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Weaknesses: the illustrations are not as clear as they need to be, and labels are inconsistent making it difficult to follow, particularly the first half, (up through the description of the model).

The force-balanced states depicted in former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>(now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-D</xref>) and in the related figure supplements do not represent the whole system.

Also, we agree that it is an interesting question how the KV volume change is accommodated by the external cells in the experiments. From preliminary experiments in which we have tracked cell nuclei (expressing mCherry) in the tailbud region, it is clear that there are at least 10-20 cell diameters between the KV and the edge of the embryo and the nuclei density is not significantly disturbed, so it seems plausible that the volume change is distributed throughout the external cells and does not change much about the external cell geometry. We plan to focus on the fluidity, geometry, and mechanical properties of external cells in future work, but we think this large endeavor is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I think it is imperative that they add a description of the effect of the drugs and the MOs on the rest of the embryo, especially the external cells.

We have now examined the effect of the</p><p>pharmacological inhibitor ouabain on the rest of the embryo and specifically on external cells surrounding the KV. We focused on ouabain treatments since it is already known that Cftr is expressed specifically in KV cells (and not external cells around the KV) and that loss of Cftr function does not alter tissues other than KV between 2 ss and 8 ss (Navis et al., 2013). This analysis is included in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>and has been described in the Results:</p><p>“Since these treatments were global, we wanted to test whether blocking ion channels altered other tissues in the embryo, including cells surrounding KV that could have an impact on KV cell shapes. […] These results indicate that ouabain does not alter the geometry of cells surrounding KV and suggest that defects in KV cell shape changes result from altered ion flux in KV”.</p><p>We did not repeat this analysis for Jup MO and Lgl2 MO treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) since KV cells (shape changes and volume changes) are normal in these treatments. The differences in the apparent extent of the KV arise from natural variations in the size of KV from embryo to embryo. We recently investigated KV variation and found that KV size can vary significantly among wild-type embryos (Gokey et al., 2016). The reason for this is that KV size is not tightly regulated, but rather only needs to exceed a certain (relatively small) threshold to function normally to establish left-right asymmetry. This source of variability has been clarified in the revised text. To corroborate size changes at the single-cell level, we measure the total volume of the KV cellular component and KV lumen at 2 ss and 8 ss stages and found asymmetric volume changes that were similar to our single cell analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We report the raw data (absolute size/volumes of single cells) at 2 ss and 8 ss stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) from all our control and treatment groups. However, given the variability in KV size (discussed above), we have focused the manuscript on relative changes rather than absolute changes. In other words, it is not the amount of volume change, but rather the AP asymmetry of the volume changes—anterior KV cells always increase in size and posterior cells always decrease in size—that is important for KV morphogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It was not clear to me why knocking out E-cadherin directly is lethal, but knocking out its accumulation is not. Is it just a dosage effect, or is something else going on?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is a dosage effect. Loss-of-function mutations in E-cadherin result in the arrest of epiboly movements of deep cells at the 70-80% epiboly stage development (8 hpf) prior to the appearance of KV (11 hpf) (Kane et al., 2005). With the MO dose we used in Jup knockdown embryos, E-cadherin enrichment at lateral KV membranes is only moderately reduced (~22% decrease) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). These knockdown embryos complete gastrulation and appear similar to controls except for KV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating Ecadherin is maintained at levels sufficient for epiboly movements and KV formation. However, our functional results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F, G</xref>) suggest loss of Jup that leads to a moderate reduction in E-cadherin expression weakens the cell-cell adhesions between KV cells relative to wild-type. This has been clarified in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The manuscript should be revised one more time, preferably by someone not intimately familiar with the project, who can identify where and why clarity is lacking. I've made some specific suggestions below, but it needs to be revised for consistency in terms (x,y,z or l,w,h or apical-basal etc.) and illustrations (line graphs vs. bar graphs, consistency of colors – in different places red means lumen, untransformed KV cell, anterior cells only, etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions. We recruited two additional readers that have now critically evaluated our manuscript and figures and made helpful comments.

See below for details. We hope that clarity has significantly improved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Highly recommended: Since the authors have the 3D data, I was disappointed that the model was nevertheless simplified to 2D. I have to assume the authors are heading in that direction, so I was torn about whether to list this under required. I chose to recommend it highly on the basis that the model as is clearly provides useful testable predictions, which are cleverly explored experimentally in the latter half of the paper. But, it would be great if the model could be that much more representative of the actual geometry.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point, which we carefully considered ourselves in writing this</p><p>manuscript. We are in fact headed in the direction of 3D models and we agree that it is important, but in order to use such a model for the KV, we first have to understand the simple, bulk mechanical properties of 3D models for tissues, which has not really been studied before.</p><p>Some of us have a preprint that just appeared online (Merkel and Manning, 2017), showing that there is indeed a fluid-solid transition in the 3D model. We next need to investigate whether adding additional interfacial tensions (as we’ve done here in 2D) are numerically stable, as there are some subtleties about numerical stability in 3D that we are actively working through now. Therefore, we didn’t want to use a model we do not yet fully understand here, and, as discussed below, we do not think it is necessary to explain the science.</p><p>For us, the question one must always ask with modeling is whether the mechanism that one is proposing as biologically relevant can survive realistic perturbations to the model. In this case, the mechanism we propose is that solid-like behavior of the surrounding tissue can “pin” the interface between the anterior and posterior KV cells so that it remains at the mid-plane despite changes to cell volume and cross-sectional area, and this helps to generate the observed shape changes. We have added a new figure and text to highlight this mechanism.</p><p>Now, we must ask whether this mechanism would survive a (major) perturbation to the model, which is going from 2D to 3D. We provide data that demonstrates that the 3rd dimension (e.g. the length of the cell along the dorsal-ventral axis, which we call the “height”) contributes much less differential changes to cell volume than changes in the cross-sectional areas. We have added a table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>, which shows that the AP-asymmetry in cell volumes at 8ss significantly alters the AP-asymmetry of cross sectional areas, but only marginally alters the height asymmetry. This suggests that KV remodeling in the middle plane perpendicular to the DV axis can be understood independently of the precise processes that control cellular DV extension. Specifically, one can imagine that the mechanism we have identified in 2D works the same way in 3D: when pinning the A-P interface at the middle plane, the average apical areas of the A and of the P cells are also pinned respectively. Thus, cell volume changes would directly affect the apico-basal dimension of these cells, leading to a change in aspect ratio. Of course, this relies on the fact there is solid-like pinning of the interface in 3D, and we have added a note and a reference in the modeling section to note the work from our preprint showing that solid-fluid transitions do exist in a 3D version of the model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The study by Dasgupta and colleagues show for the first time asymmetric volume changes in the KV and argue that this asymmetry contributes to the asymmetric cell shape changes contribute to KV cell shape changes. They also provide experiments to show that inhibiting lumen expansion does not affect cell shape changes associated with KV morphogenesis. Although asymmetric volume change represents an interesting potential mechanism, the paper is severely hampered by the quality of the results, and specifically, the huge standard deviations for some experiments. I also have some doubts about the impact of the study considering that the described process lead to change in 20% of the size of the KV and that the Amack group showed that left-right patterning occurs normally even though KV size can change vary more than 30% between embryos (see Gokey et al. 2015).</p></disp-quote><p>The sizeable standard deviations that can come with measuring KV cells are due to the wide variability in the size of KV from embryo to embryo. These standard deviations are important, as they accurately reflect the degree of variability in the system. We now report all raw cell volume data as an average + one standard deviation in the revised text (Results section). As noted, we recently reported a comprehensive study of the natural variation of KV size and number of ciliated cells in several wild-type and transgenic strains (Gokey et al., 2016).</p><p>Direct comparisons of KV size with left-right patterning (a readout for KV function) in individual embryos revealed that KV size only needed to exceed a certain (relatively small) threshold to function normally. Thus, we agree with the reviewer that the amount that the KV cells change in size/volume, which varies from embryo to embryo, may not be that important. However, it is clear from our results that wild-type KV cells always change size in an asymmetric way along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Anterior KV cells always increase in size and posterior cells always decrease in size. These asymmetric cell size changes are linked to asymmetric cell shape changes along the AP axis that we know from previous studies are critical for KV function.</p><p>We have modified the Results section and added a new paragraph to the Discussion section to clarify the point that it is the AP asymmetry rather than the absolute value of volume changes that are important for KV morphogenesis and function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>First main point of paper: There are asymmetric cell volume changes that correlate with asymmetric cell shape changes.</p><p>The presented data are not completely convincing. The reason is the approach used by the authors is not validated. For example the authors never made sure that the results are not simply due to photobleaching, changes in depth, etc. The authors should perform alternative cell volume measurements in KVs where cells are labeled in a mosaic with a membrane marker either by late mRNA injection, DNA injection or even cell transplantation and assess if the signal and therefore the cell volume measurements affected by the location of cells within the KV or by the stage of the embryos (the organ is deeper?) or by photo-bleaching (prolonged imaging). These points need to be addressed since the volume change reported here is only of about 20% between 2 and 8 ss.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that there was confusion about our methodology. We have now substantially revised the text and added new figures and movies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) to clarify our approach to 3D measurements of KV cells.</p><p>We did not use an alternative labeling approach (mRNA injection, DNA injection, cell transplantation), since each approach would be subject to the same potential imaging artifacts (e.g. photobleaching or tissue depth). Instead, we took several precautions to avoid these artifacts. In our initial experiments, time-lapse imaging (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>) was used to identify cell dynamics during KV development. However, to avoid potential photobleaching problems, live embryos in subsequent experiments were imaged only once at one stage of development – not continuously or at multiple stages. Thus, using <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>as an example, different live embryos were imaged and analyzed at 2 ss, 4 ss, 6ss and 8 ss stages and representative cell morphologies from each stage are depicted.</p><p>To avoid differences in fluorescence signal due to differences in imaging depth, cells were not selected at random positions in the KV, but rather had to reside at the middle plane along the AP axis (defined as where the lumen diameter is largest) of the KV in all embryos analyzed. This was not made clear in our original manuscript and is now emphasized in the text. All images were also visualized in an YZ orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) to determine that signals were not affected by depth. This methodology has now been clarified in the text, figures and videos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall the best would be to provide a comprehensive analysis of cell surface or volume and present convincing results (and significant data for statistical analysis) of cell volume changes throughout the KV.

As the reviewer suggests, we first thought to assume that the cells were columnar, but we quickly realized that simple assumptions like cuboidal cell shapes were not enough to account for cell volumes based on cell cross-sectional areas and cell heights, but that an effective geometrical factor was needed, which accounted for effects like cell-cell interfacial curvature. The need for such a factor was consistent with our observation of curved cell interfaces and its value was always approximately two, but the precise value varied depending on experimental stage and cell type (A/P). Thus, interpreting these results in a systematic way was difficult and so we left this computation out of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the authors need to clarify the following points:</p><p>- Sample size and number of independent experiments;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.

In wild-type embryos at 2 ss the KV-ant and KV-post cells have very similar volumes and cell shapes.

We now additionally studied the influence of</p><p>asymmetries in the external cells. As may have been expected from our proposed mechanism (that solid-like cells “pin” the interface between the anterior and posterior cells at the middle plane during volume changes), we find that it does make a difference whether only anterior or only posterior external cells were solid or all external cells were solid.</p><p>In particular, if only posterior external cells were solid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>), the AP asymmetry in KV cell shape was much weaker than if only anterior external cells were solid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>), because they do a poor job of “pinning” the interface between anterior and posterior cells. In contrast, when only anterior external cells are solid-like, the pinning works well and the APA is very slightly larger than in the case where all external cells were solid. We now added a discussion of these simulations to the main text.</p><p>In future work, we are planning to extensively study the fluidity, geometry, and mechanical properties of the external cells in more detail, in order to better constrain their effects on KV mechanics, but we believe this is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Or when there are asymmetric differences in the KV cells (when anterior KV cells are solid like, but basal KV cells are fluid like, etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>The case of solid anterior KV cells and fluid posterior KV cells is already included in our simulations.

It brings a different light to the Wang et al., 2012 paper, which used blebbistatin and MOs to disrupt mechanical properties of KV cells. Could some of the effects they saw be due to the changes in mechanical properties of surrounding cells rather than the KV cells themselves?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. Our previously reported blebbistatin treatments and</p><p>global MO knockdowns of the Rho kinase Rock2b (Wang et al., 2012) likely impact the mechanical properties of both KV cells and surrounding cells. We previously did an experiment to test whether actomyosin contractility in KV cells vs. surrounding cells is involved in KV cell shape changes (Wang et al., 2011). To test this, MOs against Rock2b were injected into midblastula stage embryos for DFC/KV specific knockdown. KV cell shape changes failed to occur in embryos with Rock2b knocked down in KV cells, even though surrounding cells were normal. This indicates that cell-autonomous function of Rock2b and actomyosin activity is important for KV cell shape changes. Of course, this doesn’t rule out a role for surrounding cells, and future studies are needed to test this possibility. This point is now addressed in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that their simulations show that cell volume changes alone could not account for cell shape changes, it is weird that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> cell shape changes are completely gone.</p><p>Is cell volume change somehow a prerequisite for cell shape changes via actomyosin contractility?

It might be also good to check phosphorylated myosin via antibody staining (as they did in Wang 2012) to see if inhibiting ion channels somehow affects actomyosin contractility.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that is interesting and important to tease apart the relationships among ion flux, cell volume changes and cytoskeletal contractility. The suggested experiments are excellent and we plan to pursue this line of investigation in future work. As suggested, there are several possible outcomes. First, as mentioned in our Discussion section, contractile forces that generate cell shape changes may be directly linked to cell volume changes. In the KV system, it will be interesting to test whether AP asymmetric volume changes result in differential cytoskeletal contractility between KV-ant and KV-post cells. To do this, we are generating fluorescent reporters of actomyosin dynamics in KV cells to analyze this in real time.</p><p>A second possibility is that actomyosin contractility is necessary for cells to change volume. Here, we can use treatments (e.g. blebbistating, Rock2b MO, and <italic>mypt1</italic> mRNA) to perturb contractility and then assay volume changes. In addition, we are building genetic tools to address this possibility. Since we have established the sox17:CreERT2 transgenic line, we are using CRISPR to introduce loxP sites into cytoskeletal regulatory genes such as Rock2b. This system would allow us to delete Rock2b specifically in KV and then follow contractility, volume changes and shape changes.</p><p>A third possibility, as pointed out, is that ion flux might influence contractility independent of volume changes. This may be difficult to separate out, but we will use antibody staining and fluorescent reporters to assess contractility in KV at early stages prior to volume changes.</p><p>Finally, it is possible that the relationship between cell volume changes, ion flux and cytoskeletal contractility is not linear, but rather more complex and interdependent on one another. Additional experiments and potentially new mathematical models will be needed if this is the case.</p><p>Of note, in response to this comment, we did few blebbistatin treatments in mosaic labeled embryos to get an idea of what might be happening. Preliminary results were inconsistent, suggesting either technical problems (variable drug efficacy or wrong dose) or that the relationship between contractility and cell volume is complex (see possible outcomes discussed above).</p><p>We feel that the experiments proposed to test the interplay between cell volume changes and cytoskeletal contractility represent a new line of investigation that goes beyond the scope of this paper and any new results would not change the conclusions of the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Repeat experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> with DFC specific knockdown and possibly in lgl mutant, which is available.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we used DFC/KV-specific knockdown to determine whether Jup</p><p>functions cell-autonomously in KV cells to regulate KV lumen expansion.

A previous study that used ouabain treatments in inhibit ion flux and lumen expansion (Compagnon et al., 2014) predicted that the forces associated with rapid KV lumen growth impacts asymmetric KV cell shape changes. Here, we show that in addition to blocking lumen expansion, inhibiting ion flux also blocked asymmetric changes in KV cell volume. Thus, the failure of cells to change shape when ion flux was altered could be due to blocked lumen expansion or blocked volume changes or both.</p><p>To test this, we blocked lumen expansion by creating a leaky KV.

We chose to use a length to width ratio (LWR) to describe cell shapes for two reasons: 1) to make connections with our previous work (done in 2D) that used LWRs to describe cell shape changes (Wang et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2012) and 2) to make connections with simulations using vertex models. In our simulations, we quantify cell shape anisotropy based on a LWR, where the length corresponds to the apico-basal extension of the cells, and the width corresponds to the lateral extension perpendicular to the DV axis. Thus, the LWR quantified in the simulations corresponds to the LWR quantified in the experiments.</p><p>Since the 2D simulations focus on a plane perpendicular to the DV axis, the cell extension along the DV axis (called “height”) is not included in the modeling.

However, this is not necessarily the case, and thus all the conclusions and predictions that involve changes in cell volume are not valid. The authors should be very careful and make more explicit the limitations of the model.

We have revised the manuscript text to more sharply focus on the goals and the main contributions of this study. We set out to develop new mathematical models and experimental methods that allow morphometric analysis of epithelial cells in the simple KV organ in order to investigate the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that contribute to cell shape changes during epithelial morphogenesis. Using this combination of modeling and experimental approaches, we uncovered new mechanistic insights that contribute to our understanding of epithelial morphogenesis:</p><p>1) Epithelial cells in KV undergo volume changes that are asymmetric along the AP axis during morphogenesis. KV-ant cells increase in volume and KV-post cells decrease in volume.

Models predicted that when external cells are solid like, asymmetric cell volume changes in KV cells contribute to cell shape changes even in the absence of lumen expansion. In particular, we have uncovered a possible mechanism for KV cell shape change: if the interface between KV-ant and KV-post cells was pinned, the volume changes directly affects the apico-basal dimension of the cells while the apical area would remain constant. Hence, asymmetric cell volume changes can induce asymmetric cell shape changes.</p><p>4) Experiments determined that asymmetric cell volume and shape changes are separable from extrinsic biophysical forces associated with lumen expansion.</p><p>Taken together, these results demonstrate ion flux serves as an intrinsic mechanism to regulate asymmetric epithelial morphogenesis in the KV organ and that changes cell morphology can be uncoupled from mechanical forces exerted during lumen expansion.</p><p>These take-home points have been clarified throughout the revised text.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Although the conclusion from the latter part is convincing, what drives asymmetric cell shape changes is largely unclear from the 3D analysis other than involvement of ion channels. The authors emphasize that live embryos are imaged at one stage to avoid potential photo-bleaching. This approach is good to initially identify the crucial parameters and duration. However, to identify the mechanisms underlying asymmetric cell shape changes requires the analysis of single cell behavior continuously during the critical time points (from 4ss to 6ss) based on time-lapse movies.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments and this suggestion. We have now performed time-lapse imaging of mosaic labeled KVs between 4 ss and 6 ss and quantified volume dynamics of single cells at 5 minute intervals during this critical time point. This has allowed us to track and quantify changes in KV-ant and KV-post cell morphology in real time. Consistent with our results from analyzing ‘snap shots’ at specific developmental stages (e.g. 2 ss, 4 ss, 6 ss or 8 ss), we found that individual KV-anterior cells increase their volume between 4-6 ss and KV-posterior cells decrease their volume. This live imaging approach sheds light on KV cell behavior and how these cells change their morphology during morphogenesis.

What is the biological significance of asymmetric cell volume changes from a mechanistic point of view? Would it be all explained by changes in length and width (2D)? Also, it is ambiguous to include this term in the title.</p></disp-quote><p>We use the term ‘asymmetric cell volume changes’ to describe regional changes in KV cell size along the anterior-posterior (AP) body axis: KV-anterior cells increase in volume over developmental time, whereas KV-posterior cells decrease in size. We apologize for the confusion, and have now clarified this in the Results section of the manuscript (subsection “3D analysis of single cells reveals asymmetric cell volume changes during KV morphogenesis”, last paragraph).</p><p>Changes in cell volume are not necessarily tied to changes in cell shape: cells can change volume but remain the same shape or change shape without changing volume. Results presented in this paper indicate KV cell volume changes contribute to KV cell shape changes. Inhibitors of ion flux inhibit lumen expansion and AP asymmetric KV cell volume changes. This indicates ion flux, which drives fluid movements, is necessary for both lumen expansion (previously published) and KV cell volume changes (not surprising and consistent with a role for ion flux in cell volume changes in other systems). When we looked at KV cell shape changes by length and width (2D) in embryos treated with ion flux inhibitors, they did not occur. This indicates that KV cell shape changes depend on 1) lumen expansion, 2) KV cell volume changes or 3) both. Mathematical modeling suggested that KV cell shapes could change if KV cell volume changes occurred without lumen expansion. We next tested this experimentally. When we leave ion flux and asymmetric KV cell volume changes intact and only inhibit lumen expansion, KV cell shape changes (measured by length and width in 2D) occur normally. Taken together, this suggests that KV cell shape changes do not depend on full lumen expansion, but do depend on asymmetric KV cell volume changes. Thus, mechanistically, KV cell volume changes are required (drive) for cell shape changes. This has been clarified in the first paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><p>As suggested, we have changed the title to “Cell volume changes contribute to epithelial morphogenesis in zebrafish Kupffer’s vesicle.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Despite the fact that the authors found out the crucial time point in this process between 4 ss and 6 ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the majority of their analyses have been done at 2 ss and 8 ss stages. The problem is that the experiments using ion channel inhibitors have been treated from tailbud to 2ss or tailbud to 8ss. Because of the effects of those ion channel inhibitors on height of both anterior and posterior cells at 2 ss, the authors should treat with those inhibitors from 4ss to 6ss to see if there is the effect only on the morphometric properties of posterior cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting this experiment to test the effect of inhibiting ion channels during the critical stages of 4 to 6 ss. Our rationale for starting pharmacological treatments at the tailbud stage was to allow the compounds to penetrate inside the embryo and block ion channel function in KV throughout the lumen expansion process. We have now repeated the mosaic-labeling experiments with ouabain treatments that started at 4 ss and then imaged KVs at 6 ss. Over the course of several trials, we found, unfortunately, that treatments between 4-6 ss did not reduce KV lumen expansion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> for a typical result). This indicates longer treatments are indeed necessary to effectively block ion channels, and therefore we are unable to assess the effect of acutely blocking ion flux between 4-6 ss.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30963.034</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Ouabain treatments between 4-6 ss do not block KV lumen expansion.</title><p>(<bold>A-B</bold>) Mosaic-labeled KV in a control embryo (<bold>A</bold>) and an embryo treated with ouabain from 4ss to 6ss (<bold>B</bold>).

In wild-type embryos, KV lumen expansion involves extension of apical surfaces of both KV-ant and KV-post cells in dorsoventral axis (represented here as cell height, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). But, lateral extension (represented here as cell width,) happens only in KV-post cells, not in KV-ant cells due to tight packing and other mechanical influences. Interestingly, lateral extension of KV-post cells can be uncoupled from the dorsoventral extensions, which play a critical role in lumen expansion. Inhibiting lumen expansion by altering junctional integrity hinders dorsoventral expansion of apical surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>)of all KV cells but KV-post cells still lose their volume via ion channel mediated fluid efflux and undergo lateral extension to facilitate asymmetric KV cell shape changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). Thus, ion channels mediate asymmetric cell shape changes via lateral extension of KV-post cells even when overall lumen expansion is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This has been clarified in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I am uncertain about how informative the modeling part is (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The vertex model simulations are basically done in 2D without measurements for the tensions in anterior and posterior cells and the external forces during the transition between 4ss and 6ss. The limitation is there is no data showing shape changes of a single cell in the anterior or posterior KV during this crucial transition (4ss to 6ss) based on time-lapse movies. However, I cannot assess on the mathematical modeling using solid-like or fluid-like cells that eventually leads to the conclusion that cell shape changes do not depend on lumen expansion.</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of our vertex model simulations was not a literal simulation of the precise time-dependent cell shape changes in vivo. As the referee correctly points out, we would be missing a lot of information for that (cell-cell interfacial tensions, external forces, tracking of cell shapes). Rather, the purpose of our simulations was to identify potential mechanisms that could induce an asymmetric LWR in the KV cells. Since we do not know the values of the cell-cell interfacial tensions and the properties of the surrounding cells, we scanned the parameter space for many possible combinations of both, and we found there was a large regime where asymmetric cell volume change drives asymmetric KV cell shape change. Based on these simulations, we could identify a potential mechanism that translates volume asymmetry into cell shape asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Then we wanted to check whether this mechanism depended on the lumen expansion, and found that even without an expanding lumen, asymmetric cell volume change can drive asymmetric cell shape change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D, F, H</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is inconsistency of the data upon ouabain treatment at 2ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In particular, for the ion channel inhibition, we test the non-significance against the alternative hypothesis that the AP volume and LWR differences are as high as in the unperturbed case (DMSO control) at 8ss. We find false error rates for the volume always below the conventional chosen value of 20%, and for the LWR even below 5%. This corresponds to a statistical power of more than 80% and 95%, respectively. We performed a similar analysis for the jupa and lgl2 treatments and always found a statistical power of at least 90%.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Mechanical properties of the surrounding cells. In simulations, asymmetric cell volume changes could account partially for cell shape changes, provided that the mechanical properties of the cells satisfy certain conditions.</p><p>The issue about mechanical properties of cells is important. The mechanical properties of surrounding cells are important and need to be solid like at least anteriorly. Please provide reasonable explanation as to why anterior and posterior could be solid like and more generally, what are the arguments implying that mesodermal cells are solid like (this can be part of the Discussion). The 'pinning' hypothesis is interesting in that aspect and could be discussed. Lance Davidson’s work could be discussed as it seems that the notochord is a pretty rigid structure from his work. In addition, could the fact that fibronectin is enriched in the anterior side of the KV could increase the possibility that cells are solid like anteriorly?</p></disp-quote><p>Our modeling results indicate that asymmetric cell shape changes in KV are more pronounced if only the anterior external cells have solid-like mechanical properties than if only the posterior external cells are solid-like, as the solid-like cells on the anterior side are able to &quot;pin&quot; the interface between the KV-ant cells and the KV-post cells. In order to determine general mechanisms, we have indeed kept the model very simple – for example, it does not take into account effects of additional tissues/structures (e.g. notochord) or extra-cellular matrix (ECM). It is possible that the notochord – which physically interfaces with KV-ant cells – may be a solid-like structure, and this may provide the pinning mechanism. Additionally, an AP gradient of ECM may help prevent neighbor exchanges and give rise to solid-like behavior only in anterior external cells. It is also possible that the solid-like ECM directly physically pins the KV-ant cells, so that the mechanism we have identified may operate even if the anterior cells beyond the ECM are fluid-like. These possibilities have been expanded upon in the discussion. In addition, we have provided new <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref> that depicts enrichment of the ECM molecule fibronectin associated with the notochord and anterior external cells, which is consistent with previous findings (Campagnon, et al. 2014. Dev Cell. PMID: 25535919). Our future work will investigate the contributions of notochord and ECM to the mechanical properties of external cells and asymmetric cell shape changes in KV.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Cell volume changes and actomyosin. Given that their simulations show that cell volume changes alone could not account for cell shape changes, it is weird that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> cell shape changes are completely gone. A way to interpret these data is that ouabain does not specifically target cell volume but also affects elements modulating cell shape, such actomyosin. This raises the question of the effect of ouabain on the actomyosin network. The demonstration is that the actomyosin network is not altered by the treatment. The authors should check it with phosphorylated myosin via antibody staining (as they did in Wang 2012) to see if inhibiting ion channels somehow affects actomyosin contractility. Or is it a problem with the model?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up this important point. We propose that cell volume changes contribute to epithelial morphogenesis in KV and are likely linked to additional important factors (e.g. mechanical properties of cells, tissue-tissue interactions between notochord and KV, and actomyosin cytoskeletal contractility) that are not currently in our model. We are quite intrigued about the relationship between cell volume changes and actomyosin contractility in KV epithelial morphogenesis. As suggested here, we used antibodies that detect phosphorylated myosin light chain (pMLC) to test whether treating embryos with ouabain alters non-muscle myosin II activity in KV cells. Our group (Wang, et al. 2012. Developmental Biology. PMCID: PMC3586254) and the Heisenberg group (Compagnon, et al. 2014. Developmental Cell. PMID: 25535919) have previously used this pMLC antibody to qualitatively assess myosin II activity in KV. Over the course of several trials, we detected cortical pMLC staining in control and ouabain treated KV cells that localized to the cortex of KV cells marked by the tight junction protein ZO1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A</xref>). However, it was not clear to us whether pMLC levels were different in treated KVs as compared to controls. Despite significant efforts to make this assay quantitative, we have not overcome variabilities in the antibody staining that appear to be due to variable penetration of the antibody into deep tissue layers where KV is located.</p><p>As an alternative approach to measure myosin II activity in KV, we took advantage of our stable transgenic <italic>Tg(actb2:myl12.1-MKATE2)</italic> embryos that express the fluorescent mKate2 protein fused to myosin light chain (Myl12.1). We and others (Compagnon, et al. 2014. Developmental Cell. PMID: 25535919) have found that the accumulation and intensity of Myl12.1-fusion proteins correlates with phosphorylated myosin II antibody staining intensity, and thereby serve as a good proxy for active myosin II. Embryos from homozygous <italic>Tg(actb2:myl12.1-MKATE2)</italic> parents were treated with ouabain starting at the tailbud stage and then KVs in live treated and control embryos were imaged at the 6 somite stage (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2B</xref>). Imaging live KVs eliminated the need to fix embryos and perform the antibody staining procedure. Blind measurements of Myl12.1-mKate2 intensity at randomly selected cell-cell interfaces did not detect a difference between control and ouabain treated KVs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2C</xref>). Similar results were obtained in multiple experiments, and measurements of KV area (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2D</xref>) were used to test efficacy of ouabain treatments.</p><p>Although these results suggest actomyosin is not dramatically changed in KVs treated with ouabain, we cannot rule out more subtle effects. Thus, we do not feel it is appropriate to draw conclusions from this one experimental approach and include these data in the present manuscript. In future work that is beyond the scope of this paper, we will investigate more rigorously the relationships among ion flux, cell volume changes and cytoskeletal contractility.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30963.035</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Effect of ouabain treatments on the actomyosin network in KV.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Antibodies that recognize phosphorylated myosin light chain (pMLC) were used to detect active myosin II at the apical cortex of KV cells marked by ZO1 staining. pMLC staining was present in both control and ouabain treated KVs, but this signal proved difficult to quantify.
