little is known about growth mechanisms later in development when fibrous tissues account for the bulk of adult vertebrate mass. We present a model for fibrous tissue growth based on 3D-electron microscopy of mouse tendon. We show that the number of collagen fibrils increases during embryonic development and then remains constant during postnatal growth. Embryonic growth was explained predominately by increases in fibril number and length. Postnatal growth arose predominately from increases in fibril length and diameter. A helical crimp structure was established in embryogenesis, and persisted postnatally. The data support a model where the shape and size of tendon is determined by the number and position of embryonic fibroblasts. The collagen fibrils that these cells synthesise provide a template for postnatal growth by structure-based matrix expansion. The model has important implications for growth of other fibrous tissues and fibrosis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05958.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05958.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05958.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Young animals are able to grow in a way that allows them to maintain roughly the same shape until they reach their adult size. The growth of embryos is driven by increases in cell size and number, but it is less clear how the body grows after birth. By this point, many of the cells in the body are part of tendons and other fibrous tissues, where they are surrounded by a mesh of fibres made of collagen and other proteins. These fibres provide strength to the tissue, but may also restrict its ability to grow.</p><p>Tendons connect muscles to bones. They contain fibres of collagen that run along their length, which enables them to cope with very strong pulling forces. Kalson et al. used electron microscopy to generate highly detailed three-dimensional models of mouse tendons at three stages: in the embryo, at birth and six weeks later.</p><p>The experiments identified two stages in tendon development. During the first stage, the number of cells and fibres across the tendon is determined in the embryo. The fibres also slightly expand in diameter and form regular waves called crimps that are important for the structural strength of the tendon. The second stage happens after birth, during which the number of cells and fibres remains constant, but the tendons continue to grow because the fibres increase in diameter and length. The cells also move to form towers of cells running along the tendon.</p><p>From these observations, Kalson et al. propose that the numbers and locations of the cells and collagen fibres that determine the shape and size of tendons are established in the embryo. The collagen fibres create a framework for the continued growth of the tendon after birth. Future challenges are to understand how the number and the arrangement of cells in the tendon is determined before the collagen fibres are made, and how these cells control the number of collagen fibres that form.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05958.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05958.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>collagen</kwd><kwd>tendon</kwd><kwd>fibril</kwd><kwd>crimp</kwd><kwd>biomechanic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kadler</surname><given-names>Karl E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tendon fibroblast cells lay down a collagen matrix template during embryogenesis, and the expansion of this matrix drives post-natal tissue growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tendons transmit tensile forces from muscles to bone and are amongst the heaviest loaded tissues in vertebrates; the forces have been estimated at ∼ 16 kN/Kg of body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison et al., 2010</xref>). The ability of tendons to transmit such large forces is directly attributable to an extracellular matrix (ECM) comprising collagen fibrils aligned parallel to the tissue long axis. Such forces occur during extended periods of activity with potentially devastating consequences on tissue integrity and cell survival. However, despite the high forces, tendon cells (tenocytes) remain viable and are able to sustain the integrity of the tissue. Our motivation for this study was to understand how tendons increase in size from an anlage of condensed mesenchyme to a mature tissue that is predominately ECM and which can withstand large forces without cell death.</p><p>The discovery of transcription factors expressed by tendon progenitors and the identification of signalling pathways in tendon has contributed greatly to our understanding of the earliest stages of tendon specification. However, the absence of a robust method of imaging cell-matrix organisation has precluded a detailed study of how the cell-rich anlage found in embryogenesis grows into a mechanically strong connective tissue in the adult. Advances in serial block face-scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) provide a method to address this problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Starborg et al., 2013</xref>). SBF-SEM is a practical addition to serial section reconstruction and can typically provide data at ∼10 nm resolution in the sectioning plane for ∼100,000 µm<sup>3</sup> volume of tissue, which is sufficient to quantify cell number, cell shape, and cell–cell interactions, as well as estimate the number and organisation of individual collagen fibrils. When used in combination with a developmental series, SBF-SEM provides new information on the changes in cell organization and matrix assembly during tissue growth.</p><p>The discovery of Scleraxis (Scx), amongst all other transcription factors, transformed studies of tendon development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brent et al., 2003</xref>). The generation of Scx-GFP mice showed the precise location of tendons in the proximal–distal axis of the limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schweitzer et al., 2001</xref>). Scx specifies important interactions between somatic muscle and cartilage cell lineages leading to tendon development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brent et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sugimoto et al., 2013a</xref>). However, Scx is also expressed in non-tendon tissues including ligaments, intervertebral discs, joints, and cartilage around the chondro-tendinous/ligamentous junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sugimoto et al., 2013b</xref>). Tenomodulin, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, is expressed in tendons and ligaments and is a regulator of tenocyte proliferation and is involved in collagen fibril maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Docheva et al., 2005</xref>). Further studies have shown that Mohawk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), EGR1, and EGR2 are transcription factors that are also involved in tendon formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lejard et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the ability of EGR1 to promote tendon differentiation is partially mediated by TGFβ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guerquin et al., 2013</xref>). Two main signalling pathways, TGFβ and FGF, have been identified in vertebrate tendon development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maeda et al., 2011</xref>, and for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tozer and Duprez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schweitzer et al., 2010</xref>). Collagen type I occurs in virtually all fibrous tissues along with type III, V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birk and Mayne, 1997</xref>), XII, XIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ansorge et al., 2009</xref>), fibronectin and small proteoglycans such as decorin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berenson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the expression of these transcription factors and structural proteins, and the presence of particular signalling pathways, does not, in itself, provide information on the development of tendon structure and function.</p><p>The defining event that signifies the onset of functional tendon development is the appearance of collagen fibrils in the ECM. The distribution of collagen fibril diameters distinguishes two stages in tendon development. In mouse, stage 1 begins at E12.5 when narrow (∼35 nm) diameter collagen fibrils are formed within actin-dependent fibripositors at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canty et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalson et al., 2013</xref>). The length and width of the tissue doubles in a few days, and is accompanied by two-orders of magnitude increases in elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McBride et al., 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">1988</xref>). Serial section transmission electron microscopy (ss-TEM) of chick embryonic tendon showed that the tendon matrix contains bundles of collagen fibrils that undergo gradual rotation over several microns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birk and Trelstad, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birk et al., 1989</xref>). Moreover, the collagen fibril bundles are stabilised by cell–cell connections containing cadherin-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richardson et al., 2007</xref>). During stage 1 there is a modest increase in fibril diameter (to ∼40 nm), which has been replicated in vitro by slow stretching of a 3-dimensional (3D) tendon-like construct containing embryonic tenocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kalson et al., 2011</xref>). At birth (in the mouse), the unimodal distribution of narrow fibrils is quickly (within a few days) replaced by a bimodal distribution of fibril diameters with a range of 35–400 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goh et al., 2012</xref>). The transition from unimodal to bimodal distributions specifies the onset of stage 2.</p><p>In addition to increased fibril diameter and changes to cell morphology, the collagen fibrils in tendon develop regular undulations, known as crimp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diamant et al., 1972</xref>). Crimp becomes evident early in embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shah et al., 1982</xref>) and provides the biomechanically important ‘toe-region’ to the force–extension curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shah et al., 1982</xref>). Crimp structure has been investigated by plane polarised light microscopy and by SEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raspanti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franchi et al., 2007</xref>), but the structure of crimp is still debated; numerous studies describe a planar 2D undulating crimp, but mathematical modelling of crimped collagen fibrils in tendon suggests crimp to be helical in structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grytz and Meschke, 2009</xref>). Again, technical limitations of techniques used to study crimp have prevented a definitive description; for example, SEM requires chemical treatment of tissue to remove cellular material, precluding analysis of the composite 3D architecture.</p><p>Although ss-TEM provided insights into the short-range hierarchical structure of tendon, technical challenges of generating undistorted serial sections and achieving an absolute alignment have been major hurdles in studying hierarchical organisation beyond the level of a few cells. We here describe SBF-SEM studies of tendon development and show 3D reconstructions at three key stages of tendon development: stage 1 (embryonic), the stage 1–2 transition (newborn), and stage 2 (6 week). We interpret our findings as suggesting that the hierarchical structure of tendon, with collagen fibrils organised into fibril bundles with a biomechanically important spiral crimp structure, and the number of collagen fibrils in bundles, is established during embryogenesis. Subsequent postnatal tendon growth is achieved by increase in collagen fibril diameter and fibril length, likely by interface-limited molecular accretion, during which the spatial relationship between cells, fibril bundles and the crimp spiral, is maintained.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantitation of collagen fibrils into bundles</title><p>To learn more about tendon development we examined embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5), newborn and 6 week postnatal mouse-tail tendon. First we investigated the collagen fibrils in the ECM, using TEM of ultra-thin sections cut perpendicularly to the tendon long axis, in which the collagen fibrils are transected transversely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Starborg et al., 2013</xref>). The results showed that at E15.5 the vast majority of collagen fibrils had near-circular outlines and were therefore perpendicular (to a close approximation) to the tendon long axis. The fibrils were organised in small groups, which occurred in channels defined by the plasma membranes of surrounding cells. These groups of fibrils are termed ‘fibril bundles’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At this stage of development the collagen fibrils are being synthesised in fibripositors at the cell-matrix interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalson et al., 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05958.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>2D analysis of mouse-tail tendon through development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of transverse sections at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5).

It is important to note that fibril profiles are fibrils in transverse section. It was not possible to count entire fibrils because some are too long to be contained within the SBF-SEM volumes we studied. TEM images showed electron dense cell–cell junctions between adjacent cell membrane extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Waggett et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richardson et al., 2007</xref>). In 6 weeks postnatal tendon, fibril bundles have grown in lateral size and are separated by striking elongated cell processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Analysis of TEM images demonstrated that fibril diameter increased during development, with mean fibril diameter increasing from 35.4 nm ± 0.2 nm at E15.5, to 46.5 ± 1.1 nm at birth and 160.1 ± 3.4 nm at 6 weeks postnatal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B,C</xref>). A bimodal distribution of diameters was found in 6 week postnatal tendon, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parry et al., 1978</xref>). Notably, the increase in fibril diameter occurred uniformly throughout the ECM, and was not confined to fibrils close to the cell. This simple, key observation is critical to understanding how collagen fibrils grow in diameter independent of distance from the source of newly synthesized collagen (i.e., the cell).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05958.004</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Summary of data</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05958.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05958.004</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Stage</th><th>Mean fibril diameter (nm)</th><th>Mean fibril area (nm<sup>2</sup>)</th><th>Mean number of fibrils per bundle</th><th>Mean fibril length (µm)</th><th>FAF (%)</th><th>Crimp length (µm)</th><th>Crimp helix radius (µm)</th><th>Tail length (mm)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>E15.5</td><td>35.4 ± 0.2</td><td>1006.5 ± 13.8</td><td>156 ± 11</td><td>125 ± 18</td><td>1.4 ± 0.3</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>6.1 ± 0.30</td></tr><tr><td>Newborn</td><td>46.5 ± 1.1</td><td>2137.9 ± 370.9</td><td>659 ± 23</td><td>578 ± 17</td><td>17.6 ± 1.3</td><td>14.0 ± 0.3</td><td>1.6 ± 0.1</td><td>10.9 ± 0.9</td></tr><tr><td>6W</td><td>160.1 ± 3.4</td><td>24,606.8 ± 933.0</td><td>684 ± 22</td><td>1250<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">*</xref> ± 305</td><td>76.4 ± 1.3</td><td>99.3 ± 2.5</td><td>2.3 ± 0.1</td><td>67.6 ± 0.3</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><label>*</label><p>For fibrils of diameter &lt;150 nm.</p></fn><fn><p>Raw data are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05958.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Fibril diameter and fibril bundling during development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fibril diameter plot for embryonic day 15.5 (<bold>A</bold>), newborn (<bold>B</bold>) and 6 week old tendon (<bold>C</bold>).

In one specimen from 6 week mouse we observed a right-handed helix. This continues the alternating handedness from polypeptide chains (left-handed helix), to collagen molecules (right-handed), to microfibrils (left-handed) and collagen fibrils (right-handed, as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holmes et al., 2001</xref>]). These data show that the fibrils in tendon bundles then form a left-handed helical macrostructure. We have observed this left-handed spiral structure of fibril bundles in all the anatomically distinct tendons we have examined using SBF-SEM, including mouse Achilles tendon and chick metatarsal tendons, with different biomechanical properties compared with mouse-tail tendon, an axial tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benjamin et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Fibril length increases during development</title><p>Using SBF-SEM we were also able to make estimates of mean fibril length by tracking fibrils and counting fibril tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Starborg et al., 2013</xref>).

At E15.5 160 fibril tips were identified (within 10,000 µm fibril lengths tracked). In newborn mouse tendon, 69 tips were found (over ∼20,000 µm fibril lengths tracked). At 6 weeks fibril tips were rare; 16 tips were identified within 10,000 µm fibril lengths tracked, all occurring in fibrils less than 150 nm in diameter (the smaller population of postnatal fibrils). No tips were found in fibrils &gt;150 nm in diameter. This gave an estimate of mean-length of 1250 ± 305 µm for fibrils less than 150 nm diameter.

Schematic diagram to represent a model of fibril nucleation and growth during tendon development. Fibrillar arrays representing bundles are shown in longitudinal and transverse section (labelled LS and TS, respectively) at the 3 time points (E15.5, newborn and 6 week). The embryonic growth stage involves fibril nucleation to increase fibril numbers along with fibril growth to increase both fibril diameter and length. The numbers of fibrils in the transverse section of the bundle is increased not only by fibril nucleation but also by axial growth of the fibrils into neighbouring regions of the bundle. The postnatal growth in stage 2 involves only fibril growth, with a major increase in fibril diameter and length, with no increase in fibril number. To maintain the observed invariant number of fibrils in the bundle transverse section, the increase in fibril length must match the local increase in tissue length. Right side panel. Schematic to represent cell and fibril growth during tendon development. Early embryonic tendon tissue (E10) is composed of rounded cells with little ECM. Collagen fibrils begin to appear in small bundles in poorly defined channels formed by cell–cell adhesions by E15.5. These channels become more developed with expansion of the ECM and are well defined in newborn tendon tissue. Postnatal expansion of the ECM results in large fibril bundles in these channels that were established during embryonic development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05958.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05958.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05958-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The events during tendon development when ECM overtakes cells as the major component of the tissue are poorly understood, largely because of the lack of a suitable technique with which to examine the micro- and macro-scale architecture. At a micro-scale, it was unknown how collagen fibrils increase in diameter from ∼35 nm to ∼400 nm (stage 1 to 2 transition), and curiously, why diameters are independent of the distance from the cell. At a macro-scale it was unknown how tenocytes become aligned in tramlines parallel to the tissue long axis in adult tendon, and how crimp develops. In this study we have shown that structure-based matrix expansion in the presence of stable cell-to-cell junctions is a novel mechanism for driving tissue growth.</p><p>The appearance of collagen fibrils and thus the start of tendon development proper, coincides with the formation of extracellular channels whose borders are delineated by cellular extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birk and Trelstad, 1985</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the wrapping of plasma membrane extensions around bundles of collagen fibrils in newborn and 6 week tendon produces a highly convoluted cross-sectional shape of the cell. Contacts between projections of neighbouring cells are stabilised by cell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McNeilly et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ralphs et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richardson et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, neighbouring cells define vertical channels into which newly formed collagen fibrils are assembled, thereby generating bundles of collagen fibrils that are corralled into lying parallel to the tendon long axis.</p><p>Although there is an increase in the number of cells longitudinally (in cell stacks) between newborn and 6 weeks, the fall in cells per unit volume of tissue due to expansion of the ECM suggest that the major driver of tissue growth is an increase in the ECM in channels between cell stacks. The extended longitudinal cell–cell contacts seen in both newborn and in 6 week tendon tissue, and the maintenance of similar numbers of cell–cell contacts and cell protrusions at birth and 6 weeks, suggests that the cell–cell contacts formed in embryogenesis form the basic pattern for the mature tendon tissue. Positive immunolocalisation of important gap junction components, connexin 32 and 43, at 6 weeks supports this conclusion.</p><p>The increase in cell number along the longitudinal axis of the tendon in postnatal growth is compatible with this interpretation. New cells formed by mitosis during tissue growth can be added in cell stacks whilst at the same time maintaining the longitudinal channels containing fibril bundles, which are growing laterally due to a dramatic increase in fibril diameter.</p><p>We were able to quantitate the number of fibril profiles, diameter and average length of collagen fibrils during embryonic to postnatal development. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, fibril diameters increased during E15.5 to newborn but maintained a unimodal diameter distribution. During embryonic development the number of fibrils per bundle increases (from E15.5 to birth). There was a significant increase in fibril diameter in postnatal tendon, and fibrils developed a bimodal diameter distribution. Also during postnatal growth (between birth and 6 weeks) the number of bundles per cell remained constant and the number of fibril profiles per bundle remained constant. The fact that the number of bundles per cell remained constant was a good indication that the cell–cell junctions between neighbouring cells are stable. SBF-SEM allowed estimation of fibril length, which showed a significant increase in fibril length from E15.5 to newborn. Taken together, these data showed that growth during the period E15.5 to newborn was the result of new fibril formation together with an increase in fibril diameter and length. Recent studies have shown that the collagen fibrils in the extracellular channels, at this early stage of tendon development, are formed in cell-surface fibripositors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canty et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalson et al., 2013</xref>), and therefore, the cell strictly controls the number of fibrils deposited to the bundles.</p><p>SBF-SEM analysis of 6 week postnatal tendon provided explanations for features that have long been a puzzle. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the number of bundles per cell and the number of collagen fibril profiles per bundle remain stable between birth and 6 weeks postnatal. During the same period, fibril diameters increase markedly and the distribution becomes bimodal. These data showed that, in mouse, cells set the number of bundles and number of collagen fibrils per bundle at the time of birth. Local growth in tendon size between newborn and 6 weeks postnatal is driven primarily by increase in collagen fibril diameter and length. Growth models have been proposed for the increase in fibril diameter based on inter-fibrillar fusion and accretion of newly-synthesised collagen molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birk et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kadler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trotter et al., 2000</xref>). Inter-fibrillar fusion can potentially involve tip-to-tip, tip-to-shaft, and shaft-to-shaft fusion. Tip-to-tip fusion results in fibril lengthening. Quantitative mass mapping by scanning transmission electron microscopy and analysis of fibril staining patterns by TEM showed that tip-to-tip fusion occurs during early embryonic tendon morphogenesis and relies on unipolar collagen fibrils, in a process that is regulated by collagen-proteoglycan interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham et al., 2000</xref>). Tip-to-shaft fusion also occurs, which generates branched networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kadler et al., 2000</xref>). A model for linear and lateral growth of fibrils during tendon development has been proposed in which decorin, and perhaps related small proteoglycans, regulates surface interactions of participating fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birk et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, fibril fusion is regulated by the directionality of collagen molecules in the fibril (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kadler et al., 1990</xref>), the availability of tips from unipolar fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham et al., 2000</xref>), and by the presence of proteoglycans at the fibril surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birk et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham et al., 2000</xref>). An important and often overlooked consequence of fibril fusion is the inevitable reduction in fibril numbers as fibrils fuse together, and the decrease in the number of fibrils per cell. It is also to be noted that fibril fusion has no effect on fibril volume fraction as no new fibril volume is created by any type of fusion; we found very few fibril fusion (tip-shaft) events when we tracked fibrils with SBF-SEM. The data presented here show that collagen fibril numbers (in profile) increased during stage 1 of development and remained constant during stage 2, despite increases in fibril diameter (in stage 1 and stage 2). Although we cannot rule out tip-to-tip fusion (which would not be expected to affect fibril diameter) our diameter and fibril number data do not support shaft-to-shaft fusion as a major contributor to increases in fibril diameter during tendon development. We also have not observed irregularly shaped fibrils, which would be expected to occur if lateral fusion was occurring.</p><p>An alternative mechanism of fibril growth is the surface-nucleation-and-propagation (SNP) model in which collagen molecules accrete onto the growing tips of fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holmes et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">1998</xref>) and to the molecular reversal region in bipolar fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Trotter et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2000</xref>). The SNP model predicts that collagen fibrils have specific binding sites for collagen molecules, leading to growth in diameter and length. Thus, fibril growth is determined by local structure at the fibril surface and is an example of interface-controlled growth as opposed to diffusion-limited accretion onto the fibril surface. The occurrence of an abrupt limitation in fibril diameter at the growing tips of vertebrate collagen fibrils also suggests a structure-based mechanism for fibril growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holmes et al., 1998</xref>). Evidence from collagen fibril diameter measurements in vivo also supports a structure-based assembly mechanism. If collagen molecules could assemble onto non-specific binding sites on the fibril in an uncoordinated manner, the axial mass profiles would be expected to show pronounced random fluctuations. In the case of diffusion-limited growth, collagen fibrils closer to the cell might be expected to have larger diameters because of the ready availability of collagen molecules emerging from the cell. However, as fibril diameters are independent of distance from the cell, it seems more likely that fibril growth (especially in postnatal tendon) is strongly influenced by the local structure of the fibril surface. Thus, the establishment of fibril number during stage 1 of development and subsequent growth in fibril diameter during stage 2 by the SNP mechanism (in the absence of overt shaft-to-shaft fibril fusion) would explain the observed increase in fibril diameter in stage 2 and the lateral growth of the tissue.</p><p>The ability of SBF-SEM to examine relatively large volumes of tissue at good resolution enabled us to assess cell shape with precision. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, cells at E15.5 and newborn had convoluted profiles, were slender cylinders with overlapping ends, and were ∼50–60 µm in length. In contrast, cells in 6 weeks postnatal had prominent lateral cellular extensions that reached deep into the ECM, were short (∼25 µm) and stacked in rows on their blunt ends. Importantly, cells at 6 weeks postnatal tendon remained in contact with each other via their cellular extensions regardless of the distance between the cell bodies where the nucleus was located. The number of collagen bundles at the cell periphery (and therefore the number of cell–cell contacts) was stable between newborn and 6 weeks postnatal. The data show that the main cell bodies move laterally apart because of the expansion of the ECM but maintain their longitudinal relationship, thereby generating the tramline organisation seen in mature tendon.</p><p>An unexpected result was visualisation of a spiral 3D organisation of collagen bundles to form the tendon crimp. In relaxed tendons, the bundles of collagen fibrils are buckled into a wavy pattern, called crimp, which is readily visible using plane polarized light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kapacee et al., 2008</xref>). Unbuckling of the crimp during longitudinal loading functions as a natural shock-absorber on initial loading as well as being important in elastic recoil (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benjamin et al., 2008</xref>]). Crimp first appears during embryonic tendon development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shah et al., 1982</xref>) but the mechanism of crimp formation remains unknown, largely because of the impracticalities of studying its formation in vivo. In our studies we were careful to preserve the tension in the tendon, avoiding major changes in crimp structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shah et al., 1977</xref>), by fixing whole tails without disturbing the axial attachment to the skeleton. Crimp 3D structure has been debated over a prolonged period. We found no kinks as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raspanti et al., 2005</xref>) but instead observed a left-handed spiral running the length of our 3D reconstructions. A spring/spiral nature of the tendon crimp has been predicted in a mathematical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grytz and Meschke, 2009</xref>). It is important to note that fibril bundles are continuous over the distances we have measured here, forming parallel spirals in axial register to provide uniform biomechanical properties when loaded, and there is a close relationship between the cell and the fibril bundle. The close association of cells with bundles suggests that the cell shape strongly influences the configuration of the crimp structure. This is consistent with studies suggesting that cell force generated by the actin-myosin system can create a crimp structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herchenhan et al., 2012</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, we showed that the crimp wavelength lengthens from ∼14 µm at E15.5 to ∼99 µm at 6 weeks postnatal. The length increase of the mouse-tail from newborn to 6 weeks by a factor of ∼6.2× closely matches the increase in crimp wavelength of ∼7.1×. This suggests a simple crimp elongation process in synchrony with bundle and tissue elongation.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that tendon development occurs in a two-stage process. In stage 1 the organisation of fibroblasts and the cellular channels for fibril deposition and growth are established, and cell-mediated control of collagen fibril deposition occurs. This sets the developmental template for structure-based matrix expansion of the existing matrix in stage 2, which drives the increase in the size of the matrix that underpins tissue growth. Important features include the cell-regulated number of cell processes that define the boundaries of collagen fibril bundles and help to maintain the tramline organization of cells in the mature tissue. These mechanisms could be a paradigm for the growth of other matrix-rich tissues that are abundant in collagen fibrils.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse sample preparation</title><p>C57/Black6 mice were sacrificed using a UK Home Office approved S1 Schedule method.

The section thickness was set to 100 nm in the Z (cutting) direction. For 6 week-old mouse-tail samples the field of view was increased to accommodate the larger cells (200 μm × 200 μm).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor), Robb Krumlauf (Reviewing editor), and two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>It is the collective opinion of the reviewers that this work provides a 3D framework that supports and extends a large body of previous observations, over several decades, using classical electron microscopy and other techniques. In addition, the approach described provides important new structural insights into the old problem of how cells determine the way in which the extracellular matrix is assembled in order to form a functional tissue. This data provides novel mechanistic insight into how tissue growth can be mediated. Hence, this is exciting work that presents a new framework in which to think about tissue growth. However, before it can be recommended for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> there are two major concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>The major issues are:</p><p>1) The authors need to demonstrate more evidence for their structure based expansion mechanism. If the authors can show that postnatal growth is primarily caused by the increase in fibril diameter size instead of any changes in cell number (or cell shape), this would further support their model. Hence it is important to address whether they also observe a change in cell number as this is another means of mediating growth. This analysis would be important specifically at the postnatal stages when the fibril bundle numbers per nucleus are constant, and could be addressed using the 3D reconstructions of the cells that they have already generated. Interestingly, the authors report that cell length decreases from 60 to 27 microns from embryonic to 6 week old stages, and it appears as though there are more cells that are shortened or more compacted along the longitudinal axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> (although their total volume remains the same). It would be interesting if the cells increase in number but also decrease their length, not contributing to the overall growth of the tissue. Because the cells are organized along tracks between the fibrils, does the number of cells in transverse cross-sectional area change differently or not at all compared with the numbers along the longitudinal axis? If there is an increase in cell number longitudinally, would this change the fibril bundle numbers per nucleus?</p><p>2) The authors state that cell-to-cell contacts are maintained during post-natal development (in the subsection headed “Increase in cell surface area during tendon development”), even though no quantitative data are presented to support this conclusion. Quantitative data that cell-cell contacts are maintained during postnatal development should be included in a revised version.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05958.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors need to demonstrate more evidence for their structure based expansion mechanism.

We have now undertaken new analyses relating to cell number during development. There data are presented in a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>We first calculated the number of cells per unit volume of tissue for each developmental stage. We found a decrease in cells per µm<sup>3</sup> between E15.5 and newborn tissue, and between newborn and 6 week tendon. The magnitude of this change was significant (almost 7 fold between newborn and 6 weeks; 0.91 to 0.14 cells per 1000 µm<sup>3</sup>).</p><p>The decrease in cell length (measured from tip to tail along the longitudinal axis of the cell) during development is an interesting observation, and following your suggestion we have explored this further. At E15.5 there are no distinct stacks of cells. Cell stacks are present at birth and at 6 weeks. The distance between nuclei of cells in stacks decreases from newborn to 6 week tissue, corresponding to a decrease in the longitudinal length of the cell. However, there is overlap of cells in newborn tissue, making the distance between nuclei less than the total length of the cell (40 vs. 55 µm). Cells in 6 week tissue are stacked end-to-end, with little overlap; their inter-nucleus distance corresponds closely to the length of the cell (28 vs. 27 µm). These data suggest that there is a relative increase in the number of cells in longitudinal axis in cell channels during tendon growth comparing newborn with 6 week tendon.</p><p>We have also analysed the changes in cell number in transverse section during development. The horizontal distance between cell nuclei in (measured in single transverse sections) is significantly increased from newborn to 6 week tendon tissue (from 6 to 32 µm). This corresponds to a decrease in cells per µm<sup>2</sup> in transverse sections of 20.5±0.8 to 1.9±0.2 cells per 1000 µm<sup>2</sup>. This change is due primarily to the increase in size of the channels containing fibrils between the stacks of cells.</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest that although there is an increase in the number of cells longitudinally (in cell stacks) between newborn and 6 weeks, the major driver of tissue growth is an increase in the ECM in channels between cell stacks.</p><p><italic>If there is an increase in cell number longitudinally, would this change the fibril bundle numbers per nucleus</italic>?</p><p>Thank you for the comment. We measured the number of fibril bundles per nucleus from transverse images. Therefore an increase in the longitudinal number of cells does not change this measurement. We now have clarified the method used to make this measurement in the Methods section.</p><p>These new data are described in the Results section, under the subtitle “Reduction in cell number per unit of tissue volume during development”.</p><p><italic>2) The authors state that cell-to-cell contacts are maintained during post-natal development (in the subsection headed “Increase in cell surface area during tendon development”), even though no quantitative data are presented to support this conclusion. Quantitative data that cell-cell contacts are maintained during postnatal development should be included in a revised version</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for the helpful comment. We agree that this is a critical point and we have undertaken new experimental work and new analysis of 3D SBF-SEM data to investigate this question. These data are presented in a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>First we modeled cell-cell contacts at each developmental stage. At E15.5 no distinct cell membrane channels were formed via membrane protrusions contacting adjacent cells; instead groups of narrow-diameter fibrils were seen between adjacent cell membranes or enclosed in cell membrane invaginations (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Newborn cells formed protrusions that contacted adjacent cells; these formed channels surrounding fibril bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Modeling of these cell-cell contact regions in 3D revealed close apposition of membranes along the longitudinal axis of the tissue, thereby defining the fibril channels. At 6 weeks a similar morphology of cell-cell contact was found, although the cell processes were much longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>We have now quantitated these cell-cell contacts. In newborn tendon each tendon cell forms distinct channel -defining protrusions that contact, on average, 4.6 ± 0.1 adjacent cells. At 6 weeks each tendon cell contacts 4.5 ± 0.1 adjacent cells (p =&gt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1D</xref>). The number of protrusions per cell that contacted adjacent cells was also similar in newborn and 6 week tendon (8.2 ± 0.2 vs. 8.3 ± 0.2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>In addition we have undertaken immunofluorescence staining against connexins 43 and 32 in 6 week tendon tissue, and have now included data showing positive staining for connexins 43 and 32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and 6E</xref>). The extended longitudinal morphology of cell-cell contacts seen in both newborn and in 6 week tendon tissue, and the maintenance of similar numbers of cell-cell contacts and cell protrusions at birth and 6 weeks support suggest that the cell-cell contacts formed in embryogenesis form the basic pattern for the mature tendon tissue. Positive immunolocalisation of important gap junction connexins at 6 weeks supports this conclusion.</p><p>The increase in cell number along the longitudinal axis of the tendon in postnatal growth is compatible with this interpretation. New cells formed by mitosis during tissue growth can be added in cell stacks whilst at the same time maintaining the longitudinal channels containing fibril bundles, which are growing laterally due to the increase in fibril diameter.</p><p>This new data is presented in the subsection headed “Cell-cell contacts are maintained during development”, in the Results.</p><p>We have also included a new section in the Discussion regarding these new data, as follows:</p><p>“Although there is an increase in the number of cells longitudinally (in cell stacks) between newborn and 6 weeks, the fall in cells per unit volume of tissue due to expansion of the ECM suggest that the major driver of tissue growth is an increase in the ECM in channels between cell stacks. The extended longitudinal cell-cell contacts seen in both newborn and in 6 week tendon tissue, and the maintenance of similar numbers of cell-cell contacts and cell protrusions at birth and 6 weeks, suggests that the cell-cell contacts formed in embryogenesis form the basic pattern for the mature tendon tissue. Positive immunolocalisation of important gap junction components, connexin 32 and 43, at 6 weeks supports this conclusion.</p><p>The increase in cell number along the longitudinal axis of the tendon in postnatal growth is compatible with this interpretation.
