obscure. Here, we resolved Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent synaptic vesicle (SV) replenishment pathways, and found that syt 7 plays a selective and critical role in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathway. Mutations that disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding to syt 7 abolish this function, suggesting that syt 7 functions as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor for replenishment. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) has also been implicated in SV replenishment, and we found that loss of syt 7 was phenocopied by a CaM antagonist. Moreover, we discovered that syt 7 binds to CaM in a highly specific and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner; this interaction requires intact Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites within syt 7. Together, these data indicate that a complex of two conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins, syt 7 and CaM, serve as a key regulator of SV replenishment in presynaptic nerve terminals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01524.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01524.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01524.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons communicate with one another at junctions called synapses. The arrival of an electrical signal called an action potential at the first neuron triggers the release of chemicals called neurotransmitters into the synapse. These chemicals then diffuse across the gap between the neurons and bind to receptors on the second cell.</p><p>The neurotransmitter molecules are stored in the first cell in packages known as vesicles, which release their contents by fusing with the cell membrane. Following a fusion event, neurons must replenish their vesicle stocks to ensure that they are ready for the arrival of the next action potential. This replenishment process is known to involve a calcium-dependent pathway and a calcium-independent pathway.</p><p>A protein called calmodulin, that binds calcium ions, has an important role in the first of these pathways. Now, Liu et al. have shown that another protein, synaptotagmin 7, also has a key role in the replenishment of synaptic vesicles, possibly as a sensor for calcium ions. Moreover, Liu et al. found that synaptotagmin 7 and calmodulin bind to each other to form a complex, which suggests that the calcium-dependent replenishment pathway is regulated by this complex.</p><p>The synaptotagmins are a family of 17 proteins, three of which are present in all animals. Two of these were known to have roles in synapses, but the role of the third—synaptotagmin 7—had been unclear. In addition to providing a more complete understanding of the replenishment of synaptic vesicles, the work of Liu et al. also supplies the final piece of the jigsaw regarding the role of the synaptotagmins that are present in all animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01524.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01524.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>synaptotagmin</kwd><kwd>neurotranmission</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH 61876</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Huisheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name><name><surname>Hui</surname><given-names>Enfu</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Lu</given-names></name><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>Chantell S</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zhao</given-names></name><name><surname>Kwon</surname><given-names>Sung E</given-names></name><name><surname>Chapman</surname><given-names>Edwin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hui</surname><given-names>Enfu</given-names></name><name><surname>Chapman</surname><given-names>Edwin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two proteins—synaptotagmin 7 and calmodulin—have central roles in the calcium-dependent pathway that maintains synaptic transmission.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemical communication at synapses in the central nervous system is subject to short- and long-term changes in strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Malenka, 1994</xref>). For example, the replenishment of synaptic vesicles (SV) in the readily releasable pool (RRP), which can be exhausted during high frequency stimulation (HFS), plays a critical role in determining the rate and degree of short-term synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang and Kaczmarek, 1998</xref>). It has been reported that Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays an important role in the replenishment step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dittman and Regehr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang and Kaczmarek, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hosoi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sakaba, 2008</xref>). Thus, identification of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for SV replenishment has emerged as a critical issue, and the ubiquitous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein CaM has been implicated in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sakaba and Neher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hosoi et al., 2007</xref>), by interacting with Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lipstein et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Synaptotagmins represent another well-known family of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins; some isoforms function as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensors for rapid SV exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chapman, 2008</xref>). Of the 17 syt isoforms in the mammalian genome, only syt 1, 4, and 7 appear to be expressed in all metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barber et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that they are involved in key, evolutionarily conserved, membrane trafficking pathways. In neurons, functions for syt 1 and 4 have been established. Syt 1 serves as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for fast synchronous SV release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Geppert et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koh and Bellen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishiki and Augustine, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2009</xref>), and syt 4 modulates transmission by regulating neurotrophin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dean et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2012b</xref>) and also regulates exocytosis in the posterior pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). One group reported that <italic>Syt7</italic> knock-out (KO) mice (hereafter termed KO) had normal synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maximov et al., 2008</xref>), but in a more recent study from the same group concluded that syt 7 functions as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for asynchronous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacaj et al., 2013</xref>). It was proposed that this contradiction was due to the use of KO mice in the former study, as opposed to the more acute knock-down (KD) approach used in the latter study. However, KD of syt 7 in otherwise WT neurons had no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacaj et al., 2013</xref>), so the physiological function of syt 7 in the mammalian central nervous system remains an open issue, whereas there is evidence that syt 7 regulates asynchronous synaptic transmission at the Zebrafish neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wen et al., 2010</xref>). The apparent discrepancy regarding the physiological function of syt 7 between mice and Zebrafish is likely due to species differences, analogous to the different functions of syt 4 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> vs mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoshihara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dean et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang and Chapman, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used high frequency stimulation, and other methods, to study synaptic transmission in cultured hippocamal neurons from KO mice and discovered that syt 7, via a highly specific interaction with CaM, functions as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor that regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent SV replenishment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of syt 7 does not affect spontaneous release, or evoked release triggered by single action potentials</title><p>We first carried out whole-cell voltage clamp recordings using primary hippocampal neurons obtained from wild-type (WT) and KO mice and found that spontaneous SV release, measured in the presence of TTX, was unaffected in the KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>).

We further distinguished a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent SV replenishment pathway from the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathway by using hypertonic sucrose to drive secretion in the complete absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent SV replenishment has been discussed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stevens and Wesseling, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hosoi et al., 2007</xref>); however, only the slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator, EGTA-AM, was used. In the current study, extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was removed and EGTA was included in the bath solution. Moreover, intracellular stores of Ca<sup>2+</sup> were depleted using CPA and the fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator, BAPTA-AM. The finding that WT neurons, in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conditions, display a similar RRP recovery rate as compared to KO neurons in normal (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) conditions, along with the inability of the syt 7 4D/N mutant to rescue recovery of the RRP in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), strongly indicate that syt 7 is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent SV replenishment pathway.</p><p>CaM is a ubiquitous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein with multiple functions in the SV cycle, including SV replenishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sakaba and Neher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hosoi et al., 2007</xref>). Remarkably, when applied to WT hippocampal neurons, a CaM antagonist precisely phenocopies the defects in SV replenishment apparent in KO neurons. Moreover, we discovered an avid and direct Ca<sup>2+</sup>-promoted interaction between CaM and syt 7; in contrast, syt 1, 2, 4, 9 and 10 failed to bind to CaM in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and loss of these latter isoforms has not been associated with enhanced synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maximov and Sudhof, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dean et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dean et al., 2012a</xref>).

In that study, there was a slight reduction in synaptic transmission in KO neurons during high, but not low, frequency stimulation, suggestive of a defect in replenishment. This effect was less pronounced as compared to our observations; the reasons for this difference are unknown, but might involve differences between the inhibitory and excitatory neurons used in these studies. Moreover, a more recent report from the same group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacaj et al., 2013</xref>), using a KD approach, reached the contradictory conclusion that syt 7 plays a role in asynchronous evoked release. However, loss of syt 7, by either KD or KO, had no effect on asynchronous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maximov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacaj et al., 2013</xref>); the only case where a loss of release was observed was when syt 7 was knocked down (and not knocked out) in a syt 1 KO background. So, the physiological relevance of this observation is unclear. Moreover, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacaj et al. (2013)</xref>, there was, again, a reduction in release only at late, but not early stages, in the stimulus train in KO neurons. We argue that this result should be interpreted as defective SV replenishment, because loss of asynchronous release should occur for all evoked responses, early and late. Furthermore, impaired replenishment of large dense core vesicles (LDCV) was also reported in KO chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schonn et al., 2008</xref>), consistent with our current study. Thus, syt 7 might serve as a ubiquitous Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for replenishment of vesicles, including LDCVs and SVs.</p><p>At present, it remains unknown as to how syt 7 and CaM regulate SV replenishment. We observed that c-myc tagged WT syt 7, as well as the 4D/N mutant, were enriched in synapses, but were not co-localized with SV markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These findings raise the possibility that syt 7 may be targeted to, and thereby act at the plasma membrane, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41a">Sugita et al. (2001)</xref>, to drive replenishment by either conveying SVs from reserve pools to the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kuromi and Kidokoro, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murthy and Stevens, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ikeda and Bekkers, 2009</xref>), or clearing vesicle release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neher, 2010</xref>). Using a pHluorin tag, we found that syt 1 and 7 have similar cell surface fractions; while significant levels of each protein are present in the plasma membrane, the largest pools of syt 7 and syt 1 are on internal organelles that acidify (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), consistent with earlier work localizing syt 7 to LDCVs and lysosomes in neuroendocrine cells and cells in the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fukuda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Czibener et al., 2006</xref>). Clearly, syt 7 is not selectively targeted to the plasma membrane (though, again, like all syt isoforms, some fraction is present in the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dean et al., 2012a</xref>]). Moreover, pHluorin-syt 7 does not recycle with SV-like kinetics, even after repetitive stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dean et al., 2012a</xref>), excluding the possibility that syt 7 traffics to SVs before, during, or after stimulation. So, syt 7 is likely to regulate replenishment either from the plasma membrane, or from LDCVs or lysosomes.</p><p>In molecular terms, the emerging view is that CaM regulates SV replenishment via interactions with both Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lipstein et al., 2013</xref>) and syt 7.

A polyclonal rabbit anti-synapsin antibody (Synaptic System, Germany) was used to localize synaptic vesicles in presynaptic terminals. 12–17 DIV neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.15% Triton X-100 for 30 min, blocked in 10% goat serum plus 0.1% Triton X-100, stained with primary antibodies for 2 hr, washed with PBS three times, and then incubated with either Cy3-tagged anti-mouse or Alexa 647-tagged anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. Coverslips were then mounted in Fluoromount (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) and images of were acquired on an Olympus FV1000 upright confocal microscope (Japan) with a 60× 1.10 numerical aperture water-immersion lens. To quantify the degree colocalization, images were imported into ImageJ (NIH) for analysis. The Pearson’s coefficient for colocalization was calculated using the intensity correlation analysis plugin for ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2009</xref>), whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of mEPSCs, evoked EPSCs, and hypertonic sucrose responses were carried out at RT using an EPC-10/2 amplifier (HEKA, Germany) from neurons at 12-17 DIV. The pipette solution consisted of, in mM: 130 K-gluconate, 1 EGTA, 5 Na-phosphocreatine, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3 (290 mOsm). The extracellular solution consisted of (mM): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3 (300 mOsm), 0.05 D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (D-AP5), 0.1 picrotoxin. For mEPSC recordings, 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> was included, and 1 µM tetrodotoxin (TTX) was added to the extracellular solution. For evoked EPSCs, 5 mM QX-314 (lidocaine N-ethyl bromide) was added to the pipette solution. Various concentrations of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (in mM: 0.5, 2, 5 and 10) were used for recording single AP evoked EPSCs. Ten mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> was used for the HFS recordings in order to maximize the first response. To evoke EPSCs, a bipolar electrode was placed against the soma, and used to trigger action potentials via a 1 ms minus 20 V pulse, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). Release was recorded as a postsynaptic response via a whole-cell patch electrode in a connected neuron.</p><p>Neurons were voltage clamped at −70 mV. Only cells with series resistances of &lt;15 M, with 70–80% of this resistance compensated, were analyzed. Currents were acquired using PATCHMASTER software (HEKA, Germany), filtered at 2.9 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz. Data were analyzed using MiniAnalysis software (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA), Clampfit (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and Igor (Wavemetrics, Portland, OR).</p><p>For hypertonic sucrose experiments, we puffed sucrose over the entire area viewed under a 40× objective lens, which includes virtually all presynaptic boutons contacting the patched cells. 500 mM sucrose was applied to neurons, using an air pressure system (PicoSpritzer III, Parker Hannifin, Cleveland, OH), for 10 s to empty the RRP of vesicles. After a quick wash (Masterflex C/L, Cole–Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL), a second puff of sucrose was applied for another 10 s at various interpluse intervals. The recovery ratio was calculated by dividing the total charge elicited by the second puff of sucrose by the total charge elicited by the first puff. For the sucrose experiments in the presence of physiological [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, the extracellular solution included 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. For the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free condition, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> was replaced with 5 mM EGTA, and 25 µM BAPTA-AM (30 mM stock in DMSO) and 30 µM CPA (100 mM stock in DMSO) were added to the bath solution; cultures were incubated for 30 min before recording to allow BAPTA-AM and CPA to exert their effects.</p><p>For the recordings using bafilomycin, 1 µM bafilomycin (1.6 mM stock in DMSO) was added to the bath solution, and incubated for 3 min prior to recording. Neurons that were treated with bafilomycin were used within 20 min. For the CDZ experiments, 20 µM CDZ (100 mM stock in DMSO) was added to the bath solution and neurons were incubated for 30 min prior to recording. In the CTZ and KYN experiments, both 50 µM CTZ (100 mM stock in DMSO) and 100 µM KYN (75 mM stock in DMSO) were added to the bath.</p><p>All chemicals were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>PHluorin imaging experiments</title><p>PHluorin imaging was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kwon and Chapman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dean et al., 2012a</xref>).

The transfected cells were identified via mCherry fluorescence. For field-stimulation, 1 ms voltage pulses (70 V) were delivered using an SD9 stimulator (Natus Neurology, Warwick, RI) connected to two parallel platinum wires spaced by 10 mm in the imaging chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Time-lapse images were acquired at 1 s intervals, with 484ex/517em, on an inverted microscope (Nikon TE300, Japan) with a 1.42 NA 100× immersion oil objective under illumination with a Xenon light source (Lambda DG4, Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Fluorescence changes at individual boutons were detected using a Cascade 512II EMCCD camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ); data were collected and analyzed offline using MetaMorph 6.0 software. A baseline of 10 images was collected before applying high-frequency field stimulation. A typical exposure time was 400 ms for pHluorin. Puncta that did not exhibit any lateral movement during image acquisition were chosen for analysis.</p><p>For pHluorin-syt 7 and pHluorin-syt 1 quenching/de-quenching experiments, fast solution exchanges were achieved using an MBS-2 perfusion system (MPS-2, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The acidic solution, with a pH of 5.5, was prepared by replacing HEPES, in the bath saline used for perfusion, with 2-[<italic>N</italic>-morpholinoethane sulphonic acid (pKa = 6.1). An ammonium chloride solution (pH 7.4) was prepared by substituting 50 mM NaCl in bath saline with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, while all other components remained unchanged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Recombinant proteins</title><p>Recombinant cytoplasmic domains of syt isforms were generated as either GST fusion proteins, or his6-tagged proteins.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a well-done piece of work indicating that synaptotagmin VII has a specific role in synaptic vesicle mobilization. The analyses rely almost completely on a physiological characterization of synaptotagmin VII knockout mice, and data interpretation is greatly aided by the selective effect with no observable change in the response to a single action potential or pool size. In addition, the results are consistent with previous work showing little effect of SytVII on synaptic transmission. An important element of this study is the experiments to rescue the defect with either wild type SytVII or with a mutant version of SytVII that lacks calcium binding (4D/N). An analysis of recovery from depression supports the conclusion that SytVII is required for the fast phase of vesicle recovery, a deficit of ∼50% is resolved. In general, the experiments are nicely performed and clearly documented.</p><p>Despite the quality of the data, all three reviewers raised similar concerns with the manuscript that must be addressed in order for this work to be considered further at <italic>eLife</italic>. These concerns must be addressed.</p><p>1) The authors have in no way addressed the fact that in a 2008 publication from the Sudhof lab (Maximov et al., PNAS) the claim is that there is in fact no real depression in synaptic depression during HFS. Interestingly the authors actually agree on many points, i.e., no change in RRP, no change in PPR etc. However as this is really the crux of this paper and the two studies on the face of it simply do not agree I think it is imperative that this be explained, or examined. There is a possible trivial explanation, which is that the Sudhof report was on inhibitory neurons. If that is the explanation then is lessens the generality of this finding. This must be addressed in the text or through further experimentation.</p><p>2) It is very difficult to understand how a protein that does not localize to either the plasma membrane or synaptic vesicles influences the replenishment of synaptic vesicles. The authors suggest that the known role of syt VII in dense core vesicle release may contribute, presumably by releasing a factor that influences synaptic vesicle recycling. However, the loss of syt VII does not eliminate regulated exocytosis of chromaffin granules, and it is harder to understand how a partial defect would produce this effect on synaptic transmission, particularly since the defect occurs as early as the second action potential in a train. This issue lies at the very heart of this study. As such, this issue has to be introduced in the Introduction and should be clearly and openly discussed. In addition, the authors should attempt additional experimentation to confirm that SytVII does indeed reside on an internal membrane and provide further experimentation to address how SytVII could specifically influence recovery. The interation with calmodulin is interesting, but it remains a protein interaction without a clearly understood relevance to vesicle recovery.</p><p>3) The work provides no mention of the number of animals or samples used for any of the experiments, in either the Methods or the figure legends. The legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> mentions three independent trials, but it is unclear what that means (animals, slices, cells), or its relationship to the statistics. This is a serious deficiency and a low n could greatly reduce confidence in this entire study. Similarly, the imaging in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> presents unnormalized changes in fluorescence, and it is very hard to evaluate this either-it would be particularly difficult to combine data like this from multiple independent experiments, again raising concern about n.</p><p>4) The authors demonstrate that the D/N mutations in the C2 domain do not rescue, consistent with the need for this tagmin to bind calcium for its function. However the authors never actually show that this protein is actually present at synapses when re-expressed as a mutant. This should be addressed experimentally.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01524.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors have in no way addressed the fact that in a 2008 publication from the Sudhof lab (Maximov et al., PNAS) the claim is that there is in fact no real depression in synaptic depression during HFS.

This must be addressed in the text or through further experimentation</italic>.</p><p>We thank the referees for raising this issue. There are numerous self-contradictory reports from the Sudhof lab concerning the synaptotagmins (syt), and in most cases we are unable to explain these contradictions. Specifically, regarding syt 7: a) the Sudhof lab reported that syt 1 and 7 had the same Ca<sup>2+</sup>- affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding to membranes (Li et al., 1995), and reported that syt 7 has a much higher Ca<sup>2+</sup>-affinity for membrane binding, as compared to syt 1 (Sugita et al., 2002).</p><p>b) In 2001, the Sudhof lab reported that: “<italic>We now propose that synaptotagmin VII functions as a plasma membrane Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>sensor in synaptic exocytosis complementary to vesicular synaptotagmins</italic>” (Sugita et al., 2001), but later reported that: “…<italic>Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>binding by synaptotagmin-VII likely does not regulate SV exocytosis…</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maximov et al., 2008</xref>). [We also note that the Sudhof lab reported that syt 1 must be glycosylated in order to be targeted to SVs, and the reason why syt 7 was targeted to the plasma membrane was because it was not glycosylated (Han et al., 2004). However, we found that glycosylation plays no role in the targeting of syt 1 to SVs, and that syt 7 is not selectively targeted to the plasma membrane (Dean et al., 2012; Kwon and Chapman, 2012).]</p><p>c) During review of our syt 7 manuscript, the Sudhof lab published a new syt 7 paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacaj et al., 2013</xref>) where they now state: “<italic>We identify a selective essential function for Syt 7 in asynchronous release.</italic>” This contradicts their earlier paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maximov et al., 2008</xref>), in which they state, again, that “<italic>…Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>binding by synaptotagmin-VII likely does not regulate SV exocytosis…</italic>”, and that syt 7 plays no role in asynchronous release.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacaj et al. (2013)</xref>, the authors used a knock-down (KD) approach to conclude that syt 7 plays a role in asynchronous release. The authors propose that compensatory mechanisms, that result from the knock-out (KO) of syt 7, preclude functional effects (and hence explain the lack of an effect in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maximov et al. (2008)</xref>, where syt 7 KOs were used), and that a KD approach should be used to study syt 7. This claim predicts that KD of syt 7 should decrease asynchronous release in otherwise WT neurons, but this was not the case: the authors saw no effect on asynchonrous release when syt 7 was knocked-down in otherwise WT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacaj et al., 2013</xref>). So, there is complete agreement that KO or KD of syt 7 has no effect on asynchronous release from mouse central neurons.</p><p>In summary, the physiological relevance of the new proposal from the Sudhof lab, that syt 7 regulates asynchronous release, is unclear, as it occurred only when syt 7 was knocked-down, but not knocked-out, in a syt 1 KO background. Moreover, in the syt 7 KD/syt1 KO study, a key control – hypertonic sucrose (to determine the size and existence of releasable vesicle pools) – was missing, so the reported phenotype could simply be due to a loss of releasable SVs, and the published data set cannot be interpreted.</p><p>Getting back to the specific point raised by the referees, we note that in Figure 5B of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maximov et al. (2008)</xref>, there was in fact a slight reduction in synaptic transmission in syt 7 KO neurons during high, but not low frequency stimulation, suggestive of a defect in vesicle replenishment. These results are consistent with our findings, although the magnitude of the effect was smaller in Maximov et al (2008). Moreover, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacaj et al. (2013)</xref>, there is a reduction in release at later, but not early, stages in the stimulus train, which we argue should be interpreted as defective SV replenishment, not the “suppression” of “asynchronous” release posited by the authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacaj et al., 2013</xref>). Loss of asynchronous release should occur for all evoked responses, early and late, but in Figure 7c of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacaj et al. (2013)</xref> this is not the case: a loss of charge transfer became apparent only at late stages in the stimulus train in syt 7 KO neurons, again consistent with our model that posits that syt 7 plays in role in SV replenishment, but not in asynchronous release.</p><p>Furthermore, impaired replenishment of large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) was also reported in syt 7 KO chromaffin cells, where the authors state:</p><p>“<italic>Replenishment was inhibited in KO cells</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schonn et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that syt 7 is a ubiquitous Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for vesicle replenishment, contributing to the replenishment of both LDCVs and SVs.</p><p>We have included a short discussion of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maximov et al. (2008)</xref> paper and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacaj et al. (2013)</xref> paper in “Discussion” section of the revised manuscript, to help to clarify these points.</p><p><italic>2) It is very difficult to understand how a protein that does not localize to either the plasma membrane or synaptic vesicles influences the replenishment of synaptic vesicles</italic>.</p><p>Our new pHluorin-syt 7 and -syt 1 quenching/de-quenching experiments confirmed (please see also (Dean et al., 2012)) that the surface and internal fractions of these isoforms were similar (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), thus syt 7 is not selectively targeted to the plasma membrane (as discussed above). Clearly, some fraction of each proteins is present in the plasma membrane; in general, all syt isoforms are present, to some degree, in the plasma membrane (Dean et al., 2012), and could, in principle, regulate release from this position.</p><p>How any of the proteins, shown to regulate replenishment (CaM, munc13-1, syt 7), operate in this process remains to be determined. The first goal is to identify all the factors, and then to figure out how they work together to regulate replenishment, thereby elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms. At present, few factors have been identified. Importantly, our study provides an entirely new, novel, and critical regulatory element in the replenishment pathway, syt 7. Rather than engage in extensive speculation as to how syt 7 regulates replenishment, we now state, in the “Discussion” section of the revised manuscript, that:</p><p>“… So, syt 7 is likely to regulate replenishment either from the plasma membrane, or from LDCVs or lysosomes. In molecular terms, the emerging view is that CaM regulates SV replenishment via interactions with both munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lipstein et al., 2013</xref>) and syt 7. Future studies are needed to determine whether CaM can physically interact with both proteins simultaneously, or whether CaM forms mutually exclusive complexes in the replenishment pathway.”</p><p>We should also note that “replenishment” is an operational definition, and the physical basis that underlies this process is currently the subject of debate: one model posits that replenishment is mobilization from a reserve or reluctant pool to a recycling pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ikeda and Bekkers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kuromi and Kidokoro, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murthy and Stevens, 1999</xref>), while another model posits that replenishment is limited by clearance of release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). So, as we identify key components of the replenishment pathway, the hope is to determine whether these components act to regulate mobilization of SVs or clearance of release sites, and these experiments are likely to require new innovations to address issues such as the movement of SV components away from active zones etc.</p><p><italic>The authors suggest that the known role of syt VII in dense core vesicle release may contribute, presumably by releasing a factor that influences synaptic vesicle recycling. However, the loss of syt VII does not eliminate regulated exocytosis of chromaffin granules, and it is harder to understand how a partial defect would produce this effect on synaptic transmission, particularly since the defect occurs as early as the second action potential in a train. This issue lies at the very heart of this study. As such, this issue has to be introduced in the Introduction and should be clearly and openly discussed</italic>.</p><p>If the referees are referring to the electrophysiological recordings under HFS, there seems to be a misunderstanding as the second AP gave rise to normal release (please see the PPR in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). If the referees are referring to the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we note that the second data point in panel C corresponds to 1 second of stimulation at 20 Hz, not the 2<sup>nd</sup> stimulation. The normal release observed at early stages, in conjunction with the deficiencies observed at later stages in syt 7 KO neurons, are indicative of reductions in SV replenishment.</p><p>We understand the point raised by the referees: ∼1 second provides little time for LDCV release to modify synaptic transmission, but it is also possible that previous release of the putative syt 7 LDCV is permissive for SV replenishment. But this example begins to illustrate the problem with speculation: since so little is known concerning replenishment it seems, to us, that too much speculation is not appropriate. Rather than speculate, we simply state that syt 7 must execute its function from where it is located: at the plasma membrane, or on internal vesicles that likely correspond to LDCVs and lysosomes. So, we have simplified the text to some extent to minimize speculation, as detailed in our response to point #2 above.</p><p><italic>In addition, the authors should attempt additional experimentation to confirm that SytVII does indeed reside on an internal membrane</italic>…</p><p>To address this, we carried out pHluorin-syt 7 quenching/de-quenching experiments; pHluorin-syt 1 was used as a control (please see also (Dean et al., 2012)). We confirmed that both syt 7 and 1 are largely targeted to internal membranes, but that a significant fraction of each protein is also present in the plasma membrane (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>… and provide further experimentation to address how SytVII could specifically influence recovery</italic>.</p><p>Our current study confirmed that loss of syt 7 has no effect on mEPSCs, or single action potential evoked synchronous and asynchronous release, and we further investigated the function of syt 7 on SV priming (hypertonic sucrose), recycling (pHluorin) and replenishment (current work). We found that only SV replenishment was impaired in syt 7 KO neurons, establishing specificity for the reported phenotype. Moreover, this phenotype has not been described for any other member of the syt family, including syt 1, 2, 4, 9, 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2011</xref>; Dean et al., 2012; Dean et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maximov and Sudhof, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2007</xref>), further establishing the novelty and specificity of our findings.</p><p>To further address the referees’ concerns, we compared the abilities of syt 1, 2, 4, 7, 9 and 10 to bind to CaM (again, since KO phenotypes have been described for these isoforms). Strikingly, only syt 7 exhibited robust Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent CaM binding activity (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>); these data establish the highly specific nature of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>•syt 7•CaM interaction. Since CaM has emerged as a key factor for replenishment in a variety of earlier studies (Hosoi et al., 2007; Lipstein et al., 2013; Sakaba and Neher, 2001), this biochemical interaction provides a physical link between the physiological function of syt 7 and a known protein for SV replenishment, CaM. Indeed, we show that a CaM antagonist phenocopies loss of syt 7, suggesting that these proteins operate together to regulate replenishment in neurons.</p><p><italic>The interation with calmodulin is interesting, but it remains a protein interaction without a clearly understood relevance to vesicle recovery</italic>.</p><p>It has been rigorously established that CaM regulates SV replenishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hosoi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lipstein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sakaba and Neher, 2001</xref>) and yes, at present it is unknown as to how CaM exerts its effects in this process: no earlier paper has worked-out a molecular mechanism. Our study is novel as we have uncovered a novel CaM binding protein, syt 7, as a key regulator of SV replenishment. So, at present, three molecules have been identified: CaM, munc13-1, and now, syt 7, in the replenishment pathway. Interestingly, both syt 7 and munc13-1 bind to CaM, so CaM perhaps serves as a central ‘hub’ for replenishment, and this issue will prompt further study. For example, we are keen to determine whether CaM can bind to both syt 7 and munc13-1 simultaneously. So, by identifying the key components, we can begin to fit them together into a molecular mechanism. It is likely that a model will await identification of additional components, but the current state-of-the-art is to first identify these components, as we have now done for syt 7 (and as Lipstein et al. (2013) have done by showing CaM works together with munc13-1 to regulate replenishment). We now state, in the “Discussion” section of the revised manuscript, that:</p><p>“In molecular terms, the emerging view is that CaM regulates SV replenishment via interactions with both Munc13-1 (Lipstein et al., 2013) and syt 7. Future studies are needed to determine whether CaM can physically interact with both proteins simultaneously, or whether CaM forms mutually exclusive complexes in the replenishment pathway.”</p><p><italic>3) The work provides no mention of the number of animals or samples used for any of the experiments, in either the Methods or the figure legends.

This is a well-established effect of this drug, and is commonly used; we simply included a trace to make sure the drug was effective (this control trace is not normally included in publications and could be removed to save space). In contrast, the statistical analysis in panels B and C, in the same figure, were calculated based on the normalized fluorescence changes from three independent experiments (three distinct litters of mice), six coverslips (two from each mouse), and 50 boutons per coverslip, which is ∼ 300 boutons in total. We have added this information in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) The authors demonstrate that the D/N mutations in the C2 domain do not rescue, consistent with the need for this tagmin to bind calcium for its function.
