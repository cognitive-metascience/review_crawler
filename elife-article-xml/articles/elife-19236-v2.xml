NLGN2 is only at inhibitory synapses while NLGN3 is at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We found that NLGN3 function at inhibitory synapses in rat CA1 depends on the presence of NLGN2 and identified a domain in the extracellular region that accounted for this functional difference between NLGN2 and 3 specifically at inhibitory synapses. We further show that the presence of a cytoplasmic tail (c-tail) is indispensible, and identified two domains in the c-tail that are necessary for NLGN function at inhibitory synapses. These domains point to a gephyrin-dependent mechanism that is disrupted by an autism-associated mutation at R705 and a gephyrin-independent mechanism reliant on a putative phosphorylation site at S714. Our work highlights unique and separate roles for the extracellular and intracellular regions in specifying and carrying out NLGN function respectively.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19236.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19236.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neuroligins</kwd><kwd>inhibitory synapse</kwd><kwd>gephyrin</kwd><kwd>autism</kwd><kwd>neuroligin 2</kwd><kwd>neuroligin 3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Quynh-Anh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horn</surname><given-names>Meryl E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nicoll</surname><given-names>Roger A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiological recordings reveal domains within the extracellular and intracellular region of neuroligin important for specifying and carrying out its function at inhibitory synapses respectively.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proper balance between inhibitory and excitatory connections is important for proper functioning of neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maćkowiak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bang and Owczarek, 2013</xref>). Cell adhesion molecules have a critical role in coordinating the apposition of presynaptic terminals with postsynaptic sites of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Washbourne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamagata et al., 2003</xref>). While much work has been done to determine the molecular organization of cell adhesion molecules at excitatory synapses, less is known about how these components are organized at inhibitory synapses.</p><p>Neuroligins are a family of postsynaptic cell adhesion molecules that interact trans-synaptically with their corresponding presynaptic neurexin binding partners to mediate proper synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Südhof, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chih et al., 2005</xref>). Rats express three neuroligins (NLGN1-3): NLGN1 is expressed exclusively at excitatory synapses, NLGN2 is selectively present at inhibitory synapses, while NLGN3 is found at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Varoqueaux et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Budreck and Scheiffele, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Song et al., 1999</xref>). NLGN2 and 3 share many previously identified domains both in their extracellular and intracellular regions. Despite the similarities between the two proteins, it is currently unknown whether they perform the same function at inhibitory synapses. One notable difference between NLGN2 and 3 resides in the extracellular region at splice site A which has previously been proposed to affect NLGN binding to its presynaptic neurexin partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ichtchenko et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chih et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>It has been suggested that NLGN2 functions through a direct interaction on its cytoplasmic tail with gephyrin, a scaffold protein thought to be essential for stabilizing glycine and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choii and Ko, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2014</xref>). In addition, it has been proposed that collybistin, a brain-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), helps regulate the localization of gephyrin, and that NLGN2 is a specific activator of collybistin via a direct interaction at the proline rich region in its cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kins et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Soykan et al., 2014</xref>). While previous studies have been able to link these interactions to NLGN2, there has been no direct study of whether these interactions are necessary for proper functioning of NLGNs at inhibitory synapses.</p><p>To investigate the importance of NLGN2 and 3 at inhibitory synapses, we used microRNAs targeted to NLGN2 or 3 individually. We found that NLGN2 is a critical component of inhibitory synapses while NLGN3 function at inhibitory synapses depends on the presence of NLGN2. Further investigation expressing chimeric constructs of NLGN2 and 3 in isolation, using a microRNA targeting all three endogenously expressed NLGNs 1, 2, and 3, identified a previously uncharacterized domain in the extracellular region that accounted for this functional difference between NLGN2 and 3. Using a similar technique to study the importance of the intracellular region in NLGN function at inhibitory synapses, we found a critical requirement for the cytoplasmic tail and identified two key residues that are separately involved in gephyrin-dependent and gephyrin-independent mechanisms of NLGN function at inhibitory synapses. We further show that an autism-associated mutation inhibits the gephyrin-dependent pathway while a phosphorylation site is responsible for modulating the gephyrin-independent pathway. These findings identify new mechanisms for NLGN function, particularly at inhibitory synapses, and provide new avenues of study for elucidating the molecular mechanisms present at inhibitory synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NLGN2 is the critical NLGN at inhibitory synapses</title><p>To determine the relative contributions of NLGN2 and 3 to inhibitory synaptic transmission, we utilized targeted microRNA constructs to knockdown either NLGN2 or 3 (validated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shipman and Nicoll, 2012a</xref>).

Compared to a previously validated knockdown construct of NLGNs 1–3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shipman et al., 2011</xref>) which reduces inhibitory synaptic transmission to about 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) we found that while NLGN2 knockdown alone recapitulated the 50% decrease in inhibitory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and d</xref>), NLGN3 knockdown alone had no effect on inhibitory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>).

We first inserted a region of NLGN2 up to the 623rd amino acid that contains substantial differences between it and NLGN3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

However, adding back NLGN2 up to the 52nd amino acid was able to potentiate inhibitory currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d and h</xref>). Further refinement showed that transplanting just the domain between the 52nd and 180th amino acid of NLGN2 was able to fully confer NLGN2 ability to potentiate inhibitory currents onto NLGN3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e and h</xref>). Since this domain encompassed the splice site A and a previously uncharacterized domain of the extracellular region, we wanted to know whether the splice site A or the uncharacterized domain alone was sufficient to confer NLGN2 function onto NLGN3. While expression of a chimeric construct containing the uncharacterized extracellular domain of NLGN2 between amino acids 52–164 showed a modest enhancement of inhibitory currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f and h</xref>), it was far less than the effect of the full length NLGN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). A chimera containing only the splice site A domain of NLGN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g and h</xref>) failed to enhance inhibitory responses. Importantly, all chimeric constructs, except NLGN3-180-NLGN2 which appears non-functional, that failed to potentiate inhibitory responses were still able to potentiate excitatory responses, indicating that they were functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Together, this suggests that the splice site A domain alone does not account for the differences between NLGN2 and 3 function but that a previously uncharacterized adjacent domain is also required.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A c-tail is required for NLGN function</title><p>Since the c-tails of the NLGNs share many similar domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), and our previous results showed that the c-tails of NLGN2 and 3 were interchangeable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>), we wanted to know whether the c-tail of NLGN1, a NLGN that is selectively present at excitatory synapses, was also capable of functioning at inhibitory synapses. In experiments done on a reduced endogenous NLGN background, full-length NLGN1 was unable to enhance inhibitory responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and d</xref>), while a chimeric construct containing the NLGN2 extracellular region with a NLGN1 intracellular region was able to enhance inhibitory currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref>). To determine whether a c-tail is required at all, we created a truncation mutant lacking most of the c-tail except for a few amino acids closest to the transmembrane domain which might be necessary for proper trafficking of the protein (Δ133, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

The reigning model of NLGN function at inhibitory synapses purports that the interaction of gephyrin with NLGN2 via its gephyrin-binding domain enables the recruitment of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choii and Ko, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2014</xref>).

To determine whether the gephyrin-binding domain is critical for NLGN2 function, we employed a variety of methods to either disrupt or excise this region of interest. Surprisingly, we found that expression of NLGN2 with a phospho-mimic mutation previously shown to disrupt gephyrin binding (NLGN2 Y770A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giannone et al., 2013</xref>), excision of the whole gephyrin-binding domain (NLGN2Δ55–69), or, most dramatically, truncation of the gephyrin-binding domain and everything downstream of it, including all known functional domains of the NLGN2 c-tail (NLGN2Δ69), all still displayed significant potentiation of inhibitory currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c and d</xref>).</p><p>While our results suggest that the gephyrin-binding domain is not critical for NLGN2 function, we wondered whether gephyrin, itself, is required.

To determine whether this was the case, we made two more double mutants, combining either the autism mutation or phospho-null mutation with the point mutation in the gephyrin-binding domain that inhibits gephyrin binding (NLGN2-R705C-Y770A or NLGN2-S714A-Y770A). Since the Y770A mutation inherently blocks the gephyrin-dependent pathway, we wanted to know which of our mutations when combined with this manipulation would reveal the presence of a gephyrin-independent pathway. We expect that if either the R705C or S714A point mutations were in a gephyrin-independent pathway, we would observe reduced enhancement of inhibitory currents when combined with the Y770A point mutation that blocks gephyrin binding.</p><p>The combined autism mutation and gephyrin-binding double point mutant (NLGN2-R705C-Y770A) exhibited enhancement comparable to full-length NLGN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f and h</xref>), while the combined phospho-null mutation and gephyrin-binding double point mutant (NLGN2-S714A-Y770A) showed significantly reduced enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g and h</xref>). Thus, while the three individual point mutations on their own still exhibited enhancement of inhibitory currents, it was only when we mutated both S714 and R705 or S714 and Y770A did we see impairment, suggesting these mutations to be involved in separate pathways. Also, mutation of both R705 and Y770 still exhibited enhancement of inhibitory currents similar to full-length NLGN2, suggesting that they function in the same pathway. Together, we propose the existence of two pathways: a gephyrin-independent pathway modulated at S714 and a gephyrin-dependent pathway modulated at both R705 and Y770 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19236.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Separate gephyrin-dependent and gephyrin-independent mechanisms for neuroligin function at inhibitory synapses.</title><p>We propose separate gephyrin-dependent and gephyrin-independent mechanisms for NLGN function at inhibitory synapses. In our NLGN2-R705C-S714A manipulation, we block the gephyrin-independent pathway by preventing phosphorylation at the S714 residue, and also block the gephyrin-dependent pathway by the autism-associated mutation at R705. Therefore, the resulting effect we see is impaired function at inhibitory synapses. In our NLGN2-R705C-S714D manipulation, we facilitate the gephyrin-independent pathway by mimicking phosphorylation at the S714 residue, while the gephyrin-dependent pathway is blocked by the autism-associated mutation at R705. The resulting effect we see is intact function at inhibitory synapses. In our NLGN2-R705C-Y770A manipulation, we only block the gephyrin-dependent pathway with the autism-associated mutation at R705 and a mutation at Y770 that blocks gephyrin-binding. The resulting effect we see is intact function at inhibitory synapses. In our NLGN2-S714A-Y770A manipulation, we block the gephyrin-independent pathway by preventing phosphorylation at the S714 residue, and also block the gephyrin-dependent pathway with the mutation at Y770 that blocks gephyrin-binding. Therefore, the resulting effect we see is impaired function at inhibitory synapses. Green is gephyrin. Yellow residues are phosphorylation sites. The Y770A point mutant has been previously characterized and shown to function as a phospho-mimic mutation that blocks gephyrin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giannone et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19236.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19236.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19236-fig8-v2"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results have uncovered the critical features of NLGN2 for proper inhibitory synaptic function and reveal domains in both the extracellular and intracellular regions of the NLGNs that are necessary for their function specifically at inhibitory synapses. Our systematic dissection of the relative contributions of NLGN2 and 3 to inhibitory synaptic function through targeted knockdown of one or the other revealed that while NLGN3 appears to be a dispensable component, NLGN2 is not and that, in fact, NLGN3 function depends on the presence of NLGN2. Further analysis via expression of chimeric NLGN2/3 constructs on a reduced endogenous NLGN background revealed that this difference between NLGN2 and 3 function at inhibitory synapses is due to differences within a domain in the extracellular region corresponding to a site important for neurexin binding, as well as a proximal uncharacterized region.</p><p>While this result seemed to suggest that the intracellular region is not important, our results clearly show that, although the intracellular region of any NLGN is sufficient for function at inhibitory synapses, if paired with the extracellular region of NLGN2, a c-tail is very much required. Thus, a NLGN2 truncation lacking most of the intracellular region failed to enhance inhibitory responses while maintaining a normal ability to traffic to the surface. Further refinement identified two distinct regions of the NLGN c-tail corresponding to gephyrin-dependent and gephyrin-independent mechanisms that enable proper function at inhibitory synapses. These results suggest that while the extracellular region is important for specifying function at an inhibitory or excitatory synapse, the intracellular region is critical for carrying out that function at both an inhibitory or excitatory synapse.</p><p>Due to the heterogeneous nature of inhibitory synapses, one question that arises is whether our observations are relevant only for particular subsets of inhibitory synapses. Previous work using simultaneous recording from connected neurons showed that NLGN2 knockout animals specifically displayed a deficit in PV but not SOM inputs onto hippocampal pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>). A similar set of studies in NLGN3 knockout animals showed an enhancement of CCK inputs but no change in PV inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Földy et al., 2013</xref>). In our experimental system, we find that while knockdown of NLGN2 critically affects inhibitory transmission, knockdown of NLGN3 does not. Our results are consistent with the observations at PV synapses, suggesting either that our stimulation placement preferentially recruits responses from these types of synapses or that in our system PV inputs are responsible for a large proportion of inhibitory responses.</p><p>One limitation of our study is that the results we observe may not occur universally among all brain regions. Indeed, recent work has shown that within the cerebellum the basket/stellate cell synapses onto Purkinje cells exhibit a decrease in mIPSC frequency but not amplitude with knock-out of just NLGN2 while the double knockout of NLGN2 and 3 exhibit a much more dramatic impairment in both mIPSC frequency and amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, there are inherent limitations with the organotypic slice preparation we have utilized in our experiments including but not limited to the presence of sprouting and rewiring of circuits and the high level of expression imparted by biolistic transfection.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The role of NLGN3 at inhibitory synapses</title><p>What might be the role of NLGN3 at inhibitory synapses since our results show that its absence does not affect inhibitory transmission, and that NLGN3 requires the presence of NLGN2 to function at inhibitory synapses? One possible explanation is that NLGN3 functions as an available mechanism to quickly enhance existing inhibitory synapses. Previous work looking at overexpression of NLGN2 or 3 in cerebral cortical neurons noticed that the majority of NLGN3 was not localized synaptically while the majority of NLGN2 was synaptically located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fekete et al., 2015</xref>). From this, we can surmise the presence of a readily available pool of NLGN3 located outside the synapse that could be recruited and associate with NLGN2 in response to induction of plasticity.</p><p>This hypothesis is further strengthened by our result showing that transplanting a domain of the NLGN2 extracellular region corresponding to a key area associated with neurexin binding fully enabled NLGN3 to function at inhibitory synapses by itself. It suggests that NLGN3 is unable to bind to the corresponding neurexin partner at inhibitory synapses alone and that it needs to heterodimerize with NLGN2 in order to function. Previous work has already shown that different neurexin isoforms are expressed at different types of synapses, and that the neurexin isoform expressed at inhibitory synapses can bind to NLGN2 but not NLGN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuccillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Futai et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it is possible that NLGN3, which seems to be able to bind to the neurexins at excitatory synapses by itself, needs to associate with NLGN2 in order to bind to the neurexins at an inhibitory synapse, and this special property of NLGN2 resides in a unique domain in its extracellular region that we have now identified. An alternative hypothesis, and one that does not necessarily require the presence of NLGN2/3 heteromers, is that there is another molecule in addition to neurexin that interacts within that domain of NLGN2 to stabilize the synapse and enable recruitment of NLGN3.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Extracellular region confers specificity</title><p>Our results showing that a chimeric NLGN3 extracellular region with a NLGN2 intracellular region was unable to potentiate inhibitory responses but could still enhance excitatory responses indicates that there are differential requirements for NLGN function at excitatory versus inhibitory synapses and that the extracellular region is critical for mediating this specificity. This is not surprising given that neurexin binding occurs at the extracellular region and that different neurexin isoforms are present preferentially at particular synapses. However, there could be other possible interactors that help define this functional specificity. Previous work has shown that NMDA receptors are able to bind to the extracellular region of NLGN1 but not NLGN2 or 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Budreck et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the presence of the B splice site insertion in NLGN1 enables it to enhance NMDA currents and promote LTP, and this site is notably absent in NLGN3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shipman and Nicoll, 2012a</xref>). For inhibitory synapses, previous work has shown that MAM domain-containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor proteins (MDGAs) are able to negatively regulate the function of NLGN2 through an interaction within their extracellular region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pettem et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Also, there are multiple glycosylation sites in the extracellular region of the NLGNs and previous work has shown that glycosylation state can affect neurexin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Comoletti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoffman et al., 2004</xref>). However, the analogous glycosylation sites initially found in NLGN1 are conserved among both NLGN2 and 3 within our critical domain, suggesting that they may not explain the difference we see in function. Previously identified cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds within the extracellular region are also conserved between NLGN2 and 3 within our critical domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoffman et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, it would be of interest to determine what molecular interactions are occurring at our critical extracellular domain to mediate NLGN function at inhibitory synapses both in baseline conditions and in response to plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Intracellular region contains the toolbox for NLGN function at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses</title><p>Our results with chimeric constructs show that any NLGN c-tail is able to function at inhibitory synapses if linked with a NLGN2 extracellular region, and that the NLGN2 c-tail is able to function at excitatory synapses when linked with the NLGN3 extracellular region. This suggests that there is no specificity within the c-tail itself to determine NLGN function at either an excitatory or inhibitory synapse. These results are consistent with previous work showing that overexpression on a wild-type background of chimeric constructs containing NLGN1 extracellular linked to NLGN2 intracellular, or NLGN2 extracellular linked to NLGN1 intracellular, is fully capable of enhancing excitatory and inhibitory currents respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Futai et al., 2013</xref>). Our work eliminates the possibility that previous observations might be due to heterodimerization of chimeric constructs with endogenous NLGNs by expressing all of our chimera on a reduced endogenous NLGN background.</p><p>While the c-tail is the toolbox that contains all the functional residues necessary to perform at either an excitatory or inhibitory synapse, it is important to note that the particular type of synapse determines which residues will be utilized. Indeed, prior work has shown that phosphorylation at the gephyrin binding domain enables preferential recruitment of PSD-95 versus gephyrin to the intracellular region of NLGN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giannone et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, while it has been shown that there is a critical residue in the NLGN3 c-tail that is important for its function at excitatory synapses, mutation of the analogous residue in NLGN2 does not affect its function at inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shipman et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the mechanisms we describe are specific for NLGN function at inhibitory synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Gephyrin-dependent and gephyrin-independent mechanisms for NLGN function at inhibitory synapses</title><p>We were surprised to find that not only the PDZ and collybistin domain are dispensable for NLGN function at inhibitory synapses but also the gephyrin-binding domain as well. There have been previous reports of gephyrin-independent function at inhibitory synapses, either in development or during plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Danglot et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Niwa et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, previous work done in mice lacking the cytoplasmic protein dystrophin showed selective reduction in clustering of α2 containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors but no change in gephyrin clustering, suggesting there might be dystrophin-dependent and gephyrin-independent mechanisms for clustering of specific GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knuesel et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, it would be of interest to determine whether phosphorylation of the S714 site affects dystrophin function.</p><p>Phosphorylation at the S714 residue of NLGN2 has been found to negatively regulate the interaction between NLGN2 and gephyrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonelli et al., 2014</xref>). However, our results indicate that phosphorylation at this site positively regulates NLGN2 function through a gephyrin-independent mechanism, since only the phospho-null form is able to block enhancement of inhibitory currents when paired with a mutation that blocks the gephyrin-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This discrepancy might be explained by the previous study’s use of non-neuronal cells for characterization of the interaction between gephryin and the phosphorylation state at that site. It remains to be determined what kinase phosphorylates this particular site and what molecules are recruited in response to phosphorylation to mediate gephyrin-independent NLGN2 function.</p><p>The R705C point mutation is the only autism-associated mutation in the NLGNs identified to date that resides in the intracellular region. Previous characterization of this autism mutation at the analogous residue in NLGN3 showed no effect at inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Etherton et al., 2011</xref>). This is consistent with our results showing that NLGN2 with the R705C point mutation alone is fully capable of enhancing inhibitory transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>). However, by combining the R705C mutation with the S714A mutation, we were able to uncover a deficit in NLGN function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Similarly, it was only by combining the Y770A mutation with the S714A mutation, not the R705C mutation, that we were able to prevent NLGN2 from enhancing inhibitory currents, suggesting that the R705C mutation operates via a gephyrin-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These results underscore the additive effects of multiple point mutations, and highlight how disease phenotypes can be due to the interaction of a number of different factors. While the R705C mutation was shown to inhibit PKC-mediated interaction with NLGN4X at excitatory synapses, there is no analogous PKC phosphorylation site in NLGN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bemben et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it remains to be determined what molecules interact at this site and how this autism-associated mutation results in disruption of gephyrin binding to NLGN2.</p><p>Our findings have highlighted the separate roles of the NLGN extracellular and intracellular regions. The extracellular region is important for specifying function at a particular synapse while the intracellular region is important for carrying out the molecular mechanisms at either an excitatory or inhibitory synapse. We identify a domain in the extracellular region that is necessary and sufficient for specifying NLGN function at inhibitory synapses and elucidate both a gephyrin-dependent and gephyrin-independent mechanism for NLGN function at inhibitory synapses operating via intracellular interactions modulated by a phosphorylation site and an autism-associated mutation. These results advance our fundamental understanding of NLGN function at inhibitory synapses and provide multiple new avenues of study for further dissection of the various molecular interactors of the NLGNs, both extracellularly and intracellularly, and in normal and disease conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental constructs</title><p>Neuroligin overexpression constructs have previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shipman et al., 2011</xref>) and were based on RNAi-proofed HA-tagged rat NLGN2 and human NLGN3.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Nguyen et al. report the roles of distinct extracellular and intracellular domains of neuroligins (NLGNs) at inhibitory synapses. The authors first find that NLGN2 but not NLGN3 is required for inhibitory synaptic transmission in cultured neurons. In follow-up experiments, the authors mainly use molecular replacement approaches to map out critical regions associated with NLGN2-dependent regulation of inhibitory transmission. The authors identify two domains in the extracellular region of NLGN2 (splice A site domain and an uncharacterized adjacent domain) that confer NLGN function at inhibitory synapses. Intracellularly, the authors find that a c-tail from NLGN1/2/3 is required for NLGN function at inhibitory synapses. Furthermore, they find that previously identified cytoplasmic domains including the PDZ-binding motif and gephyrin-binding domain are not required for NLGN2 function, but that an upstream region (δ 117-133) and two residues within this region, one autism-related (R705) and the other phosphorylatable (S714), are important for NLGN2 function. Interestingly, the authors find that these residues together with a residue in the gephyrin-binding domain (Y770) are collectively important for NLGN2 function; combinations of residues both in the gephyrin-dependent and -independent pathways are important to fully support NLGN2 function. This is an interesting, well-performed and thorough study, and a well-written manuscript that is appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>. The findings provide novel insight into the relevance and function of previously unidentified regions of Nlgn at inhibitory synapses.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This study used many constructs carrying deletions and mutations of NLGN2 and NLGN3. Ideally, their total and surface expression levels should be tested using biochemical (i.e. biotinylation) or cell biological methods, although some were tested by surface staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The extracellular deletion variants were verified of their support for excitatory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is admittedly a nicer way, but most of the cytoplasmic variants of NLGN2 were not tested for total/surface expression.</p><p>2) The authors identify the proximal part of the extracellular region of Nlgn2 as required for the functional differences between Nlgn2 and Nlgn3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The study would be enhanced if the authors could identify the property that makes this proximal region unique. The authors could use binding assays to test if this proximal region confers binding properties to Nlgn3 that allow binding of this Nlgn3 to neurexins expressed at inhibitory synapses. They could also use similar binding assays to test whether this proximal region might be required to allow Nlgn3 to associate with Nlgn2 in heteromers at inhibitory synapses. Even if the results are negative it would still be informative, as this would strengthen their alternative hypothesis that there could be another molecule interacting with the Nlgn2 proximal domain (subsection “Extracellular region confers specificity”).</p><p>3) A challenge in dissecting the contribution of the Nlgn c-tail to inhibitory synaptic function is that the downstream signaling pathways are largely unknown. Although their experiments suggest that the R705C mutation acts via a gephyrin-dependent pathway, the molecular basis of this is less clear. The authors previously showed that in Nlgn4, this mutation impairs phosphorylation of neighboring T707 by PKC (Bemben et al., PNAS 2015). T707 is absent in Nlgn1-3, suggesting an alternative mechanism. Biochemical analysis of gephryin binding in R705C mutants would help to clarify how this mutation might affect the gephyrin-dependent pathway. In these experiments, the R705C mutant can be compared to S714A mutant, which would not be expected to affect gephyrin binding. In addition, is it possible to check that the phosphorylation of neighboring S714 is not affected by the R705C mutation?</p><p>4) The authors propose that S714 modulates a gephyrin-independent pathway, based on their findings that the S714A single mutation does not impair inhibitory responses, whereas the S714A-Y770A double mutant does. The authors could functionally test the effect of the single S714A mutation by expressing the single Nlgn2-S714A mutant in an Nlgn1-3 miR+/gephyrin-miR+ background, which would be expected to fail to enhance inhibitory responses.</p><p>5) The main approach employed in the current study is electrophysiological recordings of rat organotypic slice cultured neurons. To corroborate the key findings, some of the phenotypes (if not all) should be confirmed by independent immunocytochemical approaches.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19236.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) This study used many constructs carrying deletions and mutations of NLGN2 and NLGN3.

First, there is no readily available library of all the neurexin variants expressed at inhibitory synapses from which we can obtain constructs to overexpress. Even if there were, there are a plethora of neurexin variants and combinations, including splice isoforms, which could be possibly expressed, making it unwieldy to perform this experiment.</p><p>However, we have attempted to characterize our critical extracellular domain further by looking at the crystal structure of NLGN2 which has previously been resolved [1]. We aligned the structure of NLGN2 (3BL8) to the crystal structure of the NLGN1/Neurexin1β complex [2] (3BIW) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 2</xref>), to approximate the location at which neurexin would bind to NLGN2. Highlighted in red is our critical extracellular domain, which appears to be on the side of the neuroligin away from the neurexin-binding interface, suggesting that molecular partners other than neurexins underlie the ability of this domain to confer neuroligin function at inhibitory synapses. Indeed, there are a number of candidate molecules hypothesized to associate with NLGN2 [3] and it would be of interest for future studies to screen through possible interactors for binding to our identified domain. One caveat of this structural prediction is that the neurexin binding sites are based on the NLGN1/Neurexin1β complex and it is possible that neurexins at inhibitory synapses bind to NLGN2 at a different site. In addition, we noticed that the published crystal structure of NLGN2 is missing 14 amino acids around and within the splice site A site, which could affect the true structure of the protein.</p><p>We were unable to characterize and align NLGN3 to our structural analysis due to the lack of a crystal structure and the inability of structure prediction software to fully predict the structure of our protein due to the highly disordered region around splice site A.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19236.018</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of NLGN2 dimer (in blue) aligned with Neurexin1β structure (in orange).</title><p>In red is the critical extracellular domain in NLGN2 identified in our study.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19236.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19236.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19236-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p>We do not think that our identified critical domain in the proximal region is required to allow NLGN3 to associate with NLGN2 in heteromers since wild-type NLGN3 already associates with NLGN2, as shown in the blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 3</xref>). In this experiment, HEK cells were transfected with constructs for either GFP alone, GFP+NLGN2, GFP+NLGN3, or both NLGN2 and 3. The NLGN2 construct contained an HA tag that we immunoprecipitated for and then blotted for NLGN3 to determine if the two bind. We see robust NLGN3 signal in the IP samples from cells expressing both NLGN2 and NLGN3. We can also see that we did enrich for HA-associated protein complexes since the NLGN3 signal in the input lane from cells expressing GFP+ NLGN3 goes away in the IP lane. We see some signal in the GFP+NLGN2 samples in the IP lane and this is due to the fact that the antibody we use can also detect other neuroligins when they are highly overexpressed.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19236.019</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>HEK293T cells were transfected with either GFP, GFP+NLGN2, GFP+NLGN3, or NLGN2+NLGN3.</title><p>After 2 days lysates were harvested and incubated in HA-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) to immunoprecipitate HA-tagged protein complexes.

Although their experiments suggest that the R705C mutation acts via a gephyrin-dependent pathway, the molecular basis of this is less clear. The authors previously showed that in Nlgn4, this mutation impairs phosphorylation of neighboring T707 by PKC (Bemben et al., PNAS 2015). T707 is absent in Nlgn1-3, suggesting an alternative mechanism. Biochemical analysis of gephryin binding in R705C mutants would help to clarify how this mutation might affect the gephyrin-dependent pathway. In these experiments, the R705C mutant can be compared to S714A mutant, which would not be expected to affect gephyrin binding. In addition, is it possible to check that the phosphorylation of neighboring S714 is not affected by the R705C mutation?</italic> </p><p>We transfected HEK cells with gephyrin and either NLGN2, NLGN2-R705C, or NLGN2-S714A. We then immunoprecipitated for the HA-tagged NLGN2 and blotted for gephyrin to see if we could detect any differences in gephyrin binding to the different point mutants. As shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 4</xref>), we could not detect any noticeable difference in the gephyrin signal between the point mutants. This result is not definitive in showing that there is no effect on gephyrin interactions with our point mutants due to the fact that we are highly overexpressing them and thus it is possible that there are slight nuances in the interaction that we are not able to pick up in this assay. In addition, we are using non-neuronal cells which could impact our results. While it would be ideal to use neuronal cells for this assay, we would be hampered by the fact that the gephyrin-NLGN2 interaction itself is quite weak. As shown in our blots, we see robust gephyrin signal in our input lanes. However, when we enrich for NLGN2, we see about 90% less signal suggesting that most of the gephyrin being overexpressed is not binding to NLGN2. This signal would be even weaker/undetectable if we were to use neuronal cells and endogenous gephyrin.</p><p>Unfortunately, we are not able to check whether phosphorylation of neighboring S714 is affected by the R705C mutation due to lack of a phospho-specific antibody for S714.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19236.020</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>HEK293T cells were transfected with either GFP, NLGN2+gephyrin, NLGN2R705C+gephryin, or NLGN2S714A+gephyrin.</title><p>After 2 days lysates were harvested and incubated in HA-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) to immunoprecipitate HA-tagged protein complexes.

To corroborate the key findings, some of the phenotypes (if not all) should be confirmed by independent immunocytochemical approaches.</italic> </p><p>With due respect, for multiple reasons we would argue that immunocytochemical approaches would not significantly enhance the impact of our study. First, previous work in our lab has shown that neurons expressing point mutants which affect the function of a NLGN, as determined by electrophysiological recordings, could display normal presynaptic specializations [4]. In addition, it is difficult to determine the effects our mutants have on postsynaptic specializations since there is no structural approximation of inhibitory synapse number equivalent to the spine density used for excitatory synapses. Indeed, the postsynaptic marker that is used most often for inhibitory synapses is gephyrin, which would not be ideal to use for our purposes.</p><p>References:</p><p>1) Koehnke, J. et al.
