Food odors in particular provide crucial information regarding potential foraging sites. Many behaviors occur at food sites, yet how food odors regulate such behaviors at these sites is unclear. Using <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> as an animal model, we found that males deposit the pheromone 9-tricosene upon stimulation with the food-odor apple cider vinegar. This pheromone acts as a potent aggregation pheromone and as an oviposition guidance cue for females. We use genetic, molecular, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches to show that 9-tricosene activates antennal basiconic Or7a receptors, a receptor activated by many alcohols and aldehydes such as the green leaf volatile E2-hexenal. We demonstrate that loss of Or7a positive neurons or the Or7a receptor abolishes aggregation behavior and oviposition site-selection towards 9-tricosene and E2-hexenal. 9-Tricosene thus functions via Or7a to link food-odor perception with aggregation and egg-laying decisions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08688.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08688.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08688.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals rely on their sense of smell to navigate their environments; for example, the smell of food attracts animals to particular locations. These food-rich sites are also popular places for meeting, mating, and rearing offspring. Scent molecules emitted by animals can also attract others to a particular location or affect their behaviour. These molecules are known as pheromones.</p><p>Little is understood about how cues from food and pheromones interact to influence animal behavior. Studies of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> species of fruit fly have been conducted to tease out these interactions. Fruit flies are attracted to the smell of food—particularly overripe or rotting fruit—and often congregate at a food source to mate and lay their eggs. But whether it is the food itself or other cues that trigger these behaviors is not clear.</p><p>Now, Lin et al. reveal that male fruit flies emit a pheromone in response to the smell of food. This pheromone attracts females to the food to mate and encourages the females to lay their eggs at the food-rich site. This allows the male fly to have some say as to where his offspring will be laid and also increases the chances that his offspring will survive.</p><p>Using genetic and other experiments, Lin et al. found that the pheromone is detected by a receptor on the antennae of the female flies. This stimulates a specific type of brain cell that causes the female to lay her eggs at the site where the pheromone has been deposited. A chemical released by rotting fruit also stimulates these receptors and encourages the females to congregate and lay eggs.</p><p>The body of a male fly is coated by many different pheromones, yet he deposits only a select few upon smelling a food odor. How this occurs remains to be determined, but suggests that different pheromones might be localized to different body parts. By rubbing just those parts onto their surroundings, the male might be able to deposit a specific pheromone. How food odors specifically trigger this response, or if other flying insects also deposit pheromones in response to food odors, remains to be determined.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08688.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08688.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>pheromone</kwd><kwd>oviposition</kwd><kwd>aggregation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC013070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Chun-Chieh</given-names></name><name><surname>Potter</surname><given-names>Christopher J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001391</institution-id><institution>Whitehall Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Potter</surname><given-names>Christopher J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The activation of Drosophila Or7a receptors guides aggregation and egg-laying behaviors towards both green leaf volatiles and a male-specific food-odor-induced pheromone.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals must navigate a complex and changing environment for survival and reproduction. Odorants function as molecular cues for objects in the environment, and the olfactory system translates these cues into appropriate behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laissue and Vosshall, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stensmyr et al., 2012</xref>). Living organisms are also a source of odorants, broadly termed pheromones, which play important roles in olfactory communications between different organisms of the same species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilson, 1970</xref>). Despite a wealth of knowledge of pheromone identities and their physiological functions, how environmental cues interact with pheromone signaling is not well understood.</p><p>A behavior largely mediated through pheromone signaling is population aggregation, which is hypothesized to ensure efficient use of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wyatt, 2014</xref>). Aggregation behavior may reduce interspecific competition and also be important for finding mates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hedlund et al., 1996</xref>). However, how aggregation pheromones are induced or deposited to mark certain geographical location and modulate animal behaviors remains largely unknown. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, aggregation behavior has been observed at locations that contain male flies and food substrates. The male specific pheromone cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) has been implicated as the key aggregation pheromone that attracts both males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartelt et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). cVA is manufactured and stored in an internal male organ (ejaculatory bulb) and transferred to females during copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brieger and Butterworth, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Everaerts et al., 2010</xref>), where it plays a role in inhibiting male courtship of previously mated females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ejima et al., 2007</xref>). Low levels of cVA may be present on males prior to mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartelt et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Farine et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, flies defective in sensing cVA exhibit residual aggregation behavior, suggesting the existence of an aggregation compound besides cVA from male flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> pheromones are typically cuticular hydrocarbons that are produced by specialized cells (oenocytes) in the fly abdomen and form a waxy layer on the body surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferveur, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Billeter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wyatt, 2014</xref>). Given the chemical nature of long chain hydrocarbons, most cuticular hydrocarbons are not volatile and are instead detected by gustatory contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferveur et al., 1997</xref>). For instance, 7-tricosene, an abundant male cuticular hydrocarbon, functions as an aphrodisiac for females and anti-aphrodisiac for males and is sensed via the gustatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thistle et al., 2012</xref>). Nonetheless, recent solid-phase micro-extraction gas chromatography experiments indicated the presence of volatile cuticular hydrocarbon pheromones, suggesting pheromone detection might be medicated through the olfactory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferveur et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Farine et al., 2012</xref>). All together, these studies suggest an uncharacterized cuticular hydrocarbon might function as an aggregation pheromone and possibly signal via the olfactory system.</p><p>Understanding how volatile pheromones may affect animal behavior is aided by identifying the odorant receptors activated by that pheromone. Studies using cuticular extracts or flies as odor sources identified neurons within trichoid sensilla as responding most robustly to <italic>Drosophila</italic> pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Goes van Naters and Carlson, 2007</xref>). The pheromones activating each of the four pheromone receptors (Or67d, Or65a, Or88a, Or47b) have now been identified: cVA robustly activates Or67d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ejima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kurtovic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Laughlin et al., 2008</xref>) and, to a lesser degree, Or65a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ejima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2011</xref>); and fatty acid methyl ethers methyl laurate, methyl myristate, and methyl palmitate activate Or88a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dweck et al., 2015a</xref>), whereas only methyl laurate activates Or47b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dweck et al., 2015b</xref>). In each case, the pheromone receptor is specifically tuned to respond only to the identified pheromones, and exhibit little response to a large panel of other odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dweck et al., 2015a</xref>). In addition, the pheromones activate only the identified pheromone receptors, and show little effect on other olfactory receptors.</p><p>Here, we report the finding that male flies deposit an aggregation pheromone onto their surroundings upon apple cider vinegar odor and food odor stimulation. The pheromone, 9-tricosene, is a volatile male-specific cuticular hydrocarbon and requires the olfactory, but not gustatory, system for detection. By electrophysiological and behavior studies, we identify the Or7a olfactory neurons housed in basiconic sensilla as being necessary and sufficient for 9-tricosene pheromone detection. This is surprising as Or7a, in contrast to previously characterized pheromone receptors, can be classified as a ‘generalist’ odorant receptor as it can respond to many aldehydes and alcohols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>). Behaviorally, 9-tricosene promotes aggregation and modulates female oviposition site selection- a behavior that was previously considered a female exclusive decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joseph et al., 2009</xref>). The green leaf volatile E2-hexenal, a previously characterized robust Or7a agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hallem et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>), can also guide Or7a-dependent attraction and egg-laying decisions. Three additional Or7a odor agonists could also guide positive oviposition site selection, suggesting that Or7a neuron activation might directly influence this behavior. Indeed, selective optogenetic stimulation of Or7a neurons was also sufficient to guide egg-laying site selection. Our study provides important insights into biological communication by identifying an olfactory mechanism that links together food-odor perception, male pheromone deposition, species aggregation, and female oviposition decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A novel chemosensory assay identifies a post-stimulus aggregation behavior</title><p>Traditional olfactory assays monitor either single flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</xref>) or multiple flies in small spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quinn et al., 1974</xref>) and might overlook important aggregation behaviors.

To rule out the possibility of passive pheromone deposition onto the glass plates due to crowding of many flies into a small space, flies were corralled into the odor quadrant by attraction to humidified air and monitored for post-stimulus aggregation behavior. Under these conditions, there was no detectable post-stimulus aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). All together, these data suggest that flies may deposit pheromone(s) in a specific response to the food-odor apple cider vinegar.

As a further test, we examined stimulus attraction by a prominent attractive monomolecular odorant of apple cider vinegar: ethyl acetate. Although this odorant was highly attractive, it failed to generate post-stimulus aggregation behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>).

We induced wild-type flies to deposit the food-odor induced pheromone onto the glass plate and dissolved the deposited molecules into hexane. We then painted the hexane extract onto a new glass plate in a letter ‘E’ pattern. Naïve new flies were able to trace and follow the E pattern but do not follow control hexane extracts of flies stimulated by humidified air painted in the same pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). These experiments demonstrated that an active pheromone component(s) was successfully preserved during the pheromone extraction. Behavioral results suggested the pheromone was volatile because: 1) it required the olfactory system for detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>); 2) constant air flushing reduced behavioral attraction after ∼25 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>); and 3) heating the pheromone-containing arena to 32°C to increase odor volatility eliminated post-stimulus behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Recently, four cuticular hydrocarbons were identified as male-specific volatile pheromones: 7-docosene, 5-tricosene, 23-methyldocosane, and 9-tricosene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Farine et al., 2012</xref>). To identify the nature of the pheromone(s), we performed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analyses of hexane extracts from quadrants stimulated with apple cider vinegar alone, with humidified air + flies, and with apple cider vinegar + flies. Consistent with behavioral results that cVA is unlikely to be the food-odor induced pheromone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), cVA was not detected in pheromone extracts from the glass plates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). 7-docosene and 23-methyldocosane were also not detected, while 5-tricosene was detected at trace amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The levels of 7-tricosene were increased in the experimental conditions. However, our behavioral results excluded 7-tricosene as the food-odor-induced pheromone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; also see below and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, only one other peak was significantly enriched in the experimental but not humidified air + flies control group: (Z) 9-tricosene (9-T) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Little is known regarding the function of 9-tricosene in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> besides its presence as a male-specific volatile pheromone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Everaerts et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Farine et al., 2012</xref>). To determine if 9-tricosene was attractive to <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as would be predicted for the food-odor induced aggregation pheromone, we used 9-tricosene as the stimulus in the 4-field olfactory assay. Indeed, 9-tricosene elicits attraction behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). To determine if 9-tricosene could direct aggregation behaviors, we repeated the ‘E’ experiment using 9-tricosene alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Naïve flies did trace and follow the 9-tricosene pattern, paying particular attention to the odor border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Nonetheless, the aggregation response was not identical to the full hexane extract. In particular, flies appeared to be repelled by the center of a concentrated 9-tricosene odor trail. The sensory cause of this repulsion remains to be identified, but may arise from high concentrations of 9-tricosene mediating olfactory or gustatory contact repulsion. Such highly concentrated 9-tricosene deposits are unlikely to be found after food-odor-induced pheromone deposition in the four-field olfactory assay. Overall, these data suggest that 9-tricosene under certain conditions can function as an aggregation pheromone, although additional pheromone components may contribute to the full aggregation phenotype.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08688.021</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>9-Tricosene is a food-odor induced pheromone.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of pheromone extract paint experiment.

Previously characterized volatile pheromones typically activate trichoid sensillar neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Goes van Naters and Carlson, 2007</xref>), and kairomones (odorants released by other animals or plants) typically activate intermediate sensillar neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stensmyr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dweck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ronderos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dweck et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin and Potter, 2015</xref>). Surprisingly, 9-tricosene did not stimulate these sensillar neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We found that 9-tricosene elicits rapid and robust firing patterns in the antennal basiconic ab4 sensillum, which houses two neurons (ab4A and ab4B) that express Or7a (ab4A) or Or56a receptors (ab4B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stensmyr et al., 2012</xref>). 9-Tricosene stimulates spiking of the larger amplitude neuron indicating the 9-tricosene-responsive ORNs are ab4A, which express Or7a receptors. Stimulation of ab4 sensilla by flies housed in a glass vial pre-stimulated with apple cider vinegar, compared to flies pre-stimulated with dry air alone, also led to significant increases in ab4A (Or7a) activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The identification of Or7a as a 9-tricosene pheromone receptor was surprising as, unlike previously identified pheromone receptors, it had been shown to respond to a broad range of odors, including many aldehydes and alcohols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hallem et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>). To determine if the Or7a receptor is sufficient for 9-tricosene responses, we misexpressed Or7a in an olfactory neuron that lacks an odorant receptor in ab3A sensillar neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dobritsa et al., 2003</xref>). Expression of Or7a endowed ab3A neurons the ability to respond to 9-tricosene comparable to the 9-tricosene activation pattern detected in endogenous Or7a-positive ab4 sensillum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). These data indicate that the Or7a receptor responds to 9-tricosene. This is unexpected since basiconic sensilla were traditionally considered food odor detectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Larsson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laissue and Vosshall, 2008</xref>). Both male and female ab4A/Or7a neurons responded equally to 9-tricosene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), consistent with 9-tricosene being attractive to both males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>). Or7a neurons did not respond to cVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To further verify that Or7a was responsible for the 9-tricosene responses of ab4A neurons, we generated <italic>Or7a</italic> mutants using homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Ab4 sensilla in <italic>Or7a</italic> mutants were identified based on their shape and the specific response of the ab4B neuron to geosmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stensmyr et al., 2012</xref>).

Similarly, <italic>Or7a</italic> mutants completely lacked attraction to the naturally deposited food-odor-induced pheromone and to 9-tricosene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-E</xref>). To verify that aggregation behavior is specific to 9-tricosene, we repeated the experiments using the 9-tricosene pheromone isomer 7-tricosene (7-T), which contains an identical carbon chain length to 9-tricosene but a double bond at an alternate location. Interestingly, 7-tricosene induced a neutral to slightly repulsive behavior in WT flies (AI = −0.07 ± 0.026, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).

We modified our 4-field arena by spreading a thin layer of 1% agarose onto one of the glass plates to serve as a substrate for the deposited pheromone and an appropriate medium for female egg-laying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). In order to rule out potentially confounding roles of males in this behavior, only previously mated females were assayed. Under conditions in which the food-odor-stimulated pheromone was deposited onto the agarose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A′</xref>), females laid five-fold more eggs in the pheromone quadrant. This suggests that a deposited pheromone could guide female egg-laying site selection decisions. We next generated an arena in which one quadrant contained 9-tricosene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Female flies also laid significantly more eggs in locations containing only 9-tricosene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>′).

Most undamaged plants emit undetectable levels of E2-hexenal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hatanaka and Harada, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bate and Rothstein, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Farag and Pare, 2002q</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Myung et al., 2006</xref>).

Interestingly, the ‘E’ experiments with 9-tricosene suggests that 9-tricosene may cause repulsion at high concentrations, although it remains to be determined if these high concentrations represent natural conditions. Future experiments will investigate how 9-tricosene responses are modulated by other chemicals or pheromones in guiding pheromone trailing. It also remains to be explored if different pheromone trails are deposited under different environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>9-Tricosene is an important close-range social pheromone</title><p>Food searching behaviors rely on volatile chemosensory cues, which create long-distance odor plumes or homogeneous odor clouds to guide foraging behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Budick and Dickinson, 2006</xref>). E2-hexenal, because of its high volatility, might represent such a long-distance cue for recently fallen fruit or plants. Since E2-hexenal is generated by a plant-dependent enzymatic reaction, its levels will diminish over extended time periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Farag and Pare, 2002q</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Myung et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, 9-tricosene, as a low volatility olfactory pheromone, might be ideally suited as a stable close-range olfactory marker and utilized to convey environmental conditions. This is supported by the variety of functions 9-tricosene exhibits in other species. For instance, 9-tricosene is a sex attractant for female houseflies (<italic>Musca domestica</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carlson et al., 1971</xref>) and honey bee waggle dancers (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) use a pheromone cocktail that includes 9-tricosene to communicate with nest mates about the locations of food sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thom et al., 2007</xref>). Future experiments will be required to determine the ecological niche whereby 9-tricosene signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is most prevalent.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Pheromones can activate basiconic sensillar neurons</title><p>Four basic-types of olfactory sensilla have been classified based on their size, shape, and predicted functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Couto et al., 2005</xref>). ORNs housed in basiconic sensilla tend to be strongly activated by food odors; ORNs in intermediate/trichoid sensilla tend to be activated by kairomones and pheromones; and ORNs in coeloconic sensilla are activated by amines, ammonia, water vapor and putrescine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benton et al., 2009</xref>). Only two exceptions are known—phenylacetic acid is a food odor that activates coeloconic Ir84a + neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grosjean et al., 2011</xref>); and carbon dioxide is detected by basiconic neurons expressing Gr21a/Gr63a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jones et al., 2007</xref>). 9-tricosene represents the first <italic>Drosophila</italic> cuticular hydrocarbon pheromone that, to our knowledge, is demonstrated to activate a <italic>Drosophila</italic> basiconic sensilla. Intriguingly, the same sensilla and Or7a olfactory receptor responds to the silk moth pheromone bombykol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Syed et al., 2006</xref>). It is interesting to speculate that this <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuron’s response to bombykol might represent off-target ligand specificity for 9-tricosene. Our data further suggests that activation of odorant receptors by both pheromone and plant volatiles might be more widespread than previously anticipated. Indeed, an olfactory receptor in the moth <italic>Agrotis ipsilon</italic> that was previously considered to be pheromone specific was recently found to also respond to the plant volatile heptanal, despite the plant volatile showing no structural similarity to the moth pheromone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rouyar et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Male pheromones influence a female oviposition decision</title><p>Oviposition site selection is a model system to study simple decision-making in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joseph et al., 2009</xref>). The behavior comprises three steps—an ovipositor motor program, a clean/rest period and a search-like behavior. The ovipositor motor program that leads to egg deposition is relatively short (6–7 s) as compared to clean/rest and search-like behaviors (100–130 s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Rapid egg-laying associated with an extended positional search is consistent with our observations that over long time periods there were no detectable positional preferences in the 9-tricosene pheromone quadrant even though female flies preferentially laid eggs in this quadrant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These findings also suggest that 9-tricosene might mediate two temporally distinct responses in our experimental design. A short-term aggregation behavior that lasts ∼25 min and a long-term oviposition site selection behavior that lasts for hours. A possible mechanism underlying these different behaviors could be that detection thresholds for the two behaviors are different, that is, higher concentrations of 9-tricosene triggers aggregation whereas low 9-tricosene concentrations affect oviposition.</p><p>In many insects, eggs are vulnerable and larvae have restricted motility, thus oviposition site selection is a crucial decision for progeny survival. The hypothesis of ‘mother-knows-best’ stipulates that female egg-laying decisions evolved to oviposit in places offering the best survival of offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soto et al., 2014</xref>). As expected, oviposition decisions require multiple sensory modalities, such as visual, olfactory, gustatory and proprioception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joseph et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>). Our study shows that a previously considered female-only decision can in fact be modulated by a male-deposited pheromone. Since 9-tricosene is enriched only upon food-odor stimulation, and acts to aggregate animals and increase courtship (Lin and Potter, unpublished observations), it could be a mechanism used by <italic>Drosophila</italic> males to increase the likelihood that their progeny will be laid in an optimal location. Thus, in addition to ‘mother-knows-best’, this suggest that ‘father’ may have co-opted a female’s olfactory system in order to influence an egg-laying decision for maximizing progeny survival.</p><p>The identification of Or7a as a pheromone receptor represents an intriguing puzzle. 9-Tricosene is a specific activator of Or7a, but Or7a is not activated only by 9-tricosene. How can a specific pheromone response be mediated by a ‘generalist’ odorant receptor? Our behavioral experiments suggest a strong positive correlation with the specificity of Or7a activation and oviposition-guidance. This suggests that activation of the Or7a olfactory receptor neuron can strongly influence egg-laying decisions. 9-Tricosense may therefore have a specific influence on oviposition decisions due to its specific activation of Or7a. Or7a olfactory neurons join a growing list of olfactory neurons found to mediate specific olfactory behaviors like oviposition-site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dweck et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2015b</xref>), aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stensmyr et al., 2012</xref>), courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kurtovic et al., 2007</xref>), and attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</xref>). Odorants besides 9-tricosene that stimulate Or7a neurons will activate additional olfactory receptor neurons that may function to mask or modulate Or7a-mediated egg-laying behaviors. This likely reflects how olfactory systems function to make sense of a complex environment, by assigning biological weights and values to different olfactory neuron activity patterns that together influence a behavioral choice.</p><p>Food odors and pheromone signals have been shown to project to non-overlapping divisions in higher brain regions in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, suggesting that distinct brain divisions may be involved in mediating different biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>). Might these disparate olfactory signals for oviposition decision converge in the female brain? ORNs expressing the same ORs converge onto the same glomeruli and synapse with second order projection neurons, which relay the olfactory information to higher brain regions (mushroom body calyx and lateral horn) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>). We demonstrate that basiconic Or7a neurons are responsible for 9-tricosene and E2-hexenal guided oviposition decisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figure 6C,D,7C,7D</xref>). Recently, it was found that flies preferred citrus fruit as oviposition substrates as detected by Or19a + olfactory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dweck et al., 2013</xref>), and also preferred to oviposit on substrates containing ethylphenols as detected by Or71a + olfactory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dweck et al., 2015b</xref>). Interestingly, the Or7a DL5, Or19a DC1, and Or71a VC2 projection neurons share highly similar axonal projection patterns in the lateral horn that are distinct from previously described food and pheromone regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ronderos et al., 2014</xref>).

A 627 nm LED light source (1-up LED Lighting Kit, PART #: ALK-1UP-EH-KIT; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://LEDSupply.Com">LEDSupply.Com</ext-link>) was placed directly beneath the glass 3-well egg-laying chamber with a white acrylic diffuser in between (Cat# 8505K11, McMaster-Carr). The LED was powered and controlled by an Arduino Uno to activate <italic>UAS-CsChrimson</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) (Bloomington Stock # 55,135). The power supplied to the LED by the Arduino was set to 2 V with light on for 8 ms and off for 17 ms by using a custom Arduino program. The red light stimulus was supplied continuously throughout the 23 hr egg-laying assay. The Arduino program is available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Source code 1</xref>.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank R.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor (Mani Ramaswami), and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In “Food odors trigger <italic>Drosophila</italic> males to deposit a pheromone that guides aggregation and female oviposition decisions,” Lin et al. report that food odors trigger male fruit flies to deposit an aggregation pheromone that also influences female oviposition preference. This phenomenon is in itself novel and interesting. Previous work on aggregation and oviposition has focused on how females are attracted by other females (leading to oviposition in patches, which may provide the progeny an advantage as they can better cope with competition from fungi and other fly species). This work is the first of its kind to show that males can drive female aggregation.</p><p>Using elegant multidisciplinary approaches, including behavioral assays, GCMS chemical analysis, electrophysiological recording and fly genetics, the authors identified 9-tricosene as a likely aggregation pheromone released by male flies in response to food odors and Or7a as the olfactory receptor that detects the pheromone. In support of this, the authors demonstrate that the attractive factor can be extracted in hexane and they postulate that the main factor is 9-tricosene on the basis of a GC/MS analysis. They demonstrate then that 9-tricosene (9-T) is detected by sensilla expressing Or7a. Ablating neurons expressing Or7a suppresses the attraction induced by 9-T (delivered as an odorant) as well as oviposition induction. Finally, they compare the effects of 9-T and E2-hexenal since E2-hexenal also activates Or7a.</p><p>Their findings demonstrate an intricate relationship between food odor stimulation and a cascade of behavioral responses that are beneficial to the survival of the species. This work is novel, interesting and important. The data and science are of high quality and the conclusions, if clearly established, will be of great interest to a broad range of scientists.</p><p>However, there are several issues that the authors absolutely need to address in a revised manuscript. One overriding issue and suggestion is to simplify the manuscript (potentially with a focus on the role of 9-T) as, in current form, it is unnecessarily long, convoluted and redundant, and leaves open too many questions. Another is that it suffers from inconsistent assays (which need to be addressed experimentally) as well as an unnecessarily selective presentation and discussion of their findings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The biological activities found with the surface extracts are not strictly reproduced by 9-T. Thus other chemicals may be involved. Actually, the chemical analysis made by the authors shows that the extracts contain a higher proportion of 7-tricosene (7-T). The role of 7-T is not at all discussed nor tested leaving open the possibility that it is the mixture 7-T + 9-T (and possibly other molecules at a lower concentration) that are needed to recapitulate the biological effect of the whole extract. While 9-T seems to have an effect as an odorant, the nice “E” effect of the biological extract may need a contact chemical like 7-T or a chemical not detected through their chemical analysis.</p><p>2) On this note, the original behavior involved odorants (and tastants, which are argued against by the <italic>poxn</italic> experiments) left over a surface by males, while in subsequent tests using 9-T, the authors did not “paint” the surface with 9-T, but applied it as a volatile. These are different assays. Their “E” experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>) is very nice. The authors should duplicate it with 9-T. if this does not work then the authors should nevertheless present these negative data and intellectually engage with it in a revised discussion.</p><p>3) As reported by Hallem and Carlson, 2006, Or7a is one of the most broadly tuned odorant receptors. It responds strongly to many odorants, including several alcohols and aldehydes. Or7a even responds to bombykol, a moth sex pheromone (Syed et al., PNAS, 2006). As it is, the authors present their findings as if Or7a responds strongly only to E2-hexenal and 9-tricosene. There are three suggestions for improvement here:</p><p>A) Current data show that Or7a neurons are necessary. Additional experiments should ask if they are sufficient.</p><p>B) The authors should consider testing the behavioral effect of a number of different Or7a ligands to see whether 9-T is indeed a special, biologically relevant ligand for this behavior.</p><p>C) A revised discussion should clearly acknowledge and integrate previous findings. It is puzzling that a pheromone is detected by a generalist Or. However, even if the authors do not have a good answer, it is still a surprise and therefore an issue that should be highlighted so that all olfactory biologists think about it.</p><p>4) The authors emphasize that only “food odors or complex odors” could trigger the deposition of 9-tricosene. However, they did not provide sufficient experimental support to define the chemical or biological meaning of “complex food odors”. Which types of ORNs respond to the complex food odors? How many different types of ORNs are required to trigger the release of 9-tricosene? These are not trivial questions and deserve to be addressed fully in a separate study. The current manuscript will benefit significantly if the authors could remove some panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and combine these two figures to focus on the key finding that a food odor (ACV) triggers the release of an aggregation pheromone from male flies.</p><p>5) Similarly distracting is the molecular evolution analysis shown in Figure 8. They conclude their study by looking at the evolution rate of olfactory receptors in 9 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species and find that <italic>Or7a</italic> is a gene that underwent many amino acid substitutions, suggesting that this receptor is one of the most variable amongst different species and thus one of the least conserved.</p><p>The authors seem to imply that 9-tricosene/Or7a interaction is unique for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. However, without testing whether 9-tricosene also activates ab4A or triggers similar aggregation or oviposition behavior in other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, their molecular evolution analysis alone is insufficient and their interpretation appears forced. If the authors feel very strongly about making this point in the current study, they will need to conduct similar electrophysiological and behavioral experiments in other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. Otherwise, it may help to streamline the work by removing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled “Food odors trigger <italic>Drosophila</italic> males to deposit a pheromone that guides aggregation and female oviposition decisions” for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>.

While 9-T seems to have an effect as an odorant, the nice “E” effect of the biological extract may need a contact chemical like 7-T or a chemical not detected through their chemical analysis.</italic></p><p>In the original manuscript, we did check for a potential involvement of 7-tricosene in the aggregation phenotype (revised manuscript subsection “Detection of the Aggregation Pheromone Requires Orco”). We found that mutants of <italic>pickpocket23</italic> (the primary 7-tricosene receptor) or <italic>poxn</italic> (which converts gustatory sensory neurons to mechanosensory neurons) retained wild-type responses to the aggregation pheromone (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, the egg-laying preference phenotype of the naturally deposited pheromone is recapitulated by 9-tricosene but not by 7-tricosene (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B’ and 6F</xref>). This strongly suggests that 7-tricosene, and/or other pheromones that primarily stimulate gustatory neurons, are not required for the aggregation pheromone response or oviposition guidance.</p><p><italic>2) On this note, the original behavior involved odorants (and tastants, which are argued against by the</italic> poxn <italic>experiments) left over a surface by males, while in subsequent tests using 9-T, the authors did not “paint” the surface with 9-T, but applied it as a volatile. These are different assays. Their “E” experiment (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A, B</italic></xref><italic>) is very nice. The authors should duplicate it with 9-T. if this does not work then the authors should nevertheless present these negative data and intellectually engage with it in a revised discussion.</italic></p><p>We have duplicated the “E” experiment using 9-tricosene, and the results are now included as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>. We found that flies do track and aggregate to 9-tricosene deposits, but that the aggregation phenotype is not identical to the full aggregation pheromone (compared <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This suggests that other (likely olfactory) components may modulate the full aggregation phenotype, but that 9-tricosene can function as an aggregation molecule.</p><p><italic>3) As reported by Hallem and Carlson, 2006, Or7a is one of the most broadly tuned odorant receptors. It responds strongly to many odorants, including several alcohols and aldehydes. Or7a even responds to bombykol, a moth sex pheromone (Syed et al., PNAS, 2006). As it is, the authors present their findings as if Or7a responds strongly only to E2-hexenal and 9-tricosene. There are three suggestions for improvement here:</italic></p><p><italic>A) Current data show that Or7a neurons are necessary. Additional experiments should ask if they are sufficient.</italic></p><p>To determine if activation of Or7a neurons are sufficient to guide oviposition-site selection preferences, we took an optogenetics approach to activate Or7a neurons in the presence of red light (wavelength 627 nm; genotype: <italic>Or7a-GAL4; UAS-CsChrimson</italic>). Flies require feeding of all-trans-retinal (ATR) for optogenetic activation of channel rhodopsins, and so we compared the same genotype of flies that were, or were not, fed ATR. We found that activation of Or7a neurons could lead to a significant increase in egg-laying preference towards substrates illuminated by the stimulating red light. The significance of this experiment is reduced by a wide range of behaviors of the -ATR control flies to the red-light source, which might arise from experimental conditions outside our control. Nonetheless, these results do suggest that activation of Or7a neurons is sufficient to drive oviposition-site selection. Since these results essentially confirm a chemogenetics approach to Or7a activation described below, we have included the optogenetics experiments as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>B) The authors should consider testing the behavioral effect of a number of different Or7a ligands to see whether 9-T is indeed a special, biologically relevant ligand for this behavior.</italic></p><p>We have now examined the egg-laying behavioral effect to 3 additional Or7a ligands (benzaldeyde, 1-butanol, 1-propanol), as well as 3 odorants that do not activate Or7a (hexyl butyrate, pentanoic acid, ethyl lactate). Pentanoic acid and hexyl butyrate were selected because they specifically activate Ors that benzaldehyde and 1-butanol also activate: Or67a and Or35a. We found that all Or7a ligands could, to differing degrees, induce positive egg-laying preferences. In contrast, all non-Or7a ligands showed neutral or negative egg-laying preferences. Interestingly, odorants that more selectively activated Or7a (e.g., 1-propanol) showed the greatest preference in egg-laying assays. These results suggest that activation of Or7a neurons can strongly influence positive egg-laying site preferences. 9-tricosene, as a selective activator of Or7a neurons, can thereby drive strong egg-laying preferences. These new results are presented in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>C) A revised discussion should clearly acknowledge and integrate previous findings. It is puzzling that a pheromone is detected by a generalist Or. However, even if the authors do not have a good answer, it is still a surprise and therefore an issue that should be highlighted so that all olfactory biologists think about it.</italic></p><p>We have now included additional discussion about this puzzling finding in the revised manuscript (subsection “Male Pheromones Influence a Female Oviposition Decision”). We hypothesize that 9-tricosene, since it is a selective activator of Or7a neurons, can drive a specific behavior. Other odorants that activate Or7a will also activate other odorant receptors, which will modulate or mask the behaviors driven by Or7a neurons. This might be useful to the fly in selecting oviposition sites based on different environmental and olfactory conditions.</p><p><italic>4) The authors emphasize that only “food odors or complex odors” could trigger the deposition of 9-tricosene. However, they did not provide sufficient experimental support to define the chemical or biological meaning of “complex food odors”. Which types of ORNs respond to the complex food odors? How many different types of ORNs are required to trigger the release of 9-tricosene? These are not trivial questions and deserve to be addressed fully in a separate study.

We have removed from the manuscript results and discussion relating to investigating how food-odors might trigger pheromone deposition.

I would like to first emphasize that the “E” pattern is not the primary olfactory aggregation assay we used for our aggregation experiments. The main aggregation phenotype, in which all olfactory assays were conducted, is in the 4-field arena. In the 4-field assay, we did utilize 'taste' mutants to determine the role of these mutants in aggregation to the full pheromone(s) deposited by the flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), as well as to 9-tricosene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These experiments showed that taste was not required for aggregation to the pheromone. The “E” trail assay was used mainly to verify that our hexane extracts contained functional aggregation molecules as inputs for GC-MS analyses. As such, pipetting 9-tricosene directly onto the arena in such a fashion may not closely mimic the aggregation 4-field assay in which 9-tricosene is deposited over a large surface area. Furthermore, additional focus on the “E” experiments may distract readers from the major findings of the study which demonstrate that an apple-cider vinegar odor-induced pheromone affects female oviposition decisions via Or7a receptors. For these reasons, we are hesitant to continue with technically challenging and extensive experiments on the 9-tricosene “E” pattern, preferring to instead explore these questions more rigorously and extensively in a separate study. At this point, we prefer to modify the text to address these concerns, and raise the possibility that 9-tricosene might mediate olfactory or gustatory avoidance at high concentrations.</p><p>We have highlighted these points more clearly in the revised manuscript (please see the Results subsection “9-Tricosene is a Food-Odor Induced Aggregation Pheromone”). We highlight the differences between the full hexane extract and the 9-tricosene trail. We mention that the sensory (olfactory or gustatory) cause for these differences are currently unknown, but might arise from high concentrations of 9-tricosene. We mention that these high concentrations of 9-tricosene, however, are unlikely to be found in the 4-field aggregation assays, which might suggest why such repulsion was not found in our other behavioral experiments with 9-tricosene.</p><p>We now extend the discussion of pheromone trails, which allows us to again highlight the 9-tricosene “E” observations. We mention that the cause of these differences will require future investigation, in particular how other pheromones or odorants may modulate the behavioral responses mediated by 9-tricosene alone. We again caution, however, that it remains to be determined if the high 9-tricosene concentrations causing repulsion would be found naturally in a pheromone trail.</p><p>We mention now explicitly in the figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> that the 9-tricosene pattern appears different from the full hexane extract pattern, and briefly mention potential causes for these differences.</p><p><italic>2) The discussion on the role of the generalist Or7a could be improved and made more balanced.</italic></p><p>We have revised the manuscript to better introduce and discuss the role of Or7a as a generalist odorant receptor, and present a more balanced view. In particular:</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the notion that Or7a is activated by many other odorants. (Space limitations to the abstract restricted more extensive changes).</p><p>Introduction: We introduce more clearly what was known about pheromone receptors, and the notion that they are narrowly tuned. This is raised to better contrast Or7a’s broader tuning, and surprise as a pheromone receptor. In addition, our summary introductory paragraph now emphasizes that Or7a was previously found to be a generalist, in contrast to previously identified pheromone receptors.</p><p>Results, subsection “The Or7a Receptor is Necessary and Sufficient for 9-tricosene Activation”: When Or7a is identified as the receptor responding to 9-tricosene, we now mention why this was surprising in terms of what was previously known about pheromone receptors.</p><p>Discussion: In the general summary paragraph, we now re-iterate the surprising finding that the pheromone 9-tricosone functions via a generalist odorant receptor. We also begin the discussion on how a generalist odorant receptor may mediate a specific pheromone response.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> legend: We now mention that Or7a activation by other odorants may guide similar behaviors as those mediated by 9-tricosene.</p></body></sub-article></article>
