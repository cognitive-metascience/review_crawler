Cdc42 and its effector Gic1 are involved in septin recruitment, ring formation and dissociation. The regulatory mechanisms behind these processes are not well understood. Here, we have used electron microscopy and cryo electron tomography to elucidate the structural basis of the Gic1-septin and Gic1-Cdc42-septin interaction. We show that Gic1 acts as a scaffolding protein for septin filaments forming long and flexible filament cables. Cdc42 in its GTP-form binds to Gic1, which ultimately leads to the dissociation of Gic1 from the filament cables. Surprisingly, Cdc42-GDP is not inactive, but in the absence of Gic1 directly interacts with septin filaments resulting in their disassembly. We suggest that this unanticipated dual function of Cdc42 is crucial for the cell cycle. Based on our results we propose a novel regulatory mechanism for septin filament formation and dissociation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01085.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01085.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01085.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Septins are proteins that provide structural support for cells as they divide. Yeast cells are known to have seven types of septins, which have been widely studied, and 13 different septins have been identified in human cells, although they all seem similar to those found in yeast. Mutations in the genes that carry the genetic code for septins lead to a range of debilitating conditions in humans, including neurodegenerative diseases and male infertility.</p><p>An enzyme called Cdc42 is thought to have a key role in the formation of ring-like structures by septins before a cell divides, and in the subsequent dismantling of these rings after the cell has divided. A pair of proteins, called Gic1 and Gic2, is known to be critical for the formation of the septin rings, but the details of the interactions between these two proteins, Cdc42 and the septins are sketchy.</p><p>Now Sadian et al. have used two imaging approaches—electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography—to scrutinise the role of Gic1 in greater detail in yeast cells. Gic1 interacts with specific subunits within adjacent septins, and these interactions have the effect of crosslinking the septins and stabilizing them in long filaments. However, high concentrations of the enzyme Cdc42 block the interaction between the Gic1 proteins and the subunits, causing the filaments to be dismantled. A future challenge will be to elucidate the interaction of these proteins in molecular detail using other techniques, in particular X-ray crystallography.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01085.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01085.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>septin</kwd><kwd>Cdc42</kwd><kwd>Gic1</kwd><kwd>filament</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RA 1781/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raunser</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sadian</surname><given-names>Yashar</given-names></name><name><surname>Gatsogiannis</surname><given-names>Christos</given-names></name><name><surname>Hofnagel</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name><name><surname>Goody</surname><given-names>Roger S</given-names></name><name><surname>Raunser</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>VEGA (Vedecká Grantová Agentúra, Ministerstva školstva Slovenskej republiky)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2/0050/11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patasi</surname><given-names>Csilla</given-names></name><name><surname>Farkašovský</surname><given-names>Marian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Imaging with electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography reveals that competition between Cdc42 and Gic1 for the same subunit within septins controls the formation and breakdown of septin filaments.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Septins are ubiquitous guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that have been implicated in many cellular processes such as cytokinesis, spindle positioning, morphogenesis, and exocytosis, and their mutation or overexpression is associated with neoplasia, neurodegenerative diseases and male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hall and Russell, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In yeast, four essential septins (Cdc3, Cdc10, Cdc11 and Cdc12) are found at the bud neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haarer and Pringle, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ford and Pringle, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 1991</xref>), where they form an ordered ring composed of membrane-adjacent filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartwell, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byers and Goetsch, 1976</xref>). In total seven different septins were identified in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, where they form filaments of variable size and combinations. Whereas the human genome encodes thirteen septins, <italic>C. elegans</italic> has only two and plants are devoid of septin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hall and Russell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ihara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kinoshita, 2006</xref>). Despite the genetic variability, all septins share defined structural features. A recent crystallographic study on the human SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7 complex has shed light on the structural organization of human septins at the atomic level, which differs profoundly from that of other cytoskeletal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sirajuddin et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2009</xref>). Septins interact via their central guanine nucleotide-binding domains (G-domains) and/or the N- and C-terminal extensions forming oligomers and non-helical filaments.</p><p>The basic structural unit of the yeast septin complex is an octamer, composed of four subunits, namely Cdc10, Cdc3, Cdc12 and Cdc11, arranged into two tetramers with two-fold rotational symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bertin et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Cdc42 has been identified as a central regulator of septin ring assembly and disassembly during different stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gladfelter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kozminski et al., 2003</xref>). Mutations that affect the GTPase activity of Cdc42 impair the initial assembly of septin rings, while after bud emergence, septin rings are maintained independently of Ccd42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gladfelter et al., 2002</xref>). It was also reported that the activity of Cdc42’s guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and GTPase activating protein (GAP) are required for proper septin ring formation and localization, implying that one or more cycle(s) of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis are required for Cdc42 at the beginning of budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gladfelter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caviston et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Among the essential effectors of Cdc42 in yeast are the two structurally homologous proteins Gic1 and Gic2, which are functional homologues of the human Borg protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Joberty et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sheffield et al., 2003</xref>). It has been shown that Gic1 and Gic2 play an essential and overlapping role in cytoskeletal polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hall and Russell, 2004</xref>) and septin recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iwase et al., 2006</xref>). However, the complex interplay between Cdc42, Gic1 and septins at the molecular level and its role during the cell cycle is not yet understood.</p><p>In this study, we have used electron microscopy and cryo electron tomography (cryo-ET) to describe the structural basis for the direct interaction of Gic1 and Cdc42 with septin filaments. Gic1 interacts with Cdc10 subunits of adjacent septin filaments and cross-links them. Because of this scaffolding, septin filaments are stabilized and form long railroad-like ordered filament cables. Cdc42-GTP directly binds to Gic1 and at higher concentrations inhibits the Gic1 interaction with Cdc10, resulting in the dissociation of the Gic1-septin complex. In its GDP-state, however, in absence of Gic1 Cdc42 interacts directly with Cdc10 and thereby mechanically disassembles septin filaments. Gic1 and Cdc42-GDP therefore compete for the same septin subunit. Finally, based on our results we propose a novel regulatory mechanism for septin ring formation and dissociation involving Cdc42 and Gic1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>EGFP-labeled septins without Gic1 (Cdc3-EGFP, Cdc10, Cdc11 and Cdc12) form relatively short and straight filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, when Gic1 is added during septin polymerization, long filaments that cluster together in large bundles are formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Studying the same but not EGFP-labeled samples using electron microscopy (EM), we found that in contrast to blank septin polymers that form long, often pairwise arranged filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), Gic1-septin complexes display a regular railroad-like structure with many cross-linked filaments bundled together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Gic1 forms cross-bridges between at least two filaments, keeping them at a distance of about 20 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). At each cross-bridge, Gic1 binds to at least two adjacent septin subunits on each filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), leaving a gap of six free subunits between individual Gic1 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The structure of Gic1 is not well defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) indicating that Gic1 is flexible and oriented differently at each cross-bridge.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01085.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Gic1 scaffolds septin filaments resulting in long and flexible filament cables.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Yeast septin octamers containing Cdc3-EGFP polymerized by dialysis alone (<bold>A</bold>) or together with Gic1 (<bold>B</bold>) and imaged using fluorescence microscopy.

Therefore, we performed additional experiments to further corroborate our findings and prepared septin-Gic1 complexes devoid of either Cdc10 or Cdc11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–I</xref>).</p><p>As expected from the results of antibody labeling, septin-Cdc10Δ, which formed short filaments, did not bind to Gic1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). Septin-Cdc11Δ, however, which in accordance with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertin et al., 2010</xref>) does not polymerize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) produced a similar track-like structure as the wildtype when Gic1 was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Thus, addition of Gic1 resulted not only in the binding of the protein to the septin complex but also induced septin polymerization. We then performed single particle analysis (SPA) of the septin filaments and observed that only four subunits were located between Gic1 cross-bridges of Cdc11Δ filaments, ruling out an interaction with Cdc12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–I</xref>).</p><p>In addition, yeast two-hybrid studies supported our in vitro data, showing that Gic1 only interacts with Cdc10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Notably, Cdc10 is mainly responsible for the specific interaction of septin filaments with PIP2, localizing them to membranes and promoting filament polymerization and organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertin et al., 2010</xref>). For Gic2, which is a homologue of Gic1, a direct interaction through its polybasic region with PIP2 was also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Orlando et al., 2008</xref>). Together with our findings, this suggests that the organization and polymerization of septin filaments is controlled by the interaction of Gics with Cdc10 and the interaction of both proteins with PIP2.</p><p>Bertin et al. reported that septin filaments are cross-linked by overlapping C-terminal extensions of Cdc3 and Cdc12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bertin et al., 2008</xref>). Depending on the stain thickness we also observed these thin cross-links between bare septin filaments. However, in septin-Gic1 complexes, the large Gic1 cross-bridges are very prominent, causing stain to accumulate between the Gic1 cross-bridges. This makes it impossible to visualize the thin coiled-coils between Cdc3 and Cdc12, although they are probably still there.</p><p>To study the native three-dimensional structure of the filaments, we vitrified septin-Gic1 complexes and determined their structure using cryo electron tomography (cryo-ET) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1 media2 media3 media4">Videos 1–4</xref>). We observed that Gic1, instead of cross-bridging only two filaments, simultaneously interacted with up to six septin polymers, forming long filament cables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>). The organization of these cables is such that Gic1 forms a central scaffold to which septin filaments attach. Remarkably, individual septin filaments do not start at the same position and run along in parallel rigid lines. The septin-Gic1 cables are rather composed of many filaments of variable lengths that start at random positions, sometimes bypassing a Gic1 cross-bridge or changing place with another filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–I</xref>). Filaments are often only attached to adjacent filaments for several nanometers. This gives the septin-Gic1 cables a certain flexibility that on the one hand allows them to bend and adjust to membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). On the other hand it enables the interaction between cables, resulting in mesh-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Because of the limited resolution of the reconstructions, the additional thin connections described by Bertin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bertin et al., 2008</xref>) are not visible.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01085.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cryo-ET of the septin-Gic1 complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Central slice of a cryo electron tomogram (for full tomogram see <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1 media2 media3">Videos 1–3</xref>).

Gic1, which based on its sequence has a molecular weight of 23 kDa (Gic1(104-314)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), elutes at about 49 kDa from a gel filtration column corresponding roughly to a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In a typical Gic1 cross-bridge up to 12 Cdc10 subunits are involved (two per filament) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). If we assume that each of them binds independently to a Gic1 dimer, we would expect that 12 Gic1 dimers assemble into a large cross-bridge of 600 kDa. Although we cannot exclude that the density corresponding to Gic1 appears more spread out due to missing wedge artifacts in our tomograms, the average large volume of the Gic1 density in the electron tomograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–I</xref>) indicates that it must contain multiple Gic1 molecules. In addition, the heterogeneity of the Gic1 cross-bridges suggests that the number of Gic1 molecules varies between cross-bridges.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01085.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Purification of Gic1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SDS-PAGE of the Gic1(104-314) purification.

Although Cdc42 in its GTP-state bound to septin filaments, no regular pattern as in the case of Gic1 was observed, indicating non-specific interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Surprisingly, Cdc42-GDP bound more specifically to septin filaments, and formed, in contrast to Cdc42-GppNHp, railroad track-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Even more surprising was that Cdc42-GDP completely dissociated septin filaments at higher concentrations in less than an hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9 fig10">Figures 9C and 10</xref>). We then analyzed the oligomers by size-exclusion chromatography, which showed that Cdc42-GDP binds to septin complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). SPA of the dissociated septins clearly identified either octamers with an extra density at their ends (90%) or hexamers without additional density (10%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E–F</xref>). Cdc3 sits at the ends of the hexamers, and at the second outer position of the octamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G–H</xref>). Considering the sequential order of septin oligomers, this indicates that Cdc42-GDP directly binds to Cdc10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I</xref>), which is also the binding partner of Gic1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), thereby causing dissociation of the filaments. Consequently, the resulting septin octamers differ from the ones observed under high-salt conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Instead of Cdc11, which is now in the center, Cdc10 forms the cap of the octamers at both ends. In addition, binding of Cdc42-GDP to Cdc10 probably influences its interaction with Cdc3 at the G interface resulting in the formation of Cdc42-GDP-Cdc10 dimers and hexameric (Cdc3-Cdc12-Cdc11) complexes. A direct interaction of a protein with Cdc42-GDP is unusual, since in most reported cases Cdc42, like other small G proteins, binds to its effectors in its active, that is GTP-bound state. However, also other proteins such as Msb3 and Msb4, which are GAP proteins, that are, like Gic1, involved in cell polarization, were shown to directly interact with Cdc42-GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tcheperegine et al., 2005</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01085.016</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Cdc42-GDP binds specifically to Cdc10 and dissociates septin filaments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative EM image of negatively stained septin complexes incubated with Cdc42-GppNHp.

Examining the Cdc10-Cdc10 interface, which is an N/C interface, we found that the N-terminal region is the least conserved, and would therefore present an ideal site for specific Cdc42-GDP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A–B</xref>). We deleted the N-terminal 29 residues of Cdc10 and produced complexes whose Cdc10 was replaced by Cdc10(30-322). It was previously shown that deletion of the N-terminal residues of Cdc10 results in non-polymerizing septin complexes forming tetramers and inside-out octamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertin et al., 2010</xref>). We analyzed the particles by EM and SPA, which showed that most of the complexes were indeed tetramers or octamers, and that the polymerization of the complexes was clearly impaired, as we did not observe filaments at low-salt conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A–C</xref>). We then incubated the oligomers with high concentrations of Cdc42-GDP and looked for additional densities corresponding to Cdc42-GDP by EM and SPA.

Gel filtration experiments corroborated this result and showed that indeed Cdc42-GDP does not bind to Cdc10(30-322) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13G</xref>).

This was surprising, since Gic1 binds and crosslinks Cdc10 proteins while high salt weakens the interaction at the N/C-interface between two Cdc11 proteins. Thus, the stabilizing effect of Gic1 must be stronger than the weakening effect of high salt. We confirmed this observation by performing the inverse experiment, that is septin-Gic1 complexes were dialyzed against a high-salt buffer. As expected, septin-Gic1 complexes were stable and did not dissociate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14E–F</xref>). Even septin complexes completely lacking Cdc11, which do not polymerize at low-salt conditions, form filaments when Gic1 is added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that Gic1 not only scaffolds septin filaments, but also increases their stability.</p><p>We then asked whether Gic1 would also stabilize septin filaments whose assembly is weakened at the Cdc10-Cdc10 instead of the Cdc11-Cdc11 interface.

At the bud site Cdc42 interacts with its GEF Cdc24, which catalyzes the exchange of its nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16B</xref>). As a result, Cdc42 dissociates from the septin complexes, which in turn polymerize. Besides activating many other proteins involved in septin recruitment and ring formation Cdc42-GTP recruits its effector Gic1 to the bud site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16C</xref>). Gic1, which has a high affinity for Cdc10, binds, scaffolds and stabilizes septin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16D</xref>). Gic1-Cdc42-GTP-septin cables generated in this manner form a ring at the bud neck. Since our data show that the process of Gic1-septin cable formation does not necessarily require Cdc42-GTP, we propose that upon GAP-supported GTP hydrolysis, Cdc42-GDP, which has a much lower affinity to Gic1 than Cdc42-GTP, dissociates from the Gic1-septin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16E</xref>) and recruits more septin octamers to the bud site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16F</xref>).<fig id="fig16" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01085.023</object-id><label>Figure 16.</label><caption><title>Model for septin recruitment, ring formation and disassembly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cdc42-GDP recruits septin complexes to the bud site.

As a result, Cdc42-GTP binds to Gic1-septin complexes and competes with Cdc10 for Gic1, which finally results in the disassembly of the complex and thereby septin ring rearrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16G</xref>). Gic1 will then be either degraded or relocated. After GTP hydrolysis, Cdc42-GDP in the absence of Gic1 specifically binds to septin filaments and dissociates them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16H</xref>). Thus, septins can be reassembled and reused for the next cycle, as was observed by McMurray and Thorner when tracking labeled septins through several cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McMurray and Thorner, 2009</xref>). The model elegantly explains the cycles of GTP loading and hydrolysis by Cdc42 that were observed by Gladfelter et al. during budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gladfelter et al., 2002</xref>). In conclusion, Gic1 and Cdc42 in combination with many other factors, such as the nucleotide state of septins, specific interaction with lipids and protein posttranslational modifications regulate septin recruitment, ring formation and disassembly. Most importantly, Cdc42 does not only act as a regulator, but seems to be also involved in septin recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>Construction of yeast two-hybrid plasmids of septins were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farkasovsky et al., 2005</xref>).

However, these initial attempts revealed bending as a characteristic feature of the septin-Gic1 cables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>On grids with relatively thick ice we observed filaments, which changed their orientation and ran parallel to the beam direction at 0° tilt. In some cases, short cables were completely embedded in ice in a top view orientation (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2 media3">Video 2 and 3</xref>). Since the missing wedge artifact in this geometry causes only the elongation of the septin filaments, their exact tracing was straightforward, but the cables were often too short. We therefore scanned thousands of positions in several grids for both samples (septin-Gic1 and septin-Gic1-Cdc42-GppNHp) to find complexes of sufficient length and recorded two tomograms of such regions of septin-Gic1 and three tomograms of septin-Gic-Cdc42-GppNHp complexes. Each tomogram contained 7–10 septin-Gic1 or septin-Gic1-Cdc42-GppNHp cables running parallel to the beam at 0° tilt. We extracted all separate cables as subtomograms and processed them as described above. The quality of these raw subtomograms was extremely good and details that would otherwise require the technique of subtomogram averaging (such as number and shape of filaments, or interaction between filaments) were clearly discernable even without further processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18A–B</xref>).<fig id="fig18" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01085.025</object-id><label>Figure 18.</label><caption><title>Processing of subtomograms.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Top and side view of a representative raw subtomogram filtered to 30 Å, respectively.

In order to form the septin-Gic1 complexes, 1.5 µM of Gic1 was included during dialysis. Since Gic1 forms dimers and septin octamers contain two Cdc10 subunits, the molar ratio (Cdc10:Gic1) is 1.25:1. For antibody decoration, 5 μl of polyclonal antibodies against Cdc11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and Cdc3 (a gift from Michael Knop, DKFZ-ZMBH, Heidelberg, Germany) (diluted 1:100) were added to 20 μl of a sample containing either septin-Gic1 complex or the septin octamers (generated by GTP, Cdc42-GDP or both) and incubated overnight at 4°C to allow efficient binding.</p><p>In order to evaluate the effect of Cdc42 on septin complexes, 0.1 μM of septin octamers and 0.5 μM of Gic1 were used.

Your article has been favorably evaluated (subject to revisions outlined below) by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this in vitro study with recombinant proteins, the role of the guanine nucleotide binding protein Cdc42 and the regulator Gic1-septin filament formation and dissociation is elucidated. Using a combination of negative stain electron microscopy and cryo electron tomography, along with manipulations of the septin complex or the nucleotide state of Cdc42, a dual role of Cdc42 was discovered. In the GTP-state, Cdc42 leads to disassembly of the Gic1-septin complex, whereas in the GDP-state, Cdc42 leads to further disassembly of the septin complex in absence of Gic1. Moreover, the cryo EM reconstructions show that Gic1 can bind to multiple septin filaments in a heterogeneous fashion, accounting for flexibility of septin filaments during cell division and cytokinesis.</p><p>Previous studies have linked Gic1/2 and Cdc42 nucleotide cycling to septin assembly in vivo but really how Cdc42 and its myriad of effectors actually lead to septin ring and collar formation remain mysterious. While Gic1/2 function has been genetically linked to septin organization and shown to physically associate with septin complexes, precisely what the Cdc42 effector does to regulate septins is unknown. Similarly, for Cdc42 itself, which is essential for septin assembly, it has not been determined if Cdc42 can bind septins and directly promotes filament assembly, filament bundling and/or if it simply indirectly recruits septins to the bud site.</p><p>The electron micrographs are striking and represent some of the most detailed glimpses at purified septins presented to date. However, there are significant concerns about the quality and resolution of the EM tomograms that need to be addressed, along with the other concerns outlined below, before a decision can be made.</p><p>Overall, the data indicate that 1) Gic1 can bundle septins through specific interactions at Cdc10, 2) Cdc42-GDP can bind septin octamers (through a surprisingly differently-ordered octamer than what has been shown for pure septin complex), 3) Cdc42-GTP changes how Gic1 associates with septin filaments and may itself associate with Gic1 bound to filaments, 4) high concentrations of Cdc42-GTP can lead to Gic1 dissociation for filaments and therefore ultimately destabilize the filaments. These are intriguing findings and do represent the first clean reconstitution of regulated septin assembly. Thus, the studies in this work should stimulate future studies to confirm that this is what is happening in vivo.</p><p>Required revisions:</p><p>1) The authors employ cryo-ET to view these fascinating assemblies 3D. However, lack of details precludes confidence in the displayed models. The authors need to detail the number of data sets collected and analyzed, post-processing and segmentation procedures, and should provide slices in X Y directions. Moreover, from reviewing the movies kindly provided the claim of isotropic resolution is inadequate. The resolution in Z direction is severely diminished, and this is the long axis of the bundles used. There is no way of telling what type of artifacts this geometry will introduce. If the authors want to prove that their conclusions are supported by the data, the authors will need to come up with some more convincing arguments. Maybe the authors can apply some simulations with idealized models or make use of the bundles with their long axis running in the other directions (x, y). As it stands there is some probability that the data is over interpreted, at least to some extent. Furthermore, because of the absence of averaging, the authors are looking at single motifs in a fairly noisy background, which is not helping in building confidence for their conclusions.</p><p>2) The bundles of septin-Gic complexes were “untangled” by adsorbing them to a lipid monolayer containing NTA-lipids that bind to His6-tags attached to the Cdc3 septin molecule. Do the His-tags themselves cause some aggregation in this system, i.e., could that be the origin of the entangling of the filaments? In other words, were EM studies attempted with a different method to tether them to the surface?</p><p>3) Please provide the control polymerization done in absence of fluorophore to establish the lack of interference (artifacts) induced by the addition of the EGFP-tag.</p><p>4) What is the estimated resolution of the cryo-EM tomograms in xy and z, respectively (see also point 1)?</p><p>5) What is the concentration of Cdc42-GppNHp in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>?</p><p>6) The Gic components in the septin-Gic complexes appear rather heterogeneous. Do they consist of multiple Gic molecules or is Gic thought to be a flexible multi-domain protein?</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: The fluorescence in B looks just aggregated rather than bundled: these images raise some concern about what the relevance is of filament cables to normal septin assemblies. There is no scale bar annotation for panels C-F.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: There are no scale bar annotations. There is only one spot along the fiber that is Cdc11 labeled. Please mention how many particles were used for the averaging in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.

Your revised article has been evaluated by a Senior editor, a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors (Axel Brunger), and two reviewers. We thank the authors for addressing many of the concerns raised by the reviewers and the Reviewing editor. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>There are remaining significant concerns about the quality and reliability of the cryo-EM tomography results (see the comments by Reviewer 3 below). The reviewers and editors had considerable discussions about these concerns. They recognize that main conclusion that is drawn from the tomograms is that Gic1 cross-bridges more than two filaments, a result that could not be drawn from the negative stain EM images alone. The potential artifacts that are caused by the missing wedge in the EM data could have affected this particular conclusion, especially the connections between the filaments, as the authors also showed in their simulations.</p><p>Ideally, the authors should revisit their existing EM tomograms at the orthogonal orientation to show that these connections are independent of the geometry (see Reviewer 3 comments). The authors (using the geometry in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19">Figure 19G</xref> for example) showed that there are clear extra crosslinks visible in tomograms. However, we would be prepared to accept the paper in essentially its current form if the authors would clearly point out the limitations of their current tomography study (including the potential effects of the missing wedge, lack of averaging, the estimated very low resolution of the images). The authors need to make a convincing case that the main conclusion drawn from the tomograms (more than two filaments binding to Gic1) is probably not affected by these concerns. Moreover, the authors must clearly state in the main text, the figure captions, and the conclusions that the images themselves may have gross errors.</p><p><italic>Comments from Reviewer 3</italic>:</p><p>The authors have now given a much clearer picture of the tomography data and processing. Unfortunately, much of what was laid out only confirmed the reviewer's initial concerns. It is not the quality of the reconstruction that improves by changing the relationship between beam direction and tilt axis. The data in the missing wedge is missing, still. The artifacts are just along a different direction. The illusion of “improvement” is actually dangerous because it gives a false sense of quality for the reconstruction.</p><p>The authors show themselves with their simulations that the data collection strategy they use generates severe artifacts to thin structures that are perpendicular to the beam. If there are any thin connections between the filaments, it is very likely that they will not appear in the reconstruction with the chosen geometry. The modeling of the cross-links as featureless barrels is not helpful to convince the reviewer. The question is what would happen to finer features that may be attached to these barrels or emanate from/connect between the filaments.</p><p>In trying to get a quantitative assessment of the assembly features (filaments and linkers) for this geometrically challenging system, the authors should have generated tomo-series in both orthogonal orientations to provide dual axis tomograms. Such data scheme would allow assessing the extent of the missing wedge and isotropic distortions for the system and thus provide measurable values to the confidence to the described conclusions.</p><p>Furthermore it is somewhat concerning that the whole analysis is based on five reconstructions, 2 of septin-Gic1 and 3 of septin-Gic-Cdc42-GppNHp complexes. These numbers are on the lower side to draw robust conclusions, specifically as thousand of such assemblies were viewed.</p><p>In summary, the reliability of the features in the reconstructions is questionable and the presentation of the data is misleading by implying that artifacts caused by the missing wedge would be somehow overcome by using a specific geometry.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01085.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors employ cryo-ET to view these fascinating assemblies 3D. However, lack of details precludes confidence in the displayed models. The authors need to detail the number of data sets collected and analyzed, post-processing and segmentation procedures, and should provide slices in XY directions</italic>.</p><p>We admit that the description of our approach was not completely adequate, and apologize for this. We now provide more technical details in Materials and methods.</p><p>We also provide slices and the corresponding segmentations in XY and Z direction and also included a direct comparison between raw and processed subtomograms in an additional figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18</xref>), showing that the main features of the septin-Gic1 and septin-Gic1-Cdc42 complexes described in the present study are well defined even in the noisy unprocessed subtomograms.</p><p><italic>Moreover, from reviewing the movies kindly provided the claim of isotropic resolution is inadequate. The resolution in Z direction is severely diminished, and this is the long axis of the bundles used. There is no way of telling what type of artifacts this geometry will introduce. If the authors want to prove that their conclusions are supported by the data, the authors will need to come up with some more convincing arguments. Maybe the authors can apply some simulations with idealized models or make use of the bundles with their long axis running in the other directions (x, y). As it stands there is some probability that the data is over interpreted, at least to some extent. Furthermore, because of the absence of averaging, the authors are looking at single motifs in a fairly noisy background, which is not helping in building confidence for their conclusions</italic>.</p><p>To obtain an optimal coverage of the complexes during a single-tilt tomographic image acquisition, the long axis of the complexes had to run either parallel to the tilt axis or parallel to the beam axis of the microscope. In the first case, the complexes were strongly affected by the missing wedge. The filaments appeared stretched and merged partially with each other and therefore their tracing was difficult. On the other hand, in tomograms with complexes running parallel to the beam, the septin filaments were clearly defined, all filaments around Gic1 had the same diameter and their tracing was straightforward. Furthermore, the densities corresponding to Gic1 and Gic1/Cdc42, respectively were fully comparable respective their overall shape and size to tomograms with complexes running in perpendicular directions, at least at the resolution level of 40-50 Å. Thus, tomograms of complexes running in the z direction provided the best possible 3D reconstructions of these complexes. We added two additional Videos (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2 media3">Videos 2-3</xref>) showing cryo electron tomograms with septin-Gic1 complexes running parallel to the beam.</p><p>However, we are aware that these tomograms are still affected by the missing wedge along the z direction, as pointed out by the reviewers. In order to show to what extent this results in structural artifacts, we performed tomography-simulations using an idealized railroad-like structure model, as suggested. These simulations are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19 fig20">Figures 19-20</xref> and described in detail in the revised manuscript.</p><p>In the case of the model running with its long axis parallel to the beam at 0˚, the filaments do not show prominent missing wedge artifacts at a resolution of 45 Å and are fully comparable to the filaments of the original model. Only the density of GROEL/GROES (simulating Gic1-Cdc42) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19">Figure 19F</xref>, shown in green) shows an increase in diameter along the z direction by ∼14 %.</p><p>We are confident that this mild anisotropy does not lead to wrong conclusions, especially since we do not describe any specific molecular or mechanistic details and restrict our analysis of 3D-tomograms exclusively to basic low-resolution features of the complexes. Taken together, this rules out that we over-interpret our data.</p><p><italic>2) The bundles of septin-Gic complexes were “untangled” by adsorbing them to a lipid monolayer containing NTA-lipids that bind to His6-tags attached to the Cdc3 septin molecule. Do the His-tags themselves cause some aggregation in this system, i.e., could that be the origin of the entangling of the filaments? In other words, were EM studies attempted with a different method to tether them to the surface? Note to authors: the response to our query along with the PIP2 control should be included in the revised paper; no additional experiments are needed</italic>.</p><p>In a classical EM grid preparation, samples are incubated on carbon coated copper grids to which they absorb non-specifically. In the case of filaments that tend to bundle, the whole grid is often covered with protein making the analysis of single filaments difficult and tedious. Septin filaments only interact with lipid monolayers if the monolayers contain special lipids. His-tagged septin filaments can be immobilized on lipid monolayers with Ni-NTA lipids and by varying the concentration of Ni-NTA lipids the concentration of septin filaments on the grid can be conveniently adjusted. This facilitates the sample preparation and is an established method in electron microscopy (Kelly et al. 2010).</p><p>However, in order to prove that the His-tags of the proteins are not responsible for the entangling of the filaments, we performed additional experiments. Both Gics and septins have been reported to interact strongly with PIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Orlando et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertin et al. 2010</xref>). We therefore immobilized septin-Gic1 filaments on lipid monolayers containing PIP2 instead of Ni-NTA lipids. The filaments adsorbed to the grid and bundles were “untangled” comparably to that seen in the experiments with Ni-NTA lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>), indicating that the interaction of the septin-Gic1 filaments, respectively, is not His-tag-induced.</p><p>Another good argument against the hypothesis of a His-tag-induced interaction is that we also observed the “entangling” of septin filaments when we studied unmodified wildtype septins purified from yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farkasovsky et al. 2005</xref>). The bundling of His-tagged septins is not stronger than that of the wildtype filaments. We can therefore exclude that the His-tag forces the filaments to “entangle”.</p><p>In our study, we showed that His-tagged Gic1 interacts with the septin Cdc10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The His-tag on the septin filaments, however, is attached to a different septin, namely Cdc3. We can therefore also exclude a His-tag induced interaction of Gic1 and septins. In addition, we performed experiments with GST-tagged Gic1 and observed the same railroad structures as for His-tagged Gic1, indicating that the interaction between Gic1 and Cdc10 is not induced by His-tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig22" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Septin-Gic1-GST complexes.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01085-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>Finally, the His-tags do not aggregate homogeneous Gic1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) or septin octamer samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11 fig14">Figures 11 &amp; 14</xref>). The entangling of septin filaments must therefore be caused by other physical and chemical interactions comparable to the bundling of actin filaments.</p><p>In summary, we can exclude artifacts induced by the His-tags.</p><p><italic>3) Please provide the control polymerization done in absence of fluorophore to establish the lack of interference (artifacts) induced by the addition of the EGFP-tag</italic>.</p><p>The only experiments we have done in the presence of a fluorophore are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>/B.

We point this out more clearly in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We also performed experiments with EGFP-tagged septins (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig23">Author response image 2</xref>), but did not include them in the manuscript to prevent confusion. Using EGFP-tagged proteins, we observe the same railroad track structure as in the experiments without the fluorophore. However, the density of Gic1 appears to be much larger, since EGFP localizes directly to Cdc3 and adds density to the cross-bridge between the filaments.<fig id="fig23" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Complexes between Gic1 and septin filaments containing Cdc3-EGFP.</title><p><bold>(A-B)</bold> Representative EM images of negatively stained septin filaments containing Cdc3-EGFP polymerized by dialysis alone <bold>(A)</bold> or together with Gic1 <bold>(B)</bold>.

A resolution estimate is given for only 25 of the 60 tomograms deposited in the EMDB. For 7 of these 25 tomograms, although a value is given, it is not described how the authors determined it. For 5 tomograms, the resolution was estimated by visual inspection regarding certain known features in the tomograms. For 7 tomograms, the resolution was estimated by the first zero-crossing of the CTF in the 0˚ image (however, this criteria does not distinguish between signal and noise, and is therefore just a measure for how good the resolution could be in principle). For the remaining specimens, the resolution was determined by electron diffraction (this is only possible for ordered structures such as 2D crystals or helices). A cross validation-based criterion exists for electron tomography (Cardone et al. 2005), but because of many problems it extremely underestimates the resolution of the tomograms and is therefore not used by the tomography community.</p><p>Therefore, due to the absence of a standard method, we avoid estimating the resolution of our tomograms. However, segmentation of our tomograms was straightforward after filtering down the raw tomograms to 30 Å. The first zero-crossing in the CTF in the 0˚ images of the various tomograms is at about 35-45 Å. Moreover, a visual comparison, between the densities of septin filaments in our tomograms and down-filtered crystal structures of human septin (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18 fig19 fig20">Figures 18-20</xref>), suggests a resolution of 40-60 Å. Thus, for our sub-tomograms shown in the present study, we expect a resolution in the xy direction of 40-60 Å (at lower resolutions, septin filaments are expected to appear as featureless straight rods). Furthermore, based on an elongation factor of 1.14 that we derived from our simulation studies, we expect a 5-10 Å decrease of resolution in the z direction.</p><p><italic>5) What is the concentration of Cdc42-GppNHp in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref>?</p><p>As described in the Materials and methods, Cdc42-GppNHp was added at equal concentrations as Gic1 for filament preparation, i.e., 0.5 µM and at 10x higher concentrations, i.e. 5 µM. To prevent any confusion we included the values now in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Taken into account that each yeast cell contains around 1000 copies of septin octamers and Gic1 (Ghaemmaghami et al. 2003), the estimated concentration of septins or Gic1 in a yeast cell is around 0.05 µM. However, the local concentration of Cdc42 and Gic1 in yeast (for example at the budding neck) can be much higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gladfelter et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goryachev &amp; Pokhilko 2008</xref>). We therefore believe that our observations are physiologically relevant.</p><p><italic>6) The Gic components in the septin-Gic complexes appear rather heterogeneous. Do they consist of multiple Gic molecules or is Gic thought to be a flexible multi-domain protein</italic>?</p><p>Gic1, which based on its sequence has a molecular weight of 23 kDa (Gic1(104-314)), elutes at about 49 kDa from a gel filtration column corresponding roughly to a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In a typical Gic1 cross-bridge up to 12 Cdc10 subunits are involved (two per filament) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). If we assume that each of them binds independently to a Gic1 dimer, we would expect that 12 Gic1 dimers assemble into a large cross-bridge of 600 kDa. In good agreement with this the average large volume of the Gic1 density in the electron tomograms indicates that it must contain multiple Gic1 molecules. The heterogeneity of the Gic1 cross-bridges indicates that the number of Gic1 molecules varies between cross-bridges.

We changed this in the revised manuscript.</p><p>As stated in the Material and methods, we used 199 particles that had clearly antibodies bound for this analysis. Each class average contained 15 single particles. We state that now in the revised manuscript.</p><p>However, the number of single particles in the class average is not an important potential issue. Because of the work by Iwase et al. that indicated that Gic would bind to Cdc12, we did three independent studies to prove that Gic1 binds to Cdc10. First, we did the antibody labeling mentioned above. Second, we performed septin-Gic1 complex formation with septin-Cdc10Δ complexes that showed that Gic1 does not bind to septin-Cdc10Δ filaments although they contain Cdc12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-I</xref>). Third, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays that clearly showed that Gic1 binds to Cdc10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Notably, in contrast to Iwase et al., who got a signal after 9 days, we obtained a clear-cut signal already after 2 days.

We can therefore clearly state that Cdc42-GppNHp binds to Gic1 and does not induce Gic1 oligomerization.

These cross-bridges connect parallel running filaments that lie very close to each other.

Depending on the thickness of the stain, we can sometimes see them connecting two septin filaments also at lower septin filament concentration (Author response image 3B). The Gic1-mediated cross-bridges, however, are much larger and can easily be seen in negative stain electron microscopy. The stain accumulation between the Gic1 cross-bridges makes it impossible to visualize the thin cross-bridges emanating from coiled-coil interactions of the C-terminal extensions of Cdc3 and Cdc12, although they are probably still there.

They clearly show that the complexes running parallel to the tilt axis are better resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20E-F, H-I</xref>) than the ones running perpendicular to the tilt axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20K-L</xref>). Because of the longitudinal appearance of the septin-Gic1-Cdc42 complexes, tomograms with complexes running parallel to the beam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20E-F</xref>) result in a reconstruction that is more similar to the original model compared to complexes running perpendicular to the beam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20H-I</xref>).</p><p><italic>It is not the quality of the reconstruction that improves by changing the relationship between beam direction and tilt axis</italic>.</p><p>There must be a misunderstanding: the relationship between beam direction and tilt axis does not change during a tomography experiment. It depends on the current microscope setup and if the user does not tilt the beam during image recording (we never tilt the beam!), this relationship will not change.</p><p><italic>If there are any thin connections between the filaments, it is very likely that they will not appear in the reconstruction with the chosen geometry</italic>.</p><p>As described above we revisited our EM tomogram at the orthogonal orientation and calculated a reconstruction of filaments running parallel to the tilt axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19">Figure 19A-C</xref>). As expected, we do not see any additional thin connections between the filaments.</p><p>The thin connections described in Bertin et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bertin et al. 2008</xref>) are expected to be composed of two interacting thin coiled-coils. They are very thin and cannot be seen in 2D class averages (this work) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sirajuddin et al. 2007</xref>) and 3D reconstructions of negatively stained septin octamers at 27 Å resolution (Lukoyanova et al. 2008).</p><p>The resolution of our reconstructions is 40-60 Å at best (as pointed out in our previous rebuttal letter, there is not yet a method to measure precisely the resolution of single tomograms). It is therefore expected that these structures are not resolved in our tomograms. Even if the thin connections were visible, their segmentation would be highly ambiguous, independent of the chosen geometry. This issue is pointed out in the revised manuscript more clearly.</p><p><italic>The modeling of the cross-links as featureless barrels is not helpful to convince the reviewer</italic>.</p><p>We chose GROEL/GROES as a model because it has similar dimensions to Gic1 cross-bridges and has been extensively studied by electron microscopy.</p><p><italic>The question is what would happen to finer features that may be attached to these barrels or emanate from/connect between the filaments</italic>.</p><p>As described above, finer features will not be resolved at a resolution of 40-60 Å. We have used electron tomography to study these complicated structures, not X-ray crystallography. We therefore restrict our description and conclusion to gross features. We agree with the reviewer that this would be worth analyzing in future studies, but with other techniques, in particular X-ray crystallography.</p><p><italic>In trying to get a quantitative assessment of the assembly features (filaments and linkers) for this geometrically challenging system, the authors should have generated tomo-series in both orthogonal orientations to provide dual axis tomograms. Such data scheme would allow assessing the extent of the missing wedge and isotropic distortions for the system and thus provide measurable values to the confidence to the described conclusions</italic>.</p><p>Although dual axis tomography theoretically improves the quality of tomograms, it harbors many technical problems and has therefore not been routinely used by the EM community. Most electron microscopes, including ours, are not equipped with a dual axis tomography holder. Therefore one has to remove the grid from the microscope after recording the first tomogram, turn it by 90˚ and enter it again. After finding the right position the second tomogram is recorded. Besides many obvious technical difficulties such as ice contamination when removing the grid and problems with alignment, the electron dose of such tomograms is doubled, resulting in decreased resolution. Any potential improvement of our tomograms would therefore be questionable. Instead we revisited our EM tomograms at the orthogonal orientation and searched for filaments running parallel to the tilt axis. This showed that the overall structure of the septin-Gic1 complexes is independent of its orientation in the tomogram.</p><p>From the home page of SerialEM (the most common program to acquire tilt series for electron tomography; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/index.html">http://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/index.html</ext-link>), Strategies for Cryoelectron Tomography: “There is essentially no dual-axis capability due to the low dose requirements. So, we are left with single-axis reconstructions.”</p><p>From “Cryo-electron tomography: The challenge of doing structural biology in situ” (Vladan Lučić, Alexander Rigort, and Wolfgang Baumeister, JCB:Review, August 5, 2013), Dual-axis tomography: “Tilting around two tilt axes perpendicular to each other reduces missing wedge–induced distortions and improves information content. However, dual-axis tomography has rarely been used in cryo-ET due to the need to acquire an increased number of projections and difficulties with alignment....”</p><p><italic>Furthermore it is somewhat concerning that the whole analysis is based on five reconstructions, 2 of septin-Gic1 and 3 of septin-Gic-Cdc42-GppNHp complexes. These numbers are on the lower side to draw robust conclusions, specifically as thousand of such assemblies were viewed</italic>.</p><p>We could provide hundreds of reconstructions with complexes running in random directions relative to the tilt axis. However, as described above and demonstrated by simulations, only reconstructions with filaments running parallel to the tilt axis or to the beam result in analyzable reconstructions. To find filaments in this orientation is very challenging. We are convinced that the number of reconstructions provided is sufficient to support our conclusions.</p><p><italic>In summary, the reliability of the features in the reconstructions is questionable and the presentation of the data is misleading by implying that artifacts caused by the missing wedge would be somehow overcome by using a specific geometry</italic>.</p><p>We clearly show that we do not overcome the missing wedge artifacts. This is not possible in a single tomogram experiment. However, we show that the orientation of the longitudinal complexes during tomography definitely has an impact on the resolution and overall quality of the reconstructions. We rephrased this passage in the revised manuscript to prevent any misunderstandings.</p><p>Due to the overall methodical and resolution limitations our paper focuses exclusively on gross features of the complex. We can clearly determine the number of filaments and we can even fit the crystal structure of human septin into our reconstructions to verify that the overall dimensions are correct. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the density corresponding to Gic1 appears more stretched due to the missing wedge artifacts, we can state that Gic1 cross-bridges several septin filaments. These are our conclusions from the cryo-ET data.</p><p>We are convinced that we have carefully interpreted, and not over-interpreted, the data presented and have avoided any overstatement. Therefore, we are confident that the conclusions we draw from our data, namely that Gic1 scaffolds more than two septin filaments, are robust and justified.</p></body></sub-article></article>
