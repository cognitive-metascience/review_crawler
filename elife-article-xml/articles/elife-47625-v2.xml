Although it has been suggested that the cell cycle could be a timer, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we describe a cell cycle timer that operates in <italic>Sonic hedgehog</italic> (<italic>Shh</italic>)-expressing polarising region cells of the chick wing bud. Our data are consistent with Shh signalling stimulating polarising region cell proliferation via Cyclin D2, and then inhibiting proliferation via a Bmp2-p27<sup>kip1</sup> pathway. When Shh signalling is blocked, polarising region cells over-proliferate and form an additional digit, which can be prevented by applying Bmp2 or by inhibiting D cyclin activity. In addition, Bmp2 also restores posterior digit identity in the absence of Shh signalling, thus indicating that it specifies antero-posterior (thumb to little finger) positional values. Our results reveal how an autoregulatory cell cycle timer integrates growth and specification and are widely applicable to many tissues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>limb</kwd><kwd>patterning</kwd><kwd>growth</kwd><kwd>timing</kwd><kwd>Shh</kwd><kwd>digits</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202756/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pickering</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name><name><surname>Chinnaiya</surname><given-names>Kavitha</given-names></name><name><surname>Towers</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A cell cycle timing mechanism similar to one operating in cultured adult oligodendrocyte progenitor cells controls the growth and patterning of the embryonic chick wing bud.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>How proliferation and growth are controlled during embryonic development is a difficult question to address because these processes often involve the interaction between intrinsic mechanisms and extrinsic signals, as revealed in early studies, in which limb buds were transplanted between differently-sized salamander species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Twitty and Schwind, 1931</xref>). Although much is known about how proliferation and growth are controlled by extrinsic signals, little is known about how these processes are controlled intrinsically. One mechanism involves changing the level of a factor beyond a threshold at which it can stimulate or inhibit cell cycle entry. For instance, the progressive depletion of DNA replication factors triggers the mid-blastula transition in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos after a defined number of cell cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Collart et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the increase in the levels of a G1-S phase inhibitor causes cultured adult oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to differentiate after a defined duration of proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Durand and Raff, 2000</xref>).</p><p>We previously showed that polarising region cells of the chick wing bud measure their duration of proliferation in a similar manner to that of cultured oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chinnaiya et al., 2014</xref>). The polarising region is an important developmental organiser of the early limb bud that produces the secreted signal, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Riddle et al., 1993</xref>), which is implicated in providing cells with antero-posterior (thumb to little finger) positional values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tickle and Towers, 2017</xref>). The grafting of polarising regions from young to older wing buds showed that proliferation rates are intrinsically determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chinnaiya et al., 2014</xref>). However, both polarising region and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells require permissive signals to maintain them in a proliferative state. In the case of the polarising region, this signal is based on Fgfs (Fibroblast growth factors) emanating from the overlying apical ectodermal ridge—a thickening of the epithelium that rims the distal tip of the wing bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niswander et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laufer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Niswander et al., 1994</xref>). Similarly, the application of Fgfs or Pdgf (Platelet-derived growth factor) maintains the proliferation of cultured oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Durand et al., 1997</xref>). In addition, both polarising region and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells require an instructive hydrophobic signal. For polarising region cells, this signal is considered to be retinoic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chinnaiya et al., 2014</xref>), which emanates from the trunk of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mercader et al., 2000</xref>). The growth of the wing bud away from the influence of retinoic acid signalling then starts the polarising region cell cycle timer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chinnaiya et al., 2014</xref>). However, in the case of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, retinoic acid or thyroid hormone is required to stop the cell cycle timer after a defined duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barres et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tokumoto et al., 1999</xref>). The timing of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation involves the cell-intrinsic control of p27<sup>kip1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Durand et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Durand et al., 1998</xref>), an inhibitor of the D cyclins, which are the rate-limiting effectors of the G1-S phase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohtsubo and Roberts, 1993</xref>). Although these important in vitro studies on oligodendrocyte progenitor cells provide an exemplar for understanding the temporal control of proliferation, it is unclear if similar mechanisms function during embryogenesis.</p><p>In this paper, we reveal that polarising region and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells use similar molecular mechanisms to control their duration of proliferation. We provide evidence that Shh signalling stimulates the proliferation of polarising region cells via Cyclin D2 and then inhibits proliferation via p27<sup>kip1</sup>. We also demonstrate how this timer restricts posterior digit development in the chick wing. In addition, our data suggest that Bmp2 is an important component of the timer, playing a dual role in preventing digit development, while simultaneously specifying posterior digit identity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Shh regulates cell cycle gene expression in the polarising region</title><p>Previously we demonstrated that Shh signalling intrinsically controls the rate and duration of polarising region cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chinnaiya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pickering and Towers, 2016</xref>). Thus, the transient inhibition of Shh signalling at HH20 (for approximately 72 h) using cyclopamine increases the percentage of polarising region cells in the G1-phase of the cell cycle within 24 h, indicative of a decreased rate of proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> – data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chinnaiya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pickering and Towers, 2016</xref>). This is followed by an acute stimulation in the proliferation rate between 24 and 48 h. During this time, the proliferation of distal mesenchyme cells adjacent to the polarising region is unaffected by the loss of Shh signalling, thus indicating specific effects on polarising region cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pickering and Towers, 2016</xref>).

In addition, <italic>Cyclin D1</italic> is expressed throughout the posterior part of the wing bud, as well as in the polarising region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Towers et al., 2008</xref>). Since the D cyclins are rate-limiting for G1-S-phase progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohtsubo and Roberts, 1993</xref>), it is likely that both Cyclins D1 and D2 influence polarising region proliferation, but in being restricted to the polarising region, Cyclin D2 plays a fine-tuning role. We have now demonstrated that Shh signalling is also required for the expression of <italic>p27<sup>kip1</sup></italic> in the chick wing polarising region, and we have provided evidence that this occurs via an intermediate signal—Bmp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). The other two members of the Cip/Kip group of inhibitors, <italic>p21<sup>cip1</sup></italic> and <italic>p57<sup>kip2</sup></italic>, are not expressed in the early chick wing bud, therefore indicating that, unless another inhibitor of the G1-S transition is expressed in the polarising region, p27<sup>kip1</sup> is responsible for restraining the proliferation of polarising region cells. We propose that Shh signalling activates the Bmp2-p27<sup>kip1</sup> pathway to prevent the over-proliferation of polarising region cells and the formation of an additional digit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a,b</xref>). The finding that Shh signalling is not required for the maintenance of <italic>Cyclin D1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Towers et al., 2008</xref>), indicates that the product of this gene is likely to be responsible for the over-proliferation of polarising region cells in the absence of both Cyclin D2 and p27<sup>kip1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). Therefore, the fact that Shh signalling controls the expression of <italic>Cyclin D2</italic> and <italic>p27<sup>kip1</sup></italic> with different temporal dynamics, provides a robust auto-regulatory feedback loop for modulating polarising region proliferation in the chick wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>).

It could be that Shh signalling fulfils both functions in most tissues, but at different times, and this could be the focus of future endeavours.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47625.011</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>An autoregulatory polarising region cell cycle timer.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Shh signalling is required for <italic>Cyclin D2</italic> expression in the polarising region (green). Bmp2 signalling acts downstream of Shh to control p27<sup>kip1</sup> that inhibits the D-cyclin-dependent formation of a digit from the polarising region (X), and that also promotes the digit 2 to digit 3 positional value in adjacent cells. Shh signalling also stimulates Cyclin D1-dependent proliferation in the digit-forming field, which is required for the progressive specification of antero-posterior digit positional values - 1, 2 and then 3, over 12 hr.

In addition, loss of Bmp2 signalling prevents p27<sup>kip1</sup> from inhibiting polarising region proliferation and digit development. Since blocking Shh signalling attenuates Cyclin D2 function, Cyclin D1 is likely to be responsible for the over-proliferation of polarising region cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47625-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Bmp2 signalling specifies posterior positional values</title><p>The chick wing polarising region produces a concentration gradient of Shh signalling that is considered to directly specify adjacent cells with antero-posterior positional values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Riddle et al., 1993</xref>). During this process, cells are specified with digit 1 positional values, which are sequentially promoted to digit 2 and then digit 3 positional values over 12 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Towers et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). A pattern of anterior digits (1-2-2-2) is often found in wings in which Shh signalling has been blocked during the promotion phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pickering and Towers, 2016</xref>). We have now provided evidence that digits with posterior identity fail to form in such wings, because the loss of Bmp2 signalling prevents the promotion of the digit 2 to the digit 3 positional value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a,b</xref>). Therefore, this finding supports the overlooked suggestion that Bmps function downstream of Shh signalling in the specification of antero-posterior values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Drossopoulou et al., 2000</xref>). This is an attractive hypothesis because the genes operating downstream of the positional information gradient of Shh signalling in the specification of digit identity have remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tickle and Towers, 2017</xref>). However, the manipulation of Bmp signalling during hand-plate stages in the chick leg can change digit identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dahn and Fallon, 2000</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that Bmp signalling encodes antero-posterior positional values at an early stage of chick limb development, the positional memory of which could be interpreted at later stages of development by the second wave of Bmp signalling in the expanded hand-plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>One of the problems with Bmp2 acting as a long-range signal in digit patterning, is that when it is applied to the anterior margin of the chick wing bud in the form of a recombinant protein, it fails to duplicate the pattern of digits across the antero-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Francis et al., 1994</xref>). However, this can be explained by the requirement for Shh signalling acting as a growth signal to establish the digit-forming field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Towers et al., 2008</xref>) over which Bmps could then operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Drossopoulou et al., 2000</xref>). Another line of evidence against Bmp signalling playing a role in the specification of antero-posterior positional values was the finding that mice lacking Bmp2/4/7 function in their limbs appear to have no overt changes in digit identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2006</xref>). However, we have suggested that the digits of mouse limb (digits 2-5) have similar ‘anterior’ character in terms of phalanx number and proportions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pickering and Towers, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Towers, 2018</xref>). Note, that the mouse limb has five digits in the anterior to posterior sequence of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. One possibility is that the Bmp2-p27<sup>kip1</sup> pathway is not as active in mammalian limbs as it is in avian wings, and this could allow the polarising region to produce two digits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harfe et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, diminished Bmp2 signalling might only be sufficient to specify anterior positional values, thus resulting in a cryptic ‘1-2-2-2-2’ digit pattern in mammalian limbs. A model such as this could provide an explanation for the digit patterns obtained when Shh function is removed at different time-points during mouse limb development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). We have previously suggested that the digit patterns interpreted as 1-2-4 and 1-2-4-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>) could instead be ‘1-2-2’ or ‘1-2-2-2’ patterns, because of the failure of Shh signalling to promote sufficient expansion of the digit-forming field to allow four digits to form with a ‘digit 2’ character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pickering and Towers, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tickle and Towers, 2017</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that Shh functions primarily as a mitogen, and that Bmps function downstream of Shh signalling in specifying antero-posterior positional values in the chick wing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications of the autoregulatory polarising region cell cycle timer</title><p>Cell cycle timers have been predicted in several developmental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Newport and Kirschner, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Durand and Raff, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burton et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Primmett et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lewis, 1975</xref>). Recently, we provided evidence that a progressive increase in Bmp signalling is responsible for the slowing of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pickering et al., 2018</xref>), which is linked to the acquisition of proximo-distal positional values in the distal mesenchyme of the chick wing bud (humerus to digit tips) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saiz-Lopez et al., 2015</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that this could involve a D cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor acting downstream of Bmp signalling, although it is unlikely to be p27<sup>kip1</sup>, which is only expressed in myogenic cells at later stages of chick wing development. However, important work showed that the intrinsic control of p27<sup>kip1</sup> is required for the timely differentiation of cultured adult oligodendrocyte progenitor cells after a defined duration of proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Durand et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Durand et al., 1998</xref>). Our work extends these earlier studies by providing evidence for a role of p27<sup>kip1</sup> in cell cycle timing during embryogenesis.</p><p>It is of note that mice lacking the function of p27<sup>kip1</sup> display postnatal overgrowth, which is consistent with cells in various tissues failing to restrain proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fero et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiyokawa et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakayama et al., 1996</xref>). However, human overgrowth syndromes involving p27<sup>KIP1</sup> are rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grey et al., 2013</xref>), and growth syndromes involving loss-of-function mutations in <italic>D CYCLINS</italic> have not been reported. In addition, neither <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>kip1</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fero et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiyokawa et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakayama et al., 1996</xref>) or <italic>cyclin D2</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huard et al., 1999</xref>) have been reported to have limb patterning defects, which could be considered inconsistent with the data presented in this report. This could reflect differences between how chick and mice limbs develop. Alternatively, it is likely that robust mechanisms compensate for the germline deletion of individual cell cycle components. For instance, mice lacking all three D cyclins progress to quite late stages of embryogenesis, because other cyclins normally associated with different cell cycle phases replace their functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kozar et al., 2004</xref>). On the other hand, a role for CYCLIN D2 has been predicted in human limb development from the analyses of gain-of-function mutations, which might not be readily compensated for by other cell cycle regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mirzaa et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, de novo mutations in <italic>CYCLIN D2</italic>—that produce a stable form of the protein—have been identified in individuals who have a rare overgrowth disorder named Megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mirzaa et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, individuals with MPPH syndrome frequently produce an extra posterior digit in both their upper and lower limbs, which in light of our data, could suggest that the stable form of CYCLIN D2 has overridden the SHH-BMP2-p27<sup>KIP1</sup> pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a,b</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that the patterning and growth defects found in individuals with MPPH, and related overgrowth syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mirzaa et al., 2013</xref>), are caused by the loss of control over intrinsic cell cycle timing mechanisms that operate in multiple tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>D cyclins and limb growth</title><p>Our earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Towers et al., 2008</xref>) and present data suggest that Shh signalling specifies two growth compartments during chick wing development. This growth does not specify digit number per se, which is determined at later stages by processes considered to involve self-organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Newman and Frisch, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oster et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wolpert, 1994</xref>). Thus, long-range Shh signalling by the polarising region promotes expansion of the adjacent anterior digit-forming field, likely via Cyclin D1, to provide sufficient tissue for three digits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Towers et al., 2008</xref>). Conversely, short-range Shh signalling restricts expansion of the posterior polarising region, likely via Cyclin D2/p27<sup>kip1</sup>, to prevent it producing a digit. It is unclear how these two growth outputs of Shh signalling are mediated simultaneously, but it is likely to involve the spatial distribution of the Gli transcription factors: <italic>Gli1</italic> is expressed in posterior cells, whereas <italic>Gli2</italic> and <italic>Gli3</italic> are expressed more-anteriorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marigo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schweitzer et al., 2000</xref>). The anterior growth response to Shh signalling appears evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates because three digits develop from cells adjacent to the polarising region in the chick wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Towers et al., 2011</xref>), chick leg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Towers et al., 2011</xref>) and mouse limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harfe et al., 2004</xref>). However, the ability of the chick leg and mouse limb polarising region to produce more posterior digits than the chick wing, suggests a high degree of growth plasticity, which could be a consequence of the altered dynamics of the auto-regulatory polarising region cell cycle timer.</p><p>Similarities and differences can be drawn between chick wing development and <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing development: Hedgehog signalling emanates from the posterior compartment of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing to promote growth of the anterior compartment via the Gli orthologue, Cubitus interruptus (Ci) and its regulation of Cyclin D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duman-Scheel et al., 2002</xref>). However, cells in the posterior compartment are unable to respond to Hedgehog signalling because they do not express <italic>Ci</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lecuit et al., 1996</xref>). Instead, Hh signals to the posterior compartment through the Bmp2 orthologue, Decapentaplegic, which is expressed at the antero-posterior compartment boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lecuit et al., 1996</xref>). As well as having only one Gli transcription factor (Ci) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Orenic et al., 1990</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> has one D cyclin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Finley et al., 1996</xref>) and one D cyclin inhibitor (Dacapo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lane et al., 1996</xref>). Thus, by extending these gene families, vertebrates appear to have enabled Shh signalling to elicit multiple growth responses in both a spatial and temporal manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chick husbandry</title><p>Bovans Brown chicken eggs were incubated and staged according to Hamburger Hamilton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951</xref>) HH19 is incubation day 3, HH24 - day 4, HH27 - day 5, HH29 - day 6, HH30 - day 7, and HH36 is day 10.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Whole mount in situ hybridisation</title><p>Embryos were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C, dehydrated in methanol overnight at −20°C, rehydrated through a methanol/PBS series, washed in PBS, then treated with proteinase K for 20 mins (10 μg/ml<sup>−1</sup>), washed in PBS, fixed for 30 mins in 4% PFA at room temperature and then prehybridised at 69°C for 2 hr (50% formamide/50% 2x SSC). 1 μg of antisense DIG-labelled mRNA probes were added in 1 ml of hybridisation buffer (50% formamide/50% 2x SSC) at 69°C overnight.

There is a missed opportunity to discuss what is known about the function of Shh to shorten the G1 phase and to accelerate cell proliferation, not just in limbs, but also in other tissues beyond the oligodendrocyte cell culture system that they cite as inspiration for this work.

There are similar problems with their interpretations in multiple places like stating that Shh prevents cyclin-dependent phenotypes rather than cyclin inhibition reverses the effects of loss of Shh?</p><p>3) There should be statistical analysis of digit number. Since their statement is &quot;these findings demonstrate that Shh signaling prevents the D cyclin-dependent formation of an additional digit&quot;, it should be possible to determine whether 21/42 with four digits (regardless of identity) in cyclopamine treated embryos is different from 2/23 with four digits with cyclopamine and PD0332991.</p><p>4) Please present the statistics more clearly throughout the text rather than in figure legends and methods.

For this reason it makes sense to include a &quot;1-2-3&quot; category. Contrast that with the BMP2 bead implantation experiment that is very local and one-sided, with the contralateral side for comparison, so it makes sense that the 1-2-3 category was removed from the analysis. However, the number of individuals unaffected by cyclopamine should be reported.</p><p>6) They provide evidence that Bmp2 is sufficient to inhibit proliferation after cyclopamine treatment and that Bmp2 induces p27 after cyclopamine treatment, but the argument that p27 inhibits proliferation in this context is indirect. Is there another way to halt proliferation in the limb in absence of p27? Even if p27 is sufficient, it may not be necessary. Please rewrite the manuscript to provide a more cautious set of conclusions and acknowledge the various interpretations that cannot be excluded by the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Here, Pickering and colleagues present the next chapter in a thoughtful and comprehensive series of manuscripts that address longstanding questions about limb outgrowth and its integration with the anterior-posterior specification of digits. Specifically, they build on their 2016 Development paper wherein they demonstrated a surprising role for Shh signaling to restrict distal limb expansion; late exposure to cyclopamine causes digit bifurcations and polydactyly, paradoxical to the early requirement for Shh to expand the limb field. In this manuscript submitted to <italic>eLife</italic>, they take inspiration from in vitro studies of a cell cycle timer in cultured oligodendrocytes to test the hypothesis that a Cyclin D inhibitor, p27kip1, acts downstream of Shh to inhibit Cyclin D-dependent cell cycle progression. They end with a model that ties multiple works together with these new data to suggest Shh initially expands the limb field by activating Cyclin D while at the same time inducing Bmp2 expression. Bmp2 in turn activates p21Kip to 'put the brakes' on distal tissue expansion to establish the appropriate number, and identity, of resulting digits.</p><p>The authors first reconfirm a previous observation that Cyclin D2 is expressed in the polarizing region and show that its expression is dependent on Shh signaling. They then show p21Kip1 is also expressed in the polarizing region and downregulated by cylopamine, albeit with a temporal delay relative to Cyclin D2. They next test the hypothesis that CyclinD/cdk activity is required for the increased proliferation after late cyclopamine exposure by showing that a cyclin/cdk inhibitor is sufficient to stall cells in G1 and reduce distal limb width to near control in the presence of cyclopamine. The authors then carry these experiments out longer to test the hypothesis that Shh inhibition of cyclin/cdk prevents formation of extra digits. Indeed, inhibition of cyclin/cdk together with shh inhibition frequently reduces the number of digits from four to three.</p><p>Last, the authors investigate the mechanism that results in a delayed responsiveness of p21Kip1 downregulation after cyclopamine exposure. Inspired by the fact that Bmps are known to regulate Cip/Kip expression, and the responsiveness of Bmp2 to cyclopamine, they test the hypothesis that restoring Bmp2 expression by bead implantation after cyclopamine treatment will prevent the loss of p21Kip1 expression. I think that this simple and elegant experiment is the greatest strength of the paper. It allows the authors to present a more complete model of early cyclin D2 activation followed by p21Kip1 expression that is delayed by dependence on the intermediate upregulation of Bmp2.</p><p>My major concerns are minimal as I think these data are complete and compelling. However, a few corrections are essential.</p><p>1) The final paragraph of the Introduction is abruptly short and should be expanded a little to set the stage for the rest of the manuscript. This is a stylistic criticism.</p><p>2) The graphed results of FACS in Figure 1, Figure 4A and B, and Figure 6C have no standard deviations per time point and no indication of how many times these experiments were repeated to show reproducibility.</p><p>3) Please calculate and report the p value for Cyc+PD versus DMEM in Figure 4C, since I suspect there is no difference.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Description of this manuscript:</p><p>In this manuscript, Pickering and colleagues report that Sonic hedgehog (Shh) stimulates proliferation of cells in the polarising region of the chick wing bud by controlling the cell cycle gene Cyclin D2, and at later stages Shh inhibits overproliferation by activating Bmp2-p27kip1. In a series of experimental manipulations of chick wing buds, they show that blocking hedgehog signalling causes polarising region cells to over-proliferate, leading to polydactyly (extra digits), and that this affect can be prevented by either application of Bmp2 protein or by inhibition of cyclin D. Inhibition of Shh by cyclopamine results in loss of Cyclin D2 within 8 hours and p27kip1 within 30 hours, Application of Bmp2 blocks cyclopamine-induced over-proliferation and extra digit formation, and this is associated with a rescue of p27kip1 expression.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Overall, I found this to be an interesting study that takes advantage of some unique advantages of the chick limb system and builds on the previous work from the Towers lab. However, there are several major weaknesses, including over-interpretation of the results in several places, holes in the experimental logic, lack of statistical support for conclusions, and deficiencies in scholarship. These issues prevent me from recommending publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. There are also some concerns that this study is an incremental advance over previous work, and therefore it may be of interest to a specialized but not a general readership.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Previous work, some published more than a decade ago, showed that disruption of Shh signaling causes an increase in the percentage of cells in G1, and that Shh directly regulates entry of cells into S-phase of the cell cycle. Surprisingly, the authors cite only their own studies from 2016. It would enhance the paper and improve the scholarship if the authors could acknowledge previous studies and discuss how their results fit within the context of this previous work. Some of these papers have addressed very similar questions to those examined in this manuscript, both in the limb and in other developing systems. Examples of such publications are Zhu et al., 2008; Seifert et al., 2018; Komada et al., 2013; Fink et al., 2018.</p><p>2) They show that application of PD0332991, a D cyclin/cdk inhibitor, increases the percentage of G1 cells in control and cyclopamine-treated limbs. In the Results section, they conclude &quot;These findings suggest that Shh signalling prevents the D cyclin-dependent over-proliferation of polarising region cells.&quot; This is an over-interpretation of the results. All that this experiment shows is that the PD0332991 inhibits cell cycle progression, which is the known function of the drug.</p><p>3) Results section: The experiments in which PD0332991 and cyclopamine were applied in succession resulted in 1-2-2 digit patterns in 40% of the wings. Normal digit pattern is 1-2-3. 5. Treatment with cyclopamine alone produces either an extra digit 2 (14%), an extra digit 3 (36%), or a normal digit pattern (50% – Figure 5F). The variable effects of cyclopamine alone, and the frequency of digit pattern changes under each condition, calls out for a statistical analysis to determine the significance of the effect. In their interpretation of these results, they state, &quot;these findings demonstrate that Shh signalling prevents the D cyclin-dependent formation of an additional digit&quot;. This is an overly strong conclusion based on an overinterpretation of some rather indirect evidence.</p><p>4) Results section. &quot;The percentage of polarising region cells in G1-phase of the cell cycle increases to 74.3% in Bmp2-treated wing buds compared with 64.1% in control PBS bead treated buds at 24 h&quot;. Is this a significant change? Throughout the paper, the absence of statistical analysis underlines the results.</p><p>5) In the cyclopamine + Bmp2 experiments (Results section), it is stated, &quot;of the cyclopamine-treated wings with four digits in their left wings, 47% have the digit pattern of 1-2-2-2…and 53% have the pattern 1-2-2-3…&quot; The problem here is that they report percentages of the…treated wings that developed four digits. How many of the treated embryos developed four digits? It is critical to know the size/percentage/number of individuals in the affected and unaffected groups in order to interpret the distribution of digit patterns within the affected group.</p><p>6) If p27kip1 is integral to the limb polarising region timer, then one would expect deletion of p27kip1 enhance to perturb limb patterning. However, this experiment was done in 1996 by Fero et al., Kiyokawa et al., and Nakayama et al., but there were no reported effects on the limbs. How does the finding that p27kip1 is dispensable for limb development affect the conclusion (Discussion section) that &quot;a cell cycle timer involving p27kip1 also operates in vivo to control tissue growth and patterning of a major signalling centre during embryogenesis&quot;?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An autoregulatory cell cycle timer integrates growth and specification in chick wing digit development&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>While the manuscript has been much improved, reviewer 2 continues to worry about statistical analysis. I have included the full reviews and ask you to fix these remaining issues. Although <italic>eLife</italic> does not normally allow for multiple rounds of review, I am willing to make an exception in this case since I think you can deal with this remaining concerns in a relatively short period of time without further experimentation but with better analysis. However, no further rounds of revision will be possible, so I urge you to address in detail each of the points raised by the reviewer below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The resubmitted manuscript by Pickering and colleagues is improved by an expanded Introduction and Discussion section. I also appreciate the revised summary statements of the conclusions that explicitly state the results without over-interpreting the data and the more rigorous presentation of data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>1) In the review of the original submission, I noted that this advance was incremental relative to their previous (2014 and 2016) papers on this topic, but my comment was not addressed during the open comment period or in the editor's letter to the authors. Therefore, in fairness to the authors, I considered that point to be moot when reviewing the revised version of the paper and my comments are restricted to the data and interpretation. No further action is required.</p><p>2) I have reconsidered my comments on Figure 5. I was critical of the analysis of the variable digit phenotypes that were obtained in the two treatments and I suggested that they examine the statistical significance of the variation. Although the authors report the differences in specific digit patterns, their conclusions are based entirely on whether the limbs have 3 digits or 4 digits; the variation in digit patterns was ignored. I accept that they have chosen to bin the data this way, and the effect of PD0332991 treatment on digit number is clear. If the range of variation produced by cyclopamine is not considered in the interpretation of results, then there is no reason to perform the statistical test that I suggested in my previous reviews. I view this as the authors' prerogative. No further action is required.</p><p>3) In Figure 7, the use of 3 graphs to display the results of Bmp treatment is unnecessary. The number of individuals unaffected by cycloplamine (panel C) can be stated in the text and the graph eliminated. To make it more clear that panel h has broken-out the 1223 and 123 categories of panel D, I suggest using the same colors.</p><p>4) For the experiments that compare the number of cells in G1 between two treatment groups (such as cyclopamine+Bmp2 vs. cyclopamine+PBS) in Figure 1, Figure 4 and Figure 6, I suggested that they use the Student's t-test, which is the appropriate test to compare a quantitative, single dependent variable (the number of cells in G1) between 2 groups. Instead, the authors used a Pearson's chi-squared test and argued that carrying out a t-test would require additional experiments.</p><p>I found it difficult to understand how running a different statistical test on the same data set could require additional experiments. However, after reading this paper several times, I now suspect that the central problem concerns a disparity between the description of the data in the results and the description of the data in the methods. Throughout the text, they refer to changes in &quot;the number of G1-phase cells&quot; or &quot;the number of cells in G1&quot;. This implies that they compared the numbers of cells in G1 between groups. However, the methods section describes the use of DNA content to assign cells to G1, S, or G2/M, and these categorical assignments were expressed as a percentage of the total cell number (Materials and methods section). Therefore, they are actually comparing between 2 groups the percentage of cells in 1 of the 3 categories, which is not the same as comparing the number of cells in G1 in 2 treatment groups. In other words, it appears that they are comparing categorical variables rather than a quantitative variable. If this is the case, then they can probably fix the problem by providing a more accurate description of the data in the Results section.</p><p>5) Finally, although I have offered recommendations on the appropriate statistical tests, I believe that reviewers should not dictate how authors conduct their studies. The authors have my comments and the reasoning behind my advice, so I will now leave it to the authors to proceed as they see fit.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47625.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Introduction and the discussion should be substantially expanded.

The 0-24 hour time-points in Figure 4B and 0-6 hour time-points in Figures6C also show some of this previous data. This data is not essential for these figures, but we felt that it would help the reader understand the experiments. All other time-points show new data. We have explained this in the revised paper.</p><p>In our flow cytometry experiments we analyse between 5,000 and 12,000 cells from 12-15 polarising regions (we need to pool this many polarising regions to get enough cells to produce accurate counts). Therefore, this ensures that our results are based on many replicas of the same experimental manipulation and the large number of cells counted provides very accurate data. For instance, we have shown that G1-phase numbers between left and right wing buds of the same embryos differ by less than 1% (Chinnaiya et al., 2014). In addition, when we carefully stage-match tissue from separate embryos incubated at the same time, we also achieve similar values (Chinnaiya et al., 2014). Thus, when we perform Pearson’s chi-squared analyses, a significantly different result generally equates to a &gt;1-2% difference in G1-phase numbers between the control and experimental tissue (Chinnaiya, Tickle and Towers, 2014). The differences in G1 numbers in the key experiments in this paper range between 10% and 32%, which represent extremely significant changes.

There are also some concerns that this study is an incremental advance over previous work, and therefore it may be of interest to a specialized but not a general readership.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Previous work, some published more than a decade ago, showed that disruption of Shh signaling causes an increase in the percentage of cells in G1, and that Shh directly regulates entry of cells into S-phase of the cell cycle. Surprisingly, the authors cite only their own studies from 2016. It would enhance the paper and improve the scholarship if the authors could acknowledge previous studies and discuss how their results fit within the context of this previous work. Some of these papers have addressed very similar questions to those examined in this manuscript, both in the limb and in other developing systems. Examples of such publications are Zhu et al., 2008; Seifert et al., 2018; Komada et al., 2013; Fink et al., 2018.</p></disp-quote><p>We have broadened our review of the literature and we thank the reviewer for these helpful suggestions. It is widely regarded that Shh is a mitogen and it was difficult to decide which studies to concentrate on. It was also known previously that Shh could inhibit proliferation. We did not intend to focus on our previous work but much of it created the premise of the current paper. However, we have now cited papers that describe links between Shh and D cyclins and their inhibitors. In terms of discussion related to these points, we have suggested that it is important to analyse Shh signalling over time, as it is likely to play both anti-proliferative and proliferative roles in may tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) They show that application of PD0332991, a D cyclin/cdk inhibitor, increases the percentage of G1 cells in control and cyclopamine-treated limbs. In the Results section, they conclude &quot;These findings suggest that Shh signalling prevents the D cyclin-dependent over-proliferation of polarising region cells.&quot; This is an over-interpretation of the results. All that this experiment shows is that the PD0332991 inhibits cell cycle progression, which is the known function of the drug.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point that we have now amended the Results section. ‘These findings show that D cyclin inhibition can prevent the over-proliferation of polarising region cells caused by the loss of Shh signalling.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Results section: The experiments in which PD0332991 and cyclopamine were applied in succession resulted in 1-2-2 digit patterns in 40% of the wings. Normal digit pattern is 1-2-3. 5. Treatment with cyclopamine alone produces either an extra digit 2 (14%), an extra digit 3 (36%), or a normal digit pattern (50% – Figure 5F). The variable effects of cyclopamine alone, and the frequency of digit pattern changes under each condition, calls out for a statistical analysis to determine the significance of the effect. In their interpretation of these results, they state, &quot;these findings demonstrate that Shh signalling prevents the D cyclin-dependent formation of an additional digit&quot;. This is an overly strong conclusion based on an overinterpretation of some rather indirect evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that this point refers to essential requirement outlined by the Editor. We have used Chi squared tests ‘to determine whether 21/42 wings with four digits (regardless of identity) in cyclopamine treated embryos is different from 2/23 wings with four digits in cyclopamine and PD0332991’. We have also softened our conclusion – Line 195-197. ‘Therefore, these findings demonstrate that D cyclin inhibition prevents the formation of an additional digit following the loss of Shh signalling.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Results section. &quot;The percentage of polarising region cells in G1-phase of the cell cycle increases to 74.3% in Bmp2-treated wing buds compared with 64.1% in control PBS bead treated buds at 24 h&quot;. Is this a significant change? Throughout the paper, the absence of statistical analysis underlines the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Previously, we have shown that G1-phase numbers between left and right wing buds of the same embryos differ by less than 1% (Chinnaiya et al., 2014). In addition, when we carefully stage-match tissue from separate embryos incubated at the same time, we also achieve similar values (Chinnaiya et al., 2014). When we perform Pearson’s chi-squared analyses, a significantly different result generally equates to a &gt;1-2% difference in G1-phase numbers between the control and experimental tissue. The differences in G1 numbers in the key experiments in this paper range between 10% and 32%, which represent extremely significant changes. We have added these p values to both the text and figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the cyclopamine + Bmp2 experiments (Results section), it is stated, &quot;of the cyclopamine-treated wings with four digits in their left wings, 47% have the digit pattern of 1-2-2-2…and 53% have the pattern 1-2-2-3…&quot; The problem here is that they report percentages of the…treated wings that developed four digits. How many of the treated embryos developed four digits? It is critical to know the size/percentage/number of individuals in the affected and unaffected groups in order to interpret the distribution of digit patterns within the affected group.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included this data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) If p27kip1 is integral to the limb polarising region timer, then one would expect deletion of p27kip1 enhance to perturb limb patterning. However, this experiment was done in 1996 by Fero et al., Kiyokawa et al., and Nakayama et al., but there were no reported effects on the limbs. How does the finding that p27kip1 is dispensable for limb development affect the conclusion (Discussion section) that &quot;a cell cycle timer involving p27kip1 also operates in vivo to control tissue growth and patterning of a major signalling centre during embryogenesis&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>There have been many reports of the deletion of cell cycle genes including D cyclins and their inhibitors producing no effects on mouse limb patterning. It is possible that the embryonic cell cycle is extremely robust to such germline knockouts. For instance, mice with deletion of all three D cyclin genes develop to quite late stages of embryogenesis because of compensation by other cyclins. Additionally, Cyclin D2 knockout mice have not been reported to have limb defects. However, the predicted constitutive expression of Cyclin D2 does cause limb defects in MPPH patients, suggesting the cell cycle is unable compensate. Therefore, knockout analyses in mice would have also suggested that Cyclin D2 is not important for limb development, but our data and interpretation of MPPH patients would indicate this is not the case. We have discussed all of these points in relation to p27 and Discussion section. We have also softened our conclusion. ‘Our work extends these earlier studies, by providing evidence for a role of p27<sup>kip1</sup> in cell cycle timing during embryogenesis’.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the manuscript has been much improved, reviewer 2 continues to worry about statistical analysis. I have included the full reviews and ask you to fix these remaining issues. Although eLife does not normally allow for multiple rounds of review, I am willing to make an exception in this case since I think you can deal with this remaining concerns in a relatively short period of time without further experimentation but with better analysis. However, no further rounds of revision will be possible, so I urge you to address in detail each of the points raised by the reviewer below.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) In the review of the original submission, I noted that this advance was incremental relative to their previous (2014 and 2016) papers on this topic, but my comment was not addressed during the open comment period or in the editor's letter to the authors. Therefore, in fairness to the authors, I considered that point to be moot when reviewing the revised version of the paper and my comments are restricted to the data and interpretation. No further action is required.</p><p>2) I have reconsidered my comments on Figure 5. I was critical of the analysis of the variable digit phenotypes that were obtained in the two treatments and I suggested that they examine the statistical significance of the variation. Although the authors report the differences in specific digit patterns, their conclusions are based entirely on whether the limbs have 3 digits or 4 digits; the variation in digit patterns was ignored. I accept that they have chosen to bin the data this way, and the effect of PD0332991 treatment on digit number is clear. If the range of variation produced by cyclopamine is not considered in the interpretation of results, then there is no reason to perform the statistical test that I suggested in my previous reviews. I view this as the authors' prerogative. No further action is required.</p><p>3) In Figure 7, the use of 3 graphs to display the results of Bmp treatment is unnecessary. The number of individuals unaffected by cycloplamine (panel C) can be stated in the text and the graph eliminated. To make it more clear that panel h has broken-out the 1223 and 123 categories of panel D, I suggest using the same colors.</p></disp-quote><p>We have eliminated the graph (panel C) and we have changed the colour of panel H (now G) to purple to avoid confusion with the categories.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For the experiments that compare the number of cells in G1 between two treatment groups (such as cyclopamine+Bmp2 vs. cyclopamine+PBS) in Figure 1, Figure 4 and Figure 6, I suggested that they use the Student's t-test, which is the appropriate test to compare a quantitative, single dependent variable (the number of cells in G1) between 2 groups. Instead, the authors used a Pearson's chi-squared test and argued that carrying out a t-test would require additional experiments.</p><p>I found it difficult to understand how running a different statistical test on the same data set could require additional experiments. However, after reading this paper several times, I now suspect that the central problem concerns a disparity between the description of the data in the results and the description of the data in the methods. Throughout the text, they refer to changes in &quot;the number of G1-phase cells&quot; or &quot;the number of cells in G1&quot;. This implies that they compared the numbers of cells in G1 between groups. However, the methods section describes the use of DNA content to assign cells to G1, S, or G2/M, and these categorical assignments were expressed as a percentage of the total cell number (Materials and methods section). Therefore, they are actually comparing between 2 groups the percentage of cells in 1 of the 3 categories, which is not the same as comparing the number of cells in G1 in 2 treatment groups. In other words, it appears that they are comparing categorical variables rather than a quantitative variable. If this is the case, then they can probably fix the problem by providing a more accurate description of the data in the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>When we have first described flow cytometry we have added: “Note for all Chi-square analyses the percentage of cells in G1-phase in control and experimental samples were compared to the percentage of cells in S/G2 and M phase”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Finally, although I have offered recommendations on the appropriate statistical tests, I believe that reviewers should not dictate how authors conduct their studies. The authors have my comments and the reasoning behind my advice, so I will now leave it to the authors to proceed as they see fit.</p></disp-quote><p>We have continued to use Chi-square tests to maintain consistency with our previous papers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
