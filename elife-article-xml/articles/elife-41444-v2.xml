operates on the 3’UTRs of mRNAs that are directed for NMD in the cytoplasm. Here we offer evidence, obtained from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, that UPF1 constantly moves between the nucleus and cytoplasm by a mechanism that requires its RNA helicase activity. UPF1 is associated, genome-wide, with nascent RNAs at most of the active Pol II transcription sites and at some Pol III-transcribed genes, as demonstrated microscopically on the polytene chromosomes of salivary glands and by ChIP-seq analysis in S2 cells. Intron recognition seems to interfere with association and translocation of UPF1 on nascent pre-mRNAs, and cells depleted of UPF1 show defects in the release of mRNAs from transcription sites and their export from the nucleus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NMD</kwd><kwd>Transcription</kwd><kwd>mRNA export</kwd><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>polytene chromosomes</kwd><kwd>RNA helicases</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RPG-2014-291</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brogna</surname><given-names>Saverio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>9340/Z/09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brogna</surname><given-names>Saverio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M022757/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brogna</surname><given-names>Saverio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M017982/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hebenstreit</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L006340/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hebenstreit</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The author declare that funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>UPF1 associates with nascent transcripts and plays a broad role in nuclear processes of gene expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>UPF1 (UP-Frameshift-1) is a universally conserved eukaryotic protein that was first identified in a <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> genetic screen for mutations that enhance up-frameshift tRNA suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Culbertson et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Leeds et al., 1992</xref>), and gained other names – including <italic>NAM7</italic> (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) and <italic>SMG2</italic> (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>) – from other genetic screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Altamura et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hodgkin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pulak and Anderson, 1993</xref>). Cells that lack active UPF1 accumulate mRNAs with nonsense, frameshift or other mutant alleles that introduce a premature translation termination codon (PTC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Leeds et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pulak and Anderson, 1993</xref>).</p><p>These observations are generally interpreted as evidence that UPF1 and related proteins are primarily required for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a conserved eukaryotic mRNA surveillance mechanism that detects and destroys mRNAs on which translation terminates prematurely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fatscher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">He and Jacobson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Karousis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kurosaki and Maquat, 2016</xref>). NMD is mainly regarded as a quality control mechanism that prevents cells from wastefully making truncated (and potentially toxic) proteins and that regulates the selective expression of specific mRNA isoforms during cell homeostasis and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goetz and Wilkinson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lykke-Andersen and Jensen, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The exact role of UPF1 in NMD is uncertain though. Standard models postulate that UPF1 monitors translation termination on ribosomes by interacting with a peptide release factor (eRF1 or eRF3). However, recent reports on mammalian translation systems have suggested, in contrast to earlier reports on other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Czaplinski et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ivanov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kashima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Keeling et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Singh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2001</xref>), that UPF1 does not bind to either of these. They suggested, instead, that UPF3B may contact release factors, slow the termination of translation and facilitate post-termination release of ribosomes – and so fulfil the termination monitoring role that has been assigned to UPF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Neu-Yilik et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>UPF1 is an ATP-driven helicase that unwinds RNA secondary structures and so can displace RNA-bound proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chakrabarti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Czaplinski et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fiorini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Franks et al., 2010</xref>). UPF1 is predominantly associated with 3’UTRs of cytoplasmic mRNAs which indicates that it might be selectively recruited to or activated on NMD targets with abnormally long 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Karousis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kurosaki and Maquat, 2016</xref>). However, UPF1 appears to bind mRNAs fairly indiscriminately, regardless of the position of the stop codon or the PTC and whether or not the mRNA possess NMD-inducing features such as an abnormally long 3’UTR or an exon junction downstream of the stop codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hogg and Goff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hurt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zünd et al., 2013</xref>). UPF1 helicase activity is required for NMD, but how it helps to target particular transcripts for NMD remains unclear. In view of these and other perplexing observations, it has also been questioned whether cells do possess any such mechanism to discriminate between PTCs and normal stop codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brogna et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>UPF1 is most abundant in the cytoplasm where its roles discussed above depend on ribosomal translation and occur on cytoplasmic mRNAs. A fraction of UPF1 was expected in the nucleus though, as the protein traffics in and out of the nucleus in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ajamian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mendell et al., 2002</xref>). Some studies have concluded that within the nucleus UPF1 plays a distinct and direct role in DNA replication, which would be unrelated to gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Azzalin and Lingner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azzalin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carastro et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chawla et al., 2011</xref>). However, the negative effects that depletion of UPF1 has on DNA replication and cell division could be an indirect consequence of NMD suppression altering the expression of genes required in such processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Varsally and Brogna, 2012</xref>). Moreover, there is evidence that nuclear UPF1 might contribute directly to RNA processing, at least in specific instances, and is required for nuclear export of HIV-1 genomic RNA in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ajamian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Turris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Flury et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Varsally and Brogna, 2012</xref>). Additionally, CLIP data indicate direct binding of UPF1 with the abundant nuclear-localised metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zünd et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we show direct evidence that UPF1 is globally involved in nuclear processing of mRNAs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. First, we demonstrate that UPF1 is a highly mobile protein that constantly shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and its distribution in the cell, with more in the cytoplasm than the nucleus, depends on its RNA binding properties and approximately reflects that of mRNA. UPF1 associates with nascent transcripts on chromosomes – mostly with Pol II transcribed, but also with some Pol III-transcribed genes. Relatively more of the transcript-associated UPF1 is bound with exons than with introns, suggesting that intron recognition might act as a roadblock to the 5’-to-3’ transit of UPF1 along the pre-mRNA. Most strikingly, UPF1 is needed for the efficient release of polyadenylated mRNAs from most chromosomal transcription sites and for their export from the nuclei. These observations indicate that UPF1 starts scanning pre-mRNA transcripts whilst they are still being assembled into ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes on chromosomes and suggest that UPF1 fulfils previously unrecognised role(s) in facilitating nuclear processes of gene expression and mRNA export. The broad and dynamic association of UPF1 with mRNAs redefines it from being primarily an NMD-inducing factor to being a global player in mRNA processing in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm, and might also explain why none of the prevailing models satisfactorily explain how UPF1 could target specific transcripts to NMD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Drosophila anti-UPF1 antibodies</title><p>To explore the functions of UPF1, we generated three monoclonal anti-peptide antibodies that target regions of <italic>Drosophila</italic> UPF1 outside the RNA helicase domain: one epitope in the N-terminal flanking regions (antibody 1C13 against Pep2), and two near the C-terminus (Ab 7D17 <italic>vs.</italic> Pep11; and Ab 7B12 <italic>vs.</italic> Pep12) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The antibodies also detected a second, larger band of the expected molecular weight in extracts from transfected S2 cells that over-express UPF1-GFP. Unless otherwise indicated, antibody 7B12 was used in the experiments described below.

UPF1 was most abundant in the cytoplasm and perinuclear region, and there was also distinct but less intense nuclear staining, mainly around the chromosomes and around the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A similar subcellular distribution of UPF1 was detected with the remaining two antibodies tested in wild-type salivary glands; and, the signal was drastically reduced in UPF1-RNAi glands, consistent with all three antibodies being specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Following cell fractionation of S2 cells, α-tubulin and RNA Pol II were, as expected, restricted to the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively – and a small proportion of the UPF1 co-purified with nuclei whilst most was in the cytoplasmic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), consistent with the subcellular localisation detected by immunostaining.</p><p>UPF1 was also detected both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus in other larval tissues, with varying immunostaining intensities. Perinuclear UPF1 was more apparent in salivary glands that are at a later stage of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>); and it was also obvious in Malpighian tubules and gut, which also showed an increased intra-nuclear UPF1 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In enterocytes (EC), staining was similar between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, while the most intense UPF1 signal was perinuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The perinuclear presence was also apparent in salivary glands expressing GFP-UPF1, where UPF1 co-localised with binding of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) – a lectin that predominantly interacts with O-GlcNAc-modified nuclear pore proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mizuguchi-Hata et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Since UPF1 is present both in the cytoplasm and nuclei, with relative quantities varying between cell-types, we wondered how rapidly UPF1 shuttles between cell compartments.

FLIP revealed that sustained photobleaching of a small area of the cytoplasm led, within the continuously illuminated area, to an initial rapid decrease in GFP-UPF1fluorescence followed by a continued slower reduction. Fluorescence also declined steadily both elsewhere in the cytoplasm, and, more slowly, within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These observations demonstrate ongoing diffusion of UPF1 throughout the cytoplasm, and that nuclear UPF1 can leave the nucleus and enter the photodepletable cytoplasmic UPF1 pool at a fairly steady rate. The FRAP studies monitored the speed with which unbleached GFP-UPF1 diffuses into and repopulates a photobleached region of the cytoplasm or nucleus. Almost all of the UPF1 in each cell compartment was rapidly mobile, with the halftime for repopulation of each bleached area being only a few seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>UPF1 shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm requires its RNA helicase activity</title><p>Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling has been reported in HeLa cells, with UPF1 accumulating in the nuclei following treatment with leptomycin B (LMB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mendell et al., 2002</xref>), a drug that selectively inhibits CRM1-mediated protein export from the nucleus in most eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fukuda et al., 1997</xref>).

We considered that 5’ splice sites (5’ss) at the start of introns, where the initial U1 snRNP spliceosome complex would bind, might act as road-blocks to UPF1 translocation along nascent pre-mRNAs, hence, removal of U1 might allow UPF1 to move across the intron (Model 2).

Moreover, genes with the most prominent exon-biased UPF1 enrichment, such as <italic>Xrp1</italic>, are efficiently co-transcriptionally spliced (see the Nascent RNA-seq profile in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), whereas genes with no detectable exon-biased UPF1 enrichment, such as <italic>CG5059</italic>, are poorly co-transcriptionally spliced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and are typically expressed at low levels, as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Khodor et al., 2011</xref>).

In wild-type cells poly(A) was abundant and fairly evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, as would be expected for mature mRNA, and there was relatively little in the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, panels I-III). By contrast, the nuclei of UPF1-depleted cells retained a substantial amount of poly(A), and the cells appeared to contain less cytoplasmic poly(A) than wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, panels IV-VI).

Additionally, since UPF1 was obviously not associated with 2C (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), the poly(A) accumulation at 2C in wild-type cells may be a consequence of lack of UPF1 at this transcription site.</p><p>Both the number of transcriptional sites showing poly(A) accumulation and the amount of poly(A) RNA associated with these sites were strikingly increased in UPF1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, right panel).

In contrast, we present evidence that UPF1 moves constantly within and between cell compartments, and that this shuttling depends on the ATPase activity of the RNA helicase domain, which is required for the dynamic binding and dissociation of UPF1 from mRNAs in both yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Franks et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, UPF1 ATPase domain resides within a region previously thought to contain an atypical nuclear localisation signal in mammalian cells, which when deleted, abolished nuclear UPF1 accumulation following LMB treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mendell et al., 2002</xref>). However, in view of UPF1 ATPase activity being required for this shuttling, we propose that typical UPF1 subcellular distribution, with more of the protein present in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus, is primarily a consequence of its continued association with abundant RNA cargos that are being continuously exported out of the nucleus. The NES-dependent CRM1 export pathway is not a major mRNA nuclear export mechanism in <italic>Drosophila</italic> nor in other well-studied organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herold et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hutten and Kehlenbach, 2007</xref>), yet it is required for the export of vastly more abundant cargos consisting of RNP particles like ribosomal subunits and the signal recognition particle (SRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hutten and Kehlenbach, 2007</xref>). Our data indicate that UPF1 might bind with SRP, as it strongly associated with the two loci encoding the 7SL RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which make the SRP scaffold. However, UPF1 may not be binding the individual 40S and 60S subunits, as less UPF1 is detected in the centre of the nucleolus than in the remainder of the nucleus - discussed further below.</p><p>Within the nucleus we found UPF1 associated with many actively transcribing Pol II sites, to which it seems mainly to be recruited by an interaction with nascent pre-mRNA. More of the transcript-tethered UPF1 is associated with exons than with flanking introns. Splicing might enhance UPF1 binding, particularly with downstream exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>, Model 1), however, since UPF1 also associates with intron-less genes, splicing may not be necessary for its loading on nascent transcripts. The mechanism responsible for UPF1 being associated more with exons than with introns remains therefore to be elucidated. Possibly, UPF1 associates with all Pol II nascent transcripts, but on intron-containing pre-mRNAs, splice site recognition interferes with intron binding. Consistent with this interpretation, in the two genes we examined (<italic>Xrp1</italic> and <italic>Socs36E</italic>), the exon vs. intron bias in UPF1 binding is lost in cells depleted of the spliceosome component U1 snRNP. This suggests that, when U1 snRNP is bound to the 5’ss of an intron at the initial stage of splicing, it may hinder UPF1 translocation along the pre-mRNA and cause it to dissociate (see the Model two we propose in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). UPF1 scanning of pre-mRNAs may therefore influence 5’ splice sites recognition and affect splicing directly; changes in the relative concentrations of many alternatively spliced transcripts have been reported in UPF1-depleted S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Simple affinity of UPF1 for RNA is not likely to be the primary reason why UPF1 associates with some nascent transcripts, for several reasons: UPF1 does not associate with some highly transcribed Pol II genes, such as spliceosomal snRNAs; nor with snRNA U6 or other highly active Pol III genes; nor with rRNA genes transcribed by Pol I; there would be no differential affinity for introns <italic>vs</italic>. exons within a transcript; and UPF1 appears to be excluded from the RNA-packed centre of the nucleolus where rRNA genes are transcribed and ribosomal subunits are assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McLeod et al., 2014</xref>). What features of some nascent transcripts, most often of Pol II-transcribed genes, dictate that UPF1 becomes associated with them remain to be determined. One possible candidate would be the 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap that is added co-transcriptionally to the 5’end of pre-mRNAs but not to Pol I and Pol III transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ghosh and Lima, 2010</xref>). Moreover, the m7G caps added to snRNAs and other small non-mRNA Pol II transcripts are further modified though by hypermethylation to generate 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine(m(3)G) structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mouaikel et al., 2002</xref>). Although this hypermethylation occurs after the transcripts have been exported to the cytoplasm in mammalian cells, perhaps this modification may occur in the nucleus instead in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mouaikel et al., 2002</xref>), and this might explain why these classes of transcripts are not associated with UPF1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>The association of UPF1 with nascent transcripts seems to be dynamic, and its putative 5’-to-3’ scanning along RNA is likely to be fast and, at least on intron-containing pre-mRNAs, discontinuous. This pattern also suggests that when it encounters a steric block that cannot be removed, UPF1 must be capable of quickly dissociating and re-loading elsewhere on the transcript. In vitro, UPF1 can translocate along RNAs over long distances – but only at a maximum scanning velocity of ~80 base/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fiorini et al., 2015</xref>), which is much slower than the 2–3 kb/min of Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fiorini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fukaya et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, UPF1 either translocates along RNA faster in vivo, or its scanning is not processive as envisaged, or it is factually piggybacking on another entity that is capable of translocating on the RNA faster than UPF1. Although this machinery is unlikely to be the Pol II itself, as we found no evidence of a strong direct association of Pol II with UPF1.</p><p>Notably, we observed that less of UPF1 is associated with the 5’ proximal region of nascent transcripts, which, in some instances, coincides with the 5’UTR (see <italic>Actin5C</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). 5’UTRs are defined by the process of translation initiation, in which, following association with the mRNA’s 5’ cap, the 40S (carrying the initiator tRNA) migrates downstream until it recognises the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kozak, 1989</xref>). Less association of UPF1 with 5’UTRs might therefore signify that its binding to nascent transcripts is translation dependent, at least in some instances, and supports the view that ribosomes start scanning mRNAs cotranscriptionally; evidence of which has previously been reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Al-Jubran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brogna et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The most striking effects of UPF1 depletion were retention of poly(A) RNA at transcription sites and then its failure to be exported effectively from the nucleus. Mature mRNAs that have been cleaved and polyadenylated are normally expected to be speedily released from transcription sites, but our data show that this is not always the case. We have both: a) identified some sites on polytene chromosomes that apparently accumulate poly(A) RNA even in wild-type glands; and b) shown that most of the active Pol II genes accumulate poly(A) RNA in UPF1-depleted salivary glands. Poly(A) RNA accumulation in UPF1-depleted cells is most prominent at genes with which UPF1 associates strongly in wild-type, such as <italic>Actin5C</italic> (shown both microscopically and by ChIP-seq). Conversely, those few transcription sites at which poly(A) accumulates even in wild-type cells, may not normally be associated with UPF1, a striking example of which is the 2C transcription site on the polytene chromosomes, where poly(A) accumulation was most apparent, but no obvious UPF1 association was observed.</p><p>Evidence of retention of poly(A) and specific mRNAs in discrete nuclear foci or ‘dots’ has previously been reported in cells defective in RNA processing, initially in mRNA export and processing mutants in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jensen et al., 2001</xref>); and later in other cells in which one of several RNA processing reactions are impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abruzzi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Paul and Montpetit, 2016</xref>), including <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells carrying mutation in the RNA helicase P68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Buszczak and Spradling, 2006</xref>). Whether the previously described ‘dots’ correspond to the poly(A) clusters that accumulate in the inter-chromosomal spaces of UPF1-depleted nuclei and/or to accumulations of poly(A) at transcription sites, which we identified here, remains to be determined.</p><p>In summary, our results indicate that UPF1 plays an important genome-wide role in the release of mRNAs from transcription sites and their export to the cytoplasm, at least in <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary gland cells. Possibly, in the absence of UPF1 function, mRNPs acquire or retain native conformations that hinder their release from the chromosome and make them prone to aggregation and, consequently, cause nuclear retention. Such a global role of UPF1 could explain, better than its involvement in NMD, why this protein is universally conserved in eukaryotes, why its depletion affects the expression of a large fraction of the genome, and possibly why expression of human UPF1 in rat models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) overcomes the pathology caused by over-expression or mutation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barmada et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jackson et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>The following antibodies were used for immunostaining: mouse anti-UPF1 (described as 7B12, 7D17 and 1C13 in this paper, typically diluted 1:100), mouse IgM anti-Ser2 Pol II (AB_10143905, H5, Covance, 1:500), mouse anti-hnRNPA1 (Hrb87F, P11, 1:50) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hovemann et al., 1991</xref>), mouse anti-GFP (<bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://antibodyregistry.org/AB_627695">AB_627695</ext-link></bold>, B-2, Santa Cruz, 1:200), Tetramethylrhodamine Conjugate Wheat Germ Agglutinin (Thermo Fisher, W7024, 10 µg/mL).

Pre-processing, assembly and mapping of the sequencing reads in the FASTQ files were performed by the SeqMan NGen software of this package automatically after selecting the NCBI <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Dm6 genome release and accompanying annotations. Assembly and alignment output files for each genome contig were then analysed with the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dnastar.com/t-seqmanpro.aspx">ArrayStar</ext-link> and GenVision Pro software (from the same package) to view and compare read profiles on the genome. Profiles at selected regions were saved as high-resolution images.</p><p>To perform the metagene analyses, an index for Dm6 was downloaded from the HISAT2 website. HISAT2 v2.1.0 was then used to align the FASTQ files on it. The resulting SAM files were converted to BAM format, sorted, and indexed with Samtools 1.6. For the cytoplasmic RNA-seq data, the NCBI RefSeq gene annotations for Dm6 were downloaded as a refGene table from UCSC Table Browser (genome.ucsc.edu). The LiBiNorm tool was then used to produce read counts per gene in an HTSeq-count compatible format based on the refGene file (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dyer et al., 2019</xref>). Transcript lengths were also obtained from the refGene file and used together with total mapped sequencing reads to convert counts into RPKM values. For both ChIP-seq and nascent RNA-seq data, the BAM files were converted to Bedgraph files. This was carried out with the genomeCoverageBed command and options -bga and -ibam from the Bedtools v2.26.0 suite. Custom Perl scripts were then used to filter the Dm6 annotations either for genes separated by a minimum distance to avoid overlapping signals or RNA-seq expression levels. Subsequently, custom scripts were used to extract the signal from the Bedgraph files for each entry in the filtered gene list. A single base resolution was used for flanking regions, while the signal in gene bodies was binned into 16 bins to take account of different gene lengths. Each dataset was normalised by the total mapped sequencing reads in that dataset. Cross-referencing between different datasets was done based on the ‘name’ field, after filtering the annotations for multiple entries with the identical name.</p><p>A custom script was used to extract the sequencing read coverage from the Bedgraph files for each exon/intron/exon region in the dm6 annotation file xon_fly_gene (downloaded from UCSC Table Browser). To normalise for any bias in the sequencing, the UPF1 signal of each exon or intron was divided by the average coverage in the input sample. The fold change of UPF1 signal/input signal in introns was compared to that of their flanking exons using Wilcox.test (two sided and unpaired) in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</ext-link>). This analysis was done using either all introns annotated in Dm6 (151623) or those longer than 100 bp (76708). In either case flanking exons are significantly more enriched than introns. Here we have shown the result of analysis using just the longer introns as these were considered to be more informative because of the predicted lower resolution of ChIP at discriminating between closely adjacent sequences and because of the lower sequencing coverage of shorter introns compared to longer introns. All ChIP-seq and RNA-seq raw sequencing data and Bedgraph files were deposited in the GEO repository (Accession No GSE116808). All custom scripts used in this study are provided in Source Code File 1.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Bob Michell for critically reading the manuscript and for many valuable discussions.

Using immunostainings on <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary gland chromosome spreads and in S2 cells, combined with ChIP-seq data, the authors confirm previous evidence that UPF1 is a shuttling protein that exchanges rapidly between cytoplasm and nucleus, with the majority of UPF1 residing in the cytoplasm. They further show that inside the nucleus, UPF1 localizes at sites of active transcription (primarily Pol II transcription sites), suggesting that UPF1 binds RNA co-transcriptionally. While the data for these findings is compelling and in my opinion would justify publication on its own (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 3, Figure 2, Figure 3— figure supplement 2, Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Figure S3 and Figure S5), the authors went on with additional experiments and further analysis of their ChIP-seq data that led them to conclude (i) that intron recognition interferes with UPF1 association, (ii) that Pol II tends to stall near transcription start sites in UPF1-depleted cells and (iii) that UPF1 depletion leads to nuclear mRNA retention. While the effect of UPF1 depletion on poly(A)+ RNA is striking, the conclusions of points (i) and (ii) are much less compelling and would need further investigation to gain more mechanistic insight, as detailed below. I therefore suggest removing these two parts from the manuscript. If confirmed by additional data, these findings can be published later in separate papers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Singh et al. describe the isolation of monoclonal antibodies that recognize <italic>Drosophila</italic> UPF1 and then utilize those reagents (primarily a single antibody) and UPF1-GFP to examine the subcellular distribution of UPF1 in a very large number of experiments.

Although the authors' conclusions raise the possibility of unforeseen functions for UPF1 they are contingent on two key questions: (1) how reliable are the antibody-based experiments? and (2) what feature of nascent RNA transcripts might be responsible for their apparent interactions with UPF1? Unfortunately, neither question is addressed adequately.</p><p>Specificity of the anti-UPF1 monoclonal antibodies was considered by comparisons of IF results with those obtained with UPF1-GFP, and examination of the consequences of RNAi knockdown of UPF1. UPF1-GFP results were markedly different from those obtained in IF analyses (e.g., Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 3, Figure S3, Figure S5), with the UPF1-GFP results largely showing cytoplasmic and (interesting) perinuclear staining without any significant nuclear staining, whereas the IF experiments seem to indicate that UPF1 can be found in all three locations. RNAi knockdown of UPF1 was only examined in salivary glands, where it depresses but does not eliminate anti-UPF1 staining of polytene chromosomes. Importantly, the authors did not present an experiment examining IF of S2 cells or mosaic tissues in which the UPF1 gene has been deleted. These critical experiments are a fairly commonplace approach to demonstrating unambiguous specificity of an antibody reagent. Other trivial controls that are lacking are results from an experiment using only the secondary antibody and IF localization of a protein definitively known to be cytoplasmic (using the same secondary antibody used for the UPF1 experiments).</p><p>Little insight is presented with regard to possible salient features of nascent transcripts that might mediate their putative interactions with UPF1. In light of known interactions between UPF1 and ribosomes it is surprising that the authors did not consider their own published work demonstrating that <italic>Drosophila</italic> ribosomal proteins harboring fluorescent tags manifest cytological distributions that are substantially similar to the putative UPF1 distributions seen in the current manuscript (Rugjee et al., 2013; Brogna et al., 2002). Clearly, one possibility is that the distributions seen in the present work are an indirect consequence of UPF1 interactions with chromosome-associated ribosomes or ribosomal proteins. Further, in light of UPF1's known role as an RNA-binding protein I would have expected that the authors would test whether UPF1 mutations known to impair the protein's RNA-binding capacity altered any of the cytological or ChIP-seq results seen by the authors.</p><p>[Editors' note: formal revisions were requested, following approval of the authors’ plan of action.

They argue that my alternative – and less exciting – interpretation of their data, namely that this might simply result from a substantial fraction of UPF1 binding only after intron removal, was unlikely to be valid. However, I do not understand why the fact that UPF1 was also found associated with intronless genes would challenge my interpretation of the data. With ChIP, one has no information at which stage during the transcription of an intronless gene UPF1 binds the nascent transcript.

As before, the authors begin by describing the isolation of monoclonal antibodies that recognize <italic>Drosophila</italic> UPF1 and then utilize those antibodies (primarily monoclonal antibody 7B12) and UPF1/GFP constructs to examine the subcellular distribution of UPF1 in S2 cells and salivary glands. Additional experiments evaluated ChIP-seq in S2 cells, and nuclear vs. cytoplasmic distributions in response to LMB treatment. Based predominantly on correlative data, the authors conclude that UPF1 appears to be associated with most of the active Pol II transcription sites and some Pol III-transcribed genes. As such, their conclusions represent a large leap from the conventional notion of UPF1 (and the NMD pathway) as a cytoplasmic mRNA surveillance system. Although the authors' conclusions raise the possibility of unforeseen functions for UPF1, they are contingent on two key questions: (1) how reliable are the IF, ChIP-seq, and GFP-UPF1 experiments? and (2) is it possible that the observed UPF1:RNA interactions are indirect?</p><p>Previously, I was concerned about the 7B12 antibody, particularly: (i) the very strong additional band that showed up in the westerns of Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and (ii) the lack of any tests of the antibody using UPF1 deletion/mosaic tissues. The current version of the manuscript continues to rely on RNAi knockdowns to substantiate MAb reliability, an approach that is less convincing than mosaics. Further, I find the vast overexpression of UPF1-GFP (~10x the level of endogenous UPF1), and its distribution differences relative to endogenous UPF1 to be additional concerns. In the ChIP-seq experiments, far too much attention is paid to hypothetical explanations for the differences in exon vs. intron signals (a difference that could simply be accounted for by co-transcriptional splicing) while little attention was paid to the ~10x lower recovery of UPF1 ChIP-seq vs. Pol II ChIP-seq.</p><p>Most importantly, the paper is comprised of a series of observations without definitive experiments that rule out indirect interactions as explanations for the observed results. The authors only make that concern worse by filling the discussion with numerous unsubstantiated explanations for the apparent shuttling, the ChIP-seq results, and the experiments with the UPF1 helicase mutant.</p><p>In short, this manuscript just isn't up to <italic>eLife</italic>'s standards.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41444.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors' note: the authors’ plan for revisions was approved and the authors made a formal revised submission.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that the manuscript should be &quot;streamlined&quot; to eliminate the less compelling data represented in the last two figures.

We examined this in S2 cells transfected with GFP tagged constructs expressing either wild-type UPF1 or a mutant version which carries a well characterized mutation in the ATPase domain that inhibits its RNA helicase activity, which is required for UPF1 dynamic binding and dissociation from mRNAs. The results showed the ATPase mutant version is not retained in the nucleus following incubation with LMB, unlike wild-type which readily accumulates in the nucleus (shown in the new Figure 2). In the revised Discussion section we therefore proposed that this rapid shuttling of UPF1 between nucleus and cytoplasm primarily depends on UPF1 binding to RNP cargos that are being continuously exported out of the nucleus, rather than on a direct or protein adapter-mediated interaction with CRM1, as previously suggested (referred in the manuscript). A more detailed molecular analysis of how UPF1 interacts with nascent mRNPs will need to be done in future, but we feel that this would go beyond what we aimed to demonstrate with this initial study – see our more detailed response to reviewer 1’s criticism about this point below.</p><p>We agree that it is plausible that a substantial fraction of UPF1 might associate indirectly with nascent transcripts through interactions with RNPs loaded on them. Following the reviewer suggestion, we have speculated what these RNPs and mechanisms might be in the revised Discussion section (see our detailed response to the reviewer below).</p><p>As advised, we have “streamlined” the manuscript. All the data that suggested a role of UPF1 in Pol II pausing were omitted (old Figure 5 and S10); these data remain public on the bioRxiv preprint and we hope to investigate this further and publish them at a later stage separately, as advised by reviewer 1. We have also omitted the data suggesting a role of UPF1 at the nuclear envelope (old Figure S3B).</p><p>We have kept the data showing that more UPF1 is associated with exons than with introns (old Figure 4A-D). Although we agree that more data will be required to gain insight in to the mechanism, this exon vs. intron bias in the ChIP-seq data is genome-wide and apparent at several genes that we have verified by qPCR (see our detailed response to reviewer 1 about this point). However, we simplified the figure by moving three of the panels to a supplementary figure (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2) and hope this change will make the manuscript both more concise and clear.</p><p>With regards to our conclusion that UPF1 plays a role in the release of mRNAs from transcription sites and export to the cytoplasm, as suggested by reviewer 1, we have tested whether the striking poly(A) accumulation phenotype observed in UPF1 depleted cells can be rescued by expression of a UPF1 transgene, which is not targeted by UPF1-RNAi. The result was a clear-cut rescue of this phenotype, which, hence, provides further indication that nuclear poly(A) accumulation is a direct effect of UPF1 depletion (discussed further in response to this reviewer).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Singh and colleagues present here a large amount of interesting data revolving around UPF1 functions in the nucleus at the site of transcription and during mRNA export.

This was indeed a completely unexpected result, and, as the reviewer commented, difficult to believe, initially also by us. However, our UPF1 ChIP-seq data clearly indicate that more UPF1 is associated with exons than with introns genome wide, and this observation was validated with multiple ChIP experiments and by real-time PCR of different genes (for example <italic>Xrp1</italic>, new Figure 5B). Irrespective of what the mechanism responsible might be, we think this striking exon-biased enrichment needs to be discussed in the manuscript. As introns and exons are defined co-transcriptionally, such an enrichment profile is consistent with the rest of the data and our conclusion that UPF1 association with nascent transcripts/RNPs is what primarily drives recruitment to transcription sites. Although the road-block model that we proposed (old Figure 4G, now new Figure 5—figure supplement 2B) is largely a working model, as we made it clear in the manuscript, it is the best explanation we can give presently for why less UPF1 is associated with the intron than the upstream flanking exon. The reviewer argues instead that a more likely interpretation for our results is that a substantial fraction of UPF1 binds the RNA after intron removal. We considered this possibility, but several of our observations argue against it. First, UPF1 is also associated with intronless genes, for example at the heat-shock genes such as 87A and 87C on the polytene chromosomes (new Figure 3B), and Gapdh1 in S2 cell as detected by ChIP (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Second, UPF1 was also associated with our intronless transgene upon ecdysone induction (new Figure 3C shows the intron-less version). Third, a ChIP enrichment profile such as that of <italic>Xrp1</italic> (new Figure 5A and 5B) strongly suggests that UPF1 should be able to get released from exons as transcription progresses. Contrary to the reviewer’s prediction, the overall UPF1 ChIP-seq signal does not visibly change between the last three exons of <italic>Xrp1</italic> (new Figure 5A), and more significantly, UPF1 association does not, on average, increase toward the 3’ end of genes (see metagene in new Figure 4D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Singh et al. describe the isolation of monoclonal antibodies that recognize Drosophila UPF1 and then utilize those reagents (primarily a single antibody) and UPF1-GFP to examine the subcellular distribution of UPF1 in a very large number of experiments.

Moreover, as demonstrated by the LMB treatment, UPF1-GFP is constantly shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm. As for the authenticity of the perinuclear signal, though this is most obvious with GFP-UPF1, it was also detected by immunostaining of the endogenous UPF1. This is apparent in some of the other cell types shown (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). In the revised manuscript, to address the concern about the antibody specificity, we have shown additional immunostainings of normal and UPF1-depleted salivary glands that demonstrates the veracity of the perinuclear signal of endogenous UPF1, with any of the three antibodies and, consistent with it being specific, depleted by UPF1-RNAi (this is particularly apparent in the images shown in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 2).

We agree with the reviewer that, as controversial as this explanation may be, these could be ribosomal subunits loaded on the nascent transcript (the presence of which we reported in the two papers mentioned and another which was not mentioned (Al-Jubran et al., 2013). Prompted by the reviewer’s comment, we discussed this possibility in the revised manuscript and explained our reasoning for thinking that simple affinity of UPF1 for RNA is not likely to be the primary reason why UPF1 associates with nascent transcripts. For example, UPF1 does not associate with rRNA genes, spliceosomal snRNAs, and most highly active Pol III genes. What is/are the putative mechanisms linking ribosome/ribosomal subunits association and UPF1 association with nascent transcripts will need to be addressed in future (translation initiation on nascent transcripts is our working hypothesis, as suspected by the reviewer, and have mentioned it in revised manuscript).</p><p>As for the suggestion to test UPF1 mutants, we performed additional experiments in S2 cells transfected with different variants of UPF1, including mutations (DE-AA) in its RNA helicase domain. The results of these experiments strongly indicate that UPF1 RNA helicase activity is in fact required for its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, and that it is possibly the primary determinant of its localisation in the cell where UPF1 distribution mirrors that of the mRNA, which is characteristically more abundant in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus. This new data have been added as a new figure (new Figure 2), described in the revised manuscript and their implications discussed in detail. Notably, as we have referred to in the new Discussion section, the DE-AA mutation that inactivates the ATPase domain resides within the region previously thought to function as a non-canonical “nuclear localization signal” in mammalian cells, as UPF1 lacks a clear NLS, as mentioned by the reviewer below.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ plan to address the revisions.

The authors only make that concern worse by filling the discussion with numerous unsubstantiated explanations for the apparent shuttling, the ChIP-seq results, and the experiments with the UPF1 helicase mutant.</p><p>In short, this manuscript just isn't up to eLife's standards.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for handling the reviewing of our manuscript. We are very pleased that reviewer 1 is now satisfied and supports its publication. Although they favor an alternative explanation for why more of UPF1 is associated with exons, we still think that the most plausible explanation is that it mostly associates with an exon prior removal of the downstream intron. However, we agree that a portion of UPF1 might bind to exons only after intron removal. We will discuss this possibility in the next revision and expand/modify our model of how UPF1 associates with nascent transcripts accordingly.</p><p>Reviewer 2’s remaining concern about the specificity of the antibodies puzzles us. Following the first review round, as requested we have performed many control experiments to address this concern, and we think that the results leave no doubt about the specificity of the antibodies. Reviewer 1 appears satisfied with this interpretation. Briefly, in the revision we have shown that all three monoclonal UPF1 antibodies produce similar immunostainings of both the polytene chromosomes (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1) and the salivary glands (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A), and UPF1-RNAi depletes all three antibodies signals in the cells which express the RNAi construct, but not in the adjacent fat body cells attached to the glands (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, indicated by the yellow arrows). Moreover, GFP-tagged UPF1 shows a similar subcellular distribution, and in particular a highly similar banding pattern on the polytene chromosomes (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1D).</p><p>In the latest assessment reviewer 2 points out that the 7B12 antibody detects an additional strong band in one of the Western blots (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). Although this was not pointed out in their initial review, it was by reviewer 1 and we had addressed it in our previous response. In brief, this extra band was seen only in the initial screening where the blots were incubated with ascites produced with the 7B12 hybriodoma, this cross-reactivity is minimal when using purified IgG from hybridoma supernatants (see Figure 1A). As explained in the manuscript, we have used only purified antibody not ascites in all subsequent assays.</p><p>This reviewer states that will be more convincing to test the specificity of the antibodies using genetic mosaics tissues. We don’t think that such experiments will be more informative or cleaner than what we have already performed. UPF1 is required for growth and survival of cell clones in imaginal discs (the typical tissue where clone analysis are performed), as a consequence homozygous Upf1(-) clones can’t be easily recovered and consist of just a few cells, as previously reported (Metzstein and Krasnow, 2006).</p><p>As for whether a fraction of UPF1 might be recruited indirectly on the nascent transcripts, by, for example, an interaction with associated RNPs, we agree, and, as suggested by reviewer 2’s original criticism, we have discussed this possibility extensively in the revised manuscript. Strangely, now they criticise us for having done so. Moreover, irrespective of its loading mechanism, we think that the data fully supports the manuscript main conclusion that UPF1 associates with nascent transcripts.</p><p>In summary, given that reviewer 1 appears to be satisfied with antibodies’ specificity and the rest of the manuscript, we would like you to consider whether doing the substantial more work requested by reviewer 2 is required. We are very excited about these findings and think the association of UPF1 with nascent transcripts is evolutionally conserved.</p><p>References:</p><p>Metzstein, M.M., and Krasnow, M.A. (2006).
