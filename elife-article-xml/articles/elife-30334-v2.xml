Utilizing a well-known visual motion paradigm that evokes behavioral suppression and facilitation, and combining five different methodologies (behavioral psychophysics, computational modeling, functional MRI, pharmacology, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy), we provide evidence that challenges commonly held assumptions about the neural processes underlying suppression and facilitation. We show that: (1) both suppression and facilitation can emerge from a single, computational principle – divisive normalization; there is no need to invoke separate neural mechanisms, (2) neural suppression and facilitation in the motion-selective area MT mirror perception, but strong suppression also occurs in earlier visual areas, and (3) suppression is not primarily driven by GABA-mediated inhibition. Thus, while commonly used spatial suppression paradigms may provide insight into neural response magnitudes in visual areas, they should not be used to infer neural inhibition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>surround suppression</kwd><kwd>motion perception</kwd><kwd>spatial vision</kwd><kwd>normalization</kwd><kwd>GABA</kwd><kwd>MT</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 EY025121</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schallmo</surname><given-names>Michael-Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Scott O.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH106520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernier</surname><given-names>Raphael A</given-names></name><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Scott O.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000070</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41 EB015909</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Edden</surname><given-names>Richard AE</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 EY007031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schallmo</surname><given-names>Michael-Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Scott O.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000070</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EB016089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Edden</surname><given-names>Richard AE</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Spatial suppression during motion perception reflects reduced neural response magnitudes in visual areas but is not primarily driven by neural inhibition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Processes that regulate the level of activity within neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carandini and Heeger, 2012</xref>) are thought to play a critical role in information processing by enabling efficient coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vinje and Gallant, 2000</xref>). Both suppression and facilitation of neural responses are well-known to emerge in the visual system via spatial context effects, and have a variety of perceptual consequences. For example, the perception of visual motion has been reliably shown to depend on the size and contrast of a stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tadin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tadin, 2015</xref>). Specifically, more time is needed to discriminate the direction of motion of a large high-contrast grating compared to one that is small. This seemingly paradoxical effect is referred to as spatial suppression and has been suggested to reflect GABAergic inhibitory interactions from extra-classical receptive field (RF) surrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The effect of size on duration thresholds is reversed for a low-contrast stimulus – less time is needed to discriminate motion direction for a large compared to small stimulus. This facilitation of behavior is referred to as spatial summation and has been suggested to reflect neural enhancement from RF surrounds (e.g. glutamatergic excitation) and/or an enlargement of RFs at low contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30334.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Common assumptions.</title><p>The direction of motion of a small stimulus (<bold>A</bold>); contrast = 98%, diameter = 2°) can be perceived after a shorter presentation duration than a larger stimulus (<bold>B</bold>); diameter = 12°). This has been suggested to reflect the inhibitory influence of the extra-classical RF surround (red arrows) in motion-sensitive neurons in MT. Suppression turns to facilitation at low contrast (<bold>C</bold>; 3%), which has been assumed to reflect excitation from the surround and/or expansion of the classical RF.

Conclusions about how neural processing is altered in these conditions have been drawn based on differences in duration thresholds relative to those of control observers. Generally, it has been assumed that spatial suppression and summation reflect distinct neural mechanisms that rely on inhibitory and excitatory processes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yoon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haider et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesnik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nienborg et al., 2013</xref>; but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ozeki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ozeki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shushruth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sato et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Pack, 2014</xref>), within brain regions involved in visual motion processing (particularly area MT).</p><p>Here, we test these assumptions directly and show that: (1) spatial suppression and summation in fact naturally emerge from a single, well-established neural computation observed in visual cortex – divisive normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heeger, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reynolds and Heeger, 2009</xref>); there is no need to posit separate mechanisms. (2) While neural responses in human MT complex (hMT+) indexed with fMRI correspond well with the measured perceptual effect, there is substantial suppression in earlier visual areas; thus, it is possible that hMT+ ‘inherits’ suppression from earlier stages of processing. (3) Two separate methodologies – magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and pharmacological potentiation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors – fail to show a direct link between spatial suppression and the strength of neural inhibition. Although we find that inhibition plays a role in motion perception, increases in duration threshold as a function of stimulus size should not be taken as an index of inhibitory processing. In total, our results suggest that a single computational principle – divisive normalization – can account for spatial context effects and that suppressive context effects are not driven by neural inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantifying behavior</title><p>To quantify spatial suppression and summation psychophysically, we measured motion duration thresholds (see Materials and methods) for 10 subjects in each of six different stimulus conditions, with sinusoidal luminance gratings at three different sizes (small [s], medium [m], and big [b]; diameter = 1, 2 and 12°, respectively) and two different contrasts (low = 3%; high = 98%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>).

We examined whether this apparent complexity could be explained by a simple, well-established model of early visual cortical responses that incorporates divisive normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heeger, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reynolds and Heeger, 2009</xref>), which can be summarized as:<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>This model describes the response (<italic>R</italic>) to a visual stimulus in terms of an excitatory drive term (<italic>E</italic>; reflecting the strength of the input, that is, stimulus contrast), divided by the sum of a suppressive drive term (<italic>S</italic>; also depends on input strength but is spatially broader; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) plus a small number known as the semi-saturation constant (<italic>σ;</italic> controls response sensitivity; see Materials and methods and Appendix 1 for further model details). This model has been used previously to describe how normalization may contribute to a wide range of neural functions, from early visual processing and attention to olfaction and decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carandini and Heeger, 2012</xref>). Additional model parameters that determine spatial sensitivity (e.g. excitatory spatial pooling width; <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>) were chosen to match the physiological properties of neurons in visual cortex that are thought to drive spatial suppression during behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tadin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amano et al., 2009</xref>). We found that a good qualitative match between our psychophysical motion discrimination data and the model predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>) could be obtained by assuming that the amount of time required for motion discrimination is inversely related to the peak modeled response (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>).</p><p>At high contrast, as stimulus size grows the modeled suppressive drive increases relative to the excitatory drive, so the predicted response decreases (i.e. spatial suppression; red curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This pattern generally holds as long as the spatial tuning width of the excitatory drive is comparable with the smaller stimulus sizes, and the suppressive spatial tuning is larger than this. For low contrasts and small sizes, the suppressive drive is relatively weak compared to the semi-saturation constant (<italic>σ</italic>), so the response to low-contrast stimuli increases with stimulus size until the suppressive drive is relatively larger than <italic>σ</italic> (i.e. spatial summation; blue curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Note that the parameters that determine spatial selectivity (i.e. model receptive field size) do not vary with stimulus contrast. Instead, within the computational framework of this model, spatial suppression vs. summation depends on the strength of the suppressive drive relative to <italic>σ</italic> at a given stimulus contrast. In general, given comparable spatial parameters to those used here, summation is predicted for values of <italic>σ</italic> that are within about 2 orders of magnitude of the stimulus contrast, for which the suppressive drive is relatively small compared to <italic>σ</italic>. In macaque visual cortex, the peak neural response is likewise often observed at larger sizes for lower contrast stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angelucci and Bressloff, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pack et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the complex interplay between stimulus contrast and size that results in spatial suppression and summation during motion perception may be accounted for by a simple divisive normalization rule – it is not necessary to invoke distinct neural mechanisms to explain both phenomena.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Neural responses reflect suppression and summation</title><p>Both our modeling work and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tadin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Turkozer et al., 2016</xref>) suggest that spatial suppression and summation depend on reduced and enhanced neural responses (respectively) within visual cortex, particularly in area MT. To test this hypothesis directly in human visual cortex, we measured fMRI responses to low- and high-contrast moving gratings at different sizes with the same 10 subjects from the psychophysical experiment above. In a blocked experimental design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zenger-Landolt and Heeger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Williams et al., 2003</xref>), we measured the change in the fMRI response evoked by increasing stimulus size. We report the responses from two areas: (1) early visual cortex (EVC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) which was located at the foveal confluence of areas V1, V2, and V3, near the occipital pole and (2) human MT complex (hMT+; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). For both EVC and hMT+, we used an independent localizer scan to define sub regions-of-interest (sub-ROIs) corresponding to cortical areas that selectively respond to the smallest stimulus size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Olman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schallmo et al., 2016</xref>). During a single experimental scan, two stimulus sizes were presented in alternating 10 s blocks: either small and medium or small and big. Thus, the sub-ROIs – defined by the smallest stimulus size – were constantly stimulated during the scan. This method allowed us to directly compare the relative fMRI responses to larger vs. smaller stimuli (i.e. the response during the small block served as a baseline for the larger block, which was the condition of interest). If responses in EVC and hMT+ sub-ROIs did not change between the small and larger stimulus blocks (the null hypothesis), this would indicate no influence of surrounding regions on response magnitude. Increased responses would reflect spatial summation, while spatial suppression would yield response decreases.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30334.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Measuring suppression and summation using functional MRI.</title><p>This experiment measured the response to increasing stimulus size within regions of visual cortex representing the smallest stimulus.

The overall smaller fMRI response modulation in hMT+ vs. EVC was expected due to larger receptive fields in hMT+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amano et al., 2009</xref>), which reduce the retinotopic selectivity of the hemodynamic response within this ROI. These fMRI results are consistent with the proposal that increased and decreased neural activity within hMT+ contributes to spatial summation and suppression (respectively) during motion perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tadin, 2015</xref>). Observing both suppression and summation together within a single region is consistent with the framework of the normalization model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

Here, we used two separate methodologies: pharmacological potentiation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors with the benzodiazepine lorazepam and measurements of individual differences in GABA concentration with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Our <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis was that if suppression depends on GABA-mediated inhibition, increases in GABA signaling (either pharmacological or by natural variation in GABA concentration across individuals) should correspond with increased duration thresholds specifically for big stimuli – where suppression is greatest. We did not have a strong <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis about how GABA signaling might affect duration thresholds for small stimuli, where suppression is minimal; however, our general intuition was that duration thresholds for small stimuli would be little affected.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Pharmacologically enhanced inhibition</title><p>We first examined the effect of potentiating inhibition through administration of the benzodiazepine drug lorazepam, which acts as a positive allosteric modulator at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haefely, 1983</xref>). This compound causes chloride channels to open more readily in response to GABA binding, which yields greater inhibition of neural action potentials. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover experiment, 15 subjects received either a 1.5 mg dose of lorazepam or placebo during separate experimental sessions on different days (order randomized and counter-balanced across subjects). Participants then completed the psychophysical paradigm used to examine spatial suppression and summation. This allowed us to test the hypothesis that strengthening inhibition would lead to increased spatial suppression during motion perception.</p><p>We found that increasing inhibition via lorazepam did not lead to stronger suppression – in fact, we observed weaker spatial suppression (SIs were less negative overall) under lorazepam vs. placebo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <italic>F</italic><sub>1,14</sub> = 6.51, p=0.023). Rather than increasing suppression, we found that lorazepam affected motion discrimination in two ways: first, lorazepam increased thresholds to some extent across all conditions (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,14</sub> = 9.83, p=0.007). More importantly, the effect of lorazepam (drug minus placebo) was stronger for smaller stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <italic>F</italic><sub>1,14</sub> = 6.91, p=0.020) at both low and high contrast. By increasing thresholds for smaller stimuli, lorazepam effectively weakened spatial suppression (i.e. reduced the difference in thresholds between small and larger stimuli). Thus, we found that potentiating inhibition at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor via lorazepam decreased, rather than increased spatial suppression in this paradigm.

Instead, higher GABA+ in hMT+ was associated with better motion discrimination performance overall. While this result differs from the effect of lorazepam on motion discrimination described above, we note that MRS reflects individual differences in GABA+ within visual brain areas that are (presumably) at homeostasis, whereas the effects of lorazepam can be attributed to a transient pharmacological strengthening of inhibition specific to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor class.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study examined a number of common assumptions about the neural processes underlying spatial suppression and summation during motion perception. Although this paradigm has been posited as a behavioral index for inhibition, we did not find a major role for GABA in determining the strength of spatial suppression. While a few studies have probed the neurochemical underpinnings of spatial context processing in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Read et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yoon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Song et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Loon et al., 2012</xref>), much of our current insight into the neural mechanisms of suppression and inhibition has come from work in animal models. Some reports suggest that GABAergic inhibition plays a direct role in surround suppression within visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haider et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesnik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nienborg et al., 2013</xref>), while others have indicated that this suppression occurs via withdrawal of excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ozeki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ozeki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shushruth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sato et al., 2016</xref>), which may be balanced by reduced inhibition.</p><p>Here, we predicted that if suppression was directly mediated by GABA, then we would observe both stronger suppression with lorazepam vs. placebo, and a significant correlation between GABA MRS and suppression measures. However, this was not the case; lorazepam weakened suppression rather than strengthening it, and MRS measurements of GABA+ in visual cortex did not correlate significantly with suppression strength. Further, based on post-hoc power analyses (see Materials and methods), we conclude that there is no evidence for strong, or even moderate correlations (stronger than <italic>r</italic> = 0.52) between GABA+ and suppression in our data. Of course, it remains possible that we failed to detect a weaker correlation between GABA+ and spatial suppression. If such a subtle relationship exists (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.3; here undetected), this would perhaps suggest a more complex role for GABA in mediating spatial suppression than we first hypothesized. Nevertheless, our findings seem more consistent with the withdrawal of excitation as a mechanism for spatial suppression. This agrees with an earlier observation that blocking GABA in macaque MT had no effect on spatial suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Pack, 2014</xref>) (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katzner et al., 2011</xref>]). However, our MRS findings appear to conflict with reports that greater mid-occipital GABA was associated with stronger surround suppression during contrast perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yoon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2016</xref>). This discrepancy may be related to the methods for quantifying suppression, and/or differences in the role of inhibition during perception of contrast and motion.</p><p>Beyond spatial suppression, the results from our lorazepam and MRS experiments help to clarify the role of GABAergic inhibition in mediating motion perception. We considered how these results might be described using the normalization model. We found that potentiating inhibition at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor via lorazepam decreased spatial suppression, rather than strengthening it. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref> shows how a reduction in both input (i.e. contrast) and output (i.e. response) gain yields predicted thresholds that mirror the observed effects of lorazepam (compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). Specifically, higher thresholds for smaller stimuli following lorazepam may be accounted for in the normalization model by reducing the strength of the input (i.e. reduced contrast gain). Lowering contrast gain raised the predicted thresholds for small stimuli but had little effect when stimuli were large. We therefore speculate that the effect of lorazepam in reducing spatial suppression may be consistent with reduced contrast gain within brain regions relevant to motion perception (e.g. MT).</p><p>From previous work that manipulated GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katzner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thiele et al., 2004</xref>), it may be expected that potentiating inhibition at this receptor would reduce neural responsiveness overall (i.e. lower response gain). Beyond increasing thresholds for small stimuli, lorazepam also raised motion discrimination thresholds across conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), an effect that is consistent with overall lower neural responses. While reducing <italic>input</italic> gain in the model (as above) slightly reduces the predicted thresholds in all conditions, such an effect may also be modeled by reducing <italic>response</italic> gain (scaling down predicted responses; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). This is also consistent with earlier behavioral studies showing that benzodiazepine administration generally reduces visual performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Loon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giersch and Herzog, 2004</xref>). However, we note that the observed effects of lorazepam were specific to threshold-level motion discrimination (especially for smaller stimuli); catch trial performance was not affected (see Materials and methods), which argues against more general pharmacological effects (e.g. fatigue). In summary, while the effect of lorazepam during motion discrimination may be consistent with weaker contrast gain (and perhaps also lower response gain), our findings do not support the idea that spatial suppression is directly mediated by inhibition.</p><p>We additionally showed that higher baseline GABA (as measured by MRS) is associated with better, rather than suppressed motion perception. Because this correlation was unexpected, and no statistical correction for multiple comparisons was performed, this result should be interpreted with caution. To understand why more GABA in hMT+ might lead to better motion discrimination, we considered two possibilities. First, better performance (lower thresholds) might result if GABA <italic>increased</italic> neural activity in this region – this proposal does not seem parsimonious, given the well-established inhibitory function of GABA in the adult nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCormick, 1989</xref>). Alternatively, if more baseline GABA lowers the behavioral response criterion (without necessarily changing the neural response), possibly by improving neural signal-to-noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leventhal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Puts et al., 2011</xref>), then we would expect better performance with higher GABA in hMT+. Indeed, within our model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>), reducing the response criterion has the same effect on the predicted threshold as an increased neural response. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6A–C</xref>, we show how the effect of changing criteria can be described in terms of the normalization model (compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). Note that changing the criterion has no effect on the strength of spatial suppression predicted by the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6C</xref>). This is consistent with our finding that the concentration of GABA+ in hMT+ does not influence spatial suppression measured psychophysically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A–F</xref>) or with fMRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3G–H</xref>). In terms of the motion discrimination task, a lower response criterion indicates that less sensory evidence (i.e. shorter stimulus duration) is used to reach the same decision (i.e. left- vs. right-ward motion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huk and Shadlen, 2005</xref>). This would lead to more-rapid perceptual decision making, and thus better performance. Thus, lower response criteria with higher baseline GABA may plausibly account for our MRS data. As with our experiment using lorazepam, these MRS data contradict the notion that GABAergic inhibition directly determines the strength of spatial suppression. Altogether, our findings suggest that the assumption of a direct link between spatial suppression and inhibition is invalid.</p><p>We considered whether spatial suppression and summation might be described in terms of a single computation – divisive normalization – a model for early visual processing in which a neuron’s response is suppressed (divided) by the summed response of its neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heeger, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reynolds and Heeger, 2009</xref>). We are not the first to suggest that the normalization model may account for these phenomena; Rosenberg and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rosenberg et al., 2015</xref>) used weaker normalization to explain superior motion discrimination performance in autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foss-Feig et al., 2013</xref>). Our study provides the first direct application of this model to this paradigm in typically developing individuals under a variety of experimental conditions. While it is perhaps not surprising that this model performs well in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carandini and Heeger, 2012</xref>), earlier work has modeled spatial suppression and summation in terms of other divisive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betts et al., 2012</xref>) or subtractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tadin and Lappin, 2005</xref>) computations. Generally, these earlier models have treated ‘excitatory’ and ‘suppressive’ mechanisms separately (e.g. different contrast sensitivity). The normalization model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reynolds and Heeger, 2009</xref>) used here provides a simpler account, wherein the suppressive drive is essentially the same as the excitatory drive, only broader in space and orientation (see Appendix 1). We found that this normalization model is sufficient to explain the complex interplay between stimulus size and contrast that produces psychophysical (or neural) suppression and summation. This framework appears more parsimonious than positing separate mechanisms (neural or computational) operating at different stimulus contrasts to produce suppression and summation.</p><p>Our modeling work shows that normalization can describe spatial suppression and summation under a variety of different experimental conditions. We found good agreement between the predicted model response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>), psychophysics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>), and the fMRI response in hMT+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). That both suppression and summation were observed in the fMRI response from a sub-region of hMT+ representing the stimulus center indicates that these two effects are co-localized in cortex, and both could plausibly occur within a single neural population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pack et al., 2005</xref>), which is consistent with the proposed model framework. Further, the way in which spatial suppression was affected by lorazepam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>), but not baseline GABA in hMT+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6A–C</xref>), can be explained in terms of the normalization model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1-Table 1</xref>). It is worth noting that the lorazepam data were described by an exponential reduction of contrast gain, which we speculate may reflect the compounded reduction of neural responses across multiple stages of visual processing (e.g. retina, lateral geniculate nucleus, visual cortex) due to systemic potentiation of inhibition at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor. Although recent work has suggested some limitations for describing spatial suppression in terms of normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heeger et al., 2017</xref>), we find that this model framework is sufficiently general to describe the suppression effect across our different experiments.</p><p>Finally, we examined the extent to which suppression and summation may be attributed to modulation of neural activity within area MT. Our results generally supported this hypothesis; fMRI responses in hMT+ showed better agreement with spatial suppression and summation measured psychophysically, as compared with the responses in EVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Further, better motion discrimination across individuals was predicted by higher GABA+ in hMT+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), but not in EVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4D</xref>). The idea that spatial suppression during perception is driven (at least in part) by surround suppression within MT is consistent with recent work in primate models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). For many neurons in primate MT, the presence of stimuli within the extra-classical receptive field surround suppresses (or enhances) the response to stimuli within the receptive field center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pack et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Born and Tootell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Born, 2000</xref>). The proposed link between perceptual suppression and neural suppression in MT has received further (if limited) support from studies in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Turkozer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tadin et al., 2011</xref>). Using fMRI, MRS, and modeling, our findings extend this link by showing a correspondence between neural processing in hMT+ and motion discrimination performance in human subjects.</p><p>While neural processing in hMT+ seemed more closely linked to perception, strong suppression of fMRI responses was observed in EVC at both low and high stimulus contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Feed-forward and feedback connections between EVC and MT are thought to play an important role in spatial context processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angelucci and Bressloff, 2006</xref>); our data alone are not sufficient to determine the extent to which MT inherits suppression from EVC and/or drives this suppression via feedback. However, surround suppression in early visual areas (e.g. V1, V2) is well established in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angelucci and Bressloff, 2006</xref>), and suppressed fMRI responses in these areas generally correspond with perceptual suppression during contrast judgments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zenger-Landolt and Heeger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schallmo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joo et al., 2012</xref>). This raises the possibility that some amount of spatial suppression during motion discrimination may be attributed to neural suppression in EVC. Other aspects of motion processing in MT are also believed to be inherited from earlier stages of visual processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kohn and Movshon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glasser et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>One issue for comparing fMRI results between hMT+ and EVC is the difference in RF sizes between areas. Neurons in foveal MT are thought to have a RF diameter of ~5°, while RFs in foveal EVC are much smaller (~1–2° diameter, depending on the visual area) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raiguel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tadin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amano et al., 2009</xref>). Our largest stimuli (12° diameter) are therefore expected to extend into the extra-classical RF surround for foveal neurons in both areas. Our ability to measure spatial suppression and summation with fMRI will also be affected by RF size; larger RFs in MT should make these measurement more difficult, because of less retinotopic specificity within a given voxel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amano et al., 2009</xref>). However, in about 80% of subjects, we were able to identify voxels within hMT+ that responded selectively to foveal &gt; surrounding stimuli. These hMT+ sub-ROIs showed both spatial suppression and summation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), indicating that we have the necessary spatial specificity to observe these phenomena in hMT+ in general. The fMRI responses to increasing stimulus size from voxels outside of the center-selective hMT+ sub-ROIs were very different (data not shown), and cannot be attributed primarily to spatial suppression or summation. Future work with higher spatial resolution imaging may provide greater insight into the nature of spatial suppression and summation within hMT+.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 48 adult human subjects were recruited across all experiments.

During fMRI, stimuli were displayed via projector; either an Epson Powerlite 7250 or an Eiki LCXL100A (following a hardware failure), both operating at 60 Hz. Images were presented on a semicircular screen at the back of the scanner bore, and viewed through a mirror mounted on the head coil. Stimuli during fMRI were displayed using Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Berkeley, CA). The luminance of all displays was linearized. Viewing distance was 52 cm for psychophysical display #1, and 66 cm for both display #2 and in the scanner.</p><p>In each experiment, we presented drifting sinusoidal luminance modulated gratings at two different Michelson contrast levels (low = 3%, high = 98%) and three different sizes (small, medium and big; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), following the method of Foss-Feig and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foss-Feig et al., 2013</xref>).

Due to a coding error, the stimulus diameter was slightly smaller in all subsequent psychophysical experiments (performed using display #2; diameter = 0.84, 1.7 and 10°). Drift rate was always four cycles/s. Stimuli were presented centrally on a mean luminance background, and had a spatial frequency of 1 cycle/° (display #1 and fMRI) or 1.2 cycles/° (display #2). Gratings were presented within a circular window, whose edges were blurred with a Gaussian envelope (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.25° for display #1 and fMRI, 0.21° for display #2). Gratings were presented within a circular window, whose edges were blurred with a Gaussian envelope. Note that this spatial envelope differs from the standard Gaussian envelope used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tadin et al., 2003</xref>), and yielded higher average contrast and a sharper edge profile than comparable Gaussian windows; both of these factors likely influenced the precise pattern of suppression and summation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tadin, 2015</xref>) observed here.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Paradigm and data analysis</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Psychophysics</title><p>Subjects were asked to determine whether a briefly presented vertical grating drifted left or right (randomized and counterbalanced).

This was followed by a blank screen (150 ms), after which the grating stimuli appeared (variable duration, range 6.7–333 ms), followed by another blank screen (150 ms), and finally a fixation mark (the response cue). Subjects indicated their response (left or right) using the arrow keys. Response time was not limited. To permit very brief stimulus presentations, gratings appeared within a trapezoidal temporal envelope, following an established method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foss-Feig et al., 2013</xref>).

Staircases were run separately to determine thresholds for each of the six stimulus conditions (two contrasts x three sizes, as above). Condition order was randomized across trials. Thirty trials were run per staircase within a single run (approximately 6 min). There were also 10 catch trials per run (all big, high-contrast gratings, 333 ms duration), which were used to assess off-task performance. Each subject completed four runs, with a total experiment duration of about 30 min. Example and practice trials were presented before the first run.

We used a ‘winner-take-all’ decision rule in reading out the population response from the model, which had the consequence of choosing the response from the center of the population being modeled (i.e. the response to the center of the stimulus, which was always the largest within the population).

However, the <italic>Criterion</italic> value varied across different versions of the model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>) and different contrast levels – typically, a lower <italic>Criterion</italic> was used to model thresholds for 3% versus 98% contrast stimuli. A lower <italic>Criterion</italic> indicates a difference in the process of accumulating sensory evidence to reach a perceptual decision, such that less evidence is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huk and Shadlen, 2005</xref>). Using lower <italic>Criterion</italic> values was important in cases where duration thresholds were equivalent or shorter for low- vs. high-contrast stimuli (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, medium size). We chose to adopt this modeling approach after comparing motion discrimination thresholds for medium-sized stimuli with the fMRI responses to briefly presented moving gratings (2° diameter) at 3% and 98% contrast (vs. fixation alone; see below). We found that in both EVC and hMT+, fMRI responses were significantly higher for 98% vs. 3% contrast stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>; <italic>F</italic><sub>1,26</sub> = 113, p&lt;0.001), as expected.

This leads us to the conclusion is that there must be additional factor(s), beyond response magnitudes in hMT+ and/or EVC, that contribute to duration thresholds at low vs. high contrast. We used different <italic>Criterion</italic> values in the current model to account for such factors. We suggest that one plausible explanation for this phenomenon is stimulus onset masking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tadin, 2015</xref>); masking has been shown to contribute to spatial suppression, and is thought to be stronger for high-contrast stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Churan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tsui and Pack, 2011</xref>).</p><p>We note that our intention with this modeling work was not to find the precise parameter values that provided the best algorithmic fit to our data.

In general, we used parameter values that were similar to previous instantiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reynolds and Heeger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flevaris and Murray, 2015</xref>), and/or approximate the realistic values of neurons in visual cortex. Rather than make any claims about the specifics of the parameter values, we instead note in the Results the relationships between parameters (e.g. suppressive drive having broader spatial tuning than excitatory drive) that are necessary to predict the general pattern of results from our experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Lorazepam</title><p>Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that acts as a positive allosteric modulator at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haefely, 1983</xref>). Rather that acting directly as an agonist (i.e. binding to the GABA receptor site), lorazepam binds to a separate ‘benzodiazepine’ site on the receptor, which increases the probability that the receptor’s Cl<sup>-</sup> channel will open when GABA binds. This leads to stronger hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic neuron’s membrane potential. Thus, the net effect of lorazepam is to potentiate inhibition at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor.</p><p>In separate experimental sessions separated by at least 1 week, subjects received either 1.5 mg lorazepam or placebo, with the order randomized and counter-balanced across subjects. The compounds were dispensed by a pharmacist who was not involved the study; both subjects and experimenters were blind to the order of drug and placebo until after both experimental sessions were complete. Following a 2 hr wash-in period, subjects completed the above psychophysical paradigm as part of a larger battery of experiments lasting approximately 1.5 hr. The order in which the spatial suppression paradigm was performed within this series was randomized and counter-balanced across subjects, but was always the same for the drug and placebo sessions within each subject. Instructions and practice trials were presented before the experiment in both sessions.</p><p>Catch trial accuracy was used to assess whether lorazepam affected cognitive performance in general, or motion perception more specifically. Accuracy was equivalently high in both placebo (mean = 99%, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.8%) and drug sessions (mean = 98%, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.6%; paired <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>t</italic><sub>14</sub> = 0.8, p=0.4), suggesting that lorazepam may have reduced threshold-level motion discrimination, but not task performance more generally (e.g. reduced performance due to fatigue).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Functional MRI</title><p>Data were acquired on a Philips Achieva 3 Tesla scanner. A T<sub>1</sub>-weighted structural MRI scan was acquired during each session with 1 mm isotropic resolution. Gradient echo fMRI data were acquired with 3 mm isotropic resolution in 30 oblique-axial slices separated by a 0.5 mm gap (2 s TR, 25 ms TE, 79° flip angle, A-P phase-encode direction). A single opposite direction (P-A) phase-encode scan was acquired for distortion compensation. Each scanning session lasted approximately 1 hr.</p><p>Our primary fMRI paradigms examined the change in the fMRI signal in response to an increase in stimulus size (e.g. spatial suppression). This involved presenting smaller and larger drifting gratings during alternating 10 s blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This type of alternating-block design has been used previously to measure surround suppression during fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zenger-Landolt and Heeger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Williams et al., 2003</xref>) and was chosen for its simplicity and robustness to subject noise. For the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, stimulus diameter alternated between 1° and 2°, or 1° and 12° in separate 5 min runs. For those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>, diameter alternated between 2° and 12°. Stimulus duration was 400 ms, with a 225 ms inter-stimulus interval. Sixteen gratings were presented at the center of the screen during each block; to prevent adaptation, gratings moved in one of eight possible directions in a randomized and counter-balanced order. Twenty-five blocks (13 small, 12 big) were presented during each run (125 TRs total). Stimulus contrast was either 3% or 98% (in separate runs). Each subject completed 2–4 runs at each contrast level.</p><p>Subjects performed a color/shape detection task at fixation during all fMRI experiments, in order to both control spatial attention and to minimize eye movements away from fixation. We note that this fixation task necessarily presented different attentional demands than our psychophysical paradigm (motion discrimination outside the scanner). Attention has been shown to affect center-surround interactions in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flevaris and Murray, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zenger et al., 2000</xref>) (but see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schallmo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Millin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Poltoratski et al., 2017</xref>)). Here, keeping attention focused tightly at fixation during fMRI had the advantage of mimicking the manner in which spatial attention is thought to be deployed during motion direction discrimination for very short duration stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tadin, 2015</xref>).</p><p>For the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>, stimulus contrast varied across blocks, rather than size. These scans began with a blank block in which only the fixation mark was presented on a mean gray background. Blocks of drifting gratings (2° diameter) at 3% and 98% contrast were then presented centrally in an alternating order, each followed by a blank block, to permit the fMRI response to return to baseline (6 low-contrast blocks, 6 high contrast, and 13 blank per run). Other stimulus parameters matched those from the fMRI experiments above. Subjects each completed 2–4 runs of the contrast experiment.</p><p>Functional localizer scans were acquired to facilitate ROI definition. Three different localizers were used; paradigm structure matched those above, except where noted. The first localizer was designed to identify human MT complex (hMT+); we use this notation to clarify that we did not attempt to distinguish areas MT and MST, both of which are motion selective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huk et al., 2002</xref>). Drifting and static gratings (15% contrast) were presented centrally in alternating 10 s blocks (125 TRs total). Stimulus diameter was 1° (hMT+ data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) or 2° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The second localizer was used to identify regions of visual cortex that represented the smallest stimulus size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Olman et al., 2007</xref>); checkerboard stimuli (100% contrast, phase-reversing at 8 Hz) were presented in center and surrounding regions in an alternating order across 16 blocks (10 s each, 80 TRs total). Center diameter was either 1° (with a 1° gap; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) or 2° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>); inner and outer diameter of the surround annulus were always 2° and 12°, respectively. The third localizer was used to identify EVC ROIs for the contrast experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>); checkerboard stimuli (2° diameter, other parameters as in localizer #2) and blank backgrounds were presented in alternating blocks.</p><p>FMRI data were processed in BrainVoyager (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands), including motion and distortion correction, high-pass filtering (cutoff = 2 cycles/scan), and anatomical alignment. No spatial smoothing or normalization were performed; all analyses were within-subjects and ROI-based. ROIs were identified from the localizer data using correlational analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schallmo et al., 2016</xref>), with an initial threshold of p&lt;0.05 (Bonferroni corrected). ROIs were defined for each hemisphere in two anatomical regions: motion-selective hMT+ in the lateral occipital lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and the region of EVC selective for the retinotopic position of the center stimulus (near the occipital pole; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). ROI position was verified by visualization on an inflated model of the cortical white matter surface. The top 20 most-significant voxels (in functional space) within each hemisphere were selected for analysis. In a few cases, there were not 20 functional voxels within a hemisphere ROI that met the statistical threshold above. For these subjects, the threshold was relaxed until 20 voxels from the surrounding region were included. ROIs in all subjects satisfied an uncorrected, one-tailed significance threshold of p&lt;0.002. Center-selective hMT+ sub-ROIs were defined based on a correlation analysis of their time course data during the center-vs.-surround localizer scan, with a further inclusion criterion of p&lt;0.05 (one-tailed). This allowed us to examine the fMRI response to increasing stimulus size within hMT+ voxels that showed some selectivity for the retinotopic position of the center stimulus, in addition to significant motion selectivity. Sub-ROIs in hMT+ could not be identified in two subjects from the first fMRI experiment, and six subjects from the MRS and fMRI experiment.</p><p>Average time courses were extracted from each sub-ROI for further analyses in MATLAB using BVQXTools. Time course data were split into epochs spanning from 4 s before the start to 2 s after the end of each block of interest. The response baseline was determined by averaging the signal across all such epochs between 0 and 4 s prior to block onset. For the main fMRI experiment (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we sought to measure suppression or summation in response to an increase in stimulus size. Thus, the block of interest contained the larger stimuli, and the response from the end of the preceding block of smaller stimuli served as the baseline. For the contrast experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>), the blocks of interest contained the low and high contrast stimuli, and the preceding fixation blocks served as the baseline. The time course in each epoch was converted to percent signal change by subtracting and then dividing by the baseline, and multiplying by 100. Converted time courses were then averaged across epochs, hemispheres in each run, and runs in each subject. The average signal change from 8 to 12 s after the onset of the block (the response peak) served as the measure of the fMRI response.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>MR spectroscopy</title><p>Spectroscopy data were acquired using a MEGA-PRESS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mescher et al., 1998</xref>) sequence (3 cm isotropic voxel, 320 averages of 2048 data points, 2 kHz spectral width, 1.4 kHz bandwidth refocusing pulse, VAPOR water suppression, 2 s TR, 68 ms TE). Editing pulses (14 ms) were applied at 1.9 ppm during ‘on’ and 7.5 ppm during ‘off’ acquisitions, interleaved every 2 TRs across a 16-step phase cycle. MRS data were collected within the following regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>): hMT+ in lateral occipital cortex, EVC in mid-occipital cortex, and a region of the central sulcus in parietal cortex known as the ‘hand knob' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yousry et al., 1997</xref>). Voxels were positioned based on anatomical landmarks using a T<sub>1</sub>-weighted anatomical scan collected in the same session, while avoiding contamination by CSF, bone, and fat. The EVC voxel was placed medially within occipital cortex adjacent to the occipital pole, and aligned parallel to the cerebellar tentorium. The parietal voxel was centered on the ‘hand knob’ within the central sulcus, and aligned parallel to the dorsolateral cortical surface. The hMT+ voxel was placed in the ventrolateral occipital lobe, parallel to the lateral cortical surface. Further positioning information for hMT+ was obtained using an abbreviated version of the hMT+ fMRI localizer described above (65 TRs, each 3 s, resolution 3 × 3 × 5 mm, 14 slices with 0.5 mm gap). These localizer data were processed on-line at the scanner, using a GLM analysis in the Philips iViewBOLD software to identify hMT+ voxels in lateral occipital cortex that responded more strongly to moving vs. static gratings (threshold <italic>t</italic> &gt; 3.0). The hMT+ MRS voxels were centered on these functionally identified regions in the left and right hemispheres within each subject. To mitigate the detrimental effects of gradient heating during fMRI on the MRS data quality, the functional localizer data were acquired prior to the T<sub>1</sub> anatomical scan. MRS data were acquired in both left and right hMT+ for all subjects. Two measurements in EVC were obtained for all subjects except 1. Both values were averaged for hMT+ and EVC. Parietal cortex was measured only once, and was not obtained in one subject.</p><p>To quantify the concentration of GABA+ within each voxel, MRS data were processed using the Gannet 2.0 toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edden et al., 2014</xref>). We refer to this measurement as GABA+ to note that it includes some contribution from macromolecules that is not accounted for in our analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mullins et al., 2014</xref>). Processing included automatic frequency and phase correction, artifact rejection (frequency correction parameters &gt;3 <italic>SD</italic> above mean), and exponential line broadening (3 Hz). The GABA+ peak was fit with a Gaussian (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>), and the integral of the fit served as the concentration measurement. This GABA+ value was scaled by the integral of the unsuppressed water peak, fit with a mixed Gaussian-Lorentzian. The GABA+ value was corrected based on the concentration of gray and white matter using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref> from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2015</xref>), assuming a ratio of GABA+ in white to gray matter (<italic>α</italic>) of 0.5. Gray and white matter concentrations were obtained for each voxel in each subject by segmenting the T<sub>1</sub> anatomical data using SPM8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friston et al., 1994</xref>). This correction did not qualitatively affect our results. All MRS scans and corresponding psychophysical and fMRI data were collected within a maximum 2-week time-period, as previous work has shown GABA measurements are relatively stable across several days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenhouse et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed in MATLAB. <italic>F</italic>-test statistics were obtained using repeated measures ANOVAs (e.g. four repeated psychophysical threshold estimates per subject), with subjects treated as a random effect. Stimulus size was treated as a continuous variable where appropriate. To examine whether our data were normally distributed (as assumed by parametric tests such as an ANOVA), we manually inspected the distributions of our data in each condition, and used the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality. Cases in which deviations from normality were observed were further tested using the non-parametric equivalent of an ANOVA (Friedman’s test). The p-values obtained in all such cases were smaller for the Friedman’s test than for the corresponding ANOVA, thus we report the larger values and the more conventional statistic. Correlation values (<italic>r</italic>) are Pearson’s correlation coefficients (two-tailed, unless otherwise noted). Significant correlations were confirmed using a (non-parametric) permutation test, which involved randomly shuffling the data being correlated across subjects in each of 10,000 iterations. The proportion of permuted correlations whose absolute value was greater than that of the real correlation served as the measure of significance. Permutation tests consistently yielded smaller p-values than the corresponding Pearson’s correlations; the larger values are reported. Post-hoc power analyses were performed to ensure that sample sizes were large enough such that the probability of type II error was less than 20%. Importantly, the sample sizes in our correlational analyses (N = 21 to 27) give us enough power to detect moderate to strong correlations (Pearson’s coefficients above <italic>r</italic> = 0.58 to 0.52, depending on N) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hulley et al., 2013</xref>), assuming a two-tailed significance threshold of p=0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data from this study are available from the Dryad Digital Repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.rv71c">http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.rv71c</ext-link></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Geoffrey M.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Nick Turk-Browne as the Reviewing Editor and David Van Essen as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Michael Silver.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This authors use a variety of converging methods, including behavior, neuroimaging, spectroscopy, and pharmacology to provide a new account of visual motion perception. They conclude that the same mechanism may be responsible for both suppressive and facilitatory processes, and that neural inhibition may not underlie suppression. The reviewers all thought this was an impressive body of work, but they also raised several questions and concerns detailed below. If these constructive suggestions are addressed in a revision, we are optimistic and supportive about this work appearing in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One of the claims in the paper is that one computational mechanism can account for both suppression and facilitation, but the authors use different criterion parameters for low and high contrast stimulus (conditions where facilitation and suppression dominate, respectively). This difference is about two-fold, indicating that about twice as much stimulus response is needed to reach the threshold at high rather than at low contrast. This does require an explanation and/or justification. The criterion model implicitly assumes some temporal accumulation to a criterion that determines a threshold. Why would that differ between low and high contrast? More importantly, how important is this criterion difference for the authors' claim that the same model can explain both low and high contrast data? This is less of an issue if this is not critical for the authors' claim.</p><p>2) Statistical power and conclusions of MRS study. Only 22 subjects were included, which seems pretty small for an individual differences study. There is a statement about power analyses performed, but I was confused about what data the power analyses were performed on. Was this an a priori power analysis (from what dataset?) estimating that N=21 to 27 would be enough? Or was this a post-hoc power analysis on the actual dataset, which should only tell you the effect size? More information is needed if this is to be convincing. This issue is particularly problematic because the main finding is a null result; that is, a lack of a significant correlation. But the effect goes in the predicted direction, with r=-.32 and p=. 14 for high-contrast suppression, and the binary split data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>) also show something small in the predicted direction. It is one thing to state that there was not a statistically reliable result, but to definitively conclude a lack of effect, especially given the sample size, seems unwarranted (e.g. Abstract: &quot;suppression is not driven by GABA-mediated inhibition&quot;). Without this effect the conclusions and impact of the paper are certainly dampened, though it may still be sufficiently interesting to frame it as raising doubt about the GABA-mediated mechanism.</p><p>3) Impact of computational modeling study. The authors explain in the methods: &quot;We emphasize that our goal was not to quantitatively describe the data in terms of the model but instead to show that normalization, as a computational principle, is sufficient to qualitatively account for our findings.&quot; I find this a bit unsatisfying. Does it really tell us much to say that a particular model could account for the behavioral pattern? (1) I don't think that this &quot;could&quot; statement is particularly surprising – divisive normalization is a broad, pretty mainstream model of lots of things now. (2) If divisive normalization can account for the pattern, but a 2-process model could account for it better, the conclusion would be completely different. I think there's some merit in including the modeling, but if there's not going to be a quantitative comparison, the interpretation and weighting of this part of the paper should be toned down.</p><p>4) fMRI study design. I was puzzled by several of the fMRI design and analysis decisions. I would have assumed that a standard block design to test this question would include blocks of all condition types within a single run, with counterbalanced order, and some fixation blocks interspersed. Instead they only tested 2 conditions per run, in strictly alternating order, with no fixation period between. Then the analysis was to simply take the average raw BOLD signal over the timecourse of a given type of block, with a &quot;baseline signal&quot; subtracted. But the baseline was taken 0-4s prior to block onset, which corresponds to the peak of the previous block (which was always the opposite condition). Given this, why take a baseline at all, rather than just directly compare the conditions? These choices produce some serious interpretation concerns if I'm understanding their design/analysis correctly.</p><p>5) One factor that surely affects the authors' fMRI results are different RF sizes in MT and EVC. This matters as the stimulus sizes (small, medium and large) are fixed, so the relative differences between stimulus size and average RF size will differ between MT and EVC. This will surely affect any signal that depends on a spatial activation of visual RFs. This is a concern that really limits a comparison between EVC and MT results-a limitation that needs to be explicitly addressed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Suppression and facilitation of human neural responses&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by David Van Essen (Senior editor), Nick Turk-Browne (Reviewing editor), and two of the original reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) There is still ambiguity about the fMRI design. In the rebuttal, the authors clarify that in the alternating block design, the small stimulus represents the &quot;baseline&quot; and the question is whether there is any change from this baseline during the large stimulus blocks. However, this is not how the analysis is described in the Materials and methods. The Materials and methods still state that &quot;For each type of block (e.g. small and large stimuli), response baseline was determined by averaging the signal across all such epochs between 0-4 s prior to block onset.&quot; This makes it seem like there are 2 conditions of interest in each run (small, large), and each is compared to its own baseline. This was the source of initial confusion, because &quot;baselines&quot; here are confounded with the other condition. From the rebuttal, though, it sounds like each run has a single condition of interest (&quot;large&quot;), and this is compared to the baseline of &quot;small&quot;. This would explain why the figures only show small-to-large timecourses and not also large-to-small. The Materials and methods need to be revised to be much more clear about this.</p><p>2) In the rebuttal, the authors explicitly clarify that &quot;we can say there is no evidence for strong, or even moderate correlations (stronger than r =.52) in our data […]&quot;. This statement/caveat should be made explicit in the manuscript, and not just in the Materials and methods; this seems like an important Discussion point. In particular, what are the theoretical implications if there were a weak but reliable correlation between these factors? The current experiment with this power can only detect strong correlations – but does the absence of a strong/moderate correlation imply that spatial suppression &quot;is not directly mediated&quot; by inhibition? Is there a theoretical reason to think that a hypothetical weak but reliable correlation would be evidence of something other than direct mediation? What is the a priori threshold needed to claim &quot;direct mediation&quot;? The authors need to address (in the manuscript) the fact that they only have the power to detect strong correlations, why they think it's theoretically justified to only focus on strong/moderate correlations, and leave open the possibility that there may still be weaker correlations that could not be detected here. Along these lines, the authors did not sufficiently &quot;soften&quot; their claims.

This difference is about two-fold, indicating that about twice as much stimulus response is needed to reach the threshold at high rather than at low contrast. This does require an explanation and/or justification. The criterion model implicitly assumes some temporal accumulation to a criterion that determines a threshold. Why would that differ between low and high contrast? More importantly, how important is this criterion difference for the authors' claim that the same model can explain both low and high contrast data? This is less of an issue if this is not critical for the authors' claim.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise an interesting and important point, and we have provided additional explanation and justification for our use of different criterion values within the model for low and high contrast stimuli. These additions appear in the Computational Modeling section of the Materials and methods. Our additions to the manuscript attempt to capture the following points:</p><p>First, we want to emphasize that a single criterion is all that is required to account for the principle duration-threshold findings across all similar published experiments: suppression for high contrast stimuli and summation (and/or summation followed by suppression) for low contrast stimuli. So, in this sense, using different criterion values for different contrast values is not necessary for the model to explain the main characteristics of duration threshold experiments. Also, we note that the model describing the results from the LZ experiment uses a single criterion for both low and high contrast stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>However, there is a particular characteristic of duration threshold findings (present in many publications, including the original Tadin, 2003 Nature paper and in some of our data in this manuscript) that exposes a limitation of the linking hypothesis that thresholds are directly proportional to neural responses in MT (or any other early visual area). Specifically, duration thresholds can be equivalent or shorter for low contrast stimuli compared to high contrast stimuli (this can be seen in our data, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, medium and large sizes). If we fully accept the link between MT responses and duration thresholds, this pattern of behavior would predict that MT responses are greater for very low (3%) contrast stimuli than for very high (98%) contrast stimuli. Responses in MT, however, are strongly driven by luminance contrast (a well-established finding in the field). To further demonstrate this, we have added additional fMRI measurements showing a large increase in MT and EVC responses with increasing luminance contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>). This leads us to the conclusion is that there must be an additional factor (outside of MT and EVC response magnitude) that slows the evidence accumulation rate at high contrast and speeds it up at low contrast. One plausible explanation for slower accumulation at high contrast is stimulus onset masking. Masking has been shown to contribute to the spatial suppression effect, and is thought to be stronger for high contrast stimuli (Churan, 2009; Tsui, 2011).</p><p>From a modeling perspective, we addressed this issue by including different criterion values for low and high contrast stimuli in Equation 3, which transforms the ‘MT model’ response to a ‘behavioral’ threshold – it is basically a way for us to simplistically acknowledge within the model that there are ‘downstream’ contrast-dependent processes (e.g., masking) that are beyond the scope of the current manuscript. Further research will be needed to clarify how factors such as masking contribute to spatial suppression, and how this may be described within a model framework.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Statistical power and conclusions of MRS study. Only 22 subjects were included, which seems pretty small for an individual differences study. There is a statement about power analyses performed, but I was confused about what data the power analyses were performed on. Was this an a priori power analysis (from what dataset?) estimating that N=21 to 27 would be enough? Or was this a post-hoc power analysis on the actual dataset, which should only tell you the effect size? More information is needed if this is to be convincing. This issue is particularly problematic because the main finding is a null result; that is, a lack of a significant correlation. But the effect goes in the predicted direction, with r=-.32 and p=. 14 for high-contrast suppression, and the binary split data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>) also show something small in the predicted direction. It is one thing to state that there was not a statistically reliable result, but to definitively conclude a lack of effect, especially given the sample size, seems unwarranted (e.g. Abstract: &quot;suppression is not driven by GABA-mediated inhibition&quot;). Without this effect the conclusions and impact of the paper are certainly dampened, though it may still be sufficiently interesting to frame it as raising doubt about the GABA-mediated mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ concern, and have taken steps to address this issue. First, the power analysis was indeed post-hoc, and was used to answer the question “What is the smallest correlation that we have sufficient power to detect, given our sample size?” Based on a standard type-II error rate of 0.2, we determined that our sample sizes (n = 21 to 27, depending on the analysis) gave us sufficient power to detect correlations of r ≥ 0.52, should such correlations exist. The reviewers are right to state that we cannot claim that there’s no correlation between GABA and suppression exists on the basis of these data. Rather, we can say that there is no evidence for strong, or even moderate correlations (stronger than r = 0.52) in our data – correlations that we would have sufficient power to detect in our sample if they existed.</p><p>We have clarified the fact that our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (median split by GABA+ in hMT+) did not show the predicted pattern of higher thresholds for large stimuli (stronger suppression) with greater GABA+; if anything, there is a greater effect of GABA+ for small high contrast stimuli, which does not match our prediction. It is also worth noting that with 8 correlations for the psychophysical and fMRI suppression metrics, we would expect to find a p-value &lt; 0.12 just by chance alone (without correction for multiple comparisons). Further, the observed correlation coefficients do not follow a consistent pattern across stimulus conditions, suggesting no consistent relationship between GABA concentration and suppression magnitude.</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree that the portions of the text that discuss this finding should be softened. We have taken steps to adjust our statements regarding the MRS results and overall role of GABA in suppression throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Impact of computational modeling study. The authors explain in the Materials and methods: &quot;We emphasize that our goal was not to quantitatively describe the data in terms of the model but instead to show that normalization, as a computational principle, is sufficient to qualitatively account for our findings.&quot; I find this a bit unsatisfying. Does it really tell us much to say that a particular model could account for the behavioral pattern? (1) I don't think that this &quot;could&quot; statement is particularly surprising – divisive normalization is a broad, pretty mainstream model of lots of things now. (2) If divisive normalization can account for the pattern, but a 2-process model could account for it better, the conclusion would be completely different. I think there's some merit in including the modeling, but if there's not going to be a quantitative comparison, the interpretation and weighting of this part of the paper should be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised this section to provide greater clarity on the goals of the modeling work, and toned down the interpretation and weight according to the reviewer’s suggestion. While we do provide a quantitative description of our results in terms of the model parameters, our intention with this work was not to find the precise parameter values that provide the best algorithmic fit to our data. Rather, we sought to demonstrate that, using a reasonable set of manually derived parameters, a well-accepted single process model (divisive normalization) is sufficient to explain both suppression and summation. This initial effort provided proof-of-concept; future experiments with a larger number of stimulus conditions (i.e., sizes and contrasts), will permit more precise fitting of model parameters and direct comparisons with 2-stage models. This will be of particular interest when applying this paradigm within clinical populations (e.g., does a change within a single parameter of this model account for the behavior observed in a given population?)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) fMRI study design. I was puzzled by several of the fMRI design and analysis decisions. I would have assumed that a standard block design to test this question would include blocks of all condition types within a single run, with counterbalanced order, and some fixation blocks interspersed. Instead they only tested 2 conditions per run, in strictly alternating order, with no fixation period between. Then the analysis was to simply take the average raw BOLD signal over the timecourse of a given type of block, with a &quot;baseline signal&quot; subtracted. But the baseline was taken 0-4s prior to block onset, which corresponds to the peak of the previous block (which was always the opposite condition). Given this, why take a baseline at all, rather than just directly compare the conditions? These choices produce some serious interpretation concerns if I'm understanding their design/analysis correctly.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right to point out the importance of our experimental design in measuring suppression and summation using fMRI. We have provided additional citations and greater detail in both the Results and Materials and methods sections regarding this aspect of the experiment, in order to clarify this point.</p><p>We note that this alternating-block experimental design has a long history of use for measuring visual surround suppression via fMRI (e.g., Zenger-Landolt and Heeger, 2003; Williams and Singh, 2003). By first defining an ROI that responds selectively to the smaller stimulus (center &gt; surround; Olman and Heeger, 2007; Schallmo and Olman, 2016), and comparing the fMRI response within this ROI between small (our baseline) and large (suppression or summation) blocks, we established a null hypothesis of no change in the fMRI response. That is, if the surrounding stimuli had no effect on the response to the center, then the response should not change between blocks, as the center stimulus was constant across both. Essentially, we are directly comparing the relative fMRI responses to small and large stimuli, without referencing these responses to a separate (potentially noisy) baseline response to fixation alone.</p><p>While mixed block designs have also been used during fMRI to study surround suppression (e.g., Pihlaja, 2008), the current paradigm was designed for (ongoing) use within a clinical population, and thus is intended to be especially robust to subject noise (e.g., head motion). By not relying on a GLM, this paradigm permits us to determine whether there were any outliers in the fMRI response on a block-by-block basis, and exclude them (a step not required in the current study).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) One factor that surely affects the authors' fMRI results are different RF sizes in MT and EVC. This matters as the stimulus sizes (small, medium and large) are fixed, so the relative differences between stimulus size and average RF size will differ between MT and EVC. This will surely affect any signal that depends on a spatial activation of visual RFs. This is a concern that really limits a comparison between EVC and MT results-a limitation that needs to be explicitly addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s point, and have greatly expanded upon the existing consideration of this issue (from the Results) in the Discussion section. By first localizing hMT+, and then finding voxels within this ROI that respond preferentially to center &gt; surround (from a separate localizer scan), we sought to identify the most comparable voxels to those identified in EVC, within the limitations of the current fMRI technique. We now explicitly discuss this limitation of our method as it relates to comparing results between hMT+ and EVC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) There is still ambiguity about the fMRI design. In the rebuttal, the authors clarify that in the alternating block design, the small stimulus represents the &quot;baseline&quot; and the question is whether there is any change from this baseline during the large stimulus blocks. However, this is not how the analysis is described in the Materials and methods. The Materials and methods still state that &quot;For each type of block (e.g. small and large stimuli), response baseline was determined by averaging the signal across all such epochs between 0-4 s prior to block onset.&quot; This makes it seem like there are 2 conditions of interest in each run (small, large), and each is compared to its own baseline. This was the source of initial confusion, because &quot;baselines&quot; here are confounded with the other condition. From the rebuttal, though, it sounds like each run has a single condition of interest (&quot;large&quot;), and this is compared to the baseline of &quot;small&quot;. This would explain why the figures only show small-to-large timecourses and not also large-to-small. The Materials and methods need to be revised to be much more clear about this.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the lack of clarity in this section, and have taken steps to improve our explanation of the fMRI analysis. In particular, we now explicitly point out in both the Results and Materials and methods that: 1) the large stimulus block was our “block of interest,” and 2) that the response from the end of the small stimulus block served as the response baseline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the rebuttal, the authors explicitly clarify that &quot;we can say there is no evidence for strong, or even moderate correlations (stronger than r =.52) in our data […]&quot;. This statement/caveat should be made explicit in the manuscript, and not just in the Materials and methods; this seems like an important Discussion point. In particular, what are the theoretical implications if there were a weak but reliable correlation between these factors? The current experiment with this power can only detect strong correlations – but does the absence of a strong/moderate correlation imply that spatial suppression &quot;is not directly mediated&quot; by inhibition? Is there a theoretical reason to think that a hypothetical weak but reliable correlation would be evidence of something other than direct mediation? What is the a priori threshold needed to claim &quot;direct mediation&quot;? The authors need to address (in the manuscript) the fact that they only have the power to detect strong correlations, why they think it's theoretically justified to only focus on strong/moderate correlations, and leave open the possibility that there may still be weaker correlations that could not be detected here. Along these lines, the authors did not sufficiently &quot;soften&quot; their claims. In addition to the lack of caveats or softening in the Discussion, the results still make statements such as &quot;no correlations were found&quot;, &quot;there was no association between&quot;, and &quot;no relationship between&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded upon our discussion of this issue to include the statement regarding “no evidence for strong or even moderate correlations […]” in the second paragraph of the Discussion. We now explicitly mention the possibility of weak, undetected correlations between GABA+ and suppression strength, and the implications of such. Further, we have taken greater measures to soften the language surrounding this point, both here in the Discussion, as well as in the MRS Results (as noted by the reviewers), and at the end of the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the rebuttal and revision the authors are claiming that the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> if anything show an effect in the opposite direction as predicted, but this is confusing.
