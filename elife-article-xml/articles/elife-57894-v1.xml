shown promising results in clinical cancer trials, but markers predicting AZD1775 response are lacking. Here we analysed AZD1775 response in a panel of human breast cancer (BC) cell lines by global proteome/transcriptome profiling and identified two groups of basal-like BC (BLBCs): ‘PTEN low’ BLBCs were highly sensitive to AZD1775 and failed to recover following removal of AZD1775, while ‘PTEN high’ BLBCs recovered. AZD1775 induced phosphorylation of DNA-PK, protecting cells from replication-associated DNA damage and promoting cellular recovery. Deletion of DNA-PK or PTEN, or inhibition of DNA-PK sensitized recovering BLBCs to AZD1775 by abrogating replication arrest, allowing replication despite DNA damage. This was linked to reduced CHK1 activation, increased cyclin E levels and apoptosis. In conclusion, we identified PTEN and DNA-PK as essential regulators of replication checkpoint arrest in response to AZD1775 and defined PTEN as a promising biomarker for efficient WEE1 cancer therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PTEN</kwd><kwd>DNA-PK</kwd><kwd>AZD1775</kwd><kwd>basal-like breast cancer</kwd><kwd>WEE1</kwd><kwd>cyclin

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Deregulation of DNA replication, often attributed to aberrant oncogene-induced replication stress (RS) is a hallmark and driver of cancerogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). RS induces various DNA lesions, including highly cytotoxic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), leading to an increased reliance on replication checkpoints and repair activities and has therefore been described as an ¨Achilles heel¨ of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartkova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kotsantis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maya-Mendoza et al., 2018</xref>). Targeting such activities may be detrimental for cancer cell survival and present novel treatment strategies as exemplified by the synthetic lethality between BRCA1/2 mutated, homologous recombination (HR)-defective tumours, and inactivation of single strand break (SSB) repair by Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashworth, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bryant et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dobbelstein and Sørensen, 2015</xref>). Regrettably, highly aggressive and genetically unstable cancers often rewire checkpoint/repair pathways that contribute to chemotherapy resistance and escape from targeted therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marzio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yazinski et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Uncoupling of polymerase and helicase activities during oncogene-induced RS leads to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) bound by replication protein A (RPA) and activation of ATR for protection of stalled replication forks and/or repair of damaged DNA. ssDNA-RPA mediated recruitment of ATR (through ATRIP) promotes phosphorylation of H2AX and activation of CHK1. ATR-CHK1 then orchestrate the RS response through various downstream targets including phosphorylation and inactivation of phosphatase CDC25 and inhibition of CDK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kotsantis et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, inhibition of ATR has been recognized as an attractive pharmacological strategy for amplification of RS in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lecona and Fernandez-Capetillo, 2018</xref>). Indeed, Toledo et al. demonstrated that unscheduled origin firing upon ATR inhibition caused replicative stress and eventually replication catastrophe due to RPA depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toledo et al., 2013</xref>). However, activation of CHK1 was shown to circumvent replication catastrophe associated with ATR inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buisson et al., 2015</xref>) and co-inhibition of CHK1 produced synthetic lethality in cancer cells through CDK-dependent origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanjiv et al., 2016</xref>). Accumulating evidence demonstrates significant crosstalk between different DNA damage response (DDR) kinases. For instance, DNA-PK was shown to facilitate ATR signalling at stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2018</xref>) and reinforce ATR-mediated checkpoint activation through RPA phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashley et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The WEE1 checkpoint kinase controls DNA replication and the G2/M transition through phosphorylation of CDKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parker and Piwnica-Worms, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watanabe et al., 1995</xref>). Inhibition of WEE1 removes the negative phosphorylation on Y15-CDK2 (in concert with CDC25) resulting in overactivation of CDK2, increased origin firing and reduced replication fork processivity. Indeed, deletion of CDK2 was shown to desensitize cancer cells to WEE1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heijink et al., 2015</xref>). WEE1 also phosphorylates and blocks CDK1 activity in response to DNA damage, activating the G2/M checkpoint to prevent unscheduled mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Russell and Nurse, 1987</xref>). Consequently, WEE1 inhibition can force cells to undergo pre-mature mitosis and mitotic catastrophe and combined inhibition of WEE1 and ATR is synergistic in vitro and in vivo, thus representing a promising therapeutic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bukhari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruiz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Young et al., 2019</xref>). However, the relative contribution of different checkpoint kinases and repair/replication factors in regulating recovery following treatment with these drugs remains to be elucidated. Overexpression of WEE1 is associated with poor patient outcome in several malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iorns et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Slipicevic et al., 2014</xref>), and to date few markers predicting response to WEE1 inhibition have been identified.</p><p>In this study, we performed a systematic analysis of AZD1775 sensitivity in relation to global proteome and transcriptome in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and identified a group of basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cell lines with low PTEN expression that were highly sensitive to AZD1775 monotherapy. Importantly, we show that PTEN-positive BLBC cell lines recovered following AZD1775 treatment through a DNA-PK-mediated mechanism and demonstrate potent synergy between AZD1775 and DNA-PK inhibitor NU7441. AZD1775 induced the phosphorylation of DNA-PKc (here referred to as DNA-PK) and CHK1 independently of ATR and deletion of DNA-PK prevented recovery of proliferation following AZD1775 monotherapy, establishing a novel synthetic lethal interaction between DNA-PK and AZD1775 in BLBC cells. Together, these results identify PTEN as a potential biomarker that may help to guide efficient WEE1 inhibitor therapy in the clinical setting, and show that a key function of PTEN and DNA-PK is to protect BLBC cells from lethal DNA damage by suppressing excessive replication stress induced by AZD1775.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Differential response and recovery of basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cell lines to AZD1775 monotherapy</title><p>To assess breast cancer cell line sensitivity to AZD1775, we performed a high-content imaging (HCI)-based analysis of 16 cell lines representing major subtypes of breast cancer treated with AZD1775 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Changes in cell numbers following AZD1775 treatment were retrieved at single-cell resolution and visualized as dose response curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Inhibition of proliferation in response to AZD1775 was further validated by crystal violet staining assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> and data not shown). Among all the cell lines tested, the BLBC subtype displayed the highest sensitivity to AZD1775 acutely compared with luminal cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), in agreement with recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bukhari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2018</xref>). To assess whether the response to AZD1775 persisted following removal of inhibitor, we evaluated cellular recovery by drug washout experiments. Since ATR inhibition by AZD6738 has been reported to be synergistic with AZD1775 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2018</xref>), cellular recovery following single-agent treatment was compared to AZD1775 + AZD6738 combination treatment. Importantly, even though the combination was synergistic acutely in multiple BLBC cell lines, it provided no clear synergism in a subset of BLBC cell lines that were highly sensitive to AZD1775 monotherapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Instead, AZD1775 mono-treatment prevented recovery of the highly sensitive BLBC cell lines as opposed to the group of BLBC cell lines that re-proliferated after AZD1775 monotherapy drug washout (hereafter referred to as sensitive and recovering BLBCs, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bukhari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2018</xref>), AZD1175 treatment was accompanied by decreased tyrosine 15 phosphorylation of CDK1 and CDK2 (i.e. CDK activation), while the acute synergistic effect of the combination treatment enhanced DNA damage as shown by an increased phosphorylation on S139-γH2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). The increased γH2AX phosphorylation in response to AZD1175 or the combination treatment was attenuated by the CDK2 inhibitor Milciclib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), confirming that the DNA-damaging effect of WEE1 inhibition is attributed to CDK activation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Differential response and recovery of basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cell lines to AZD1775 monotherapy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of the HCI AZD1775 screen in breast cancer cell lines and drug response characteristics. Activity Area - AA, EC50 - concentration of compound achieving 50% of the maximum effect, IC50 - concentration of compound achieving 50% reduction in cell number, and cell cycle profile.

To identify markers associated with AZD1775 sensitivity in breast cancer, we performed a systematic analysis of AZD1775 response profiles in relation to the global proteome and transcriptome in the panel of breast cancer cell lines. The proteomics profiling identified proteins from 11408 genes with 9222 proteins with quantitative data across all sample replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Analysis of the proteomics and transcriptomics data showed a significant correlation (Spearman’s averages correlation was 0.63 and median 0.69) between protein and mRNA expression levels across the cell line models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary files 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>). Similarly, we found a general connection between DNA copy-number aberrations and changes to mRNA and protein expression levels (data not shown). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the breast cancer proteomics data using the intrinsic subtype classifier PAM50 genes showed sample clusters separating luminal from BLBC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). On the gene level we found clusters of functionally linked genes relating to the main transcriptional features of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neve et al., 2006</xref>). Correlation of AZD1775 drug sensitivity to all proteins in the cell line panel identified PTEN expression as one of the strongest predictors of sensitivity to AZD1775 both at the protein (p=0.0002) and RNA levels (p=0.0002) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). Expression levels of other proteins associated with AZD1775 sensitivity (TP53I11, CTPS1 and CDC7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) did not discriminate between sensitivity and recovery of BLBC cells post AZD1775 treatment and was mainly linked to molecular subtype (basal-like vs luminal cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The negative correlation between PTEN expression and AZD1775 response was validated in several breast cancer cell lines by immunoblotting and drug response profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). To further explore the relationship between PTEN expression and dependency on WEE1 in breast cancer cell lines, we assessed WEE1 RNAi loss-of-function gene effects using the depmap portal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McFarland et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsherniak et al., 2017</xref>) and estimated the reliance on PTEN protein expression for viability. Strikingly, low PTEN protein was significantly correlated with a greater dependency on WEE1 in our proteomic dataset (Pearson’s correlation, r = 0.70, p=0.008) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Co-dependency between WEE1 and PTEN protein was also found in an independent proteome dataset generated in the Gygi lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nusinow et al., 2020</xref>) (Pearson’s correlation, r = 0.40, p=0.041) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). To investigate if PTEN regulates recovery following AZD1775 monotherapy, we first generated two isogenic PTEN knockout lines of the recovering BLBC cell line MDA-MB-231 using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). PTEN-proficient and PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with AZD1775 and cellular recovery was assessed after removal of AZD1775. Consistently, deletion of PTEN significantly attenuated recovery of MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We next assessed replication-associated DNA damage in PTEN-proficient and PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-231 cells and in AZD1775 sensitive HCC1937 cells by high-content immunofluorescence microscopy of γH2AX/EdU. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>, AZD1775 treatment significantly increased phosphorylation of γH2AX in replicating (EdU+) PTEN-deficient cells as compared to PTEN-proficient cells, supporting an impaired replication checkpoint and increased sensitivity to AZD1775-induced RS in the PTEN-deleted cells. Accordingly, re-expression of PTEN in hypersensitive PTEN-negative HCC1937 cells significantly reduced AZD1775 sensitivity as compared to HCC1937 empty vector (EV) control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Similar results were obtained using an independent WEE1 inhibitor (PD0166285) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Knockdown of WEE1 using siRNAs also reduced the viability of PTEN-deficient as compared to PTEN-proficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, colony formation assays confirmed improved ability of PTEN-reconstituted HCC1937 cells to reproliferate post AZD1775 monotherapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In conclusion, PTEN can not only be used as a new biomarker for AZD1775 sensitivity, but apparently also plays an active role in processes that have an impact on recovery from AZD1775 treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ATR inhibition by AZD6738 exacerbates AZD1775-induced RS and abrogates recovery of replication</title><p>We next looked closer into the subgroup of BLBC cell lines recovering post AZD1775 monotherapy.

Consequently, EdU labelling after 23 hr of drug treatments showed that only 13% of cells treated with the AZD1775 + AZD6738 combination incorporated EdU, while a substantial fraction of mono- and vehicle-treated cells were in active replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These data were confirmed in vivo using a xenograft model with MDA-MB-231 cells where the combination treatment strongly reduced BrdU incorporation, whereas the monotherapies had only marginal effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consistent with this, removal of AZD1775 (or AZD6738) restored replication in MDA-MB-231 and BT20 cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), recapitulating the recovery phenotype and demonstrating that AZD1775-induced RS is well tolerated in these BLBC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref> and B). By contrast, the AZD1775 + AZD6738 combination completely prevented EdU incorporation and recovery of proliferation even at low doses of AZD1775 supporting a wide therapeutic window and high potency of AZD1775 when combined with AZD6738 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Further, AZD1775 + AZD6738 treatment strongly increased the number of β-gal positive cells, suggesting that the combination leads to cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), a state of persistent cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">d'Adda di Fagagna, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Halazonetis et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ATR inhibition by AZD6738 exacerbates AZD1775-induced RS and abrogates recovery of replication.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantification of cell proliferation post-drug treatment as indicated in MDA-MB-231 cells. Error bars indicate standard deviation calculated from three independent experiments.

In addition, we analysed induction of DNA damage by γH2AX staining as well as expression of RAD51. Both AZD1775 mono-treatment and the AZD1775 + AZD6738 combination increased formation of ssDNA, the combination with very rapid kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Although the single-agent treatments induced replication-associated DNA damage, the number of γH2AX foci was strongly reduced in the mono-treated cells after 3 days of drug wash-out, indicative of ongoing DNA repair, while a high proportion of the combo-treated cells retained γH2AX foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>).

Although AZD6738 acutely attenuated AZD1775-induced phosphorylation of S345-CHK1, phosphorylated CHK1 was preserved in cells treated with the AZD1775 + AZD6738 combination relative to total CHK1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), and phosphorylation of RPA accumulated with the AZD1775 + AZD6738 combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting activation of a compensatory pathway that preserves CHK1 phosphorylation and presumably replication arrest when ATR is inhibited. Further, CHK1 phosphorylation was sustained following wash-out of the two combined drugs as compared to wash-out after AZD1775 mono-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Previous studies have reported that DNA-PK maintains the stability of CHK1 in response to replication stress and DNA-PK-mediated phosphorylation of CHK1 was shown to inhibit origin firing when ATR is inactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buisson et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, we found that DNA-PK was phosphorylated by the combination treatment and interestingly, also by AZD1775 mono-treatment while total DNA-PK protein level was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>).

Importantly, recovery assays after drug wash-out showed that DNA-PK-deficient cells were unable to proliferate following AZD1775 mono-treatment, demonstrating that DNA-PK is critical for cellular recovery in response to AZD1775-induced RS in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To delineate the dependency on DNA-PK for DNA replication post AZD1775 treatment, we first analysed the phosphorylation status of DNA-PK and CHK1 in response to AZD1775 or the AZD1775 + AZD6738 combination by immunofluorescence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). AZD1775 + AZD6738 combination increased phosphorylation of DNA-PK compared to AZD1775 single-agent treatment in the DNA-PK-proficient cells, presumably compensating for the inactivation of ATR by AZD6738 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <italic>image c vs. image g</italic>). Phosphorylation of CHK1 (pS345-CHK1) was induced regardless of the presence or the absence of DNA-PK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <italic>image d vs. image f</italic>). This result suggests that ATR compensates for the lack of DNA-PK and confirms that ATR is the primary kinase responsible for pS345-CHK1 in response to RS. However, while pS345-CHK1 was sustained in DNA-PK-proficient cells treated with the AZD1775 + AZD6738 combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <italic>image h</italic>), phosphorylation of CHK1 was reduced in DNA-PK-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <italic>image j vs. h</italic>), providing supporting evidence that DNA-PK-mediates phosphorylation of CHK1 when ATR is inhibited. Consistently, these results were confirmed by immunoblot analysis with pS345-CHK1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), thus supporting a dual function of DNA-PK in promoting phosphorylation of CHK1 in the absence of ATR (AZD1775 + AZD6738 treatment) and regulating recovery of proliferation in the presence of ATR (AZD1775 treatment) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C and D</xref>). To investigate recovery in more detail and its dependency on DNA-PK, we analysed replication-associated DNA damage (EdU/γH2AX) by high-content immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>, combined treatment with DNA-PK inhibitors (NU7441) and AZD1775 significantly increased DNA damage in the replicating fraction of MDA-MB-231 cells, compared to mono-treatment with either AZD1775 or NU7441. EdU/γH2AX staining by FACS analysis corroborated these results, showing a clear increase of γH2AX-labelled cells in the replicating fraction (EdU+) of DNA-PK-deficient compared to DNA-PK-proficient cells treated with AZD1775 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Taken together, these data support a direct function of DNA-PK in facilitating replication arrest in response to AZD1775-induced RS even in cells with functional ATR.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>DNA-PK regulates recovery of replication and survival in response to AZD1775.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of DNA-PK expression in MDA-MB-231 scrambled control and isogenic DNA-PK knock-out cell lines (clones #1 and #2).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>, AZD1775 mono- and AZD1775 + AZD6738 combination-treatment induced phosphorylation of DNA-PK in HCC38 cells, thus ruling out that DNA-PK phosphorylation deficiency per se is the source of the replication-induced DNA damage and lack of recovery in AZD1775-sensitive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Although AZD1775 induced phosphorylation of CHK1 in HCC38 cells, the total level of pS345-CHK1 was lower compared to recovering MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that CHK1 signalling is partially compromised in cells sensitive to AZD1775 monotherapy. We next investigated whether deletion of PTEN affected AZD1775-induced DNA-PK and CHK1 phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, phosphorylation of DNA-PK was enhanced in the PTEN-knockout cells treated with AZD1775 while S345-CHK1 phosphorylation was attenuated compared to PTEN-proficient cells. As expected, AKT was hyperphosphorylated in PTEN deleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Although these results do not establish a direct link between PTEN and DNA-PK activity, they indicate that both PTEN loss and DNA-PK loss interfere with CHK1 activation in response to AZD1775 treatment, which presumably contributes to the increased sensitivity to AZD1775 monotherapy. As low PTEN expression is one of the strongest predictors of AZD1775 response and deletion of PTEN is associated with replication-induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we assessed expression of proteins relevant to replication checkpoint control and AZD1775 sensitivity using our proteomic dataset. Due to the relatively small number of cell lines compared to the large number of proteins in our proteomic dataset, unbiased analysis could have a high false discovery rate and we therefore focused on specific proteins involved in DNA replication and repair. HR repair proteins ATR, BRCA1, BRCA2 or the NHEJ factors DNA-PK, XRCC5, XRCC6 did not associate with AZD1775 sensitivity, suggesting the levels of these proteins are likely not associated with AZD1775 sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In agreement with the significant association between low PTEN protein expression and sensitivity to AZD1775, we found that the group of AZD1775-sensitive BLBC cell lines have low levels of PTEN protein compared to the group of BLBC recovering following AZD1775 monotherapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Notably, among the AZD1775-sensitive cell lines, only MDA-MB-157 cells had high PTEN protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, several cell lines in the AZD1775-sensitive subgroup displayed elevated levels of cyclin E protein, including MDA-MB-157 cells harbouring CCNE1 amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition to low PTEN expression and/or high cyclin E expression, low WEE1 expression levels reached significance between sensitive and recovering subgroups, while neither MYC, cyclin A or RRM2 protein expression levels were associated with AZD1775 sensitivity or recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Markedly, we found that AZD1775 treatment drastically reduced cyclin E protein expression in MDA-MB-231 control cells while PTEN- or DNA-PK-deleted cells exhibited only partial suppression of cyclin E in response to the AZD1775 monotherapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results suggest that insufficient CHK1 activation and elevated levels of cyclin E in PTEN/DNA-PK-deleted cells could be the source of DNA damage and cell death following AZD1775 monotherapy. Supporting this possibility, knockdown of cyclin E reduced γH2AX level and increased viability in response to AZD1775 in MDA-MB-231 cells, directly linking AZD1775-induced replication stress to cyclin E expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Altogether, our findings support a model in which PTEN-deficient BLBC cells have a lower threshold of tolerable replication stress due to defective DNA-PK-CHK1 replication checkpoint response and elevated levels of cyclin E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Deletion of DNAPK or PTEN attenuates CHK1 phosphorylation, impedes downregulation of cyclin E and overrides replication arrest in response to AZD1775 monotherapy-induced DNA damage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HCC38 cells were treated with the indicated drugs for 24 or 48 hr and phosphorylation of DNA-PK (pT2609) was analysed by HCI analysis. The proportion of pT2609-DNA-PK-labelled cells represents mean of three biological replicates ± SEM.

Our study shows that loss of PTEN is one of the strongest markers of AZD1775 sensitivity and response in breast cancer cell lines, and that PTEN-deficient BLBC cell lines are unable to recover following removal of AZD1775. WEE1 inhibition is known to cause replication stress-driven DNA damage through over-activation of cyclin E/CDK2, which in turn triggers the ATR/CHK1 DNA damage checkpoint leading to replication arrest and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sorensen and Syljuasen, 2012</xref>). Our results show that PTEN deficiency was associated with abrogation of the replication checkpoint, resulting in continued replication despite DNA damage, leading to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). PTEN loss deregulate PIK3/AKT/mTOR signalling, which could have an impact on replication stress for instance by increasing cyclin E levels through AKT-mediated inhibition of GSK3 (which prevent cyclin E degradation by the FBW7 ubiquitin ligase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arabi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Welcker and Clurman, 2008</xref>]). However, deregulation of PTEN/PIK3/AKT signalling can also promote genomic instability through various mechanisms including inactivation of the G2 checkpoint, CHK1 phosphorylation, mis-localization of BRCA1/RPA and loading/unloading of DNA-PK onto DNA damage sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that sensitivity to AZD1775 in this regard may lie beyond deregulation of AKT activity.</p><p>Interestingly, in-depth genetic analyses of breast cancer specimens pin-pointed a novel molecular breast cancer subtype characterized by a genetic footprint indicative of a defective HR-based DNA repair mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nik-Zainal et al., 2016</xref>). This homology repair-deficient footprint is enriched for basal-like/triple-negative characteristics, germline and somatic BRCA1 mutations, loss of p53, and notably loss of PTEN by deletion or mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nik-Zainal et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, He et al. showed that PTEN deletion leads to dissociation of RAD51 from replication forks highlighting an important role for PTEN in regulating the replication stress cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2015</xref>). PTEN deletion was previously shown to reduce the average inter-origin distance increasing origin density, presumably due to deregulation of dormant origin firing during RS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2015</xref>). These results are in agreement with our findings that PTEN-deleted BLBCs display decreased CHK1 activation in response to AZD1775, and supporting an increased dependency on replication initiating factors such as cyclin E/CDK2. A direct link between impaired CHK1 activation, cyclin E deregulation and increased AZD1775 sensitivity in PTEN-deficient BLBC cells remains to be determined. Nonetheless, our findings are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that loss of PTEN and activation of AKT leads to reduced nuclear localization and impaired CHK1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Puc et al., 2005</xref>) and lethal interactions between inhibition of CHK1 and WEE1 in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarts et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, Sen et al reported that CHK1 is activated in AZD1775-resistant cells as an escape mechanism to overcome accumulation of DNA damage and cell death, however this study did not investigate expression of PTEN/cyclin E in relation to CHK1 activation and AZD1775 sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Prior studies have addressed the association of specific genes with acute response to AZD1775, including key regulatory proteins such as p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarts et al., 2012</xref>), SETD2 and RRM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pfister et al., 2015</xref>). p53 is frequently mutated in BLBC tumours but expression of p53 was not associated with response to AZD1775 in our panel of cell lines (data not shown). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pfister et al., 2015</xref>), we found that AZD1775 treatment reduced expression of RRM2 protein, but neither RRM2 nor SETD2 expression levels significantly correlated with recovery following AZD1775 treatment although a trend towards lower RRM2 expression was found in the AZD1775 sensitive group. In our dataset WEE1 expression levels reached significance between sensitive and recovering cell lines at 5% FDR, and interestingly, low expression of WEE1 was found in the group of AZD1775 sensitive cell lines. Whether low WEE1 expression is associated with increased cyclin E-CDK2 activity and elevated intrinsic RS, and consequently increased AZD1775 sensitivity in these breast cancer cell lines is not known. However, we did not find a significant difference of proliferation-related proteins or cell cycle populations in the different BLBC subgroups, regardless of response to AZD1775 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E,F and G</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the status of PTEN as an important determinant of AZD1775 sensitivity, we also discovered a role of DNA-PK as an essential regulator of the replication checkpoint and recovery post AZD1775-treatment, linked to the activation of CHK1 independently of ATR. AZD1775 triggered ATR-CHK1 pathway activation, but also induced phosphorylation of DNA-PK independent of ATR, as DNA-PK phosphorylation was augmented when AZD1775 was combined with ATR inhibitor AZD6738. Interestingly, we found that DNA-PK knockout decreased CHK1 phosphorylation on S345 in response to WEE1 and ATR inhibition. These results underscore a more direct role for DNA-PK in regulation of the replication checkpoint in response to RS beyond its canonical function in classical NHEJ repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis et al., 2014</xref>). In line with these results, Buisson et al. showed that activation of DNA-PK counteracts RS through a CHK1-mediated backup pathway during ATR inhibition and Lin et al. reported that DNA-PK regulates CHK1-Claspin stability for an optimal RS response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buisson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). A more direct role of DNA-PK in regulating replication origin firing has also been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dungrawala et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, although DNA-PK is not an essential gene, it may have indispensable checkpoint functions during high RS. Consistent with this possibility we show that DNA-PK is necessary for protection of BLBC cells from replication-associated DNA damage and maintains replication arrest following AZD1775 mono-treatment. Consequently, deletion of DNA-PK abrogates the replication block following AZD1775-induced activation of ATR-CHK1, thereby allowing replication to proceed despite DNA damage, resulting in apoptosis. Indeed, AZD1775 combined with DNA-PK inhibitors was found to be synergistic in multiple BLBC cell lines. Thus, DNA-PK activation by AZD1775 is sufficient to maintain replication arrest until the DNA damage is repaired (through ATR) and replication can restart (see model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).</p><p>Our findings that AZD1775 treatment result in rapid downregulation of cyclin E protein expression is consistent with WEE1 inhibitor-induced activation of CDK2 (loss of Y15 phosphorylation), autophosphorylation and degradation of cyclin E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hughes et al., 2013</xref>). Knockdown of cyclin E desensitized BLBC cells to AZD1775, and interestingly, DNA-PK-knockout cells were unable to downregulate cyclin E in response to AZD1775 monotherapy. Correspondingly, targeted deletion of PTEN in MDA-MB-231 cells also partially prevented cyclin E downregulation. As mentioned, detailed mechanistic insights into how PTEN and DNA-PK regulate cyclin E expression in response to AZD1775 remain to be investigated. Since a common denominator for both PTEN and DNA-PK deficiency in BLBC cells was the suboptimal phosphorylation of CHK1, and since activated CHK1 is reported to inhibit cyclin/CDK activity in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toledo et al., 2013</xref>), one possibility is that CHK1 plays a direct function in downregulating cyclin E levels in order to maintain the replication arrest in response to AZD1775. Accordingly, Chen et al. recently reported that cyclin E overexpression is a potential biomarker predicting response to AZD1775 monotherapy in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), results consistent with our study.</p><p>In summary, our data show that both PTEN and DNA-PK status contribute to sensitivity to AZD1775 in BLBC cells. Although the relation between PTEN and DNA-PK is still unclear in this respect, both are required for activation of the CHK1 replication checkpoint, shutting down replication upon AZD1775-induced RS and shielding BLBC cells from lethal DNA damage. Future preclinical studies will determine the benefit of PTEN as a potential predictive marker of response to AZD1775 monotherapy and the role of DNA-PK in drug resistance and recurrence.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>NOD/SCID</td><td>Taconic/Denmark</td><td>#NODSC</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>MDA-MB-231</td><td>ATCC</td><td>Cat #HTB-26 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0062">CVCL_0062</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>MDA-MB-231 gScrambled</td><td>This Paper</td><td/><td>CRISPR/Cas9-expressing cell line</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>MDA-MB-231 PTEN-KO</td><td>This Paper</td><td>Clone #1.4 Clone #2.3</td><td>CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out cell lines</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>MDA-MB-231 DNA-PK-KO</td><td>This Paper</td><td>Clone #1.4 Clone #2.3</td><td>CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out cell lines</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HCC1937-Empty vector (EV)</td><td>This Paper</td><td/><td>Stable pBabe-puro expressing cell line</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HCC1937-PTEN</td><td>This Paper</td><td/><td>Stable pBabe-puroL-PTEN expressing cell line</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pBABE-puro (plasmid)</td><td>Addgene</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_1764">Addgene_1764</ext-link></td><td>Retroviral empty backbone construct</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pBABE-puroL PTEN (plasmid)</td><td>Addgene</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgen">Addgen</ext-link> 10785</td><td>Retroviral construct expressing PTEN</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>AZD1775</td><td>AstraZeneca</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>AZD6738</td><td>AstraZeneca</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>GraphPad Prism 8</td><td>GraphPad Software</td><td>Version 8.3 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>CellProfiler</td><td>Carpenter lab, Broad Institute</td><td>Version 3.1 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007358">SCR_007358</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ImageJ</td><td>Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>SynergyFinder</td><td>Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland</td><td>PMCID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5554616/">PMC5554616</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Depmap portal</td><td>Broad Institute</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_017655">SCR_017655</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Breast cancer cell lines included in this study were the luminal cell lines HCC1419, MCF7, CAMA, HCC1428, T47D, and the basal-like cell lines HCC38, HCC70, HCC1569, HCC1937, MDA-MB-157, HCC1143, BT20, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT549, SUM159PT, Cal51, HS578T and SUM149PT.

The Broad Institute sgRNA algorithm was used to design a minimum two sgRNA per targeted genes. Lentiviruses were generated in HEK293FT cells by co-transfecting the specified sgRNA containing-pLenti Cas9 v.2.0 together with the lentivector packaging plasmids, psPAX2 and pMD2.G. Supernatants containing viral particles (48–96 hr post transfection) were pooled and used to infect target cells in the presence of freshly added hexadimethrine bromide (10 mg/mL). Seventy-two hours post-infection, the transduced cells were subsequently selected and maintained as pools or clones in the presence of puromycin (0.5–1.0 µg/mL). Knockdown was assessed by immunoblotting. To verify genomic editing in DNA-PK isogenic knockout cell lines the targeted region was PCR-amplified and cloned into pTOPO2.1, followed by Sanger-sequencing of at least six clones per cell line. If all sequencing reactions revealed the same edited allele in a cell line, we additionally confirmed the presence of only one allele by using Alt-R genome editing detection kit (IDT) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The lentiviral plasmid for expression of PTEN was a gift from William Sellers (Addgene plasmid #10785). Lentiviruses were generated and cells transduced as described above for knockout cell lines.

Briefly, the DNA damage siRNA library consisting of three individual siRNAs for 300 DNA repair genes (Dharmacon) was preprinted into 384 wells in final concentration of 17 nM and complexed with 0.06 µL of siLentFect (Bio-Rad) lipid transfection agent. 1250 MDA-MB-231 (ATCC) cells were applied onto each 384 well as a suspension and allowed to transfect for 24 hr. Replicate one screen plates were treated with 500 nM AZD1775 and replicate 2 plates with 0,01% DMSO. After 48 h cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X 100% and 10% horse serum in PBS and blocked with 10% horse serum. Cells were assayed with antibody for gamma-H2AX (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and labelled with goat-anti-mouse Alexa647 (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA) secondary antibody and DAPI for DNA. Immunostained cells were analysed by microscopic imaging, using an Olympus scanR high content imager (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER CCD digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Hamamatsu, Japan). Cells were analysed using the scanR image analysis software. Integrated nuclear DNA staining was used for imaging cytometry analysis of cell cycle distribution and gamma-H2AX foci counts per nuclei were quantified using a watershed object identification algorithm. For analysis of significance, a Z-score was calculated for cell counts as measure of viability and gamma-H2AX foci counts for induction of DNA damage using global plate mean values and standard deviation for all samples in the plate, including negative controls and excluding positive controls. From this analysis, siRNAs with Z-scores ± 2 standard deviations were considered significant. siRNA DNA repair pathway-based pattern identification analysis was performed using gene ontology annotations from AmiGO two gene ontology database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/landing">http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/landing</ext-link>).

Each 384-well sample well was imaged with a 10 × objective using specific filter sets for DAPI (Semrock, Inc). The effect of the drugs on cell numbers as indicator of cell viability was assessed by comparing cell counts measured in DMSO (negative controls). The DNA counterstaining of the cells was performed according to the following protocol. First the culture medium was aspirated carefully from each well and the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed once for 5 min with PBS. Cell permeabilized was done with 0.3% Triton-X100 in 20 µL of PBS for 15 min at room temperature, followed by PBS wash.

Initial dose response was assessed by image cytometry of 384-wells plates containing cells treated with increasing doses of drugs for 72 hr. At the treatment endpoint, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100, stained with DAPI (1 μg/ml) and labelled with the indicated antibodies in TBS- 0.1% Tween 20 overnight. Non-conjugated primary antibodies were counterstained with the appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor) for 2 hr prior to further wash in TBS and image acquisition using Olympus ScanR at 10x magnification. Minimum four tiles were captured per well for quantitative analysis using Olympus ScanR Analysis Software: the DAPI-positive region of each cell was used as a boundary to quantitate nuclear signal, and a 10 pixel annulus around the nucleus was used to quantitate cytoplasmic signal, omitting nuclear signal. To assess phosphorylation of γH2AX (pS139), DNA-PK (pS2056 and pT2609) and CHK1 (pS345) and expression of DNA-PK, CHK1 and RAD51 by high-content imaging, cells were plated in clear-bottom 96-well plates (Corning) treated as indicated depending on the experimental setup and subsequently stained as described above.

summary:</bold></p><p>PTEN is frequently mutated in human cancers, and most often the loss of PTEN confers drug resistance in those tumors. In this manuscript the authors find that PTEN loss sensitizes basal-like breast cancer lines to WEE1 inhibitors. Moreover, they find that WEE1 inhibitors synergize with DNA-PK inhibitors to kill this tumor type. The work has important clinical ramifications for the therapy of this and other cancers.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;PTEN and DNA-PK determine sensitivity and recovery in response to WEE1 inhibition in breast cancer&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Maureen Murphy as the Senior and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is 'in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>'. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>In this manuscript the authors identify two proteins whose presence dictates resistance to WEE1 inhibitors: PTEN and DNA-PK. The former could serve as a biomarker, and the latter could serve as an actionable target for breast cancer. The authors perform an analysis of AZD1775 sensitivity in relation to the proteome and transcriptome in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. They identify a novel synthetic lethal interaction between DNA-PK and the WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 in basal-like breast cancer cells. The authors create two CRISPR knockout clones of MDA-MB-231 cells and show that loss of PTEN confers sensitivity to WEE1 inhibition by AZD1775. In an odd turn, the authors then turn to combinations of AZD1775 with an ATR inhibitor, and they show the combination is more effective in 231 xenografts. The authors then perform a high-content image-based RNA interference (RNAi) screen of 300 DDR genes in MDA-MB-231 cells, to search for other targets. They identify DNA-PK as a potential target, and they claim to show that NU7441 and AZD1775 are synergistic against basal like breast cancer with high PTEN, but these data do not seem to appear in any of the (several) submitted versions of the manuscript. Overall the manuscript is interesting and the data in it extend upon the findings in the literature of the impact of ATR plus WEE1 inhibitors.</p><p>Overall, if the authors are able to complete the following, this work could be suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>1) The authors should show a table of combination indices which demonstrates synergy between DNA-PK inhibitor NU7441 and AZD1775. Ideally this should also be accompanied by a xenograft analysis of this combination, similar to what the authors have done for ATR/WEE1 combination in Figure 3, but in these days of quarantine it will be acceptable to show rigorous evidence for synergy of NU7441 and AZD1775 in multiple BLBC lines.</p><p>2) Much of the work has been done on a single WEE1 inhibitor. In the interest of rigor, if the authors can show that silencing WEE1 or use of an independent WEE1 inhibitor also shows reliance on PTEN loss for sensitivity, this would improve the broadness of the conclusions.</p><p>3) The model shown in Supplementary figure 7 should be condensed and shown as a main figure in the manuscript.</p><p>4) Finally, the authors should go through the manuscript with a fine-tooth comb and make sure that each figure is referenced correctly, and in order, in the manuscript. Unfortunately, the copy of the revised manuscript did not have figures attached, so it was impossible to do this myself, and several of the figures seemed inaccurately referenced in the text of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57894.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, if the authors are able to complete the following, this work could be suitable for eLife:</p><p>1) The authors should show a table of combination indices which demonstrates synergy between DNA-PK inhibitor NU7441 and AZD1775.

The results from this analysis both validate and expand our findings that low PTEN protein level is a potential vulnerability in WEE1-targeted breast cancer cells. Thus, a greater dependency on WEE1 was found in breast cancer cells with low PTEN levels as shown by a significant correlation between PTEN protein expression and WEE1 gene effect in two different proteome datasets (this study and Nusinow et al., see new Figure 2C and new Figure 2—figure supplement 2C). As suggested, we confirmed that an independent WEE1 inhibitor (PD0166285) reduced cell viability in a PTEN-dependent manner, similar to AZD1775 (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 2E). Finally, we demonstrate reliance of PTEN for sensitivity to WEE1 depletion in both PTEN-KO (MDA-MB-231 cells) and PTEN-restored cells (HCC1937) (new Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The model shown in Supplementary figure 7 should be condensed and shown as a main figure in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have condensed the model which is now incorporated as a main Figure 6H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Finally, the authors should go through the manuscript with a fine-tooth comb and make sure that each figure is referenced correctly, and in order, in the manuscript.

We also paid attention to the reviewer’s concern regarding incomplete material, methods and figure legends, and have made appropriate corrections throughout the manuscript. We thank the reviewer for the thorough revision of our paper and have addressed all the different points raised, either by additional experiments or clarification/discussion to the best of our ability as specified in detail below.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</p><p>Summary:</p><p>By doing global proteome and transciptome analysis on a panel of breast cancer cell lines, the authors identified two response group to AZD1775 in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cells separated by their PTEN status. The authors defined BLBC cells as recurrent if the cell lines are able to recover after removal of AZD1775. The authors found that PTEN high BLBCs were able to recover from AZD1775 treatment. Since AZD1775 induced DNA-PKc phosphorylation, the authors proposed that it protected cells from replication associated DNA damage and promoted cell recovery. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout DNA-PKc or PTEN, the authors showed that it sensitized the recurrent BLBCs to AZD1775. The authors concluded that PTEN would be a promising biomarker for stratifying breast cancer patients for WEE1 cancer therapy. The manuscript contains an impressive amount of data, however,the quality of the figures, theincomplete Material and methods, theinadequate figure legendsetc. make it impossible to interpret. I have included a list of concerns which is by no means complete. The manuscript requires extensive re-organization.Comments:</p><p>All the immunofluorescence images provided in this manuscript are low resolution, low magnification, and blurry(Figure 3E, 5C, and Figure 3—figure supplement 2C, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-C).As such, it is extremelydifficult to interpret either cell morphology or sub-cellular localizationof proteins. In some cases,DAPI is too faint to see(Figure 5C). Furthermore,scale bars are missingin several images (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-E) and in other cases scale bars are present but the reference size is not providedin the legend (Figure 3E, 5C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, Figure 3—figure supplement 2C, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B).Higher resolution and higher magnification images are required.If any immunofluorescentimages are stitched together(e.g. Figure 3—figure supplement 2C), it should bestated in the legend.</p><p>We apologize that the immunofluorescence images were of poor quality in the original submission and now provide higher resolution and magnifications, including scale bars with reference size. All merged images are clearly separated by lines which is also stated in corresponding legends.</p><p>Control (total DNAPK levels) is missing in the western blots (Figure 6B and C) and immunofluorescence images (Figure 5C).Similar comment for pS345-CHK1 (Figure 6C).</p></list-item></list><p>We have not analysed total DNAPK and CHK1 protein levels in every single experiment because total protein expression is not significantly affected by AZD1775 treatment, in stark contrast to the increased phosphorylation of DNAPK/CHK1 by AZD1775. This is now more clearly stated in the text. Expression of total CHK1 protein was analyzed in several of the previous figures. Total DNA-PK protein levels is analyzed in new Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and Figure 5—figure supplement 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1A – The high content imaging screen measured cell numbers.How is it related to the curve on the right (which is a crystal violet assay)?</p></disp-quote><p>It is correct that the high-content imaging (HCI) screen measure changes in total cell number at single-cell resolution, producing dose response curves and drug response characteristics, while the response curve to the right is drug response quantified by crystal violet assay. We apologize for the confusion in this case and have exchanged the crystal violet data with a drug response measurement from the HCI screen. The crystal violet data (which served as validation of HCI data) is now moved to Figure 1—figure supplement 1B. To clarify, the HCI data evaluates IC50 – concentration of compound achieving 50% reduction in cell number, EC50 – concentration of compound achieving 50% of the maximum effect, AA – Activity Area. This information is now added to the schematics in Figure 1A and legend, and the response data shown in new Supplementary file 1 (addressing this point by reviewer #1 and comment by reviewer #3 below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1C – this supposedly classified cell lines based on synergy between AZD1775 and AZD6738 – it is not clear how synergy was defined.Why were the concentrations of the drugs at 500nM and 1000nM respectively? This figure arbitrarily separated cell lines based on two fixed drug concentrations. Why is MDA-MB-231 not included?I also disliked with the term &quot;recurrent&quot;. It implies recurrence in a clinical setting.How was synergy determined?The combination was asserted to be synergistic but what model was used and what were the synergy scores for the combinations?</p><p>Also never define what the statistical significance of **** is or what test was used.</p><p>What are the different IC50 values for these cell lines?A table is needed here.</p></disp-quote><p>“Recurrent” is now changed to “recovering”.</p><p>Referring to the previous point (IC50), additional drug response data is provided in Supplementary file 1 and statistical significance more clearly defined in Figure 1C legend.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Synergy can be defined as a combination effect that is greater than the additive effect expected from the knowledge of the individual drugs. As a single agent, 1 μm of AZD6738 has minimal inhibitory effect in all the cell lines (mean ± SD = 1918 nM ± 662 nM, p&lt;0,05) and acute synergy of the combination was therefore analyzed at a fixed ratio of 1 μm AZD6738 and 500 nM AZD1775. Synergy was calculated by ¨Combination Index” (CI) using CImbinator, a publicly-available online drug-combination calculation tool (Flobak et al., 2017), based on the least-squares method proposed by Dr. Ting-Chao Chou (Chou, 2010). Synergy scores are provided in the Figure 1C legend. As mentioned in the text, acute synergy between AZD1775 + AZD6738 was recently published while this study was ongoing. Therefore, we chose to focus our resources on experiments that would cover new ground and increase the impact of the study. Nevertheless, to accommodate reviewer #1’s concern, we now provide more in-depth synergy analysis (analyzing synergy at different drug concentrations) for AZD1775 + AZD6738 (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and legend, described in the main text). In addition, we also provide new data demonstrating synergistic interaction between AZD1775 + DNAPK inhibitor (NU7441) combination (new Figure 4c and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and legend, described in the main text). Synergy scores were calculated based on the Bliss model using SynergyFinder, a specialized online tool (Ianevski et al., 2017).</p><p>Figure 1E is described as clonogenic assays but it cannot be since it is only 7 days. No colony formation is possible in 7 days.No description in Materials and methods. Quantification?What are the ODsfor all of the different wells, 2 of the recurrent cell lines – BT20 and HCC1143 look like the mono treatment was also inhibiting growth a decent amount compared to the DMSO control, so what percentages of cells were growing post treatment?</p><p>We apologize for the inadequate description of the assay and are thankful that this was pointed out. All colony assays in the manuscript are 2D crystal violet assays for adherent cells. A more detailed description of the assay is now included in the Materials and methods section and described in the corresponding legends. Further, quantification of cell numbers following drug washout (recovery of proliferation) is now more clearly described in the main text, and new Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and corresponding legend.</p><p>Figure 1F – the flow cytometry data is very difficult to read (too small).Why does the BT20 cell line has no to little γH2AX foci when clearly the combination treatment in Figure 1C resulted in over 50% cell death.</p></list-item></list><p>Sorry for the confusion in this case. With respect to Figure 1F, AZD1775 mono- and the combination-treatment in fact increase γH2AX in BT20 cells (13% and 19%, respectively). The important point is that AZD1775 induce little γH2AX in replicating DNA in these cells (2,4%, as measured by EdU pulse-labeling) as compared to hypersensitive HCC38 cells (27,6% EdU/γH2AX+).

To further emphasize the results in Figure 1F, we include graphs showing the % of γH2AX+ in both the EdU-negative as well as the EdU-positive population from one representative FACS experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3B – Statistics?Did n=4 for control and each mono treatment and then n=6 for combo so can you get proper stats from n=4?</p></disp-quote><p>The statistics are based on tumor growth index i.e. the relative increase in tumor volume at a particular time point compared with the tumor volume at the start of treatment for each tumor. This is now explained in the legend to Figure 3B. Analysis from 4 vs 6 mice gave significant differences between the two groups for most but not all time points using this method. We should point out that the Swedish authorities are very strict with the 3R rules and we therefore try to keep the number of mice to a minimum in each experiment.</p><p>Images of higher magnification are provided, including scale bars with reference size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Western blots need to be quantitated (Figure 3G, Figure 4C, D, E and F, Figure 5D, Figure 6B, C, F and G).

The inconsistencies need to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree, 500 nM AZD1775 produce consistent results (for example, AZD1775 clearly increase phosphorylation of CHK1, DNAPK and γH2AX, and reduce phosphorylation of CDK1/2 in multiple blots) although the amount of increase/decrease vary depending on the treatment time for certain experiments. It is correct that we generally use 500nM AZD1775 for biochemical experiments (close to IC50 in MDA-MB-231 cells) but different concentrations are used in drug response experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors suggest that the increased γH2AX is caused by increased Cdk2 activity as evident by the fact that the CDK inhibitor Milciclib reduces γH2AX levels.Granted, Milciclib is slightly more selective towards Cdk2, but Milciclib also inhibits Cdk1 as well as other CDKs.Given that increased Cdk1 activity is shown to induce chromosome pulverization in WEE1 inhibited cells (Duda et al., Developmental cell, 2016; Lewis et al., Cancer Research, 2019) it is unlikely that the reduced DNA damage observed with Milciclib treatment is solely dependent on loss of Cdk2 activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Since Milciclib inhibits CDK2 at a 9-fold lower concentration than CDK1, it is likely that the main effect on γH2AX goes through CDK2, which is also compatible with our other observations throughout the manuscript. Nevertheless, since we cannot exclude that the effect of Milciclib in part goes via effects on other CDKs, we have modified the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Increased AKT/mTOR signalling is reported to induce AZD1775 acquired resistance through increase nuclear activation of Chk1 (Sen et al., 2017).The authors show that the loss of PTEN increases AKT signalling consistent with the role of PTEN in regulating PIP3 levels, but inconsistent with the Sen et al. study.The authors should cite this paper and discuss the potential discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the reviewer has misunderstood. First of all, Sen et al. report that CHK1 is activated in AZD1775-resistant cells as an escape mechanism to overcome accumulation of DNA damage and cell death. Our findings are not inconsistent with this result, as a matter of fact, we show that CHK1 is phosphorylated in response to AZD1775 treatment and also demonstrate that DNAPK is critical for CHK1 activation when ATR is inhibited (Figure 5). AZD1775 induce the replication checkpoint arrest (phosphorylation of CHK1 and downregulation cyclin E expression), followed by checkpoint recovery and proliferation post-treatment (Figure 3). Second, Sen et al. studied acquired resistance in SCLC models and showed that high AXL/MET/mTOR expression is associated with resistance to AZD1775, while our work focused on identification of factors regulating AZD1775 sensitivity and recovery post treatment (breast cancer model). The important point here is that our study reveals that loss of PTEN is associated with increased sensitivity to AZD1775, presumably due to an impaired checkpoint activation (reduced pS345-CHK1 and elevated cyclin E levels, Figure 6) resulting in replication-induced DNA damage and cell death in PTEN-deficient cells (Figure 2). Although not formally proven in our study, loss of PTEN and hyperactivation of AKT may impair CHK1 activation in response to AZD1775 treatment (reduced pS345-CHK1, Figure 6). Notably, Puc et al., 2005 showed that loss of PTEN and activation of AKT leads to reduced nuclear CHK1 localization promoting genomic instability in tumor cells. Puc et al. traced the checkpoint defect in PTEN-negative cells to AKT and phosphorylation of CHK1 at serine 280 leading to cytoplasmic retention of CHK1. This result is inconsistent with Sen et al., who suggest that activation of AXL/mTOR induces CHK1 accumulation in the nucleus. In summary, we found reduced CHK1 phosphorylation/activity and increased sensitivity to AZD1775 in PTEN-deficient cells, similar to Puc et al. At this stage, it is unclear whether increased AKT activity in PTEN-deficient cells is the primary cause for the compromised CHK1 activation (reduced pS345-CHK1) and deregulated replication checkpoint (elevated cyclin E levels) in response to AZD1775. We now discuss and cite both of these papers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that the authors claim that the loss of PTEN and DNAPK enhance AZD1775 sensitivity, the authors should confirm that PTEN and DNAPK re-expression in KO cells restores AZD1775 resistance.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now restored PTEN expression in PTEN-negative, AZD1775 hypersensitive HCC1937 cells. As shown in new Figure 2G, expression of PTEN significantly reduced sensitivity to AZD1775 monotherapy, strongly supporting a critical function for PTEN in suppressing excessive replication stress induced by AZD1775. In addition, we show that reintroduction of PTEN in PTEN-negative cells promote cellular recovery post AZD1775 treatment (new Figure 2H).</p><p>Restoring DNAPK in DNAPK-KO background is a formidable task that would take considerable time before it produced any tangible results and is therefore beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Provide raw data for the graph presented in Figure 2E.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><p>Rectified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors asserted there is significance many times without showing the statistics for the significance.

The authors carried out a systematic analysis of AZD1775 sensitivity and resistance and identified a group of basal-like breast cancer cells hypersensitive to AZD1775 that are characterized by loss of PTEN.In my opinion, the experiments are presented in a straightforward and logical fashion.

They test a panel of breast cancer (BC) cell lines with global proteome/transcriptome profiling. This led to identification of two response groups of basal-like BC cell lines distinguished by PTEN status. High levels were resistant and PTEN low were sensitive to WEE1i. The molecular mechanism underlying the PTEN role was not fully elucidated. Overall, this suggests that PTEN might be a biomarker for stratification of breast cancer patients for more efficient WEE1 therapy. The authors then show that DNA-PK inhibition also sensitises to WEE1i, which was linked with DNA-PKi suppressing CHK1 activation.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>AZD1775 toxic effects are exerted in S and G2 cell cycle phases. For this reason, it is crucial to properly evaluate that there are no major cell cycle population differences between the different cells lines and if there are, factor them in into the analysis.This appears not accounted for in their analysis (at least I did not find it in the Materials and methods section or explicitly stated in the text).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very relevant point and we thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify this in more detail. We provide additional information demonstrating that there are no major differences in cell cycle populations/proliferation between the cell lines that significantly influence the response or recovery following AZD1775 treatment, see new Supplementary file 1 and new Figure 6—figure supplement 1G. This is now clearly described in the legends and in the main text. Furthermore, we have analyzed expression of proteins related to proliferation and find no major difference between the basal-like cell lines, regardless of AZD1775 sensitivity/response. As expected, a difference in proliferation-related proteins is observed when comparing luminal and basal-like cells (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1E and F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors identified factors that are correlated with resistance (such as CDC7), but do not comment on them at all.Also, TP53I11 is completely new factor that has not been investigated at all, which could be an interesting follow up project.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that other factors associated with increased or reduced AZD1775 sensitivity would be interesting to follow up. To investigate this further, we analysed the expression of CDC7, TP53I11 and CTPS1 in the different cell lines and provide protein data in new Figure 2—figure supplement 2A. Although linked to AZD1775 sensitivity, the main discriminator of these markers is the molecular subtype, basal-like vs luminal cells (which is not the case for PTEN which also differentiate between basal cells, Figure 2 and 6E). Regardless, loss of PTEN and activation of dormant origins during replication stress (He et al., 2015) supports an increased dependency on replication initiating factors such as CDC7 and cyclin E which is in line with our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors spend a significant amount of the paper focusing on the efficacy of the double treatment WEE1i + ATRi, which could be reduced considering they have more novel findings.</p></disp-quote><p>As the AZD1775 + AZD6738 combination was published when this study was ongoing, we have focused on the more novel findings (DNAPK/PTEN), however, the AZD1775 + AZD6738 combination drug washout data are still relevant as the previous studies were not primarily addressing recovery post treatment.

The BT20 and HCC38 cells in fact have similar S phase population (BT20 – 37% EdU+, HCC38 – 38% EdU+). The point is that AZD1775 induces little γH2AX in replicating DNA in BT20 cells (2,4%, as measured by EdU pulse-labeling) as compared to hypersensitive HCC38 cells (27,6% γH2AX+/EdU+ cells). As this was obviously not clear in the previous figure, we now include γH2AX data for both the EdU-negative as well as the EdU-positive population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are multiple cases where statistics is missing on the figure panels.</p></disp-quote><p>Statistics is now provided when relevant.
