(ZIKV) infection confers long-term protection against reinfection, preventing ZIKV from re-emerging in previously affected areas for several years. However, the long-term immune response to ZIKV following an outbreak remains poorly documented. We compared results from eight serological surveys before and after known ZIKV outbreaks in French Polynesia and Fiji, including cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. We found evidence of a decline in seroprevalence in both countries over a two-year period following first reported ZIKV transmission. This decline was concentrated in adults, while high seroprevalence persisted in children. In the Fiji cohort, there was also a significant decline in neutralizing antibody titres against ZIKV, but not against dengue viruses that circulated during the same period.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Since the Zika virus first emerged in the Pacific Islands in 2007, it has caused many outbreaks in the Pacific and Latin America. Some scientists thought that after exposure to the virus people would develop long-term immunity to it, reducing the number of outbreaks in the future. Several studies supported this idea. These studies showed that many people recently infected with Zika developed antibodies in their blood that might protect them from becoming ill during future outbreaks. But it was not clear how long this protection would last.</p><p>To better understand how immunity to the Zika virus changes over time, Henderson, Aubry et al. combined data from eight surveys that collected blood samples at different time points during Zika outbreaks in French Polynesia and Fiji. The analysis showed that the proportion of people with detectable antibodies against the Zika virus increased in both countries after the outbreaks. In children these immune responses persisted for years, but antibody levels declined over time in adults. By contrast, antibodies to the closely related dengue virus did not wane over time in individuals tested for both viruses in Fiji in 2013, 2015 and 2017.</p><p>The data suggest that immunity against the Zika virus may not last as long as previously thought, which could affect the chances of future outbreaks. The findings may also have implications for researchers studying the virus, because the number of people with antibodies against the virus is not a good estimate of how many people were initially infected. More studies are needed to understand immunity to Zika virus over time and how it may affect future outbreaks.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Zika virus (ZIKV), a <italic>Flavivirus</italic> primarily transmitted to humans by <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, was first reported in the Pacific region on Yap island (Federated States of Micronesia) in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duffy et al., 2009</xref>). Six years later, there was a large ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao-Lormeau et al., 2014</xref>) where an estimated 11.5% of the population visited healthcare facilities with clinical symptoms suggestive of ZIKV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kucharski et al., 2016</xref>). Since then the virus has spread across the Pacific region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Musso et al., 2014</xref>), including to Fiji where cases of ZIKV infection were first detected in July 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">World Health Organisation, 2015</xref>). The same year, cases of ZIKV infection in Latin America were reported for the first time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zammarchi et al., 2015</xref>). From February 1 to November 18, 2016, due to its rapid spread and association with birth defects, microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016</xref>) the WHO declared ZIKV a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">World Health Organisation, 2016</xref>). At the end of 2016, outbreaks had declined in most of the countries recently affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">O'Reilly et al., 2018</xref>). However, ZIKV was still circulating in 2018 in several countries, including Fiji and Tonga in the Pacific region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">World Health Organisation, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In countries with known ZIKV outbreaks, the few serological surveys that have been published found a high level of ZIKV seroprevalence following the outbreak. In French Polynesia, a population-representative cross-sectional serological survey at the end of the outbreak in 2014 found a seroprevalence of 49% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aubry et al., 2017</xref>). In Martinique, a study of blood donors showed a post-outbreak seroprevalence of 42% in 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gallian et al., 2017</xref>). In Salvador, Northeastern Brazil, a serosurvey in 2016 of prospectively sampled individuals including microcephaly and non-microcephaly pregnancies, HIV-infected patients, tuberculosis patients, and university staff, found a post-outbreak seroprevalence of 63% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Netto et al., 2017</xref>). Another study in Salvador, conducted in a long-term health cohort, also found a post-outbreak seroprevalence of 63% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rodriguez-Barraquer et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, in paediatric and household cohort studies in Managua, Nicaragua, ZIKV seroprevalence was estimated to be 46% in households following the outbreak in 2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zambrana et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>It has been suggested that infection with ZIKV confers immunity that lasts several years; if so, the high level of seroprevalence in affected countries may reflect sufficient herd immunity for the current ZIKV epidemic to be over in many locations, with the virus unable to re-emerge for decades to come (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kucharski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">O'Reilly et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Netto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferguson et al., 2016</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that neutralizing antibodies can distinguish between ZIKV and dengue virus (DENV) – a closely related <italic>Flavivirus</italic> – and that the immune response following ZIKV infection can persist over a year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Montoya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Griffin et al., 2019</xref>). It has also been suggested that primary ZIKV infection may confer protective immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Osuna et al., 2016</xref>). However, ZIKV serosurveys conducted at the end of the outbreak in French Polynesia and 18 months later found a drop in seroprevalence in the Society Islands, the archipelago where over 85% of the inhabitants of French Polynesia reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aubry et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the long-term antibody response following a ZIKV outbreak remains unclear.</p><p>Here, we explore short- and long-term seroprevalence against ZIKV as well as neutralizing responses against ZIKV following two ZIKV outbreaks in the Pacific region. We compared results from five serological surveys in the Society Islands, French Polynesia, over a seven-year period, and three serial serological surveys in the same cohort of individuals in Central Division, Fiji, over a four-year period. These surveys span the pre- and post- outbreak period in each country, allowing us to examine temporal changes in antibody responses following a ZIKV outbreak.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In French Polynesia, seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against domain III of the ZIKV envelope glycoprotein in blood donors recruited before October 2013 was &lt;1% (0.3–2%), which confirmed that the virus had not previously circulated in the population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Analysis of samples collected in the general population of the Society Islands of French Polynesia after the emergence of ZIKV showed a decrease in ZIKV seroprevalence from 37% (26–47%) to 22% (16–28%) between February-March 2014 and September-November 2015 (chi-squared test, p=0.03). In Fiji, analysis of the serum samples serially collected from a cohort of participants in the Central Division showed an increase in ZIKV seroprevalence from 6.3% (3.3–11%) in October-November 2013 to 24% (18–31%) in November 2015 (chi-squared test, p&lt;0.0001), and then a decrease to 12% (7.9–18%) by June 2017 (chi-squared test, p=0.005). In this cohort, based on IgG results tested by microsphere immunoassay (MIA), 6 of the 189 participants seroconverted (from negative to positive) and 28 seroreverted (from positive to negative) to ZIKV between 2015 and 2017 (McNemar’s test, p=0.0003).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Seroprevalence of ZIKV among participants in five serological surveys in French Polynesia and three serological surveys in Fiji, conducted between July 2011 and June 2018.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Date</th><th valign="bottom">Country</th><th valign="bottom">Population and assay used</th><th valign="bottom">Age range (median)</th><th valign="bottom">Total no. seropositive/total no. tested</th><th valign="bottom">Seroprevalence % [95% CI]</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th colspan="6">French Polynesia - General Population</th></tr><tr><td>Jul 2011-Oct 2013</td><td>Society Islands, French Polynesia</td><td>Blood donors, ELISA</td><td>18–75 (36)</td><td>5/593</td><td>0.8 [0.3–2.0]</td></tr><tr><td>Nov 2013</td><td colspan="5"><italic>First confirmed local transmission of ZIKV in French Polynesia</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Feb-Mar 2014</td><td>Society Islands, French Polynesia</td><td>General, ELISA</td><td>13–77 (47)</td><td>18/49</td><td>37 [26-47]*</td></tr><tr><td>Sep-Nov 2015</td><td>Society Islands, French Polynesia</td><td>General, MIA</td><td>4–88 (43)</td><td>154/700</td><td>22 [16-28]*</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">French Polynesia - schoolchildren</td></tr><tr><td>May-Jun 2014</td><td>Society Islands, French Polynesia</td><td>School children, <break/>ELISA</td><td>6–16 (11)</td><td>312/476</td><td>66 [60-71]*</td></tr><tr><td>Jun-2018</td><td>Society Islands, French Polynesia</td><td>School children, <break/>MIA</td><td>6–16 (11)</td><td>291/457</td><td>64 [58-69]*</td></tr><tr><th colspan="6">Fiji</th></tr><tr><td>Oct-Nov 2013</td><td>Central Division, Fiji</td><td>General, MIA</td><td>2–78 (24)</td><td>12/189</td><td>6.3 [3.3–11]</td></tr><tr><td>Jul 2015</td><td colspan="5"><italic>First confirmed local transmission of ZIKV in Fiji</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Nov-2015</td><td>Central Division, Fiji</td><td>General, MIA</td><td>4–80 (26)</td><td>45/189</td><td>24 [18-31]</td></tr><tr><td>Jun-2017</td><td>Central Division, Fiji</td><td>General, MIA</td><td>6–82 (28)</td><td>23/189</td><td>12 [7.9–18]</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>* CIs were calculated taking into account the cluster sampling design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aubry et al., 2017</xref>) and using the Fisher exact test.</p><p>MIA – microsphere immunoassay.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>To investigate possible factors influencing the decline in seroprevalence, we compared the seroprevalence profiles in children (defined as ≤16 years) and adults (&gt;16 years) in both settings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

There was a large DENV-3 epidemic during 2013–14 in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Osuna et al., 2016</xref>), which meant most seroconversions to DENV-3 occurred between the collection of samples in 2013 and 2015. In those individuals that seroconverted to DENV-3 (<italic>n</italic> = 19) or ZIKV (<italic>n</italic> = 31) between 2013 and 2015, the initial rise in NT log titres against ZIKV was larger than for DENV-3, with a mean change of 5.0 and 3.37 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>). All individuals who had seroconverted to DENV-3 remained seropositive to the virus in 2017, while four individuals who had seroconverted to ZIKV were seronegative in 2017. Although the NT log titres increased by a mean of 0.89 for DENV-3 between 2015 and 2017 (two-sided t-test, p=0.04), log titres against ZIKV declined by a mean of 1.94 over the same period (two-sided t-test, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>).</p><p>In Fiji, there was a delay of around 18 months between the end of the 2013–14 DENV-3 epidemic and collection of samples in 2015. As DENV titres can wane following infection, particularly in individuals with a prior DENV exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clapham et al., 2016</xref>), titres against DENV-3 in Fiji may therefore have had more time to wane and reach a stable persistent level than titres against ZIKV, which may have circulated later than DENV-3. We therefore analysed changes in titre for participants who were initially seronegative to DENV-1 and DENV-2, which were circulating at low levels in Fiji between the two serological surveys in 2013 and 2015 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As with DENV-3, we found no evidence of a subsequent overall decline during 2015–17 for those participants who seroconverted to DENV-1 or DENV-2 during 2013–15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Of the 45 participants tested by neutralization assay, nine were initially seropositive to ZIKV by NT in 2013. Fitting a generalized additive model to these data, we found that higher baseline mean NT log titres against DENV were associated with an increased probability of seropositivity to ZIKV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, higher baseline mean DENV titres were not associated with increased seropositivity by MIA in 2013. There was little difference between the assay results in the 2015 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), but we did find evidence of a difference in the 2017 results, with 15/45 participants positive by MIA and 31/45 positive by NT. This difference was associated with participants’ 2013 DENV titres: those with intermediate DENV titres in 2013 had a significantly lower probability of being seropositive in the MIA in 2017 compared to NT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Relationship between mean DENV log neutralization titre across the four serotypes in 2013 and ZIKV seroprevalence using different assays, in a subset of 45 participants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Seroprevalence by MIA, shown in grey, and neutralization test (NT), shown in orange, for sera collected in 2013.

The high number of participants from the Fijian cohort that seroreverted between 2015 and 2017 suggested that anti-ZIKV antibody levels waned in these individuals to the point that they were no longer detectable by MIA. Using a neutralization assay to test longitudinal sera collected in Fiji, we found that the mean change in neutralizing antibody titres against ZIKV also decreased significantly between 2015 and 2017, showing that individual-level antibody titres against ZIKV as well as overall seroprevalence decreased over time. In contrast, over the same period, neutralizing antibody titres against DENV-3, a closely related <italic>Flavivirus</italic> which caused a large epidemic in Fiji in 2013–2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kucharski et al., 2018a</xref>), remained stable.</p><p>In both countries we found seroprevalence against ZIKV in individuals aged over 16 declined over the two-year period following an outbreak, while the overall level of seroprevalence persisted in children. This pattern was unique to ZIKV compared to DENV in both countries. It is possible that this is related to the DENV immunological profile of individuals, given that the older population is likely to have experienced more DENV infections over their lifetime. If an individual has experienced prior DENV infections, high numbers of weakly neutralizing cross-reactive B cells may outcompete naïve B cells for ZIKV antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Midgley et al., 2011</xref>), leading to a short-term boost in antibody response against ZIKV following ZIKV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Robbiani et al., 2017</xref>) but not a persistent specific response; a similar phenomenon has been observed for other antigenically variable viruses like influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kucharski et al., 2018b</xref>). In the 2017 samples, more participants remained seropositive in the neutralization assay – which measures the overall ability of sera to neutralize ZIKV – than in the MIA, which tests for IgG antibodies against domain III of the envelope glycoprotein. This difference was greatest for participants who had intermediate baseline titres to DENV in 2013 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which would support the hypothesis that prior DENV exposure may result in a detectable short-term specific response against ZIKV following ZIKV infection (as measured by MIA), but not a persistent specific response.</p><p>To our knowledge, the only other study to date that has investigated the long-term persistence of neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV was conducted in 62 residents of Miami (Florida, USA), who had a confirmed ZIKV infection in 2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Griffin et al., 2019</xref>). This cross-sectional study found that all participants had neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV 12–19 months after infection. This study also found that at least 37% of the participants had no evidence of past DENV infection, which is consistent with the hypothesis that anti-ZIKV immune responses may persist longer in populations that have had less exposure to DENV. More data are therefore needed to test hypotheses about the potential impact of pre-existing anti-DENV immune response on anti-ZIKV antibody waning.</p><p>Although we found evidence of a decline in seroprevalence for antibodies against domain III of the envelope glycoprotein, as well as waning neutralizing antibody responses following two ZIKV outbreaks, the implications for susceptibility to future ZIKV infection remain unclear. Given the antigenic similarity of DENV and ZIKV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Priyamvada et al., 2016</xref>), it is commonly assumed that the immune response to ZIKV infection will be similar to that following DENV infection. High levels of neutralizing antibodies to DENV have been shown to correlate with protection from symptomatic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Katzelnick et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, infection with a single DENV serotype can confer lifelong immunity to the infecting serotype as well as a transient period of cross-neutralization against heterologous serotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wahala and Silva, 2011</xref>). However, it is unclear in the context of ZIKV what the relationship is between a specific titre value and susceptibility to further infection. A key aim for future work will be to establish how waning antibody levels as measured by MIA and neutralization assays may impact protective immunity, and hence susceptibility to reinfection in populations that have already experienced transmission of ZIKV.</p><p>There are some additional limitations to our analysis. First, we did not have reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmation of ZIKV infection in individuals sampled in this study. We have presented analysis of representative serological surveys in two locations with known, RT-PCR-confirmed ZIKV outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mallet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">World Health Organisation, 2015</xref>). However, RT-PCR confirmation for ZIKV at the individual level remains difficult to obtain, in particular from blood samples, and there have been relatively few confirmations globally compared to the number of suspected cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferguson et al., 2016</xref>), let alone analysis of long-term antibody dynamics in RT-PCR confirmed patients. In French Polynesia, there were approximately 32,000 reported clinical cases of ZIKV infection, but only 297 documented RT-PCR-confirmed cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mallet et al., 2015</xref>). As a result, antibody responses in RT-PCR-confirmed cases may not necessarily be representative of immune responses against ZIKV in the wider population, particularly following asymptomatic infection. Although MIA seropositivity in our study was defined using control sera collected over a year after RT-PCR-confirmed infection, our results suggest that this threshold may not detect long-term waning responses in individuals who had unreported, and likely less severe, infections.</p><p>Our analysis was also limited by study design. In French Polynesia, surveys were cross-sectional, so we were unable to examine temporal antibody dynamics at the individual level. However, both cross-sectional studies of the general population were conducted using population representative cluster sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aubry et al., 2017</xref>) in the same remote island locations with stable population composition, which enabled robust comparisons of overall seroprevalence. We did identify one potential source of sampling bias with different DENV exposure profiles in the two surveys, but our conclusions of declining seroprevalence for ZIKV persisted once we adjusted for this bias. We also used a different serological testing method between the studies in French Polynesia in 2014 and 2015. However, both used the same recombinant antigens and it has been shown that there was good agreement between ELISA and MIA in the 2014 samples (see Materials and methods). In Fiji, a strength of our study was the collection of longitudinal samples from the same individuals at three time points. However, our sample size was limited given the logistical challenge of recontacting participants twice over a four-year period. These data provided strong evidence that ZIKV seroprevalence declined over the two-year period following first reports of circulation, but our sample size was insufficient to fully explore the potential effect of anti-DENV pre-existing immunity on anti-ZIKV antibody waning once we stratified individuals by previous DENV exposure. Although the outbreaks of DENV-3 in Fiji and ZIKV in French Polynesia were well-documented and occurred over a relatively brief period of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), it was harder to identify the likely time of infection for other viruses – such as ZIKV in Fiji or DENV in French Polynesia – in our study populations. Several participants in Fiji were seropositive to ZIKV by neutralization assay (NT) in 2013, but this result may be influenced by cross-reaction; participants who had high pre-existing titres to DENV in 2013 were more likely to be seropositive by NT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In our main analysis of titre dynamics, we therefore focused on the subset of participants who were seronegative by NT in 2013 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, we obtained the same conclusion when participants who were initially seropositive were also considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The global ZIKV epidemic began in the Pacific islands in 2013 before spreading in Central and South America from 2015. Seroprevalence studies following ZIKV epidemics in Latin America have been reported but data have either been non-representative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Netto et al., 2017</xref>) or not enough time had elapsed since the outbreak to observe long-term dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rodriguez-Barraquer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zambrana et al., 2018</xref>). To our knowledge, these are the first studies of community seroprevalence over a long-term period following a ZIKV outbreak. Therefore, patterns observed in Pacific islands may be an early indication of what might happen to seroprevalence in Latin America where ZIKV outbreaks began two to three years after the French Polynesia epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao-Lormeau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bogoch et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the short-term, our findings have implications for the design of follow up studies of ZIKV. Our results provide evidence that levels of seroprevalence one to two years following ZIKV circulation may be lower than previously expected and study designs may need to be adapted to reflect this, particularly in settings that exhibit long-term low level circulation of ZIKV as opposed to large sporadic outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ruchusatsawat et al., 2019</xref>). For example, estimates of microcephaly risk may be inflated if derived from long-term seroprevalence data that underestimate the true extent of infection within the population, and results of clinical trials could also be biased if post-outbreak seroprevalence is used an indicator of infection within a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen, 2018</xref>). In the longer-term, our results demonstrate the value of longitudinal serological studies of flaviviruses, and analysis using multiple serological tests, including neutralization assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clapham et al., 2016</xref>). Such studies will be essential to understand different aspects of the short and long-term immune antibody response against ZIKV, and how prior exposures to DENV may influence these responses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study location and participants</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>French polynesia</title><p>Four separate ZIKV serosurveys were previously conducted in the Society Islands (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

To assess the potential for cross-reactive antibody responses, we examined the correlation between changes in log titre to different viruses between 2013 and 2015. Among the 20/69 paired samples that tested seronegative against all five viruses in 2013 and were re-tested in 2015, there was no evidence of an association between changes in ZIKV titre and changes in titre against any of the DENV serotypes, suggesting that the changes in ZIKV titre were unlikely to be strongly influenced by DENV cross-reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, the 49/69 participants who had a pre-2013 DENV exposure and a large rise against ZIKV between 2013–15 tended to exhibit a smaller rise against DENV viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>A previous study, which tested serological samples from Fiji across three divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kama et al., 2019</xref>), found that of the samples reactive by MIA, 66/83 (79.5%) exhibited neutralizing activity for ZIKV (κ = 0.71) and 109/112 (97.3%) for DENV (κ = 0.80). In this study, we tested what proportion of samples for the 45 participants in the full dataset (i.e. 135 samples in total) that were seropositive or seronegative by MIA had the same result by the neutralization assay. We found that 54/68 (79.4%) samples that were positive to ZIKV by MIA were also positive in the neutralization assay, and 42/67 (62.7%) who were seronegative were also negative by neutralization assay (κ = 0.42). We also calculated the proportion positive by neutralization assay that had the same result by MIA. We found that 54/79 (68.4%) samples that were positive to ZIKV in the neutralization assay were also positive by MIA, and 42/56 (75%) who were seronegative were also negative by MIA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For data from Fiji, where serial samples were collected from the same individual, changes in seroprevalence between studies were tested using McNemar’s test. In French Polynesia, chi-squared tests were performed to test for evidence of a change in seroprevalence between two cross-sectional surveys. Changes in mean log titre between groups were analyzed using a t-test. To analyse the potentially non-linear relationship between DENV neutralization titres and seroprevalence by MIA and neutralization test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we used a generalized additive model via the mcgv package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wood, 2019</xref>). The model was of the form <italic>g(E(y))=b + f(x)</italic>, where <italic>y</italic> was the binary outcome variable, <italic>x</italic> was the predictor (i.e. titre), <italic>g</italic> was the link function, <italic>b</italic> was the intercept, and <italic>f</italic> was a smooth function represented by a penalized regression spline. Mean DENV titre was calculated as the mean of log titres against the four DENV serotypes for each participant.

for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Isabel Rodriguez-Barraquer as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Neil Ferguson as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity:); Leah Katzelnick (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Henderson and Aubry et al. have performed a comparative study of cross-sectional and longitudinal serosurveys conducted before, soon after, and multiple years after the arrival of ZIKV to French Polynesia and Fiji. They use multiple serological assays to measure ZIKV-specific antibodies and DENV-specific antibodies. Specifically, they find an overall decline in ZIKV-specific seroprevalence by ~2 years after the outbreaks in each country, which was primarily driven by a decline in adults (defined as &gt;16 years of age). Children appeared to maintain seroprevalence. They also use longitudinal data from a small subset of individuals from Fiji to show waning in neutralizing antibody titers as well.</p><p>These results are worth publishing, but we have several concerns about their presentation and interpretation. In particular, it is not clear to us whether the waning captured by the ELISA/MIA assay is meaningful (as evidence of waning protection) or simply reflects the kinetics of the specific antibody response (anti-domain III) measured by this assay. Data from neutralization assays, the gold standard, is unfortunately scarce (<italic>n</italic> = 45), hard to interpret and not very conclusive because of the timing of sample collection (some waning is expected) and because the evidence of seroreversion is quite weak (only observed in four individuals with weak seroconversions).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors speculate that the reductions in ZIKV seroprevalence measured by ELISA/MIA could indicate waning population immunity to ZIKV. This would have profound implications for future ZIKV dynamics in these and other populations, as the authors discuss. However, we think that another possibility, that is more likely, is that the observed decreases might just reflect the kinetics of antibody responses measured by this specific assay (antibodies against domain III). As far as we understand, it hasn't yet been established whether this antibody response is a good marker of historical exposure, or just a marker of recent exposure. DENV seroprevalence also seems to wane (Supplementary Figure 1). In the absence of additional data describing the performance/kinetics of this assay, this potential explanation needs to be discussed.</p><p>2) More details should be provided about the serological assays used. Two references are provided about the ELISA/MIA assays but they also provide very little information. At the very least, the paper should be explicit that the assay uses recombinant antigens comprising domain III of the envelope glycoprotein. Ideally, data on performance characteristics of the assay should also be reported as this information is crucial for the interpretation of results.</p><p>3) Related to the point above, please include more detail on the agreement between the MIA and ELISA tests. As far as I can see reference 11 does not contain enough information to assess this. It states: &quot;80% were positive by both tests&quot;. Were all the rest of the samples negative by both tests?</p><p>4) While ZIKV seroprevalence is observed to wane in both populations (Figure 1), DENV seroprevalence dynamics differ between the populations. It is not clear why, and how this relates to the observed decay for ZIKV seroprevalence. The results seem to be affected by the historical intensity of DENV transmission in French Polynesia and Fiji and may have been affected by DENV or ZIKV transmission that occurred after the main ZIKV epidemics. We recommend that Supplementary Figure 1 accompany Figure 1 in the main text. In Fiji, following the ZIKV epidemic, titers to DENV appeared to increase (except to DENV3). In French Polynesia, there was no DENV immunity to the four DENV before the arrival of ZIKV, and DENV titers did decline in adults after the ZIKV epidemic. Basically, it would be helpful to the reader if the authors include a figure on the epidemics of DENV and ZIKV in these populations before and after the ZIKV epidemic, ideally with serotype-specific epidemic curves if such data are available, to be able to interpret these results.</p><p>5) The age-standardised seroprevalence is the important metric here. As the authors note there is less decline in this metric. This should be the main result, as it seems that the other comparisons are not informative at all-as far as I can determine the differences are simply driven by the age distributions of the population sampled. Please explain if this is not the case.</p><p>Longitudinal data from Fiji tested using neutralization assays could certainly have added strength to the hypothesis of waning population immunity, but unfortunately the data is scarce (n = 45) and hard to interpret for multiple reasons:</p><p>6) In order to be able to compare the DENV and ZIKV results (Figure 2), it would be crucial to understand when sample collection occurred with respect to ZIKV and DENV outbreaks. At the end of the Results, from what we understand: the DENV outbreak was before the ZIKV outbreak, so the observed differences in decline rates between DENV and ZIKV could be explained by much of the DENV decline already happened before the measurement, whereas the ZIKV transmission was much closer to the time of the first measurement. Differences of just a few months could make a large difference here. This would be consistent with the lower increase observed from 2013-2015 for DENV compared to ZIKV. Similarly for the differences in seroreversions, there may have been individuals that were DENV positive closer to the transmission, but were not by 2015, and therefore would not have been captured by the measurements here. In addition, it would be useful to know if there was any DENV transmission in the 2015-2017 period?</p><p>7) Also, looking at the neutralization data in GitHub, it seems that 9/45 (20%) of individuals had positive (but low) titers to ZIKV in 2013 (titer greater of equal to 2). 7/9 of these positive values are in individuals who also have positive titers to 3 or more dengue serotypes. We find this concerning as this is supposed to be the pre-Zika time-point and this might suggest some cross-reactivity in this ZIKV PRNT assay. Has the sensitivity and specificity of this neutralization assay (and this cut-point) been calculated? More details need to be provided about this assay and its performance as well.</p><p>8) Related to the above, it would be good to show the correlation between neutralization and MIA results. I tried to do this myself (using the provided ids) but was only able to match the data of 16/45 individuals (the neut dataset includes 344 individuals, most with incomplete data). Unless there's a problem with the data (or provided IDs), the agreement seems poor. For example, these 16 individuals have positive neutralization titers in 2015 (&gt;4 in the majority) and yet, only 5/16 are classified as positive by the MIA assay.</p><p>9) The four observed ZIKV seroreversions described in the last paragraph of the Results seem to be in individuals with relatively low titers at seroconversion (4). There are four additional &quot;seroreversions&quot; among individuals who were already positive in the 2013 sample. Are these seroreversions mainly capturing cross-reactive responses? It would be useful to show a figure (maybe supplementary) with the longitudinal neutralization titer data.</p><p>10) In light of these limitations/uncertainties, we think the manuscript needs to be reworked to emphasize the uncertainty regarding the meaning of these findings. We would emphasize the need for more studies using longitudinal data (rather than cross-sectional) data and a broader set of assays, including PRNTs. We would de-emphasize the discussion/conclusions around the implications of waning protection (last paragraph of the Discussion). While provocative, we are not convinced it's supported by the presented data.</p><p>11) It would be good to clarify which subset of samples were tested and the sample sizes that went into each analysis.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Zika seroprevalence declines and neutralizing antibodies wane in adults following outbreaks in French Polynesia and Fiji&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Reviewing Editor and Neil Ferguson as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed most of our concerns. Thanks for providing the merged data! We have some additional comments:</p><p>1) The low agreement reported for the ZIKV MIA and PRNTs assays is a bit concerning, and not consistent with the sensitivity and specificity reported. There seem to be 65 samples positive according to the PRNT in 2017, and of these only 17 (26%) are positive according to the MIA. Assuming that the PRNT is the &quot;gold standard&quot;, this would suggest a much lower sensitivity of MIA than was reported for old infections, suggesting time-dependent sensitivity (26% vs. 80%). If instead we question the performance of the PRNT (cross-reactivity?) then the waning results are also questionable. I think these discrepancies (and the difficulty interpreting results from these novel assays) should be explicitly discussed.</p><p>2) Related to the above, authors should explicitly state in the text that, while neutralization titers decayed over the observation period, there's little (or no) evidence of sero-reversion (decreasing seroprevalence) according to the neutralization data.</p><p>3) Please provide a reference for the sensitivities and specificities reported for the MIA assay. Also, please state whether these performances were evaluated using acute/early convalescent samples vs. samples from historical infections (infections occurring one or more years before).</p><p>4) I also find it concerning that 9/46 samples (~20%) were positive against ZIKV (low titers) according to the PRNT assay in 2013. The authors perform some analyses around cross-reactivity, but these are only described in the Materials and methods. I think cross-reactivity (and how it could impact the results) should be addressed in the Discussion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Zika seroprevalence declines and neutralizing antibodies wane in adults following outbreaks in French Polynesia and Fiji&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Neil Ferguson (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>Most of our concerns have been satisfactorily addressed, but I have one remaining question.</p><p>- You report that the proportion seropositive (by MIA) was ~24% in Fiji in 2015, yet Figure 3B shows a seroprevalence of &gt;90% among the 45 individuals that were also tested using neutralization assays. It could almost be seen as if individuals were selected for neutralization assays based on the MIA status (42/45 samples positive by MIA were tested) but the text reads that they were selected based on sample availability only. Please clarify how the samples were selected.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48460.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>Henderson and Aubry et al. have performed a comparative study of cross-sectional and longitudinal serosurveys conducted before, soon after, and multiple years after the arrival of ZIKV to French Polynesia and Fiji.

[…] A key aim for future work will be establish how waning antibody levels as measured by MIA and neutralization assays correspond to protective immunity, and hence susceptibility to reinfection in populations that have already experienced transmission of ZIKV.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) More details should be provided about the serological assays used. Two references are provided about the ELISA/MIA assays but they also provide very little information. At the very least, the paper should be explicit that the assay uses recombinant antigens comprising domain III of the envelope glycoprotein. Ideally, data on performance characteristics of the assay should also be reported as this information is crucial for the interpretation of results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these details to the Materials and methods:</p><p>“Serum samples collected from blood donors between July 2011 and October 2013 and samples collected from the general population and schoolchildren in 2014 were all tested for presence of IgG antibodies against ZIKV and each of the four DENV serotypes using a recombinant antigen-based indirect ELISA as reported previously</p><p>[Aubry et al., 2017; Aubry et al., 2015]. […] Recombinant antigens used in both assays comprised domain III of the envelope glycoprotein of ZIKV, DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, or DENV-4 strains (respective GenBank accession no. KJ776791,</p><p>AF226686.1, FM986654, FJ44740.1, FM986672.1) and were produced using the</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 expression system (Life Technologies, USA) as previously detailed [Aubry et al., 2015].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to the point above, please include more detail on the agreement between the MIA and ELISA tests. As far as I can see reference 11 does not contain enough information to assess this. It states: &quot;80% were positive by both tests&quot;. Were all the rest of the samples negative by both tests?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional details to the Materials and methods:</p><p>&quot;The sensitivity and specificity of the MIA assay were respectively 100% and 100% for DENV-1, 89.47% and 97.1% for DENV-2, 100% and 100% for DENV-3, 96.88% and 100% for DENV-4, and 79.59% and 94.87% for ZIKV. In the serosurvey conducted among the general population of the 5 archipelagos in French Polynesia in 2014 [Aubry et al., 2017], 196 samples were tested using both ELISA and MIA: among the 97 serum samples that tested positive for anti-ZIKV IgG by ELISA, 78 (80%) were also found positive by MIA; and among the 99 serum samples that tested negative for anti-ZIKV IgG by ELISA, 70 (71%) were also found negative by MIA. This produced a value of Cohen’s κ = 0.51 [Aubry et al., 2017].&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) While ZIKV seroprevalence is observed to wane in both populations (Figure 1), DENV seroprevalence dynamics differ between the populations. It is not clear why, and how this relates to the observed decay for ZIKV seroprevalence. The results seem to be affected by the historical intensity of DENV transmission in French Polynesia and Fiji and may have been affected by DENV or ZIKV transmission that occurred after the main ZIKV epidemics. We recommend that Supplementary Figure 1 accompany Figure 1 in the main text. In Fiji, following the ZIKV epidemic, titers to DENV appeared to increase (except to DENV3). In French Polynesia, there was no DENV immunity to the four DENV before the arrival of ZIKV, and DENV titers did decline in adults after the ZIKV epidemic. Basically, it would be helpful to the reader if the authors include a figure on the epidemics of DENV and ZIKV in these populations before and after the ZIKV epidemic, ideally with serotype-specific epidemic curves if such data are available, to be able to interpret these results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it would be useful to include epidemiological context and have updated Figure 1 to include data on which serotypes were confirmed by PCR during this period, as well as temporal trends in symptom reporting. Note that in Supplementary Figure 1 (now Figure 1—figure supplements 1–4), the plots were only intended to show DENV data for 2014 and 2015 in French Polynesia; the apparent zeros in 2013 were the result of redundant plotting code. However, we realise that it would be helpful to show the 2013 data as well, as have updated the figures accordingly.</p><p>We also cover the advantages and challenges of the epidemiology in these locations in the updated Discussion:</p><p>“These data provided strong evidence that ZIKV seroprevalence declined over the two-year period following first reports of circulation, but our sample size was insufficient to fully explore the potential effect of anti-DENV pre-existing immunity on anti-ZIKV antibody waning once we stratified individuals by previous DENV exposure. Although the outbreaks of DENV-3 in Fiji and ZIKV in French Polynesia were well-documented and occurred over a relatively brief period of time (Figure 1), it was harder to identify the likely time of infection for other viruses – such as ZIKV in Fiji or DENV in French Polynesia – in our study populations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The age-standardised seroprevalence is the important metric here. As the authors note there is less decline in this metric. This should be the main result, as it seems that the other comparisons are not informative at all-as far as I can determine the differences are simply driven by the age distributions of the population sampled. Please explain if this is not the case.</p></disp-quote><p>We think it is important to show the results of age-standardisation, and now do so in Table 2 in the main text. However, we disagree that differences observed are simply the results of the age distributions sampled.</p><p>There are three main reasons for this:</p><p>First, the age distributions of the 2014 and 2015 study populations were not particularly different (Table 7); both had a similar median and IQR.</p><p>Second, age-adjusted DENV seroprevalence estimates for over 16s in French Polynesia were similar to the raw seroprevalence values (now shown in Table 2). Standardising for age increased uncertainty, but did not consistently shift estimates in either direction for these other viruses, suggesting no evidence of a systematic bias as a result of sampling.</p><p>Third, ZIKV risk seems to be higher in younger age groups; in French Polynesia, seroprevalence was higher in school children. Hence the 2015 study, which had a slightly younger median age (43 vs. 47), would if anything be expected to have a raw seroprevalence estimate that was biased upwards rather than downwards.</p><p>It is therefore likely that any changes in ZIKV seroprevalence estimates after age standardisation are the result of increased uncertainty owing to relatively low levels of seropositivity in adults, particularly in 2015, and small sample size in 2014, rather than a genuine age effect.</p><p>It is worth noting that we have identified some differences between the 2014 and 2015 study populations, particularly in terms of exposure risk. We examined the potential impact of these differences by bootstrap resampling the data according to prior exposure history (see response to point 15 below). We still observe a decline in ZIKV seroprevalence, but no decline for recently circulating DENV serotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Longitudinal data from Fiji tested using neutralization assays could certainly have added strength to the hypothesis of waning population immunity, but unfortunately the data is scarce (n=45) and hard to interpret for multiple reasons:</p><p>6) In order to be able to compare the DENV and ZIKV results (Figure 2), it would be crucial to understand when sample collection occurred with respect to ZIKV and DENV outbreaks. At the end of the Results, from what we understand: the DENV outbreak was before the ZIKV outbreak, so the observed differences in decline rates between DENV and ZIKV could be explained by much of the DENV decline already happened before the measurement, whereas the ZIKV transmission was much closer to the time of the first measurement. Differences of just a few months could make a large difference here. This would be consistent with the lower increase observed from 2013-2015 for DENV compared to ZIKV. Similarly for the differences in seroreversions, there may have been individuals that were DENV positive closer to the transmission, but were not by 2015, and therefore would not have been captured by the measurements here. In addition, it would be useful to know if there was any DENV transmission in the 2015-2017 period?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it is worth including more details about the potential relationship between epidemiological dynamics and sample collection timing. We now include information on flavivirus circulation in the new Figure 1 (see also response to point 4 above). Although the DENV-3 epidemic Fiji occurred around 18 months for the 2015 sample collection, there was also low-level circulation of DENV-1 and DENV-2 during this period. We therefore analysed log neutralisation titres for participants who were seronegative to these respective viruses in 2013 and seroconverted in 2015. Unlike ZIKV, we found no evidence of a subsequent overall decline during 2015–17 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). We describe this analysis in the updated Results section:</p><p>“In Fiji, there was a delay of around 18 months between the end of the 2013/14 DENV-3 epidemic and collection of samples in 2015. […] Unlike ZIKV, we found no evidence of a subsequent overall decline during 2015–17 for those participants who seroconverted during 2013–15 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Also, looking at the neutralization data in GitHub, it seems that 9/45 (20%) of individuals had positive (but low) titers to ZIKV in 2013 (titer greater of equal to 2). 7/9 of these positive values are in individuals who also have positive titers to 3 or more dengue serotypes. We find this concerning as this is supposed to be the pre-Zika time-point and this might suggest some cross-reactivity in this ZIKV PRNT assay. Has the sensitivity and specificity of this neutralization assay (and this cut-point) been calculated? More details need to be provided about this assay and its performance as well.</p></disp-quote><p>The sensitivity and specificity of this assay using this cut-off has not been calculated. However, log-titres to ZIKV follow a bimodal distribution (Figure 3 in new manuscript), which supports a cut-off of 2 as an appropriate definition of seropositivity. We also examined the correlation between MIA and neutralisation assay results, finding 68–75% agreement between the two (see response to point 8 below).</p><p>As log titres may have been influenced by cross-reactivity, we also compared correlations in responses against different pairs of viruses. For participants who were seronegative to all five viruses in 2013, we found no evidence of cross-reactive responses against ZIKV and the four DENV serotypes (Figure 3—figure supplement 2 in new manuscript), although there was evidence of potential cross-reaction for participants who were already seropositive to DENV (Figure 3—figure supplement 3 in new manuscript). In our main analysis using neutralisation titres (Figure 2), we therefore conditioned on participants being seronegative to ZIKV in 2013.</p><p>These additional analyses of neutralisation data are now described in the ‘Serological analysis: Fiji’ section of the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Related to the above, it would be good to show the correlation between neutralization and MIA results. I tried to do this myself (using the provided ids) but was only able to match the data of 16/45 individuals (the neut dataset includes 344 individuals, most with incomplete data). Unless there's a problem with the data (or provided IDs), the agreement seems poor. For example, these 16 individuals have positive neutralization titers in 2015 (&gt;4 in the majority) and yet, only 5/16 are classified as positive by the MIA assay.</p></disp-quote><p>The IDs in the two datasets provided in the original submission were independent, as the datasets were not analysed together. In the new submission, we include a single merged dataset (“dset5-fiji-mergedassaydata.csv”), and use this to assess the correlation between neutralization and MIA results. This is described in the updated Materials and methods:</p><p>“A previous study, which tested serological samples from Fiji across three divisions [Kama et al., 2019], found that of the samples reactive by MIA, 66/83 (79.5%) exhibited neutralizing activity for ZIKV (κ = 0.71) and 109/112 (97.3%) for DENV (κ = 0.80). […] We found that 54/79 (68.4%) samples that were positive to ZIKV in the neutralization assay were also positive by MIA, and 42/56 (75%) who were seronegative were also negative by MIA.”</p><p>While compiling the linked dataset, we also realised that two participants had multiple aliquots tested for MIA. We have therefore omitted these repeat MIA measurements from the dataset, leaving 189 unique samples. We have updated all the values in the text accordingly, and the overall conclusions remain the same.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The four observed ZIKV seroreversions described in the last paragraph of the Results seem to be in individuals with relatively low titers at seroconversion (4). There are four additional &quot;seroreversions&quot; among individuals who were already positive in the 2013 sample. Are these seroreversions mainly capturing cross-reactive responses? It would be useful to show a figure (maybe supplementary) with the longitudinal neutralization titer data.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the limited neutralisation results we had available, we aimed to focus on the overall titre dynamics, rather than focusing too heavily on results from simple cut-off metrics, which as suggested, may not fully reflect the range of the underlying responses. The main reason we conditioned on seronegativity in Figure 2 was to remove potential effects of cross-reactivity responses in 2013 (see response to point 7 above). We realise, however, that it would also be helpful to show the same analysis including participants who were already seropositive by neutralisation assay to ZIKV or DENV in 2013. We therefore have added a new figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) showing results for participants who had a rise in log titre of at least 2 between 2013–15, regardless of titre in 2013. We obtain the same conclusion about waning, actually with a larger average decline in log titre for ZIKV (panel A). This is further evidence that individuals can exhibit a notable decline in ZIKV response, even if they do not fall below the titre = 2 threshold.</p><p>Thank you also for the suggestion to show the raw titres. We agree this would be useful and have added this to the new manuscript (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In light of these limitations/uncertainties, we think the manuscript needs to be reworked to emphasize the uncertainty regarding the meaning of these findings. We would emphasize the need for more studies using longitudinal data (rather than cross-sectional) data and a broader set of assays, including PRNTs. We would de-emphasize the discussion/conclusions around the implications of waning protection (last paragraph of the Discussion). While provocative, we are not convinced it's supported by the presented data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have de-emphasised the potential implications for protective immunity in the Abstract and Discussion, and focus instead on the need for additional studies to address the questions raised and remaining. The final paragraph of the Discussion is now as follows:</p><p>“In the short-term, our findings have implications for the design of follow up studies of ZIKV. […] Such studies will be essential to understand different aspects of the short and long-term immune antibody response against ZIKV, and how prior exposures to DENV may influence these responses.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) It would be good to clarify which subset of samples were tested and the sample sizes that went into each analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the sample sizes at relevant points in the text, as well as to figure and table legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed most of our concerns. Thanks for providing the merged data! We have some additional comments:</p><p>1) The low agreement reported for the ZIKV MIA and PRNTs assays is a bit concerning, and not consistent with the sensitivity and specificity reported. There seem to be 65 samples positive according to the PRNT in 2017, and of these only 17 (26%) are positive according to the MIA. Assuming that the PRNT is the &quot;gold standard&quot;, this would suggest a much lower sensitivity of MIA than was reported for old infections, suggesting time-dependent sensitivity (26% vs. 80%). If instead we question the performance of the PRNT (cross-reactivity?) then the waning results are also questionable. I think these discrepancies (and the difficulty interpreting results from these novel assays) should be explicitly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>As MIA and NT measure different aspects of the immune response, we decided to analyse the two results in more detail. First, we compared ZIKV seroprevalence estimates according to pre-existing DENV titre in 2013 (new Figure 3). As already noted in the previous iteration of the manuscript, we found some evidence of cross-reactivity by NT for participants with higher initial DENV titres, which is why we conditioned on participants being seronegative by NT in 2013 in our main analysis of the titre data (Figure 2). We found little difference between assays in 2015. The difference in 2017 was greatest for participants with some pre-existing DENV titre, consistent with the B cell competition hypothesis presented in previous version of the Discussion.</p><p>These findings are described in the updated Results:</p><p>“Of the 45 participants tested by neutralization assay, 9 were initially seropositive to ZIKV by NT in 2013. […] This difference was associated with participants’ 2013 DENV titres: those with intermediate DENV titres in 2013 had a significantly lower probability of being seropositive in the MIA in 2017 compared to NT (Figure 3C).”</p><p>We have also expanded the hypothesis about immunological mechanism for these findings in the Discussion, proposing an explanation for why MIA responses did not persist:</p><p>“If an individual has experienced prior DENV infections, high numbers of weakly neutralizing cross-reactive B cells may outcompete naïve B cells for ZIKV antigen [Midgley et al., 2011], leading to a short-term boost in antibody response against ZIKV following ZIKV infection [Robbiani et al., 2017] but not a persistent specific response; a similar phenomenon has been observed for other antigenically variable viruses like influenza [Kucharski et al., 20181]. […] This difference was greatest for participants who had intermediate baseline titres to DENV in 2013 (Figure 3C), which would support the hypothesis that prior DENV exposure may result in a detectable short-term specific response against ZIKV following ZIKV infection (as measured by MIA), but not a persistent specific response.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the above, authors should explicitly state in the text that, while neutralization titers decayed over the observation period, there's little (or no) evidence of sero-reversion (decreasing seroprevalence) according to the neutralization data.</p></disp-quote><p>There is some limited evidence of sero-reversion according to neutralization titres, and we now include the numbers in the Results:</p><p>“In total, four participants seroreverted between 2015 and 2017; all had a log titre of 4 against ZIKV in 2015.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please provide a reference for the sensitivities and specificities reported for the MIA assay. Also, please state whether these performances were evaluated using acute/early convalescent samples vs. samples from historical infections (infections occurring one or more years before).</p></disp-quote><p>We now clarify in the Materials and methods that serostatus was defined by a cut-off determined using positive and negative control sera analyzed by ROC curve, with the quoted sensitivities and specificities for MIA calculated from these results. The positive control serum for ZIKV was collected 13 months after RT-PCR confirmed infection.</p><p>In the revised Discussion, we also note that the post-infection immune response in RT-PCR-confirmed cases may not be the same as in asymptomatic or unreported cases:</p><p>“antibody responses in RT-PCR-confirmed cases may not necessarily be representative of immune responses against ZIKV in the wider population, particularly following asymptomatic infection. Although MIA seropositivity in our study was defined using control sera collected over a year after RT-PCR-confirmed infection, our results suggest that this threshold may not detect long-term waning responses in individuals who had unreported, and likely less severe, infections.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I also find it concerning that 9/46 samples (~20%) were positive against ZIKV (low titers) according to the PRNT assay in 2013. The authors perform some analyses around cross-reactivity, but these are only described in the Materials and methods. I think cross-reactivity (and how it could impact the results) should be addressed in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in the response to point 1 above, participants who were seropositive by NT in 2013 typically had higher initial DENV titres, suggesting potential cross-reactivity. However, our main analysis focused on participants who were seronegative to ZIKV in 2013, so this should not affect our conclusions.</p><p>We include the additional analysis as Figure 3 in the new Results and address the issue of cross-reactivity in the updated Discussion:</p><p>“Several participants in Fiji were seropositive to ZIKV by neutralization assay (NT) in 2013, but this result may be influenced by cross-reaction; participants who had high pre-existing titres to DENV in 2013 were more likely to be seropositive by NT (Figure 3A). […] However, we obtained the same conclusion when participants who were initially seropositive were also considered (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Most of our concerns have been satisfactorily addressed, but I have one remaining question.</p><p>- You report that the proportion seropositive (by MIA) was ~24% in Fiji in 2015, yet Figure 3B shows a seroprevalence of &gt;90% among the 45 individuals that were also tested using neutralization assays. It could almost be seen as if individuals were selected for neutralization assays based on the MIA status (42/45 samples positive by MIA were tested) but the text reads that they were selected based on sample availability only. Please clarify how the samples were selected.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point, and we realise we should have been clearer here. The NT testing was indeed informed by the 2013 and 2015 MIA status, as well as sample availability (i.e. from loss to follow up in the longitudinal serosurvey and stored serum availability). However, this selection choice did not affect our conclusions about waning of ZIKV titres, because our analysis focused on individual-level changes in NT titre conditioned on serostatus, rather than absolute seroprevalence by NT.</p><p>We have updated the Materials and methods accordingly:</p><p>“To follow the evolution of antibody titres at the individual level, a subset of samples collected from the same individuals in 2013, 2015 and 2017 were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV and each of the four DENV serotypes using a neutralization assay as previously described [Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016]. […] We also tested samples from an additional 24 participants from the same cohort who were seropositive to ZIKV by MIA in 2013 or 2015 and for whom we had sufficient serum from 2013 and 2015 to test by neutralization assay, but no matched sample from the 2017 follow up survey (i.e. 69 paired samples in total).”</p><p>As well as the Results:</p><p>“To explore dynamics of antibody waning at the individual level, we performed neutralization assays (NT) on a subset of 45 participants from Fiji for whom sufficient sera were available to test against ZIKV from all three collection periods, focusing on those who were seropositive to ZIKV by MIA in 2013 or 2015.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
