Although the enzymatic properties of purified NM-2 motor fragments have been determined, the emergent properties of filament ensembles are unknown. Using single myosin filament in vitro motility assays, we report fundamental differences in filaments formed of different NM-2 motors. Filaments consisting of NM2-B moved processively along actin, while under identical conditions, NM2-A filaments did not. By more closely mimicking the physiological milieu, either by increasing solution viscosity or by co-polymerization with NM2-B, NM2-A containing filaments moved processively. Our data demonstrate that both the kinetic and mechanical properties of these two myosins, in addition to the stochiometry of NM-2 subunits, can tune filament mechanical output. We propose altering NM-2 filament composition is a general cellular strategy for tailoring force production of filaments to specific functions, such as maintaining tension or remodeling actin.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myosin</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>motility</kwd><kwd>mechanochemistry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC000039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>Thomas B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL001786</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sellers</surname><given-names>James R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Individual nonmuscle myosin 2 filaments in cells may differ their mechanical and kinetic properties depending on the myosin paralog composition giving the cells a mechanism for fine tuning the output of a given nonmuscle myosin filament.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Humans have 13 class II myosin heavy chain genes. Most of these encode for the heavy chains of skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle myosins, but three encode for the heavy chains of paralogs that are widely expressed in nonmuscle tissue. These are commonly called NM2-A, NM2-B and NM2-C, each with different heavy chains encoded by the <italic>MYH9</italic>, <italic>MYH10</italic> and <italic>MYH14</italic> genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>). Nonmuscle class II myosins (NM2) are molecular motors involved in cytokinesis, cell migration, adhesion and tissue morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heissler and Manstein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>). The coiled-coil tail region of the heavy chain of each of these myosins homodimerizes and the neck region associates with an essential light chain (ELC) and a regulatory light chain (RLC), creating a hexameric molecule. These individual myosin molecules further self-associate via their tails to form bipolar filaments that are approximately 300 nm in length and contain, on average, either 30 myosin molecules for NM2-A and NM2-B or 16 myosin molecules for NM2-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billington et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Niederman and Pollard, 1975</xref>). In addition, it has been demonstrated that NM2-A and NM2-B can co-polymerize to form heterotypic filaments in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shutova et al., 2014</xref>). It is unknown why mammalian cells express three different NM2 paralogs, or what their individual or shared functions are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>). The enzymatic activity and the filament assembly of each of the NM2 paralogs are regulated by phosphorylation of the RLC by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), or other cellular kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heissler and Sellers, 2016</xref>).</p><p>It has long been known that the different skeletal muscle myosins-2 have distinct enzymatic and mechanical properties from studies in muscle fibers and of isolated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bottinelli and Reggiani, 2000</xref>). Similarly, numerous enzymatic studies conducted on the soluble, single-headed subfragment-one (S1) or double-headed heavy meromyosin (HMM) fragments have revealed differences in the steady state and transient state kinetics of the three NM2 paralogs that suggests there is differentiation of function amongst them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heissler and Manstein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kovács et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosenfeld et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). The enzymatic activity of all three NM2 paralogs is low compared to other myosin 2 family members. Nevertheless, of the three NM2 paralogs, NM2-A has the highest actin-activated ATPase activity and translocates actin filaments the fastest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). During the course of binding and hydrolysis of ATP and subsequently product dissociation, myosin cycles through conformations that bind weakly and strongly to actin. The duty ratio (r) of a myosin is defined as the fraction of a kinetic cycle the myosin spends in a conformational state which binds strongly to actin. NM2-B has a four-fold higher duty ratio than NM2-A, meaning that it will spend a greater proportion of its ATPase cycle strongly bound to actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kovács et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The role of myosin bipolar filaments as force generating structures in cells has been clearly demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>). Myosin filaments can interact with actin filaments of opposite polarity to create a sarcomeric type contractile unit, similar to those found in striated muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ebrahim et al., 2013</xref>). They may also move processively along actin filaments in cells which could aid in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ebrahim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fenix et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2017</xref>) or may serve as protein scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maddox et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Piekny and Glotzer, 2008</xref>). Recent studies using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy for the visualization of single, or small clusters of myosin filaments in cells, allow for the possibility of dissecting their detailed function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beach and Hammer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fenix et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). However, despite their fundamental roles in generating force in cells, the mechanical properties of individual NM2 filaments are unknown.</p><p>To understand their individual mechanical properties, we used purified full-length human NM2-A and NM2-B molecules expressed in <italic>Sf</italic>9 cells to reconstitute and study the ability of single filaments of NM2 myosin paralogs to move along actin filaments bound to the coverslip surface. We find that NM2-B filaments are processive even at low-solution viscosity and that 5 – 10 myosin motor domains per half filament are required to ensure processivity. In contrast, NM2-A filaments are only processive when the viscosity of the solution is raised to mimic that of the intracellular millieu using methylcellulose or when NM2-A is co-polymerized with NM2-B. These data suggest that NM2-B is more adapted to a role of maintaining a high static tension level in cells, whereas NM2-A is geared to more rapid motile activity. Our data further show that formation of heterotypic NM2 filaments is an effective mechanism to fine tune filament mechanical properties between these two modes. As cell biologists start to decipher the cellular roles of NM2 filaments using fluorescence microscopy, our study demonstrates that not all NM2 filaments are equivalent and that subunit composition must be considered in order to fully understand their function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NM2-B filaments move processively on actin filaments</title><p>In a first set of experiments, we investigated the motility of NM2-B filaments using TIRF microscopy. We introduced a HaloTag at the N-terminus of the myosin heavy chain to allow for covalent labeling with dyes of different colors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The regulatory light chain (RLC) was phosphorylated using MLCK in order to activate the enzymatic activity of the myosin and to facilitate filament formation. We found that individual HaloTag-NM2-B filaments moved processively along fluorescently labeled actin filaments attached to a glass coverslip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The NM2-B filaments were slightly longer (~300 nm) than the diffraction limited resolution of our TIRF microscope and usually appeared as slightly elongated objects whose long and short axes could be readily distinguished. In the presence of 1 mM ATP, HaloTag-NM2-B filaments showed robust processive motility with a characteristic run length of 1.95 ± 0.12 μm (mean ± SEM) and a velocity of 43 ± 21 nm∙ s<sup>−1</sup> (mean ± SD, n = 1463 filaments) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). This experiment confirms an earlier study showing that NM2-B filaments purified with an N-terminally fused GFP-RLC (GFP-RLC-NM2-B) also moved processively along actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nagy et al., 2013</xref>). To directly compare the movements of myosin filaments using these two labeling strategies, we re-examined the movement of GFP-RLC-NM2-B filaments under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). GFP-RLC-NM2-B filaments showed the same level of processivity as HaloTag-NM2-B filaments.

Moreover, upper and middle right panels show clearly GFP-RLC-NM2-B filaments that tumbled on actin filaments (arrows).</p></caption></media><p>Several interesting features of the NM2-B filament motility were observed in our timelapse recordings, reflecting possible behaviors of NM2 filaments in cells. A single NM2-B filament could move on actin with its long axis perpendicular or parallel to the actin filament and could flip back and forth between these two modes while moving (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). In the case of perpendicular interactions only one side of the myosin filament interacted with actin. The polarity of the actin filament determines the direction the bipolar myosin filament moves even when the NM2 filament is interacting in a parallel manner with the actin filament where motors from each end of the bipolar filament are in proximity to actin. When NM2-B filaments encountered an intersection of two actin filaments, they often paused before continuing along the original filament or switching to the other (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Since the actin filaments in this assay were tethered to the coverslip surface this would be analogous to the myosin exerting isometric tension on two actin filaments in a cell.

The isoform composition of each moving filament was determined by measurement of the intensities of the two colors and varied only slightly from the ratios expected for random co-polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We did not see evidence for the filaments changing their isoform composition during an actin-attached processive movement. Run length distributions were well described by a single exponential decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and decreased linearly with increasing F<sub>NM2-A</sub> from 1.88 ± 0.14 μm (mean ± S.E.M., n = 1121) at F<sub>NM2-A</sub> = 0.72, to 0.79 ± 0.01 μm (n = 1454) at F<sub>NM2-A</sub> = 0.24)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The distributions of the velocity of the filaments at each mixing ratio were not well fit to a single Gaussian (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is particularly evident at the 1:2 mixing ratio. For this reason, we decided to calculate the arithmetic mean velocity of all the filaments at a given mixing ratio to represent <italic>v</italic>. The velocity of the mixed filaments is largely determined by the velocity of the slower moving NM2-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This was consistent with previous results from actin gliding in vitro motility assays, which show that slower myosins dominate the velocity when myosin 2 isoforms of different inherent velocity are randomly bound to the coverslip surface, which was modeled by assuming the two myosin isoforms affect the attachment lifetimes of each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cuda et al., 1997</xref>). Our results show that the mechanical properties of single heterotypic NM2 filaments can be varied depending on the ratio of their paralogs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study has important implications for understanding how NM2 myosin filaments interact with actin filaments and function within the cell. Despite their almost identical structure, NM2-A and NM2-B filaments differ significantly in their motile and kinetic properties. NM2-B filaments have a higher composite duty ratio and move slower than NM2-A filaments under the unloaded conditions of the single filament in vitro motility assay. The effect of force on the kinetics of NM2 paralogs has not been measured using optical trapping, but a previous transient kinetic study showed that the rate of dissociation of ADP from both acto-NM2-A and acto-NM2-B motor domains is affected by intramolecular strain that occurs when the two motors of a myosin molecule are bound to adjacent actin monomers in the presence of ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kovács et al., 2007</xref>). However, this study revealed that NM2-B is significantly more strain dependent than NM2-A. Since the dissociation of ADP from acto-NM2 limits the rate of dissociation of NM2 from actin, this suggests that under strained conditions, NM2-B will have a significantly longer lifetime on actin filaments than NM2-A. This implies that NM2-B filaments might be better suited for maintaining tension on actin filaments in cells, whereas NM2-A would be more useful as a cargo motor for rapid but unsustained contractions or in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, given its higher motility rate. In this regard, it is interesting that NM2-A is more prominent in the leading edge of cells where there are active actin dynamics, whereas NM2-B is typically more concentrated with stress fibers which are linked through adhesion complexes to generate forces on the substrate and where actin is highly dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beach et al., 2014</xref>). The longer attachment lifetimes and greater strain dependence of these attachments would allow NM2-B to maintain force more effectively and efficiently than NM2-A.</p><p>We also show in the present study that NM2-A and NM2-B molecules co-polymerize randomly in vitro consistent with reports that they readily form heterotypic filaments in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shutova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shutova et al., 2014</xref>). These co-filaments move processively over a range of NM2-A to NM2-B ratios. Our data show that co-filaments containing as few as six to eight molecules of NM2-B in the presence of a majority of NM2-A molecules continue to move processively, albeit with shorter run lengths than filaments containing higher amounts of NM2-B. Interestingly, the velocity is strongly dictated by the slower NM2-B which is consistent with experiments using the sliding actin in vitro motility assay when fast and slow myosins are mixed on the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cuda et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harris et al., 1994</xref>). These results imply that a cell can tune the mechanical output of a filament by varying its composite ratio of NM2 paralogs. Other sources of strain in a cell might affect the mechanical properties of NM2 paralogs. Strain could arise from two myosin filaments interacting with the same actin filament or from actin-binding proteins that might tether the filament to the cytoskeletal component or a membrane which might provide resistance to the NM2-directed motion.</p><p>By copolymerizing NM2-B with a tail fragment, we were able to determine that more than four motors need to be present at one end of a bipolar filament to ensure its processivity. This agrees remarkably well with calculations based on the duty ratio of the individual NM2-B motor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). We also found that the rate of movement of the hybrid myosin filaments on actin were not significantly affected by the number of myosin motors available. These results suggest that the rate of movement of the myosin filaments are governed by the rate of detachment of myosin from actin. This is in contrast to a recent study with smooth muscle myosin filaments suggesting that the rate of filament movement is limited by the myosin attachment rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brizendine et al., 2015</xref>). There are several differences in the myosins and experimental setups that could have contributed to the different conclusions. First, smooth muscle myosin forms side-polar filaments in contrast to the bipolar filaments formed by NM2-B. Second, the duty ratio of smooth muscle myosin is low and it was necessary to include methylcellulose in the assay medium. In the presence of methycellulose, it might be possible for all the motors in a myosin filament to transiently be dissociated from actin without the myosin filament diffusing away before a new motor can bind and tether the myosin filament to actin. A second study from this same lab has recently been published containing a more elaborate model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brizendine et al., 2017</xref>). This model allows that myosin filaments may move with attachment or detachment limited kinetics depending on the myosin, myosin motor density and ionic conditions. The higher duty ratio of NM2-B would inherently bias the system toward a detachment limited mode. The observation that the rate of movement of the filaments did not vary with the number of contributing motors was consistent with a recent study which made synthetic myosin filaments mimics using DNA nanotubes where the spacing and density of myosin motor domains could be varied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hariadi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>It is significant that tail fragments that were N-terminally fused with either the Halo-tag or a fluorescent fusion protein (data not shown) form bipolar filaments that, by negatively stained transmission electron microscopy, are similar to those formed by full-length molecules. In contrast, numerous studies have shown that myosin tail fragments that are not N-terminally capped by GFP or a HaloTag form much longer and thicker aggregates or paracrystals when polymerized either in vitro or when overexpressed in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franke et al., 2005</xref>). One potential use of capped tail fragments would be as a dominant-negative construct for myosin in cells where they would co-polymerize with full-length NM2 and thereby reduce the average number of myosin motors in a filament. However, the polymerization of these tail fragments lacking the light chain binding sites and therefore no RLC, would not be under the control of myosin light chain kinases and could result in inappropriate assembly and mislocalization of the myosin filaments in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beach et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In view of the experimentally determined single molecule duty ratio of 0.05 for NM2-A, it is not surprising that these filaments failed to move processively in the absence of methycellulose. Calculations using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation (1)</xref> show that more than 50 motors are required at one end of a NM2-A bipolar filament to ensure that at least one motor would be attached to an actin filament and ensure continuation of a processive run. There are only about 30 motors available at the end of a bipolar filament and not all of these are likely to be in a geometrically favorable position for actin filament interaction at any given moment. Under these low viscosity conditions, the myosin filaments rapidly diffuse away from an actin filament when no motors were attached.</p><p>The viscosity experienced by objects the size of NM2 filaments in cells is expected to be between one and two orders of magnitude larger than that in a simple aqueous buffer. Therefore, we mimicked elements of the physiological viscosity by adding 0.5% methylcellulose to increase the viscosity by about 25-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalwarczyk et al., 2011</xref>). We show that under these higher viscosity conditions NM2-A filaments behave as processive units. A recent study of the motility of single filaments of smooth muscle myosin also found they did not move processively under low-viscosity buffer conditions, but that inclusion of methylcellulose into the assay chamber allowed for robust motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haldeman et al., 2014</xref>). Methylcellulose was also used in in vitro motility experiments with skeletal muscle myosin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murrell and Gardel, 2012</xref>). Methylcellulose may act in two ways in this assay. By increasing solution viscosity, the diffusion rate of the NM2-A filaments is reduced sufficiently such that upon an instantaneous dissociation from actin, it would not diffuse away before another myosin motor could attach and restore processive movement. Methylcellulose is also a crowding agent which may influence the kinetics, and therefore the duty ratio of NM2-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Highsmith et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, inclusion of methylcellulose in assays of NM2-B filament produced a ‘parking’ behavior, where filaments were unable to detach upon reaching the end of the actin filament and where multiple myosin filaments accumulated at actin intersections. This behavior precluded a quantitative comparison of NM2-B filament run lengths under viscous and nonviscous conditions. The highly processive nature of NM2-B filaments is interesting to consider in that this myosin partitions to the rear of the cell and results in the production of an extended cell rear or tail, via the production of stable and long lived actomyosin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>). The parking behavior of NM2-B filaments at high viscosity has also been observed for smooth muscle myosin filaments under similar assay conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haldeman et al., 2014</xref>). The spatial self-sorting behavior of NM2-A and NM2-B filaments has recently been demonstrated to rely on a gradual enrichment of NM2-B in stress fibers during retrograde flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shutova et al., 2017</xref>). Our results offer an explanation for how NM2-B can become preferentially enriched towards the cell posterior in polarized cells, since NM2-B rich filaments have an enhanced activity to remain bound to actin and will thus tend to track rearwards with retrograde flow. Conversely, NM2-A rich filaments have a greater probability of detaching from actin and will thus undergo relatively high rates of turnover and recycling with respect to actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shutova et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Another significant difference in our in vitro assays and the cellular environment is that in our system each moving myosin filament typically has contact with only one actin filament. A single cluster of motor domains emanating from one end of a bipolar filament could potentially have interactions with about a 100 nm stretch along an actin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billington et al., 2013</xref>). This length of actin encompasses around 40 actin monomers, many of which would be sterically unavailable to the myosin motor domains. Inside a cell, myosin filaments may interact with a bundle of actin filaments or with multiple individual actin filaments. Both of these cases would tend to increase the ability of myosin to processively interact with actin within its cellular environment. The ability of NM2 filaments to interact with actin in an ‘end on’ manner where the cluster of myosin motors on the opposite end of the bipolar filament project outward would also enhance the ability of NM2 filaments to cross-link and bundle actin filaments or to slide actin filaments relative to one another. The single filament in vitro motility assay will be very useful in dissecting this mode of actin-myosin interaction.</p><p>Recently, studies using super-resolution light microscopy found that individual myosin filaments align to form vertical stacks. The formation of these stacks appeared to require both actin and myosin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fenix et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). We observed multi-filament structures that resemble these structures being formed when two NM2 filaments meet whilst moving on an actin filament. These structures are dynamic and can shed or add individual myosin filaments. Since dynamically treadmilling actin was not present in our in vitro assays, this suggests that merging and splitting of such structures is an intrinsic property of myosin filaments when they are brought into close proximity with each other. The physical basis for forming stacks is not known. The attraction is likely to be electrostatic since fewer filament stacks are observed by electron microscopy as the ionic strength is raised. To form the folded ‘off’ state, the two motor domains of a single myosin make an asymmetric interaction in which the loop 2 region of one motor interacts with the converter domain of another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wendt et al., 2001</xref>). This interaction appears to be broken upon phosphorylation of the regulatory light chains. It is possible that this weak interaction comes into significance when two filaments, each bearing 30 motors per filament end, come into close proximity. The fact that the stacks can disassemble suggests that the forces holding them together are not large.</p><p>The question remains as to why mammalian cells have three genes to encode nonmuscle myosins. Studies in mutant mouse models reveal that different nonmuscle myosin paralogs have different patterns of expression during development (for a review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma and Adelstein, 2014</xref>). For example, in the early embryo, only NM2-A is expressed in the developing visceral endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conti et al., 2004</xref>). Ablation of NM2-A is lethal at embryonic day 6 since the cells cannot form appropriate adhesion complexes between cells. The DNA encoding the NM2-B heavy chain can be inserted into the NM2-A genetic loci resulting in expression of NM2-B during this early embryonic period. The NM2-B/NM2-A switch can rescue the early embryonic lethality, but the mouse experiences other defects later in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Other studies reveal cases where paralog switching is not successful. NM2-A is specifically required for placental blood vessel formation and NM2-B is required for neuronal cell migration during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). In these cases, the opposite paralog cannot functionally substitute, suggesting that each of these myosins have features that are not redundant for some cellular functions.</p><p>Our results suggest that relating light microscopic observations of myosin filaments in cells to their mechanical output is not trivial. With the advent of super-resolution light microscopy, it is now possible to image single myosin filaments in cells, but most experimental methods used to date are not sufficient to truly understand the composition of the observed filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fenix et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). If the investigator uses overexpression of a GFP-tagged RLC, then the heavy chain composition of the filament will be unknown. Similarly, visualization of myosin filaments by overexpression of a GFP-tagged myosin heavy chain does not rule out the possibility that an observed filament could be a co-polymer with another NM2 paralog, or with myosin 18A (<italic>MYO18</italic>), which is an enzymatically inactive pseudo-myosin.</p><p>In summary, a cell has several potential mechanisms to mechanically fine tune or regulate the activity of a given myosin filament. These include forming heteromeric filaments composed of two or more NM2 paralogs (or myosin 18A) with differing mechanical properties and controlling the number of myosin molecules in a filament or the phosphorylation status of the regulatory light chain of the myosins in a filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billington et al., 2015</xref>). This means that for a given NM2 filament observed in a cell, there can be a wide range of mechanical properties which cannot be estimated by fluorescence intensity alone. It follows that that the behavior of individual NM2 filaments within a cell are highly unlikely to be uniform. Thus, increases in myosin filament density following a cellular perturbation or movement do not necessarily imply that the mechanical output will scale proportionally. These factors highlight the complexity of dissecting NM2 filament function in vivo. In this respect, the in vitro single filament motility assay is a sensitive way to provide information on the regulation of filament mechanical output and to inform future cell biological studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Indentifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (Spodoptera fugiperda)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Sf9</italic></td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher <break/>Scientific <break/>11496015</td><td valign="top">Maintained in Sf-900 III SFM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pFastBac1-NM2-A</td><td valign="top">PMID: 24072716</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pFastBac1-NM2-B</td><td valign="top">PMID: 24072716</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pFastBac1-NM2-B tail</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">NM2-B tail</td><td valign="top">Progenitor: pFastBac1-NM2-B</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">FAST</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://spudlab.stanford.edu/fast-for-automatic-motility-measurements">http://spudlab.stanford.edu/fast-for-automatic-motility-measurements</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">ImageJ</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imageJ.nih.gov/ij">http://imageJ.nih.gov/ij</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of expression vectors</title><p>For the preparation of GFP-RLC-NM2 full-length molecules, the cDNA of full-length NM2-A and NM2-B MHCs were amplified and cloned into a modified pFastBac1 vector (FLAG-pFastBac1) encoding an N-terminus Flag-tag (DYKDDDK) for purification.

The protein pellet was then collected by centrifugation at 60,000 g for 30 min and dissolved in an appropriate amount of buffer A containing 0.5 M NaCl and 10 mM DTT. The purified proteins were analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) followed by PageBlue staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Protein concentration was determined using a spectrophotometer and calculated according to the formula [myosin](mg/ml) = (A280 − A320)/εwhere ε, the extinction coefficient of the protein, was 0.52 mL⋅mg<sup>−1</sup>⋅cm<sup>−1</sup> for myosins and 0.39 mL⋅mg<sup>−1</sup>⋅cm<sup>−1</sup> for the NM2B tail (Online ExPASy ProtParam tool). The yield of the purification procedure was 1–2 mg of purified proteins. Myosin proteins were flash frozen in 20 µl aliquots and stored in liquid nitrogen until used.

HaloTag-NM2 molecules were fluorescently labeled together at the same time as the phosphorylation reaction by adding to the buffer a 10X excess of the chosen HaloTag-dye (Promega). To remove the excess dye, myosin was polymerized into filaments by dilution of the ionic strength to 25 mM with buffer A, centrifuged at 60,000 g for 45 min and then dissolved in buffer A containing 0.5 M KCl and 10 mM DTT.

NM2-A bound to the coverslip surface was used in the experiments to determine whether phalloidin affects NM2-A motility. In one set of experiments, we separately added either Alexa-fluor-647-phalloidin-labeled actin filaments or filaments formed from actin monomers that were labeled with Atto-538 (Hypermol). In a second experiment preformed Alexa-Fluor-647-phalloidin-labeled actin filaments were mixed with preformed Atto-538-labeled actin filaments and then added to the in vitro motility flow chamber and the movement of both colored actin filaments were simultaneously measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Single filament TIRF assay</title><p>The single filament TIRF assay was performed in flow cells made with a microscope slide (Corning Frosted Microscope Slides 75 × 25 mm; Thickness 0.9–1.1 mm), a coverslip (18 × 18 mm #1.5; Fisher Scientific) and double-side adhesive tape as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kron and Spudich, 1986</xref>). In the assay, biotinylated actin filaments were attached to the surface of the coverslip. In this study, two alternative protocols for the functionalization and passivation of the coverslips were used. In the first, 0.1% nitrocellulose was smeared and allowed to dry on the coverslip. The functionalized coverslip was then used to build the flow cell and a solution containing 5 mg∙ml<sup>−1</sup> of biotinylated BSA was applied to the flow cell. After 2 min, the flow cell was washed with motility buffer (20 mM MOPS (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EGTA) containing 50 mM KCl and then a solution containing 1 mg∙ml<sup>−1</sup> BSA was applied to the flow cell to reduce nonspecific interaction. After a second wash with 50 mM KCl motility buffer a solution containing 2 mg∙ml<sup>−1</sup> NeutrAvidin was added to the flow cell. After 5 mins of incubation, the flow cell was washed again with 50 mM KCl motility buffer and it was ready for the binding of biotinylated actin filaments. Alternatively, the coverslip was treated with biotinylated Polyethylene glycol (Biotin-PEG) according to previously published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breitsprecher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haldeman et al., 2014</xref>) with the following modifications. The coverslip were washed by sequential sonication in 2% Hellmanex (Hellma GmbH and Co. KG), distillated water and 100% ethanol. In each step, the coverslips were sonicated for 10 min. After drying with N<sub>2</sub>, the coverslip were plasma cleaned for 10 min using a Plasma system ZEPTO (Diener electronic, Germany). The concentration of mPEG-silane (MW 2,000) and biotin-PEG-silane (MW 3,400) (both (Laysan Bio, Inc. Arab, AL) were 2 mg∙ml<sup>−1</sup> and 10 μg∙ml<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Prior to each experiment, a Biotin-PEG-treated coverslip was extensively rinsed with ddH<sub>2</sub>O, dried with N<sub>2</sub> and used to build the flow cell. The flow cell was incubated with 10 mg∙ml<sup>−1</sup> of BSA for 2 min. After washing with 50 mM KCl motility buffer a solution of 2 mg∙ml<sup>−1</sup> NeutrAvidin was added and incubated for 5 min. The flow cell was then washed with 200 μl of 10 mg∙ml<sup>−1</sup> BSA followed by 200 μl of 50 mM KCl buffer and it was ready for biotinylated actin binding. It is important to note that the Biotin-PEG treatment of the coverslips dramatically reduces the nonspecific interaction of NM2 filaments and the coverslip surface.

In the experiments where methylcellulose was used, after the binding of actin, a solution containing 30 nM of NM2 filaments in 150 mM motility buffer was added and incubated for 1 min. The NM2 filament motility was initiated by addition of 30 μl of final buffer with 0.5% methylcellulose into the flow cell. The change in order of addition of reagents compared to the experiments in the absence of methylcellulose was necessitated since free myosin filaments tended to form larger structures in the presence of methylcellulose.

The excitation light source was a Nikon LU-N4 Laser Unit equipped with four lasers (405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, 640 nm). The microscope was also equipped with an externally triggered fast wheel for the emission filters (HS-625 Filter Wheel, Finger Lakes Instrumentation (FLI), LIMA, NY) to increase the acquisition rate and at the same time reduce the crosstalk between channels.

For each fluorescence channel, 20 images of the field of view were captured using the same laser power and exposure time used for the experiments. The background images from each channel were then averaged and the resulting image was subtracted from the respective channel of the movies. Each movie was analyzed individually for tracking of fluorescently labelled NM2 filaments using the TrackMate plug-in for ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). The TrackMate plug-in settings used for the analysis of the movies were the following: detector: LoG detector (estimated blob diameter: 1 μm, Threshold: 50–200), initial threshold: not set, view: HyperStack Displayer, tracker: Simple LAP tracker (Linking max distance: 1 μm, gap-closing max distance: 0.5 μm, gap-closing max frame gap: 2), filters on the tracks: Track displacement (above 150 nm). Each track identified by the software using these settings was manually checked using the Trackscheme displayer tool. Only myosin filaments that were observed to bind to actin, move and dissociate before reaching the end of the actin filament were included in the analysis. NM2 filaments that reached the end of the actin and dissociated were excluded from the analysis. Thus, we are measuring a minimum estimate of the run length. For each manually selected filament, the total fluorescence intensity per frame of each filament was calculated from the average intensity per pixel and spot size provided by the TrackMate analysis. The average total fluorescence intensity of each filament, <italic>I,</italic> was then calculated averaging the total fluorescence intensity for the entire track.</p><p>The fluorescence channels used for filament tracking varied according to the fluorophore used to label the NM2 filaments. For the experiments in which two fluorophores were used to label the molecules that form the NM2 filaments, filament tracking with TrackMate plug-in was performed using the 488 nm channel to measure the average velocity and run length and to calculate the intensity (I) of the Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488)-labeled molecules that form each filament.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor and Mohan Balasubramanian as the Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Robert Anthony Cross (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The referees and the editors appreciated your careful study looking at copolymers containing myoIIA and myoIIB and deciphering their biophysical parameters. The referees believe that, with some revision, this paper will make a fine contribution to <italic>eLife</italic>, which will be of value to the molecular motor and the cell biology community.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A large number of minor points have been raised and I would like you to consider and address all of them, since nearly all of these are fixed by rewriting or by one experiment (the phalloidin bound actin inhibiting motile properties of myosin IIA).</p><p>1) The paper needs to clearly articulate how this work might influence thinking in the cell biology community and how it may inform various cell behaviours.</p><p>2) The general principle that variations in myosin isoform composition produce different properties is well-established in muscle myosin thick filaments. This work establishes that the blend of isoforms also determines the velocity and processivity of the much smaller myosin filaments that assemble in nonmuscle cells. The authors clearly feel that the nonmuscle myosin field has neglected the importance of isotype-mixing in determining mechanical output, but their data do not actually demonstrate that filaments in vivo vary in their mechanical output – first because they are not working in vivo, and second because there are no force measurements in this paper, just measurements of zero-load processivity. I recommend toning down the language about mechanical output and concentrating on velocity and processivity, whilst discussing the potential for force-generating and force-holding ability of NM2 filaments in vivo to vary.</p><p>3) Please clarify in the text whether the duty ratios given assume that the two heads of one molecule interact independently with actin. “[…] the duty ratio of an NM2-B monomer&quot; – does this mean one head?</p><p>4) The Discussion considers the potential for filaments with different isotype mixes to deal differently with strain, but again, since there are no measurements of strain here, I think the authors should restrict themselves to pointing out the possibilities, rather than implying that the current results speak directly to the role of strain versus isotype-mix. The Kovacs (2007) study was about internal strain (strain between heads of one molecule). The internal stress and strain on myosins in filaments will be different in a nontrivial way (Hariadi, Nat Nano, 2015). External strain (for example, that coming from another myosin filament pulling on the same actin, could also be relevant in vivo.</p><p>5) Please comment, if possible, on whether exchange of fluorescent molecules between filaments occurs on a relevant timescale.</p><p>6) A paper by Diensthuber et al., (2011) suggests that phalloidin stabilization of actin inhibits the motile properties of NM2-A, but not NM2-B. Phalloidin is used in these experiments, so the authors should address this point about possible inhibition of the motor.</p><p>7) The Materials and methods do not reveal how the authors deal with limitation of actin filament length in calculating the run length.</p><p>8) The meaning of uncertainties are not always clear in the figures. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows a distribution with a mean +/- 1 nm. I assume this is S.E.M. I would actually prefer to see the STD of the distributions throughout the manuscript, since that is the more useful parameter when comparing the different distributions. For example, the difference in the widths of the distributions between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> is interesting.</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, third panel: It is difficult to believe that there can be confidence in the exponential fit of these binned data. Is this binning actually what was used to obtain the fit?

Examples of where we had addressed this in the original manuscript include:</p><p>Introduction: “These data suggest that NM2-B is more adapted to a role of maintaining a high static tension level in cells, whereas NM2-A is geared to more rapid motile activity. […] Not all NM2 filaments have identical mechanical properties.”</p><p>Discussion: “This implies that NM2-B filaments might be better suited for maintaining tension on actin filaments in cells whereas NM2-A would be more useful as a cargo motor, for rapid but unsustained contractions or in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, given its higher motility rate. […] The longer attachment lifetimes and greater strain dependence of these attachments would allow NM2-B to maintain force more effectively and efficiently than NM2-A.”</p><p>Discussion: “These results imply that a cell can tune the mechanical output of a filament by varying its composite ratio of NM2 paralogs.”</p><p>Discussion: “The highly processive nature of NM2-B filaments is interesting to consider in that this myosin partitions to the rear of the cell and results in the production of an extended cell rear or tail, via the production of stable and long lived actomyosin structures (Beach et al., 2014; Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009).”</p><p>Discussion: “Our results offer an explanation for how NM2-B can become preferentially enriched towards the cell posterior in polarized cells, since NM2-B rich filaments have an enhanced activity to remain bound to actin and will thus tend to track rearwards with retrograde flow. Conversely, NM2-A rich filaments have a greater probability of detaching from actin and will thus undergo relatively high rates of turnover and recycling with respect to actin (Shutova et al., 2017).”</p><p>Discussion: “The ability of NM2 filaments to interact with actin in an “end on” manner where the cluster of myosin motors on the opposite end of the bipolar filament project outward would also enhance the ability of NM2 filaments to cross-link and bundle actin filaments or to slide actin filaments relative to one another.”</p><p>Discussion: “Since dynamically treadmilling actin was not present in our in vitro assays this suggests that merging and splitting of such structures is an intrinsic property of myosin filaments when they are brought into close proximity with each other.”</p><p>Discussion: “Thus, a cell has several potential mechanisms to mechanically fine tune or regulate the activity of a given myosin filament. […] In this respect, the in vitro single filament motility assay is a sensitive way to provide information on the regulation of filament mechanical output and to inform future cell biological studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The general principle that variations in myosin isoform composition produce different properties is well-established in muscle myosin thick filaments. This work establishes that the blend of isoforms also determines the velocity and processivity of the much smaller myosin filaments that assemble in nonmuscle cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We now acknowledge in the revised manuscript that the different properties of skeletal muscle myosin isoforms have been known for some time (see review by Bottinelli and Reggiani (Bottinelli and Reggiani, 2000) from experiments studying unloaded shortening of single muscle fibers and we have now included a reference to an excellent review of this:</p><p>“It has long been known that the different skeletal muscle myosins-2 have distinct enzymatic and mechanical properties from studies in muscle fibers and of isolated proteins (Bottinelli and Reggiani, 2000).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors clearly feel that the nonmuscle myosin field has neglected the importance of isotype-mixing in determining mechanical output, but their data do not actually demonstrate that filaments in vivo vary in their mechanical output – first because they are not working in vivo, and second because there are no force measurements in this paper, just measurements of zero-load processivity. I recommend toning down the language about mechanical output and concentrating on velocity and processivity, whilst discussing the potential for force-generating and force-holding ability of NM2 filaments in vivo to vary.</p></disp-quote><p>We do agree that we feel the difference in the properties of the nonmuscle myosin isoforms have been largely neglected in the motility/cytoskeletal field. The best example of this is that many cell biologists routinely use expression of a GFP-labelled RLC to follow “nonmuscle myosins”. While no one has really studied it quantitatively with pull downs, etc., I think we would all be very surprised if this light chain didn’t bind to each of the three NM2 isoforms in cells. Therefore, using this method of imaging myosin filaments completely abolishes the ability to correlate any observed effect with the heavy chain isoform composition of the filament.</p><p>With respect to the reviewer’s wishes to tone down the use of the word “mechanical” in the text, we respectfully would like to use it. The online Oxford dictionary includes the definition “Relating to physical forces or motion; physical”. We will endeavor to make it clear that we are only studying unloaded motility in our studies so that there is no confusion. Below are two places where we have modified the text to account for this.</p><p>“Given the strikingly different behaviors of NM2-A and NM2-B filaments described above, we next investigated how co-filaments containing both myosin paralogs moved in our assay.” Here we changed the original “behaved mechanically” to “moved”.</p><p>New text reads “Despite their almost identical structure, NM2-A and NM2-B filaments differ significantly in their motile and kinetic properties. NM2-B filaments have a higher composite duty ratio and move slower than NM2-A filaments under the unloaded conditions of the single filament in vitro motility assay. The effect of force on the kinetics of NM2 paralogs has not been measured using optical trapping,”we changed “mechanical” to “motile” and added the text “…under the unloaded conditions of the single filament motility assay.”</p><p>The only published data concerning the force sensitivity of these myosins are our stopped-flow kinetic study of ADP release which we published in Kovacs et al. (Kovacs et al., 2007). This is relevant since the release of ADP from the acto-myosin complex is likely the rate limiting step in determining attachment lifetimes. We agree with the reviewers that future work to determine the force dependence of NM2 isoforms should further elucidate the molecular mechanism of NM2 mechanics, and we plan to study this effect in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please clarify in the text whether the duty ratios given assume that the two heads of one molecule interact independently with actin. “[…] the duty ratio of an NM2-B monomer&quot; – does this mean one head?</p></disp-quote><p>In the first sentence under the subheading “More than four NM2-B motors are required for processive movement” we stated that: “The duty ratio of an NM2-B monomer is a function…”. This has been changed to <italic>“</italic>The duty ratio of a single NM2-B motor (subfragment-one)…<italic>”</italic> to emphasize that the determined duty ratio is for a single, independently active myosin motor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Discussion considers the potential for filaments with different isotype mixes to deal differently with strain, but again, since there are no measurements of strain here, I think the authors should restrict themselves to pointing out the possibilities, rather than implying that the current results speak directly to the role of strain versus isotype-mix. The Kovacs (2007) study was about internal strain (strain between heads of one molecule). The internal stress and strain on myosins in filaments will be different in a nontrivial way (Hariadi, Nat Nano, 2015). External strain (for example, that coming from another myosin filament pulling on the same</p><p>actin, could also be relevant in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments, where mixed filaments of NM2-A and NM2-B were created, do demonstrate strain dependence since the NM2-A molecule crossbridge kinetics will be modified by slower NM2-B crossbridge kinetics and vice versa. This mixed myosin assay is no longer “unloaded”. Similar to experiments carried out with mixed molecules in the gliding filament assay, the slower myosin tends to dominate the velocity (Cuda et al., 1997). We have modified a sentence at the end of the Results to emphasize this: “This was consistent with previous results from actin gliding in vitro motility assays, which show that slower myosins dominate the velocity when myosin 2 isoforms of different inherent velocity are randomly bound to the coverslip surface which was modeled by assuming the two myosin isoforms affect the attachment lifetimes of each other (Cuda et al., 1997).<italic>”</italic> </p><p>In many aspects the Hariadi et al. paper on synthetic “filaments” agrees with our work. Although most of the work in Hariadi et al. was done with the processive class V and VI myosins, the study showed that the velocity of actin filament gliding was not dependent on the number of crossbridges participating nor on the spacing of these crossbridges. The fact that reduction in the number of possible myosin motors by copolymerizing with a headless tail fragment does not diminish speed of movement is consistent with Hariadi et al. as well as many studies from the past. Hariadi et al. also studied the effect of changing the compliance which we are unable to do since we are dealing with a native thick filament. We have included a reference to this work: “The observation that the rate of movement of the filaments did not vary with the number of contributing motors was consistent with a recent study which made synthetic myosin filaments mimics using DNA nanotubes where the spacing and density of myosin motor domains could be varied. (Hariadi et al., 2015).”</p><p>The effect of strain on myosin filament kinetics is of great interest to us. The Kovacs et al. (Kovacs et al., 2007) study used the fact that the two motors of an NM2 HMM molecule can simultaneously bind to two adjacent actin monomers in the presence of ADP to look at the effect of strain on ADP release, which is likely to be the kinetic step that controls cycling rate. Note that another study from our lab (Nagy et al., 2013) demonstrated that in the presence of ATP, it is unlikely that NM2-B binds to actin via both motors at the same time, so this intramolecular strain between two bound motors from the same myosin is not likely to be a source of internal strain in our filament experiments. However, motors from different myosins within a filament could very likely produce internal strain. We have no mechanisms in the present study to determine the number of myosin motors within a filament that simultaneously interact with actin. This is a point of great interest to us for future studies.</p><p>It is not likely that external strain (coming from another myosin filament pulling on the same actin filament) is a factor in most of the experiments presented in the current manuscript since the actin filaments are typically bound to the coverslip surface and are not free to move. The reviewer is correct however, in that external strain caused by another myosin filament acting on the same actin filament could be another factor in cells. Strain could also be generated if an actin filament is in contact with actin binding proteins that are anchored to the cytoskeletal or the membrane. We have included a sentence in the Discussion to emphasize this:</p><p>“Other sources of strain in a cell might affect the mechanical properties of NM2 paralogs. Strain could arise from two myosin filaments interacting with the same actin filament or from actin binding proteins that might tether the filament to the cytoskeletal component or a membrane which might provide resistance to the NM2 directed motion.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please comment, if possible, on whether exchange of fluorescent molecules between filaments occurs on a relevant timescale.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point and is something that we plan to be study this in detail. In each mixing experiments, both filament components were covalently labeled with different color HaloTags. This allows us to look at the ratio of the two colors of filaments that are moving processively along actin. We monitored the intensity of the two colors of single myosin filaments during their attachment time to actin, which can be as much as 10 min, and typically only observed gradual photobleaching of each color. Since the photobleaching rates of the two dyes were not identical, this did result in a slight change in the ratio of the two colors, but we saw no evidence where one paralog was being substituted for the other during the course of any given processive run for a single filament. This was not a great surprise to us since the free myosin concentration in our experiments is quite low. Whether there is exchange occurring in solution between myosin filaments that are unbound to actin is not relevant for our experimental set up since we are determining the myosin composition of each moving filament while quantifying its velocity and run lengths. The traces are noisy. Some of the contribution to this might be that the filaments change their orientation on actin while moving and are long compared to the depth of the TIRF field. This could result in fluctuations in intensity. We observe the occasional trace where the intensity of one color rapidly spikes, but this is probably caused by some artifact, such as two filaments approaching within the diffraction limited distance, since the spikes are large and rapid and would represent a major change in the filament composition occurring in a very short interval of time. We include this data below for the reviewers’ benefit (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We included a sentence to this effect in the second paragraph: “We did not see evidence for the filaments changing their isoform composition during an actin-attached processive run.”</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32871.044</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Each color shows the proportion of NM2-A in a given filament during a processive run.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-32871-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) A paper by Diensthuber et al., (2011) suggests that phalloidin stabilization of actin inhibits the motile properties of NM2-A, but not NM2-B. Phalloidin is used in these experiments, so the authors should address this point about possible inhibition of the motor.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewers’ request, we have performed additional experiments to study the ability of NM2-A HMM to translocate Atto-565-labeled actin, and also actin labeled with two different phalloidin derivatives, rhodamine and Alexa-Fluor-647. There was no significant difference in the rate of actin filament gliding with any of these actins. We include this data as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> and have added a sentence: “Note, that in contrast to a previous study (Diensthuber et al., 2011), we found no effect of phalloidin on the movement of actin filaments by NM2A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The Materials and methods do not reveal how the authors deal with limitation of actin filament length in calculating the run length.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript under the heading of “data analysis” we described this as follows: <italic>“</italic>NM2 filaments that reached the end of the actin filament and dissociated were excluded from the analysis.<italic>”</italic> </p><p>We now phrase it somewhat differently under the same heading: “Only myosin filaments that were observed to bind to actin, move and dissociate before reaching the end of the actin filament were included in the analysis.

We have given the standard deviation and the standard error in each figure legend for the velocity measurements, but have left the error bars for the velocity determinations in the plots as S.E.M.s. In reviewing the single molecule motility as well as the gliding actin in vitro motility literature, we have observed that most investigators present the run length error as S.E.M. and there is an increasing tendency to plot the velocity data in both types of assays with S.E.M.s as the error bars. We have also added R<sup>2</sup> values to the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, third panel: It is difficult to believe that there can be confidence in the exponential fit of these binned data.

The values were not greatly changed. We also plotted cumulative frequency distributions, but were not satisfied with the fits. The change in bin size for the third panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> did not dramatically change the value for run length, but we modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> to reflect this and received a slightly different “minimum number of heads” of 4.1 vs. 4.9. The text has been modified to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The rates of filament motility appear to be limited by the rate at which myosins detach from actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), which is at odds with the results of Brizendine et al., (2015), which suggest an attachment limited model. It would be helpful to the myosins specialists if this point was discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The Brizendine et al. (Brizendine et al., 2015) study differs from ours in several important ways. First, they were using smooth muscle myosin which makes side polar filaments and has a lower duty ratio. Second, since these filaments did not move processively on actin in the absence of methycellulose, they used this viscosity enhancing reagent in all their assays. In the experiments relative to ours (where we mixed myosin tail fragments and full length NM2-B molecules to reduce myosin motor density) we did not use methylcellulose since this reagent is not required for the motility of this myosin. As noted in our manuscript NM2-A also does not move processively in the absence of methylcellulose, but does so in its presence. We believe this is because methylcellulose effectively limits the diffusion of myosin away from the actin filament such that if the filament is transiently detached it will not diffuse sufficiently far away that another myosin motor cannot rebind to keep the myosin filament tethered to the actin filament. Thus, the NM2-A filament (or the smooth muscle myosin filament) in the presence of methylcellulose may not truly be moving “processively” through its entire “observed” run length as we and others have defined processivity for single molecule studies using two-headed myosin5 or myosin-6 constructs. This definition requires that the myosin take multiple steps on actin per diffusional encounter and assumes that the molecule diffuses away when neither of its two motors is attached to actin.</p><p>A second paper recently published from this lab (Brizendine et al. 2017) elaborated on their model and suggested that whether a filament’s motility was limited by myosin attachment or detachment would vary with the conditions and possible source of myosin. We have now referenced this paper and modified the text accordingly. We believe that determination of the limiting step for movement in motility assays and muscles is still not firmly established and merits further work. We have added new discussion on this point to the revised manuscript:</p><p>“We also found that the rate of movement of the hybrid myosin filaments on actin were not significantly affected by the number of myosin motors available. […] The observation that the rate of movement of the filaments did not vary with the number of contributing motors was consistent with a recent study which made synthetic myosin filaments mimics using DNA nanotubes where the spacing and density of myosin motor domains could be varied. (Hariadi et al., 2015).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The finding that myosin filaments can form stacks in vitro is interesting. Can the authors speculate on the mechanism by which the stacks form?</p></disp-quote><p>When unphosphorylated NM-2 forms the folded monomeric inactive conformation the two heads of the molecule make an asymmetric contact wherein the loop 2 region of one motor contacts the converter region of the other (Wendt et al., 2001) (Jung et al., 2008). This contact appears to be evolutionarily conserved across many phyla. Our speculation is that this “weak affinity” of loop 2 for the converter domain persists when the two heads become separated upon phosphorylation and that when one filament comes in close proximity to another, potentially bringing sixty myosin heads in close proximity that the cumulative attraction of these multiple weak interactions are sufficient for aligning the filaments in a stack. We have elaborated on this in the revised Discussion:</p><p>“The physical basis for forming stacks is not known. […] The fact that the stacks can disassemble suggests that the forces holding them together are not large.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Subsection “More than five NM2B motors are required for processive movement”: The authors' discussion of the duty ratio does not consider head-head gating. Although this is mentioned later in the manuscript, it is appropriate to mention that this equation does not take this process into account.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed true. Please note however, as discussed in response to question 4, our previous data strongly supports the fact that NM2-B molecules are unlikely to bind to actin via two motors of the same molecule in the presence of ATP (Nagy et al., 2013) and so the type of gating that was presented in Kovacs et al. (Kovacs et al., 2007) is unlikely to occur in these filaments. We have included a couple of sentences to explain this:</p><p>“This equation assumes that each motor is capable of interacting with actin. In the presence of ATP, NM2-B molecules only interact with actin via one motor at a time (Nagy et al., 2012) so corrections for intrahead gating as shown by Kovacs et al. (Kovacs et al., 2007) do not have to be considered.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Discussion, last two paragraphs: The wording in the paragraphs is awkward. The topic sentence of the first paragraph is: &quot;Our results raise experimental concerns in elucidating the role of NM2s in cell biological experiments.&quot; However, it is not clear from the paragraph which concerns were raised by the results. The information in the second paragraph actually seems to be more related to this sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten this passage and split it into two paragraphs to hopefully make it clearer:</p><p>“Our results suggest that relating light microscopic observations of myosin filaments in cells to their mechanical output is not trivial.
