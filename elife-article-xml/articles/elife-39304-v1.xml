pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39304.001</object-id><p>Male germ cells of all placental mammals express an ancient nuclear RNA binding protein of unknown function called RBMXL2. Here we find that deletion of the retrogene encoding RBMXL2 blocks spermatogenesis. Transcriptome analyses of age-matched deletion mice show that RBMXL2 controls splicing patterns during meiosis. In particular, RBMXL2 represses the selection of aberrant splice sites and the insertion of cryptic and premature terminal exons. Our data suggest a <italic>Rbmxl2</italic> retrogene has been conserved across mammals as part of a splicing control mechanism that is fundamentally important to germ cell biology. We propose that this mechanism is essential to meiosis because it buffers the high ambient concentrations of splicing activators, thereby preventing poisoning of key transcripts and disruption to gene expression by aberrant splice site selection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39304.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In humans and other mammals, a sperm from a male fuses with an egg cell from a female to produce an embryo that may ultimately grow into a new individual. Sperm and egg cells are made when certain cells in the body divide in a process called meiosis. Many proteins are required for meiosis to happen and these proteins are made using instructions provided by genes, which are made of a molecule called DNA.</p><p>The DNA within a gene is transcribed to make molecules of ribonucleic acid (or RNA for short). The cell then modifies many of these RNAs in a process called splicing before using them as templates to make proteins. During splicing, segments of RNA known as introns are discarded and other segments termed exons are joined together. Some exons may also be removed from RNAs in different combinations to create different proteins from the same gene.</p><p>A protein called RBMXL2 is able to bind to RNA molecules and is only made during and after meiosis in humans and most other mammals. RBMXL2 can also bind to other proteins that are known to be involved in controlling splicing of RNAs, but its role in splicing remains unclear.</p><p>To address this question, Ehrmann et al. studied the gene that encodes the RBMXL2 protein in mice. Removing this gene prevented male mice from being able to make sperm. Further experiments using a technique called RNA sequencing showed that the RBMXL2 protein helps to ensure that splicing happens correctly by preventing bits of exons and introns in mouse genes from being rearranged. These findings suggest that the gene encoding RBMXL2 is part of a splicing control mechanism that is important for making sperm and egg cells.</p><p>The work of Ehrmann et al. could eventually help some couples understand why they have problems conceiving children. Male infertility is poorly understood, and not knowing its causes can harm the mental health of affected men. Furthermore, these findings may help researchers to understand the role of a closely related protein called RBMY that has also been linked to infertility in men, but is much more difficult to study.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd><kwd>retrogene</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P006612/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ehrmann</surname><given-names>Ingrid</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yilei</given-names></name><name><surname>Elliott</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_PC_U127580973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crichton</surname><given-names>James H</given-names></name><name><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>Ian R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG AG046544</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gazzara</surname><given-names>Matthew R</given-names></name><name><surname>Barash</surname><given-names>Yoseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>089225/Z/09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elliott</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell division by meiosis during sperm production depends on expression of an RNA-binding protein that prevents abnormal RNA-processing pathways.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It has been a long recognised hallmark of mammalian gene expression patterns that there are extremely high levels of transcription and transcriptome complexity in testicular cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de la Grange et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Licatalosi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Soumillon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grosso et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yeo et al., 2004</xref>). These high gene expression levels are thought to result from epigenetic changes that favour relaxed patterns of gene expression during meiosis – the unique form of division used to generate sperm and eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Soumillon et al., 2013</xref>). Many nuclear RNA-binding proteins are differentially expressed during and immediately after meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grellscheid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmid et al., 2013</xref>). These include the nuclear RNA binding protein RBMXL2 (also known as hnRNP GT) that is expressed only during and immediately after male meiosis, but not in the preceding spermatogonial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ehrmann et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

This role remains to be identified, but RBMXL2 protein has an N-terminal RNA Recognition Motif (abbreviated RRM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). RBMX and RBMY proteins are also nuclear RNA binding proteins that are very similar to RBMXL2 (73.2% and 36.8% overall identity to RBMX and RBMY, respectively; 93.7% and 77.2% identity within the RRMs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The RNA binding specificity of RBMXL2 protein is unknown, but both RBMX and RBMY proteins bind to AA dinucleotide-containing RNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cléry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moursy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nasim et al., 2003</xref>). The RBMXL2, RBMX and RBMY proteins interact with and modulate the splicing activity of Tra2β and SR proteins in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cléry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moursy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nasim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elliott et al., 2000a</xref>), suggesting a role in splicing control. Maintaining proper ratios of mRNA splice isoforms can be critical in normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalsotra and Cooper, 2011</xref>), where changes in isoforms can have effects on encoded proteins ranging from major to subtle. Alternative splicing is known to be critical for germ cell development. For example, deletion of the splicing regulator protein PTBP2 within germ cells affects mRNA isoforms important for cell-cell communication with Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hannigan et al., 2017</xref>). Some alternative splicing events in the testis are conserved between humans and mice so may control fundamental aspects of germ cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmid et al., 2013</xref>). However many alternative splicing patterns are not conserved between humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kan et al., 2005</xref>). RBMX protein is also reported to control transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takemoto et al., 2007</xref>), affect DNA double strand repair and mitotic sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matsunaga et al., 2012</xref>), and to bind to m6A methylated RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The function of RBMXL2 and why this RNA binding protein has been conserved across placental mammals are not known. A major factor limiting understanding of endogenous RBMXL2 functions has been the absence of a reliable mouse model. Development of a mouse model is also critical to test the importance of this wider family of RNA binding proteins in germ cell development. Men carrying the <italic>AZFb</italic> deletion on their Y chromosomes are missing <italic>RBMY</italic> genes and undergo meiotic arrest. However, it is unclear if <italic>RBMY</italic> loss is causing this phenotype, because the deletion interval encompasses several other genes which could contribute to male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elliott, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vogt et al., 1996</xref>). Within the meiotic and immediately post-meiotic germ cells which express RBMXL2, the <italic>RBMX</italic> and <italic>RBMY</italic> genes are transcriptionally inactivated within a heterochromatic structure called the XY body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang, 2004</xref>). Meiosis thus provides a genetically tractable window to probe RBMXL2 function where there should be no redundancy effects possible with either RBMX or RBMY. Hence to discover what RBMXL2 does in the germline we have made a conditional <italic>Rbmxl2</italic> gene knockout mouse. Analysis of this knockout mouse reveals that RBMXL2 protein is essential for meiosis and has a major role in protecting the meiotic transcriptome from aberrant selection of cryptic splice sites that are normally ignored by the spliceosome. Our data suggest this fundamentally important process operates so efficiently in meiosis that it has been previously undetected, yet is critical to avoid male infertility caused by aberrant splicing of key meiotic transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RBMXL2 protein is essential for male fertility</title><p>To test how important RBMXL2 protein is for male germline development we made a conditional mouse model in which we flanked the <italic>Rbmxl2</italic> open reading frame with <italic>LoxP</italic> sites.

The presence of these round spermatids indicates that meiosis can occasionally complete in the absence of RBMXL2 protein. This is consistent with loss of RBMXL2 causing either (1) a developmental block in meiosis from which a few cells can escape; or alternatively (2) a slow attrition effect, in which the <italic>Rbmxl2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testis phenotype is caused by post-meiotic stages dying in the adult testis. To differentiate between these two possibilities we histologically analysed testes at 21 days postpartum (21dpp), at which point germ cells in the wild type (<italic>Rbmxl2</italic> <sup>+/+</sup>) mice have just started to enter the post-meiotic round spermatid stage. At 21dpp there were still significantly fewer round spermatids in the <italic>Rbmxl2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> sections compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), even though there would have been less time for round spermatid cell death compared with the adult.

Staining of nuclear spreads with antibodies specific to the meiotic chromosome proteins SYCP1 and SYCP3 more precisely showed that <italic>Rbmxl2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice arrest germ cell development during the diplotene substage of meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Asynapsis was rarely observed in either control or mutant pachytene stage spermatocytes, indicating that the defect causing diplotene arrest does not significantly impact either synaptonemal complex formation or meiotic homology searching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4E</xref>) (N = 3, 109 and 94 nuclei scored for wild type and <italic>Rbmxl2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> respectively).</p><p>In summary, the above mouse phenotype showed that deletion of the ancient RNA binding protein RBMXL2 induces progressive defects in male mouse meiotic prophase.

To test this we analysed wild type and <italic>Rbmxl2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testes using RNAseq. Based on the knockout phenotype above, and because the adult wild type testis contains additional more advanced germ cells that are missing from the adult <italic>Rbmxl2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testis, we analysed testes at 18 days post partum (18dpp) during the first synchronised wave of mouse spermatogenesis. Such 18dpp wild type mouse testes contain germ cells between spermatogonia all the way through to diplotene, with 60% of cells engaged in meiotic prophase, but no post-meiotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellvé et al., 1977</xref>).</p><p>Gene expression analysis of this RNAseq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>) showed overall patterns of transcription were similar between wild type and <italic>Rbmxl2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> 18dpp testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

This is consistent with RBMXL2 regulating splicing of a functionally diverse group of genes. Analysis of knockout phenotypes provided by the MGD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 2018</xref>) indicated that whole gene deletion of 25/186 RBMXL2-regulated genes cause male infertility. These latter target genes must thus have a key role in germ cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata6">Figure 3—source data 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7</xref>). Genetic deletion of some other RBMXL2 target genes cause either embryonic or neonatal lethality (33/186 genes), developmental (19/36 genes) or pleiotropic defects (43/186 genes). Cell type mis-splicing of these latter genes during meiosis could thus cause severe phenotypic effects on germ cell biology.</p><p>Fourteen (33%) of the genes originally identified to have changed overall expression levels between wild type and <italic>Rbmxl2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testes also changed splicing patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source datas 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">3</xref>). These included splice variants in <italic>Esco1</italic> (encoding a protein involved in chromatid cohesion), <italic>Slc39a8</italic> (that encodes the transporter protein responsible for cadmium toxicity in the testis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dalton et al., 2005</xref>); and the <italic>Slc9c1</italic> gene (annotated on the MGD as essential for male fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 2018</xref>]).</p><p>The RNA binding specificity of RBMXL2 protein was unknown. Thus we used high throughput sequencing cross linking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) to enable us to correlate splicing changes detected within the <italic>Rbmxl2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> 18dpp mouse testis with global RBMXL2 protein-RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grellscheid et al., 2011</xref>). Antibodies specific to mouse RBMXL2 immuno-precipitated a radiolabelled RNA protein adduct of the known size of RBMXL2 protein (50 KDa) after treatment with high concentrations of RNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elliott et al., 2000b</xref>). Lower concentrations of RNase were used to retrieve an average tag length of 40 nucleotides. Enriched motif analysis of the sequenced RBMXL2 CLIP tags showed that each of the top 10 5-mers contained the dinucleotide AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, AA is also the dinucleotide bound by RBMX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moursy et al., 2014</xref>), which is consistent with over 90% shared sequence identity within the RRMs of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These intragenic cross-linked sites mapped to the mouse genome most frequently within introns, consistent with RBMXL2 being involved in nuclear RNA-processing events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Next we searched for CLIP tags mapping to regions near the splicing events controlled by RBMXL2, which would suggest direct regulation. We observed enrichment of RBMXL2 binding both within alternative exon sequences and in regions proximal to regulated splice sites compared to non-regulated events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Consistent with these enriched binding occurrences, motif maps of the top pentamers identified by CLIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) showed regions of enrichment proximal to regulated versus non-regulated splice junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>RBMXL2 protein represses splicing of exons that would compromise meiotic gene expression</title><p>Overall, the above bioinformatics analysis indicated an accumulation of defective splice isoform patterns in the <italic>Rbmxl2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testis. MAJIQ captures local splicing variations (LSVs) that involve both known and un-annotated (de-novo) splice sites, junctions and exons. These LSVs can correspond to both classical binary splicing events and more complex events involving three or more junctions. Since classical binary events (e.g. skipped exons) are easier to inspect and visualise with the RNAseq reads on the UCSC genome browser, we focused on the binary events for further investigation. This showed that 60% of the 87 most easily visualised classical splicing events controlled by RBMXL2 involve the altered selection of de-novo splice sites (defined as not currently annotated on the most recent build of the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> genome GRCm38/mm10, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). These de-novo splicing variations controlled by RBMXL2 are putatively cryptic events as they insert novel internal exons that were flanked by consensus GT-AG 5' and 3' splice sites. Moreover, these de-novo splice sites showed low expected percent spliced in (E(PSI)) values in wild type 18 dpp testes and across a panel of twelve mouse tissues, further suggesting they are cryptic events only included in the absence of RBMXL2 and not in wild type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Detailed investigation indicated 84% of such cryptic exons were either not multiples of three or introduced stop codons into their mRNAs, meaning their insertion into mRNAs would disrupt protein reading frames and interfere with meiotic protein expression.</p><p>Splicing inclusion of cryptic terminal exons could also severely impact patterns of meiotic gene expression. We detected high inclusion of a cryptic terminal exon within the 5′ UTR of the <italic>Kdm4d</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, note also increased splicing of an already annotated upstream <italic>Kdm4d</italic> alternative exon within the <italic>Rbmxl2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testis).

Exon two contains the entire CDS (Coding DNA Sequence, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) of the <italic>Kdm4d</italic> gene. Analysis of exon junction read numbers using Sashimi plots confirmed different nuclear processing pathways are used for <italic>Kdm4d</italic> in wild type and knockout testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). There were 14-fold more exon junction reads connecting <italic>Kdm4d</italic> exon one to the cryptic exon (140 reads), when compared to exon junction reads joining the cryptic exon to <italic>Kdm4d</italic> coding exon 2. This pattern is consistent with splicing inclusion of the cryptic exon being connected with use of an associated polyA site. Consistent with this, some individual RNAseq reads extended past the 5′ splice site of the <italic>Kdm4d</italic> cryptic exon and then terminated downstream following a consensus polyadenylation site (AATAAA) sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Ectopic activation by Tra2β indicated that although this <italic>Kdm4d</italic> exon cryptic exon is effectively ignored by the spliceosome in wild type testis, cryptic exon splicing is activated in response to increased expression of a splicing activator protein. Importantly, splicing activation by Tra2β was efficiently supressed when the minigene was co-transfected at the same time with both RBMXL2 and Tra2β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 5 and 6).</p><p>We addressed if other cryptic exons repressed by RBMXL2 might also possess the capacity to be activated by splicing regulators that bind to their associated splicing enhancer sequences.

Our data further show that RBMXL2 protein is important to protect the meiotic transcriptome from a spectrum of splicing defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). These include classic manifestations of cryptic splicing that would be strongly deleterious to gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marquez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sibley et al., 2016</xref>), such as insertion of novel cryptic exons and premature polyadenylation sites that would disrupt protein coding sequences, and the selection of cryptic splice sites that would shorten or extend exon lengths. Previous work reporting poor conservation of splicing patterns between species suggested that alternative splicing might not control fundamental aspects of germ cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kan et al., 2005</xref>).

Direct RNA protein interactions of RBMXL2 with important splicing regulatory sequences in the pre-mRNA.

In silico data suggest that the cryptic exons repressed by RBMXL2 would be poised for splicing inclusion in conditions of high concentrations of splicing activators because of their strong ESE contents. We suggest a model where RBMXL2 protein may buffer the activity of splicing activator proteins to prevent such cryptic splice site selection from happening in meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This model is also consistent with previously reported data showing that RBMXL2, RBMX and RBMY proteins physically interact with and antagonise the splicing activity of Tra2β and SR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nasim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Venables et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elliott et al., 2000a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Data presented in this study also show that <italic>Kdm4d</italic> cryptic exon splicing activation by Tra2β is blocked in vitro by co-expression of RBMXL2. As an alternative and not mutually exclusive model, RBMXL2 protein-RNA binding may sterically block recognition of some cryptic splice sites during meiosis, including the cryptic 5′ splice site within <italic>Meioc</italic> exon five which was utilised in the <italic>Rbmxl2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>). However, no HITS-CLIP tags for RBMXL2 were detected near the <italic>Kdm4d</italic> cryptic exon. Furthermore, a version of RBMXL2 deleted for the key RNP1 motif involved in RNA-protein interactions could still repress <italic>Kdm4d</italic> cryptic exon splicing (albeit slightly less efficiently than the wild type RBMXL2 protein). Thus buffering protein interactions between RBMXL2 and proteins like Tra2β may be potentially more important in repressing cryptic splicing in meiosis than direct RBMXL2 RNA-protein interactions.</p><p>Loss of RBMXL2 disrupts expression of many downstream target genes in parallel, both at splicing and transcriptional levels. This makes it difficult to resolve whether the phenotype detected in the <italic>Rbmxl2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse testes is caused by aberrant expression of a single target RNA, or is a compound phenotype involving multiple genes. Some genes affected by RBMXL2 protein deletion are annotated as important for spermatogenesis on the MGD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). These include <italic>Alms1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arsov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collin et al., 2005</xref>); <italic>Brca2</italic> which is required for meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharan et al., 2004</xref>); <italic>Kdm4d</italic>, which helps control apoptosis during male germ cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iwamori et al., 2011</xref>); and <italic>Cul4a</italic> that encodes an important ubiquitin ligase needed for DNA damage response. Two factors complicate direct comparison of MGD phenotypes with those after RBMXL2 knockout. Firstly, conventional knockouts will report a phenotype the first time a gene is needed in a developmental pathway. In contrast RBMXL2 is only expressed from the onset of meiosis, so any defects in target gene expression that occur without RBMXL2 could result in a later phenotype. For example, <italic>Meioc</italic> knockout phenotype analysis has concentrated on entry into meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abby et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Soh et al., 2017</xref>). Our data show that <italic>Meioc</italic> exon five is still spliced normally on meiotic entry in the <italic>Rbmxl2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse (at 12dpp), but becomes compromised later on during meiotic prophase (when RBMXL2 is expressed). It is possible that <italic>Rbmx</italic> and <italic>Rbmy</italic> will provide an equivalent function to <italic>Rbmxl2</italic> in spermatogonia and early spermatocytes, and that it is only when meiotic sex chromosome inactivation initiates during pachytene that germ cells will depend on <italic>Rbmxl2</italic>. Consistent with this, in transfected cells RBMX was able to suppress a cryptic splice exon in the <italic>Kdm4d</italic> with similar efficiency to the RBMXL2 protein. Secondly, the MGD phenotype data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 2018</xref>) is after gene knockout, whereas Rbmxl2 deletion changes patterns of splice isoforms.</p><p>High levels of gene expression and alternative splicing have also been observed in the nervous system, and this is another anatomic site where pathological cryptic exon inclusion has been reported. Neuronal cryptic exon inclusion occurs following depletion of the splicing repressor protein TDP43, and might contribute to neuron death in neurological diseases like ALS and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). Cryptic splicing has also been observed in cultured human cells after depletion of the splicing repressor proteins hnRNP C, hnRNPL and PTB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ling et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McClory et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zarnack et al., 2013</xref>), and in mouse oocytes depleted for the splicing factor SRSF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Do et al., 2018</xref>). Taking all these results into consideration we suggest that RBMXL2 has a key role controlling the meiotic transcriptome, and suggest that human male infertility caused by loss of <italic>RBMXL2</italic> or its paralog RBMY may be associated with germ cell type-specific cryptic splicing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (M. musculus)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Rbmxl2</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(M. musculus)</td><td valign="top">C57Bl/6</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(M. musculus)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Rbmxl2</italic> knockout</td><td valign="top">this publication</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(M. musculus)</td><td valign="top">FlpE</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodríguez et al., 2000</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(M. musculus)</td><td valign="top">PGKcre</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lallemand et al., 1998</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (H. sapiens)</td><td valign="top">HEK293</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Sheep polyclonal <break/>anti-Rbmxl2</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ehrmann et al.

A thin band at the size of 65 kDa (RBMXL2 migrates at around 50 kDa and MW of 50 nt RNA is about 15 kDa) was cut out and subject to protein digestion. RNA was recovered and subject to Illumina sequencing, and the reads were aligned to the mouse genome. HITS-CLIP tags mapped to 22,438 protein coding genes. HITS-CLIP data were further analysed to extract most frequently occurring pentamer nucleotide sequences within genes (ncRNA, ORF, 3’UTR, 5’UTR and intron).

What follows is the editors’ letter requesting such plan.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;An ancient germ cell-specific RNA binding protein protects the germline from cryptic splice site poisoning&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>In this manuscript, Ehrmann and colleagues characterize the germ cell-specific RNA binding protein hnRNP GT. The authors generated a conditional knockout mouse targeting hnRNP GT, and demonstrate significant defects in testis histology and spermatogenesis in mutant animals. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that defects in knockout animals likely stem from problems during a specific stage of meiosis. Given the observed phenotypes, transcriptome-wide analysis is performed looking both at steady-state mRNA levels as well as splicing patterns. The authors find both transcript-level and splicing-level differences between wild type and mutants, but their data suggest more prevalent defects in the latter layer of gene regulation. In particular, in addition to aberrant regulation of annotated alternative exons, the authors identify a more significant proportion of 'cryptic'/minor splice sites being utilized in mutant animals, and the use of these splice sites are predicted to have deleterious effects on encoded protein products. Additional experiments include HITS-CLIP assays that determine the sequence binding preference of hnRNP GT (motifs with AA dinucleotides) and information about direct targets of this RNA binding protein. Finally, the authors show in cell lines that over-expression of hnRNP GT has the ability to suppress usage of a cryptic splice site, even in the context of co-expression of the activating SR protein Tra2β.</p><p>Overall, this is a carefully conducted investigation that should be of considerable interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic> after suitable revision. It is requested that authors provide a proposed plan for revisions that can be performed within approximately two months, based on the comments below. In particular, it was felt that the paper would be significantly strengthened by the inclusion of additional data supporting functional roles for the isoforms highlighted by the authors, and in this regard their plan should pay special attention to point 3 below. It was also felt that the section of the paper relating to functional consequences of isoform switches could be better focused and the authors should make an effort to revise this section accordingly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “hnRNP GT protein controls splicing patterns during meiosis”. The manuscript states that 23 of 27 tested splicing events were validated, citing Source Data 3. But this file has no data – only has a list of primers used for RT-PCR. It would be appropriate to include the results of the RT-PCR – as PSI (mean {plus minus} sd) for WT and KO conditions, and to define how an event was defined as validated. Did validation only require a statistically significant change in the same direction as for RNA-Seq? Ideally show the RT-PCR values alongside the MAJIQ values for PSI.</p><p>The RT-PCR examples shown in Figure 4B, Figure 5B and Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,B, look convincing and do not need quantitation to be convincing. Nevertheless, it would be good to show the PSI numbers to allow direct comparison with the MAJIQ output.</p><p>2) Many genes are identified with differences in overall transcript abundance and/or changes in alternatively spliced isoforms. The authors largely ignore the 45 genes identified with differences in RNA level between WT and KO testis. The authors should comment on these genes and provide information on what the encoded proteins do, and how changes in their levels (caused by hnRNP GT KO) might contribute to the meiotic defects observed.</p><p>3) The analysis of alternative splicing changes is not explored in sufficient depth to provide insight into why KO germ cells arrest in meiosis. The authors focus on select examples of genes previously shown to be important for spermatogenesis and that also express alternatively spliced mRNAs in KO compared to WT testes. While these genes may be required for different aspects of spermatogenesis, the authors manuscript would be significantly strengthened if they can provide any evidence that the splicing changes induced by hnRNP GT loss negatively impact gene functions.</p><p>In this regard, the authors claim that &quot;…insertion of this Kdm4d cryptic exon disables Kdm4d gene expression&quot;, citing the reduced read density on Kdm4d exon 2 shown in Figure 4A. I was not convinced that the splicing of the cryptic exon 'disables… gene expression' for the following reasons. First, clearly there are reads mapping to the exon2 indicating that full length transcripts are being produced. Second, because of the different scales used in the top and bottom RPKM tracks, it is difficult to state unequivocally that there is an appreciable difference in read density on exon 2. Third, Kdm4d should be in the list of 45 genes with reduced RNA levels (it is not in Figure 3—source data 1). Fourth, there is no western blot data showing that Kdm4d levels are reduced in KO testes. As it stands, the RT-PCR analysis of Kdm4d (primers in exon 1 and 2) is not adequate given the argument that polyadenylation at the cryptic exon primarily leads to truncation of transcripts. The authors should perform qRT-PCR to confirm decreased levels of the conventional transcript and ideally a western blot to show reduced protein expression.</p><p>The second example that is presented is alternative splicing of 3' terminal exons in Lrrcc1. The authors note that Lrrcc1 &quot;is essential for mouse fertility (Figure 4D&quot; but do not reference the publication. Do Lrrcc1 mutants have the same meiotic defect as hnRNP GT KO mice? In Figure 5, the authors describe changes in mRNA isoforms from the Meioc gene caused by activation of cryptic 3' and 5' splice sites. The authors spend a considerable amount of time carefully characterizing the splicing changes in Meioc mRNAs, but then ultimately indicate that &quot;Consistent with the RNAseq data, expression levels of this full length Meioc protein did not change in the knockout (Figure 5D).&quot; So again, I am left questioning whether the splicing in Meioc in hnRNP GT KO are functionally relevant and have any contribution to the hnRNP GT phenotype.</p><p>In light of these concerns it would greatly strengthen the authors' manuscript if they can provide data that more strongly support roles for the aforementioned (or other splicing changes) in the phenotypes observed in their hnRNP GT ko mice.</p><p>4) Whereas the RNAseq libraries are described in detail (ages, number of replicates, etc), there is scant information on the CLIP data. The authors are requested to add information on the age of samples, how many replicate tissues were used, how was the data processed and analyzed, how many genes have binding. It should also be mentioned how high-confidence binding sites were discriminated from experimental noise. Also, while AA-dinucleotides may be present in the top 10 pentamers, the quality of the CLIP information is unclear.</p><p>5) RNA binding maps representing different classes of splicing event would enhance the presentation of the CLIP analysis. For example, it would be interesting to see how hnRNP GT binding correlates with regulatory outcome from the RNA-seq analysis both for cryptic splice sites and for canonical types of alternative splicing like exon skipping events. Are similar features observed regarding mode of binding and regulation?</p><p>6) In Figure 6, the authors describe analysis of a minigene splicing reporter bearing the Kdm4d cryptic exon. A schematic of the minigene should be included in the Figure. The data shows that the cryptic exon is spliced in ~40% of reporter transcripts expressed in HEK293, and inclusion of the exon decreases significantly when hnRNP GT is expressed. A direct role for hnRNP GT in repressing the cryptic exon should be demonstrated by showing that mutation of AA dinucleotides abolishes hnRNP GT's ability to repress splicing (or bind the transcript).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>hnRNP GT is a mammalian autosomal paralog of RBMX and RBMY that is expressed during spermatogenesis when RBMX and RBMY are switched off. Its importance in spermatogenesis is indicated by mutations associated with male infertility.</p><p>In this manuscript David Elliott and colleagues use a mouse hnRNPGT conditional knockout model. As anticipated a very specific spermatogeneis phenotype was observed within exactly the time-window when hnRNPGT, but not RBMX or RBMY, is expressed. After careful and systematic phenotyping, testis mRNA-Seq was carried out at timepoint when the primary defect caused by hnRNPGT knockout could be observed (at later timepoints, the different cell-type compositions resulting from the initial phenotype would have dominated the signal). This showed that hnRNPGT deletion led to a large number of alternative splicing changes, with a strong enrichment for non-annotated (ie cryptic) events. The majority of cases would lead to down-regulated protein expression/activity, suggesting a compound phenotype arising from reduced expression of numerous proteins that are important during meiosis.</p><p>Overall, this is a carefully conducted investigation, clearly presented, which should be of interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Subsection “hnRNP GT protein controls splicing patterns during meiosis”..

Nevertheless, it would be good to show the PSI numbers to allow direct comparison with the MAJIQ output.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this report, Ehrmann et al., examine the functions of the RNA binding protein hnRNP GT in spermatogenesis. This protein is highly conserved across ~65 million years of evolution, is expressed during the meiotic and post-meiotic steps of spermatogenesis, and its’ in vivo roles have remained poorly understood.</p><p>The authors demonstrate that deletion of the hnRNP GT results in a major arrest of germ cell development during prophase of meiosis, with very few cells surviving to the post-meiotic (spermatid) stage. More detailed analyses indicate that most germ cells lacking hnRNP GT arrest at the diplotene stage of meiotic prophase. Experiments characterizing the phenotype of hnRNP GT knockout mice (KO) are well executed and interpreted reasonably.</p><p>To understand what gene expression events are altered in the absence of hnRNP GT, the authors perform RNA-Seq analysis on biologic triplicate testes from wild type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice collected at postnatal day 18. In contrast to the phenotypic analyses, I was disappointed with the RNA analyses described in the paper, as well as the authors' interpretation of the data.</p><p>1) Many genes are identified with differences in overall transcript abundance and/or changes in alternatively spliced isoforms. The authors largely ignore the 45 genes identified with differences in RNA level between WT and KO testis. There is no rationale presented for doing so. There are no descriptions of what the encoded proteins do, and how changes in their levels (caused by hnRNP GT KO) might contribute to the meiotic defects observed. Instead, the authors end this section rather abruptly and move on to the analysis of splicing changes. Why are these gene expression changes dismissed? This was somewhat surprising given that the authors mention (in the introduction) a role for RBMX in controlling transcription patterns.</p><p>2) Similarly, the analysis of alternative splicing changes are not explored in sufficient depth to provide new insight into why KO germ cells arrest in meiosis. Instead, the authors focus on the presentation of select examples of genes previously shown to be important for spermatogenesis and that also express alternatively spliced mRNAs in KO compared to WT testes. While these genes may be required for different aspects of spermatogenesis, there is no data presented to show that the splicing changes induced by hnRNP GT loss negatively impact gene functions.</p><p>The first of the examples presented is Kdm4d, in which loss of hnRNP GT results in splicing of a cryptic exon. The authors claim that &quot;…insertion of this Kdm4d cryptic exon disables Kdm4d gene expression&quot;, citing the reduced read density on Kdm4d exon 2 shown in Figure 4A. I was not convinced that the splicing of the cryptic exon 'disables… gene expression' for the following reasons. First, clearly there are reads mapping to the exon2 indicating that full length transcripts are being produced. Second, because of the different scales used in the top and bottom RPKM tracks, it is difficult to state unequivocally that there is an appreciable difference in read density on exon 2. Third, Kdm4d should be in the list of 45 genes with reduced RNA levels (it is not in Figure 3<italic>—</italic>source data 1). Fourth, there is no western blot data showing that Kdm4d levels are reduced in KO testes.</p><p>The second example that is presented is alternative splicing of 3' terminal exons in Lrrcc1. The authors note that Lrrcc1 &quot;is essential for mouse fertility (Figure 4D&quot; but do not reference the publication. Do Lrrcc1 mutants have the same meiotic defect as hnRNP GT KO mice? The magnitude of the splicing change in Lrrcc1 is modest, as most AS changes tend to be. I'm not criticizing the authors for this, but unless the authors can show that this splicing change impacts Lrrcc1 function or germ cell progression through prophase, I am left shrugging my shoulders. The same can be said for references to Slc39a8.</p><p>In Figure 5, the authors describe changes in mRNA isoforms from the Meioc gene caused by activation of cryptic 3' and 5' splice sites. The authors spend a considerable amount of time carefully characterizing the splicing changes in Meioc mRNAs, but then ultimately indicate that &quot;Consistent with the RNAseq data, expression levels of this full length Meioc protein did not change in the knockout (Figure 5D).&quot; So again, I am left questioning whether the splicing in Meioc in hnRNP GT KO are functionally relevant and have any contribution to the hnRNP GT phenotype.</p><p>To conclude point 2, unless the authors can show that the highlighted splicing examples shown are biologically important and contribute to the hnRNP GT phenotype, the significance is doubted, particularly for Meioc, whose protein levels are reportedly unaltered.</p><p>3) Whereas the RNAseq libraries are described in detail (ages, number of replicates, etc), there is scant information on the CLIP data. What age was this performed on, how many replicate tissues, how was the data processed and analyzed, how many genes have binding? There is no mention of how high-confidence binding sites are discriminated from experimental noise. Thus, while AA-dinucleotides may be present in the top 10 pentamers, the quality of the CLIP information is unclear.</p><p>4) In Figure 6, the authors describe analysis of a minigene splicing reporter bearing the Kdm4d cryptic exon. A schematic of the minigene should be included in the Figure. The data shows that the cryptic exon is spliced in ~40% of reporter transcripts expressed in HEK293, and inclusion of the exon decreases significantly when hnRNP GT is expressed. A direct role for hnRNP GT in repressing the cryptic exon should be demonstrated by showing that mutation of AA dinucleotides abolishes hnRNP GT's ability to repress splicing (or bind the transcript).</p><p>5) The authors claim that hnRNP GT has a major role in protecting the meiotic transcriptome from aberrant selection of cryptic splice sites that are normally ignored by the spliceosome. While this may be a role, it's not clear that it is a major role. My reservation comes from the way in which these splicing events were selected. The authors state that &quot;60% of the 87 most clearly visualized classical splicing events controlled by hnRNP GT involved the altered selection of cryptic splice sites.&quot; What is a 'clearly visualized' splicing event? 60% of 87 is 52, meaning that 52/237 splicing events (or 22% total) are cryptic splicing events.</p><p>6) &quot;the poor conservation of splicing patterns between species has previously suggested alternative splicing might not have a major role in controlling fundamental aspects of germ cell biology (Kan et al., 2005).&quot; The referenced paper compares human and mouse splicing across tissues. Besides meiosis, there are considerable differences in the mitotic and post-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis between human and mouse. Furthermore, several labs, including the corresponding author's, have provided strong evidence indicating important roles for regulated alternative splicing events in germ cell development. The authors should reference these studies.</p><p>In summary, Ehrmann and colleagues demonstrate that hnRNP GT is required for sperm formation, and hnRNP GT loss is associated with changes in RNA levels and alternatively spliced isoforms. However, the data is not explored in sufficient depth to link these two main observations, nor does it provide information on the mechanism(s) by which hnRNP GT functions on different RNAs. As a result, the data does not break new ground and the manuscript is not likely to appeal to the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Ehrmann and colleagues characterize the germ cell-specific RNA binding protein hnRNP GT. The authors generated a conditional knockout mouse targeting hnRNP GT, and demonstrate significant defects in testis histology and spermatogenesis in mutant animals. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that defects in knockout animals likely stem from problems during a specific stage of meiosis. Given the observed phenotypes, transcriptome-wide analysis is performed looking both at steady-state mRNA levels as well as splicing patterns. The authors find both transcript-level and splicing-level differences between wild type and mutants, but their data suggest more prevalent defects in the latter layer of gene regulation. In particular, in addition to aberrant regulation of annotated alternative exons, the authors identify a more significant proportion of cryptic splice sites being utilized in mutant animals, and the use of these splice sites are predicted to have deleterious effects on encoded protein products. Additional experiments include HITS-CLIP assays that determine the sequence binding preference of hnRNP GT (motifs with AA dinucleotides) and information about direct targets of this RNA binding protein. Finally, the authors show in cell lines that over-expression of hnRNP GT has the ability to suppress usage of a cryptic splice site, even in the context of co-expression of the activating SR protein Tra2β.</p><p>Overall, I found the study very interesting and well executed, with very clean results and convincing phenotypes. It remains an important goal for continued characterization of RNA binding proteins in tissue- and context-specific alternative splicing, and relative to other tissues like the nervous system and muscle cells, there is comparatively little known about germ cell regulators of splicing.</p><p>I have only a few points that would be nice to see addressed by the authors:</p><p>1) The authors indicate that hnRNP GT, RBMX and RBMY are paralogs. It would be nice to see a sequence alignment of all three proteins from various species to better visualize this. For example, what type of conservation is observed over relevant domains in the three RNA binding proteins?</p><p>2) RNA maps would be nice to include as part of the CLIP analysis, perhaps separated by class of splicing event. For example, it would be interesting to see how hnRNP GT binding correlates with regulatory outcome from the RNA-seq analysis both for cryptic splice sites and for canonical types of alternative splicing like exon skipping events. Are similar features observed regarding mode of binding and regulation?</p><p>3) Should all of the 'cryptic' splice sites really be annotated as 'cryptic'? This is perhaps more about semantics, but it sounds like the authors define cryptic splice sites as anything that is not annotated in the mm10 gene annotations. However, most RNA-seq data (even from wild type animals) will identify novel junctions often not documented in existing annotations on databases (especially tissue-specific isoforms which are often functional).</p><p>Perhaps this is just a matter of semantics, but in my opinion, cryptic splicing would involve novel splice sites that are never detected in wild type animals, as opposed to minor isoforms that are still found in wild type animals.</p><p>Some clarification from the authors would be nice regarding this point regardless of what they decide to call these variants. Specifically, are the majority of the cryptic events they detect in mutants completely absent in wild type animals, or are they detectable in wild type, just at low abundance?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39304.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ notes: the authors’ response after being formally invited to submit a revised submission follows.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this manuscript, Ehrmann and colleagues characterize the germ cell-specific RNA binding protein hnRNP GT.

It is requested that authors provide a proposed plan for revisions that can be performed within approximately two months, based on the comments below. In particular, it was felt that the paper would be significantly strengthened by the inclusion of additional data supporting functional roles for the isoforms highlighted by the authors, and in this regard their plan should pay special attention to point 3 below. It was also felt that the section of the paper relating to functional consequences of isoform switches could be better focused and the authors should make an effort to revise this section accordingly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “hnRNP GT protein controls splicing patterns during meiosis”. The manuscript states that 23 of 27 tested splicing events were validated, citing Source Data 3. But this file has no data – only has a list of primers used for RT-PCR. It would be appropriate to include the results of the RT-PCR – as PSI (mean {plus minus} sd) for WT and KO conditions, and to define how an event was defined as validated. Did validation only require a statistically significant change in the same direction as for RNA-Seq? Ideally show the RT-PCR values alongside the MAJIQ values for PSI.</p><p>The RT-PCR examples shown in Figure 4B, Figure 5B and Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,B, look convincing and do not need quantitation to be convincing. Nevertheless, it would be good to show the PSI numbers to allow direct comparison with the MAJIQ output.</p></disp-quote><p>Good suggestion, we added this data to the paper as an extra column to Figure 3<italic>—</italic>source data 4, so it is right next to the primers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Many genes are identified with differences in overall transcript abundance and/or changes in alternatively spliced isoforms. The authors largely ignore the 45 genes identified with differences in RNA level between WT and KO testis. The authors should comment on these genes and provide information on what the encoded proteins do, and how changes in their levels (caused by hnRNP GT KO) might contribute to the meiotic defects observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We now add this extra information and discuss the transcriptional changes in the text as requested. There are some interesting genes in the list of transcriptional changes. These include Cul4a, constitutive knockout of which causes a meiotic phenotype, and Fsip2 which encodes a component of the sperm midpiece. We also added qPCR analysis here to confirm gene expression changes of Fsip2 (new Figure 3<italic>—</italic>figure supplement 1). We agree with the reviewer that addition of this extra material makes our analysis much more complete. We also discuss how constitutive knockouts of genes needed in late meiosis may arrest at earlier stages in germ cell development if they are also needed earlier. This means that later stages will be invisible in terms of the knockout phenotype (please see also below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The analysis of alternative splicing changes is not explored in sufficient depth to provide insight into why KO germ cells arrest in meiosis. The authors focus on select examples of genes previously shown to be important for spermatogenesis and that also express alternatively spliced mRNAs in KO compared to WT testes. While these genes may be required for different aspects of spermatogenesis, the authors manuscript would be significantly strengthened if they can provide any evidence that the splicing changes induced by hnRNP GT loss negatively impact gene functions.</p><p>In this regard, the authors claim that &quot;…insertion of this Kdm4d cryptic exon disables Kdm4d gene expression&quot;, citing the reduced read density on Kdm4d exon 2 shown in Figure 4A. I was not convinced that the splicing of the cryptic exon 'disables… gene expression' for the following reasons. First, clearly there are reads mapping to the exon2 indicating that full length transcripts are being produced. Second, because of the different scales used in the top and bottom RPKM tracks, it is difficult to state unequivocally that there is an appreciable difference in read density on exon 2. Third, Kdm4d should be in the list of 45 genes with reduced RNA levels (it is not in Figure 3—source data 1). Fourth, there is no western blot data showing that Kdm4d levels are reduced in KO testes. As it stands, the RT-PCR analysis of Kdm4d (primers in exon 1 and 2) is not adequate given the argument that polyadenylation at the cryptic exon primarily leads to truncation of transcripts. The authors should perform qRT-PCR to confirm decreased levels of the conventional transcript and ideally a western blot to show reduced protein expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that from just the UCSC screenshot originally shown (Figure 4 in the manuscript) that this Kdm4d cryptic exon does not stand out as a terminal exon. We also carried out more detailed analysis of junction reads. This supports our interpretations, and we now incorporate this extra data into</p><p>the manuscript (in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 2). In the Sashimi plot</p><p>(Figure 4—figure supplement 2A), all wild type junction reads (71) join directly exon 1 to exon 2 (wild type sample shown in red, knockout sample shown in blue, and the Kdm4d gene reads from right to left). In contrast, the knockout sample shows a more complex pattern across the first intron. Importantly, almost all the reads terminate at the cryptic exon. There are 140 reads joining exon 1 to the cryptic exon. Only 10 junction reads join the cryptic exon to exon 2. Although we only show data for one knockout and one wild type mouse on the Sashimi plot, we saw the same patterns for exon junction reads for each of the knockout mice and wild type mice. The most straightforward conclusion to this exon junction read pattern is that the Kdm4d cryptic exon operates as a terminal exon.</p><p>In our expression analysis shown in Figure 3A, Kdm4d shows a log2 fold change in expression of -0.96 with a p value of 0.00048, but the padj value is 0.129 so this did not qualify for significance. We now provide the full table of expression levels between wild type and knockout for all genes as source data (see new Figure 3<italic>—</italic>source data 1). The lack of statistical significance is because of biological variability between mice. We also tested expression of Kdm4d exon 2 using qPCR. A decrease in Kdm4d exon 2 expression was detected across all knockout compared to wild type mice (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2B). Similar to the DESeq analysis this did not reach statistical significance, but it illustrates that the trend was the same in all 3 knockout mice.</p><p>Published antibodies raised against mouse Meioc enabled us to detect a shorter</p><p>protein isoform only in the knockout and not in the wild type or heterozygote (see also below). However, there is in general lack of validated antibodies against the mouse proteins that we would like to investigate. There is an Abcam antibody reported to react with mouse Kdm4d, but the single paper that used it does not show a Western of Kdm4d protein. We proposed in our action plan to obtain a new commercial (Proteintech) antibody specific for BRCA2 that is predicted to recognize mouse BRCA2 protein (384KDa). We tested this antibody by Western, but it mainly detected proteins of 250KDa and 70KDa even in wild type testis - much smaller than that corresponding to the expected size of full length BRCA2 protein. These data raise questions about the specificity of this antibody in mice, so we have not included this data in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second example that is presented is alternative splicing of 3' terminal exons in Lrrcc1. The authors note that Lrrcc1 &quot;is essential for mouse fertility (Figure 4D&quot; but do not reference the publication. Do Lrrcc1 mutants have the same meiotic defect as hnRNP GT KO mice?</p></disp-quote><p>In our updated manuscript we have made it clearer how we accessed the MGI and IMPC phenotypes, by referring to the Mouse Genome Database. For example, Lrrcc1 has a male infertile phenotype from the mouse knockout project (http://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/Gene/Phenotype?db=core;g=ENSMUSG00 000027550;r=3:14533788-14572658). We cite the Smith el al., 2018. This paper is about the database which we used to get the information, not specifically about just Lrrcc1 itself. We also made it clearer in our revised text that (1) the testis phenotype characterisation available for gene knockouts available via MGI and IMKP are not as detailed as we have performed for Hnrnpgt, so it is difficult to side by side compare them; and that (2) because of its expression profile, Hnrnpgt is likely to be most important for control of its target genes well after meiotic prophase has started –even if these target genes are also expressed earlier in germ cell development. In contrast, the mouse knockout phenotypes reported at MGD are often constitutive knockouts, so will arrest germ cell development the first time that the target gene is needed –often earlier than late prophase. For example, the phenotype of the constitutive Meioc knockout mouse has focussed on meiotic entry, well before late meiotic prophase when the Hnrnpgt KO mouse has a phenotype. So while Meioc is needed early in meiosis, a later role in meiosis is currently been invisible within the Meioc knockout mouse. Hence the published constitutive knockout does not tell us how impairing the function of Meioc during late pachytene would affect spermatogenesis. We also discuss the possibility that Rbmx and Rbmy could provide an equivalent function to Hnrnpgt that operates in spermatogonia and early spermatocytes, and that it is only when meiotic sex chromosome inactivation kicks in during pachytene that any critical non-redundant functions of Hnrnpgt will become apparent. We tested RBMX protein control of the Kdm4d cryptic exon in our revised Figure 6B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 5, the authors describe changes in mRNA isoforms from the Meioc gene caused by activation of cryptic 3' and 5' splice sites. The authors spend a considerable amount of time carefully characterizing the splicing changes in Meioc mRNAs, but then ultimately indicate that &quot;Consistent with the RNAseq data, expression levels of this full length Meioc protein did not change in the knockout (Figure 5D).&quot; So again, I am left questioning whether the splicing in Meioc in hnRNP GT KO are functionally relevant and have any contribution to the hnRNP GT phenotype.</p><p>In light of these concerns it would greatly strengthen the authors' manuscript if they can provide data that more strongly support roles for the aforementioned (or other splicing changes) in the phenotypes observed in their hnRNP GT ko mice.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee raises the important point of what is the importance of the</p><p>cryptic spliced isoforms if the normal mRNAs are also expressed in the testis. We</p><p>think this comes down to which cells express particular isoforms, and have carried out more experimental analysis to address this. Since hnRNP GT is only expressed in meiotic prophase, and its knockout has a late prophase arrest, we considered whether the correctly spliced Meioc exon 5 detected in total testis RNA could originate from the many cell types that exist before prophase. If this was the case, then the normal splicing signal from earlier germ cell types would make a significant contribution to swamping out the signal detected from aberrant splicing patterns in later germ cell types (including cells in diplotene).</p><p>We tested this by monitoring whether levels of cryptic splicing patterns become</p><p>stronger as the cell types that depend more exclusively on hnRNP GT expression</p><p>appear. This time-course data is shown in the new Figure 5E, and shows that</p><p>cryptic splicing of Meioc exon 5 does get progressively worse during meiotic</p><p>prophase. The normal splice isoform of Meioc was strongly expressed in the 10-</p><p>13dpp testis, with the shorter isoforms virtually invisible. 13dpp testis contain type B spermatogonia, preleptotene spermatocytes, zygotene spermatocytes and cells entering pachytene (Bellve et al., 1977). Just 3 days later, cryptic splicing patterns are easily detectable within 16dpp testes (which contain cells within pachytene, as well as the type B spermatogonia, preleptotene spermatocytes, zygotene spermatocytes found in 13dpp testis). These data support a model where cryptic Meioc splicing occurs within the specific cell types that rely on hnRNP GT for RNA processing, and that the normal splice isoform signal in whole testis RNA must be coming at least in part from earlier germ cell types before meiotic prophase.</p><p>Likewise, the shorter Meioc protein detected by Western could be specifically from cells in late prophase, and full length from earlier germ cell types (Figure 5D).</p><p>We also performed similar time-course experiments to analyse cryptic splicing of Brca2. This showed the same picture, that the Brca2 cryptic splice isoform comes from cells in meiotic prophase, and that there is a strong signal from normally spliced Brca2 from earlier germ cell types (new Figure 5<italic>—</italic>figure supplement 2).</p><p>We have also added additional discussion to our manuscript. Since we observe</p><p>splicing defects in 186 genes, the phenotype we observe may likely be due to the</p><p>additive loss of several or many genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Whereas the RNAseq libraries are described in detail (ages, number of replicates, etc), there is scant information on the CLIP data. The authors are requested to add information on the age of samples, how many replicate tissues were used, how was the data processed and analyzed, how many genes have binding. It should also be mentioned how high-confidence binding sites were discriminated from experimental noise. Also, while AA-dinucleotides may be present in the top 10 pentamers, the quality of the CLIP information is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>The CLIP analysis was carried out using one adult mouse, and was processed via the standard pipeline by Tomaz Curk using the icount software (http://icount.fri.uni-lj.si).

A schematic of the minigene should be included in the Figure. The data shows that the cryptic exon is spliced in ~40% of reporter transcripts expressed in HEK293, and inclusion of the exon decreases significantly when hnRNP GT is expressed. A direct role for hnRNP GT in repressing the cryptic exon should be demonstrated by showing that mutation of AA dinucleotides abolishes hnRNP GT's ability to repress splicing (or bind the transcript). We propose to test this using an RRM negative hnRNPGT.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the schematic (new Figure 6A). In fact, we don’t detect CLIP tags near the Kdm4d cryptic exon, although we do see them elsewhere on the gene (Figure 4A). Although lack of tags does not definitively exclude hnRNP GT binding to this region of the Kdm4d gene, it does suggest that hnRNP GT control of this cryptic exon could be largely through protein-protein interactions with another</p><p>splicing regulator such as Tra2β, rather than direct RNA-protein binding. We tested this idea by co-transfection experiments with full length hnRNP GT, and with an hnRNP GT variant from which the RNP1 motif in the RRM (RNA recognition motif) had been deleted (updated Figure 6B). Since both co-transfections blocked splicing inclusion of this cryptic exon this experiment supports the effect of hnRNP GT being largely not mediated by direct protein-RNA interactions by the RRM. Interestingly, although the ΔRNP1 version of hnRNP GT is able to repress splicing inclusion of the Kdm4d exon, it did not work quite as efficiently as the full length version of the protein. This leaves open some role for the RRM in regulating this Kdm4d exon.</p><p>We have also added in new data showing that RBMX is able to repress splicing of</p><p>the Kdm4d cryptic exon (updated Figure 6B). This supports the idea that RBMX</p><p>protein may fulfil the function of hnRNP GT prior to meiotic prophase, and so</p><p>contribute to the normal splicing patterns observed from testes before 14dpp.</p></body></sub-article></article>
