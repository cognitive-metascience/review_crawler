reorganization. We have examined the mechanism of WNV fusion and sought evidence for potential intermediates during the conformational transition by following hemifusion of WNV virus-like particles (VLPs) in a single particle format. We have introduced specific mutations into E, to relate their influence on fusion kinetics to structural features of the protein. At the level of individual E subunits, trimer formation and membrane engagement of the threefold clustered fusion loops are rate-limiting. Hemifusion requires at least two adjacent trimers. Simulation of the kinetics indicates that availability of competent monomers within the contact zone between virus and target membrane makes trimerization a bottleneck in hemifusion. We discuss the implications of the model we have derived for mechanisms of membrane fusion in other contexts.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04389.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04389.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04389.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Flaviviruses are a group of viruses that cause serious diseases in humans, including yellow fever, West Nile fever and dengue fever. Like all viruses, flaviviruses protect their genetic material with a protein shell and, like many other viruses, that shell also has a lipid membrane.</p><p>Flaviruses use one of their surface membrane proteins, known as ‘envelope protein’ or simply ‘E’, to bind to the surface of host cells. Once the virus has attached to the host cell membrane, it becomes engulfed within a bubble-like structure called an endosome, which also has a surrounding membrane. The interior of an endosome is acidic. Under these conditions the E protein undergoes a series of changes that bring the two membranes into close contact, so that the membrane of the virus can fuse with the membrane of the endosome. This membrane fusion allows the genome of the virus to escape the endosome and hijack the cell to make new copies of the virus.</p><p>The E proteins on a mature flavivirus particle are found in pairs, but previous work showed that these proteins must work together in groups of three (called ‘trimers’) for the viral and endosomal membranes to fuse. Chao et al. have now asked: what are the rate-limiting steps that lead to the formation of trimers? And how many trimers are necessary to cause the membranes to fuse?</p><p>Chao et al. have investigated these questions using virus-like particles containing the E protein of West Nile Virus. They used techniques that can track individual particles<bold>,</bold> which their laboratory had previously used to investigate the influenza virus, to model changes in the E protein before, during and after membrane fusion. Chao et al. then made mutant versions of the envelope protein and used virus-like particles containing them to test the model.</p><p>The data that Chao et al. obtained and computer simulations they carried out suggest that exposure to acidic conditions encourages the pairs of E proteins to separate and extend towards the endosome membrane. Individual E proteins then group together into trimers, and at least two trimers are needed to exert enough force to allow the membranes to fuse. The experimental design used by Chao et al. will now allow them to study the action of molecules that inhibit membrane fusion by West Nile Virus and other viruses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04389.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04389.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd><kwd>flavivirus</kwd><kwd>West Nile virus</kwd><kwd>single particle</kwd><kwd>kinetic</kwd><kwd>conformational change</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA13202, AI057159, AI109740</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chao</surname><given-names>Luke H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The West Nile Virus envelope protein catalyzes membrane fusion through low-pH induced conformational rearrangement, with a rate determined by the formation of two trimeric complexes at the contact zone between the virus and target membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell entry of enveloped viruses requires membrane fusion, catalyzed by a viral surface protein. The fusion protein of flaviviruses—the group that includes yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), dengue (DV), and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) viruses—is the envelope protein (E), which becomes fusogenic when exposed to reduced pH in an endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">van der Schaar et al., 2007</xref>). This step merges viral and endosomal membranes and releases the viral genome into the cytosol.</p><p>Although thermodynamically favorable, lipid-bilayer fusion has a very high kinetic barrier (∼50 kcal/mol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rand and Parsegian, 1984</xref>). Modeling and experiment suggest that hydration-force repulsion occurs when two bilayers approach more closely than 15–20 Å. Fusion proteins such as E reduce this barrier by inducing the distortion needed to form a hemifusion stalk—the short-lived intermediate that resolves to form a pore. They do so through a series of membrane-coupled conformational rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harrison, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Mature flavivirus particles have an ordered icosahedral lattice of E dimers on the surface of a ∼500 Å diameter virion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhang et al., 2013a</xref>). Cleavage by furin of prM, the E-protein ‘chaperone’, during transit through the trans-Golgi network converts an immature, non-infectious, and fusion incompetent particle, with trimer-clustered prM-E spikes, into an infectious and fusion competent particle, with dimer-clustered E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rey et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stadler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2008</xref>). This rearrangement primes the E protein to undergo a sequence of fusion-inducing conformational changes when exposed to acidic pH.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04389.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Molecular structure and conformational rearrangements in flavivirus membrane fusion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: domains of flavivirus E protein in the dimer on the surface of a mature virion or virus-like particle (VLP), monomers shown in solid and outline forms. right: arrangement of dimers on a small (60-subunit) VLP.

Domain I is a central <bold>β-</bold>barrel that positions the other two domains; domain II, two long, clustered extensions from domain I, bears the fusion loop at its distal tip; domain III is an immunoglobulin-like domain that may have a receptor-binding surface. In the prefusion, neutral-pH conformation, a cavity at the junction between domains I and III sequesters the fusion loop of the E dimer partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Protonation of key histidine residues induces dimer dissociation, exposing the fusion loop and allowing the ectodomain to hinge outwards from the virion surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fritz et al., 2008</xref>). Engagement of the fusion loop with the target membrane facilitates trimerization, accompanied by repositioning of domain III relative to domain I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rey et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Modis et al., 2004</xref>). Rearrangement of the membrane-proximal stem, from a conformation buried in the outer leaflet of the viral membrane to one that stabilizes the inter-protomer trimer interface, can then ‘zip’ the trimer together and induce collapse of the extended intermediate, causing the transmembrane anchors to approach the trimer-clustered fusion loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Pangerl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klein et al., 2013</xref>). This last step favors formation of a hemifusion stalk between the apposed leaflets of the two membranes. Disruption of domain III repositioning by exogenous free domain III or inhibition of stem zippering by stem-derived peptides inhibits infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liao and Kielian, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>). Resolution of the hemifused state into an open pore may require further rearrangement of the fusion loops and the C-terminal transmembrane anchors.</p><p>We have studied the kinetics of WNV membrane fusion, in a single-particle format developed previously to analyze influenza virus fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Floyd et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Kinetic data can define rate-limiting steps preceding an observed process, and coupled with site-directed mutation they can identify key intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Floyd et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ivanovic et al., 2013</xref>). We have used this approach to probe the conformational transition of WNV E on the virion surface. Our data support a mechanism in which a pH-dependent dimer-monomer equilibrium creates, at the contact between virus and target membrane, a pool of monomers competent to cluster into target-membrane engaged trimers. Formation of at least two adjacent trimers allows progression to hemifusion. The corresponding two-stage structural picture is (i) that stochastic activation of E monomers (by dimer dissociation and monomer outward extension) leads to trimerization and essentially irreversible target-membrane engagement, whenever three neighboring monomers are active, and (ii) that two adjacent trimers can together exert enough force on the membranes they bridge (target membrane and viral membrane) to produce a hemifusion stalk. Formation of adjacent trimers is limited by the availability of competent monomers. This mechanism—like the one shown previously to fit influenza-virus fusion kinetics—does not require defined trimer–trimer interactions, because resistance of the two membranes to deformation toward a hemifusion stalk couples conformational changes in the trimers that bridge them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ivanovic et al., 2013</xref>). Fusion proceeds rapidly whenever a sufficient number of them can overcome the deformation barrier. We suggest that this description may apply more generally to fusion of intracellular vesicles and to fusion of two cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-particle analysis of WNV hemifusion</title><p>Recombinant expression of flavivirus proteins prM and E yields mature, non-infectious, empty virus-like particles (VLPs).

In bulk fusion studies, in which acidification induces fusion with liposomes that do not bear a receptor or surrogate, exposure of the fusion loops may be necessary even for initial interaction of the virus or VLPs with the target bilayer. Mixed VLPs, with a 50:50 mixture of wild-type:W101A E protein, had a mean dwell time (52–53 s at pH 5.5) and an overall yield of fusion events (∼30%) similar to those of fully wild-type particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>An initial reversible pH-dependent transition</title><p>The first step in assembly of trimeric fusion complexes is release of E protein ectodomains from lateral contacts, especially those between dimers, in the surface of a mature virion.

The geometry is an idealization of the actual surface lattice, with explicitly defined dimers that reorganize during the dimer-to-trimer transition. We chose 30 monomers for the contact patch, because the small VLPs have about 60 subunits (depending on how perfect their surface lattice), and 30 subunits, a hemisphere, is the largest possible contact without major distortion of the target bilayer. The contact is unlikely to be much smaller, because particles with half of their E proteins containing ‘weakened’ fusion loops (the W101A mutation) had fusion properties similar to those of wild-type particles. A single number for the size of the contact patch is a reasonable approximation for the somewhat heterogeneous population of VLPs, because observed hemifusion kinetics did not depend on the extent of labeling with DiD and hence did not depend on the area of particle membrane or the diameter of the particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>We initialize the simulation by distributing the monomers between a ‘prefusion’ state and an ‘activated’ state. The former we take to be dimer-like; the latter we take to represent a conformation in which the monomer extends outward so that its fusion loops can contact the target membrane. The reversible transition between these states corresponds to the dimer-monomer equilibrium of soluble flavivirus E ectodomain (sE) and to the reversible E extension detected in our dynamic light scattering observations. It has a pH-dependent equilibrium constant, K<sub>dm</sub>, and a forward rate constant, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>act</italic></sub> (and hence a probability P<sub>act</sub> = [1−exp(−<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>act</italic></sub>Δt)] for each time step, Δt, in the simulation). Thus, K<sub>dm</sub> = (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>act</italic></sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>ret</italic></sub>)[H+], where <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>ret</italic></sub> reflects the reverse rate constant (for the monomer to dimeric transition). We set the pK for K<sub>dm</sub> to agree with our measurements of the pH at half-maximal increase in the hydrodynamic radius (pH 6.8 for the ∼30 Å expansion of Kunjin virus). We describe cooperativity in the activation transition with a factor (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>dim</italic></sub>), by which the activation of one protomer increases the activation rate for its neighboring dimer partner. That is, for a given neighbor, its probability for activation, P<sub>act</sub>(neighbor) = <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>dim</italic></sub>[1−exp(−<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>act</italic></sub>Δt)], if (and only if) the partner is already activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>The extended monomers that bridge to the target membrane can then cluster as trimers. We define explicitly all possible trimer combinations for the 30 protomer hexagonal lattice. We assume that in this second transition, a trimer forms with probability P<sub>tri</sub> = [1−exp(−<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>tri</italic></sub>Δt)], whenever three adjacent monomers (a triangle of positions in the idealized lattice of the simulations—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) become activated; this step includes essentially irreversible capture of the fusion loops by the supported bilayer, as observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stiasny and Heinz, 2004</xref>). It corresponds to the observed irreversible trimerization and membrane capture of E ectodomains when the protein is exposed to reduced pH in the presence of liposomes. We used the measured pH for half-maximal trimerization (6.1), as determined by liposome co-floatation of recombinant soluble WNV E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), to set the pH dependence for the trimerization step.</p><p>Finally, when T adjacent trimers have formed, the simulation allows hemifusion to proceed to completion with a probability P<sub>comp</sub> = [1−exp(−<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>comp</italic></sub>Δt)]. A simulation for a given virion exits on execution of this step, after recording the total number of steps (i.e., the time to hemifusion) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>We ran hemifusion simulations for 500 particles over a range of pH values. We found a unique set of parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) that generated histograms very similar in shape and in pH-dependence of dwell time to our experimental data from WNV VLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The three values we varied were <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>act</italic></sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>tri</italic></sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>comp</italic></sub>. We converged on these parameters following sequential rounds of optimization, testing fits for conditions in which one, two or three trimers defined hemifusion. We also tested a range of values for P<sub>dim</sub> from 2–50, thus altering the cooperativity of subunit activation, and values for T from 1 to 3. We found that the data fit best to models in which two trimers mediate hemifusion and that this number was insensitive to the assumed pK<sub>a</sub> for monomer activation and to the assumed threshold pH for trimer formation. We investigated if accounting for cooperativity between a subunit and its neighbors in the surface lattice other than its dimer partner would alter the outcome of our simulations. Incorporation of an additional factor did not make any changes in the properties of the simulation histograms and their fits. For all subsequent simulations, we fixed the parameter <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>dim</italic></sub> = 4, well within the tested range. With these parameters, the rate-limiting step is trimer formation. We noticed that as we increased the pH in these simulations, we lowered the yield of total particles reaching hemifusion during the fixed time frame of the simulation. We found the same trend in the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In the simulations, the lower yield came from a reduced pool of activated monomer available to form trimers and a resulting geometric penalty for trimer possibilities. Relaxing this constraint, by increasing the target patch size to 37 monomers, increased overall event yield in the simulation; decreasing the target patch size to 23 decreased the yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04389.010</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Simulations varying rate constants and contact-patch size and including mixture of wild-type and mutant E.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overall hemifusion rate at pH 5.5 from simulations with all parameters fixed at values shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> except for <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>tri</italic></sub> or <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>comp</italic></sub> (left and right panels, respectively).

In the post-fusion conformation, N193 makes a ring of hydrogen bonds in the center of the domain II trimer contact, where it probably contributes to clustering of the fusion loops. WNV N193A VLPs showed no change in bulk fusion threshold.

By correlating fusion kinetics with specific, site-directed alterations in E, we have sought to determine the rate-limiting molecular events, the number of WNV E trimers needed to fuse, and the mechanism for coordinating conformational change among the several trimers that generate a single fusion pore.</p><p>Previous work on influenza virus, taking a similar approach, has produced the following description of hemagglutinin (HA) catalyzed fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Floyd et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ivanovic et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). The rate-limiting step in the hemagglutinin (HA) conformational change is exposure of the fusion peptide and its engagement with the target bilayer. The contact zone between a typical influenza virus particle and the membrane with which it will fuse includes about 100 closely packed HA trimers. When the pH drops, stochastic rearrangement of trimers within that contact zone creates a random pattern of extended HA bridges between the two membranes. The extended intermediates have a detectable lifetime only because hydration force and resistance to membrane deformation prevent collapse of any single trimer to a postfusion conformation. The free energy recovered from collapse of three neighboring trimers is enough to overcome this barrier, and rapid collapse and hemifusion ensue as soon as three adjacent trimers in the contact zone have created intermembrane bridges.</p><p>The sequence of molecular events in flavivirus fusion is somewhat more elaborate, because of the change in oligomeric association of E. E dimers, which initially form a regular icosahedral array, dissociate, exposing the fusion loops at the tip of domain II and allowing the subunits to project outwards from the virion surface. These events are fast, and under many conditions they may be in rapid equilibrium. Our results, both from experiment and simulation, suggest that the rate-limiting molecular step is formation of extended trimers. This conclusion is consistent with observations on low-pH induced trimer formation from soluble E ectodomain dimers: liposomes greatly enhance the yield of trimers, probably by transiently immobilizing the monomers in the right orientation. The rate of trimerization depends in turn on the effective surface concentration of activated monomers in the contact zone between virus particle and target membrane, and the rate of hemifusion, on the occurrence of a suitable number (at least two) of adjacent trimers within that zone. Since activation of individual monomers is stochastic, a critical constraint comes from the geometric requirements for availability of activated E to trimerize.</p><p>Previous, bulk-phase studies of flavivirus and alphavirus fusion with liposomes using pyrene-modified lipids incorporated into the virion followed the decrease in pyrene excimer fluorescence that accompanies dilution into the target liposome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chatterjee et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Waarts et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fritz et al., 2011</xref>). Our single particle analysis has extracted mechanistic detail from mutants that have no detectible bulk phenotype. The observed increase in single particle hemifusion yield at higher temperatures (∼40% at 24°C) suggests that local rearrangements in the particle surface can help satisfy the geometric requirements for trimerization, increasing overall yield with little change in overall reaction rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D–E</xref>). Experimental data for the 1:1 WT:W101A mixed particle showed no decrease in hemifusion yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). A likely explanation is that mixed trimers, with one or two Trp-containing fusion loops, can participate in facilitating hemifusion, perhaps in some cases with participation of a third trimer. A simulation assuming that any trimer with one or more mutated E monomers would be inactive greatly decreases yield, while relaxing this constraint recovers wild-type levels, as observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism just outlined has some formal similarities to the one described for SNARE-catalyzed synaptic vesicle fusion, but the latter has an additional regulatory feature leading to a pause immediately before initial membrane mixing. Fast (ms) synaptic vesicular membrane fusion proceeds by rearrangement of multiple copies of the trans-membrane SNAP/SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez et al., 2014</xref>), docked in a poised state analogous to the fusion-loop inserted, extended E-protein intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). The synaptic fusion machinery may also act in a stochastic fashion, in which a minimum number of complexes are sufficient to catalyze fusion. Although subsequent events are very fast, the poised state precedes any membrane merger: the two bilayers remain distinct until triggering, and activation by calcium-dependent co-factors allows coordinated, rapid progression from the extended state to full pore formation, probably through a transient hemifusion stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Diao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lai et al., 2014</xref>). The pre-assembly step in synaptic vesicle fusion thus avoids the penalty imposed on viral fusion by the requirement that a critical number of neighboring bridges accumulate <italic>after</italic> the triggering event (increased proton concentration) before they can zipper and collapse.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04389.013</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Kinetic mechanisms of membrane fusion.</title><p>Darker arrows indicate faster steps.

Moreover, both have high local protein density within the bilayer—at least 15% for flaviviruses and nearly 25% for synpatic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>). We find that WNV VLP fusion kinetics are independent of particle size and hence of curvature within the relevant range, which spans a substantial difference in outer:inner area ratios. The area of the outer polar-group layer in small VLPs is nearly three times that of the inner polar-group layer; the ratio is just over 1.5 for the virion-sized particles. The wedge-shaped transmembrane hairpins of M and E, neither of which extends fully into the lumen of the particle, may compensate in part for curvature and help drive budding into the ER; insertion of amphipathic α3 of the stem into the outer leaflet of the bilayer, occupying about 10% of the total outer-leaflet surface area, probably stabilizes curvature as well. With these compensations, even the rather sharp curvature of the small VLPs probably contributes very little to overcoming the barrier to fusion. A potential contribution to catalyzing membrane merger is the perturbation in the target membrane that comes from introducing fusion loops or fusion peptides into its lipid bilayer. The heterogeneity of fusion-loop and fusion-peptide structures and sequences among the various kinds of enveloped viruses appears, however, to rule out a common mechanism for such a disturbance. Our analysis therefore concentrates on the distortions imposed by linking large-scale conformational changes in the fusion protein with comparably strong deformations of the lipid bilayers.</p><p>In the absence of regulation at a primed hemifusion step, like that regulated by synaptotagmin or complexin for SNAREs, the transition to fusion is very fast, once the necessary number of trimers has formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). The requirement that several neighboring monomers undergo domain rearrangements to assemble into trimers implies that the extended conformation will have a finite lifetime and that blocking trimerization will markedly reduce the likelihood of hemifusion. The potency of exogenous stem-derived peptide inhibitors of dengue virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>) suggests that these properties provide an inhibitory strategy yet to be fully exploited by conformation-specific targeted antibodies or small-molecule inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Virus-like particles (VLPs)</title><p>West Nile Virus virus-like particles (VLPs) were produced from a stable 293T cell line transfected with the pVRC8400 expression vector with a structural cassette containing prM-E sequence from the genotype NY99 sequence (produced by Angelica Medina–Selby, Doris Coit and Colin McCoin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lanciotti, 1999</xref>)) preceded by the tissue plasminogen activator signal sequence.

We calibrated the instrument using polystyrene beads (5 nm radius), tomato busy stunt virus in compact and expanded states (R = 170 Å and 190 Å, respectively), and rotavirus double-layered particle as standards (350 Å radius). Each data point is the average of three measurements, each of which was determined by twenty consecutive 10 s acquisitions Data were filtered based on stability of light intensity and sample polydispersity criteria (&lt;20%) with the program DYNAMICS v6 for data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Simulations</title><p>Simulations were written in MatLab (Mathworks).

However, the reviewers agree that the novelty lies primarily in the kinetic model which reveals, for instance, that trimerization is a rate-limiting step, rather than in the experimental approach or the general pathway involving dimer dissociation, trimerization etc. The modeling thus constitutes the key part of the work, and several aspects of it were viewed as rather problematic.</p><p>1) The simulation model has five fitting parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, could there be other combinations of the parameters that would give similar quality of the fit? Can the combinations be different for different pH? For instance, can lipid mixing be mediated by several trimers at acidic pH and by only one at moderately acidic pH? In the analysis of the mutants four of the five parameters were kept fixed.

It was felt that this should be doable within the time allowed for revision. Provided that by carrying out additional analysis and addressing the issues above the main conclusions are substantiated and robust, the reviewers are supportive of publication.

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and a member of the Board of reviewing editors. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining questions concerning the modeling that should be addressed before acceptance.</p><p>For one of the two fixed parameters –<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>dim</italic></sub>, the authors now tested a range of values and found the data still fit best to models with two trimers mediating hemifusion. This is an important analysis and it would be useful to specify the tested range. The second fixed parameter is the pK for K<sub>dm</sub>. In the Rebuttal letter the authors wrote: “we have used experimental data on the conformational transition of soluble E to fix the pK of the dimer-monomer step”. This would be great, but the description in the manuscript is actually very different. The manuscript states: &quot;we set the pK for K<sub>dm</sub> to agree with bulk measurements of the pH threshold for fusion (pK<sub>f</sub>, pH 6.4 for WNV VLPs). This has to be clarified.</p><p>If the pK of the dimer-monomer step is indeed directly measured, please describe these measurements in the paper.</p><p>If pK for the dissociation of the WNV E dimer is fixed at 6.4 based on the literature, please provide the references. I do not think References 1 and 20 mentioned in the Rebuttal (“a well-characterized and biochemically established condition is the pH threshold for dimer dissociation (References 1, 20)”) help to set this pK, since Reference 1 is a study carried out on another virus (tick borne encephalitis rather than WNV) and Reference 20 does not present any data for the pH threshold of the dimer dissociation (only pH dependence of lipid mixing).</p><p>If the pK of the dimer-monomer step is taken from the pH dependence of lipid mixing, this is not a direct measurement. Dimer dissociation is not the only low pH-dependent stage in fusion, and other pH-dependent stages (including the trimerization step that is found by the authors to depend on pH with pH 6.1 threshold) can contribute to or determine the observed pH dependence of fusion. Furthermore, for the same viral fusogen, pH threshold for lipid mixing can depend on the specifics of the assay (for instance, Wessels et al., 2007, Biophys. J., 93, 526; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moesker et al., 2010</xref>, Journal of General Virology, 91, 389) and on the composition of the target membrane (for instance, Gollins &amp; Porterfield, 1986, Journal of General Virology. 67, 157). Thus, pK of the dimer dissociation step can differ from pH threshold of lipid mixing, and it is important to examine whether small changes in the pK for K<sub>dm</sub> would yield better fits with 1 or 3 trimers mediating hemifusion or 2 trimers would remain the best fit.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04389.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Generally your work is considered to be novel and of high interest.

We provide details below. We have also found that by introducing a pH dependence for the trimerization step, again fixed by experimental measurement, and by allowing trimers with one “dead” protomer to participate in hemifusion, we considerably improve the agreement of simulated and observed yield.

Also, are the simulations dependent on the grid size, i.e. the spacing of the trimers</italic>?</p><p>We emphasize that our model in fact has only three free parameters. A well-characterized and biochemically established condition is the pH threshold for dimer dissociation. This value determines the K<sub>dm</sub> equilibrium constant in our simulation, thus fixed the ratio of <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>act</italic></sub> to <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>ret</italic></sub>. We fixed <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>dim</italic></sub> (the cooperativity factor for dimer dissociation) at 4, corresponding roughly to a four-fold increase in the dimer to monomer transition rate.

We found that other combinations could not generate as good a fit. The text and figures have been modified to make this clear.</p><p>We considered whether models with a different number of trimers required to complete hemifusion could fit our experimental data equally well. We compared the results of simulations in which we varied the number of trimers defining hemifusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 1</xref>). The model with two trimers clearly fit better than models with one or three trimers. This global behavior applies across the pH range studied. Attempts to optimize the fitted parameters with a three-trimer or one-trimer hemifusion model resulted in poor fits of the simulation distributions to the experimental data.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-04389-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>We also investigated whether we could generate better agreement with the data from mutants by varying <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>comp</italic></sub>, as suggested, and found that the fits using this model were poorer (as reflected by the χ<sup>2</sup> value and plotted residuals), despite adding a second fitting parameter in the <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>comp</italic></sub> fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 2</xref>).<fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-04389-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Grid spacing was not a consideration for describing flavivirus fusion, as unlike influenza hemagglutinin, there is a regular icosahedral arrangement of E on the virion surface. We did note potential differences due to grid area (total number of E proteins in the contact zone) as observed in simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) A related problem is that relevant experimental data are not well explained by the fit, such as why VLPs with 1-to-1 mix of wild-type E protein and W101A E protein had a mean dwell time and an overall yield of fusion events similar to those of fully wild-type particles. The yield of hemifused particles depends on pH in simulations much stronger than in the experiment (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7B</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>The difference between our experimental observations and the simulation results for the mixed particles prompted us to consider whether a trimer containing two wild-type fusion loops might still be competent to mediate hemifusion. We generated another version of our simulation scheme to account for this possibility and found an overall event yield similar to wild type values, better matching our experimental observations (Updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The figures in the main text have been updated to reflect the new simulation.</p><p>We had considered that pH might influence different stages of the reaction, and in the originally submitted version of the work, we chose to build in a pH-dependence for the initial dimer dissociation step. To determine whether additional steps might depend on pH, without adding further free parameters, we measured the trimerization pH threshold for soluble WNV E protein in a liposome co-floatation assay and obtained a value of 6.1. Because WNV E is monomeric in solution, the measurement deconvolves dimer dissociation from trimerization. We built this parameter into our simulation, just as we had incorporated pH dependence with a measured pK into the dimer dissociation step and found better correlation between our simulation and the experimental yield at higher pH values (updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Previous studies on several fusion processes suggested that there are higher energy barriers to overcome on the way from hemifusion to an expanding fusion pore than on the way from the tight contact to hemifusion. Should the conclusion “… makes trimerization a bottleneck in the overall course of the fusion reaction” be edited to “a bottleneck in hemifusion”</italic>?</p><p>We agree, and we have changed the wording as suggested.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>The reviewers’ principal concern was with the assumption that the pH threshold for bulk fusion is a suitable estimate for the pK of the dimer-monomer step on the virion surface. The point is a good one, and we realized that we could fix the parameter for K<sub>dm</sub> (the pH-dependent dimer-monomer equilibrium) by measuring the dimer-monomer equilibrium step directly by dynamic light scattering of Kunjin virions. We have done so and incorporated this experimental value as a fixed parameter in the simulations. We now describe this measurement in the paper.</p><p><italic>If the pK of the dimer-monomer step is indeed directly measured, please describe these measurements in the paper</italic>.</p><p>We used Kunjin virus, the West Nile virus variant; its uniform diameter allows us to interpret a change in dynamic light scattering as a change in effective hydrodynamic radius. We observe a reversible expansion upon low-pH treatment (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). West Nile virions have been shown to undergo transient temperature dependent fluctuations, during which extension of the E protein opens access to otherwise sequestered epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dowd et al., 2011</xref>). A similar transition seen with dengue virions is temperature dependent and can be trapped by binding of antibody to the epitopes it exposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). The measured radius is somewhat larger than the fully compact structure seen by cryoEM, suggesting that E subunits can undergo transient, reversible outward excursion even at pH ∼8 and room temperature (see main text for further discussion).</p><p>We find that pH 6.8 is the midpoint of the transition from a smaller to a larger radius (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We interpret the change in hydrodynamic radius as a measure of the rearrangement of E subunits from the circumferential orientation of their long axis seen in mature virions to a partially extended conformation with fusion loops exposed. We take the midpoint pH for this transition as the pK of the dimer-monomer equilibrium for E protein on the virion surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We have re-run all of the simulations in the paper with the newly determined K<sub>dm</sub> value and updated all of the relevant figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7 fig8">Figures 6C, 7B-D, 8C and F</xref>).</p><p>This transition shows a Hill coefficient of ∼3, indicating local cooperativity for the transition, but not a globally cooperative reorganization of the entire surface lattice.</p><p><italic>For one of the two fixed parameters –</italic>P<sub>dim</sub><italic>, the authors now tested a range of values and found the data still fit best to models with two trimers mediating hemifusion.

In addition, based on the observed Hill coefficient of 2.5, we investigated if accounting for additional cooperativity effects on other adjacent subunits outside of a dimeric unit would alter our simulations. Incorporation of an additional factor did not make any changes in the properties of the simulation histograms and their fits.
