assemblies and respond dynamically to pH and temperature stresses to protect client proteins from aggregation. While the alpha-crystallin domain (ACD) dimer of sHSPs is the universal building block, how the ACD transmits structural changes in response to stress to promote holdase activity is unknown. We found that the dimer interface of HSPB5 is destabilized over physiological pHs and a conserved histidine (His-104) controls interface stability and oligomer structure in response to acidosis. Destabilization by pH or His-104 mutation shifts the ACD from dimer to monomer but also results in a large expansion of HSPB5 oligomer states. Remarkably, His-104 mutant-destabilized oligomers are efficient holdases that reorganize into structurally distinct client–bound complexes. Our data support a model for sHSP function wherein cell stress triggers small perturbations that alter the ACD building blocks to unleash a cryptic mode of chaperone action.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07304.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07304.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07304.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are composed of one or more long chain-like molecules that must fold into complex three-dimensional shapes in order to work properly. Incorrectly folded proteins cannot function and often aggregate into toxic states that are associated with a number of neurological diseases including Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's.</p><p>Elevated temperatures, increased acidity, and other stressful conditions in the cell can hinder the folding process and may cause existing proteins to unfold and aggregate. However, when cells experience these stresses, certain proteins—known as small heat shock proteins (or sHSPs for short)—act as ‘holdase chaperones’ to protect cells from protein misfolding.</p><p>HSPB5 is one such chaperone that binds to and stabilizes other proteins (called ‘clients’) to prevent their aggregation. The core structure of HSPB5 and other similar chaperone proteins is well known. But, it is not clear how chaperones sense stressful conditions and respond to increase their activity to help stabilize client proteins.</p><p>Now, Rajagopal et al. have identified a single amino acid in HSPB5 that is sensitive to pH changes. When the environment inside a cell becomes more acidic, this amino acid (a histidine) triggers changes in HSPB5's structure that enhance the chaperone's activity.</p><p>This histidine was then replaced with another amino acid in an attempt to lock HSPB5 into a low-pH state that mimics an active HSPB5 chaperone inside a stressed cell. Further experiments revealed that this mutant HSPB5 is a super-active holdase chaperone, and that it dramatically changes its structure to bind to a client protein in the holdase state. From this, Rajagopal et al. propose a model to explain how cellular stress triggers small changes in HSPB5 that propagate through the chaperone in a response mechanism that increases its activity. Future studies will investigate whether inherited mutations in HSPB5 and other similar chaperones—which are associated with cardiac, muscle, and nerve disorders—exert their effect by disrupting this response mechanism.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07304.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07304.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>protein chaperone</kwd><kwd>heat shock protein</kwd><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY017370</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klevit</surname><given-names>Rachel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008268</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delbecq</surname><given-names>Scott P</given-names></name><name><surname>Klevit</surname><given-names>Rachel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Small decreases in pH associated with cellular stress conditions unleash a cryptic mode of client binding in a ubiquitously expressed human small heat shock protein that is more effective at delaying client aggregation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells have numerous strategies to cope with the consequences of stress conditions that lead to protein misfolding and aggregation. Ineffective resolution of protein misfolding and unmitigated protein aggregation can lead to formation of plaques, fibrils, and other aggregated species encountered in neurodegenerative diseases. Generally, ATP-dependent chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 assist with protein refolding, while ATP-independent chaperones known as small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) act as first responders by maintaining proteins in soluble forms to inhibit misfolding and to delay aggregation. Under transcriptional regulation of the heat shock factor, Hsf1, levels of sHSPs can rise to 1% of total cellular protein when conditions deviate from the norm, e.g. ischemia, hypoxia, oncogene activation, and chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kampinga and Garrido, 2012</xref>). sHSPs are found throughout prokaryotes and eukaryotes. There are ten sHSPs encoded in the human genome (HSPB1, HSPB2, etc), ranging in size from 15 to 25 kDa. Most, including the ubiquitously expressed human sHSP HSPB5, form large assemblies that exist as dynamic distributions of polydisperse oligomers whose properties are both temperature and pH dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jehle et al., 2011</xref>). Which form or forms of an sHSP are active and how they function are central unanswered questions. In addition, how sHSPs interact with partly unfolded or aggregate-prone proteins (‘clients’) to prevent formation of aggregates remains enigmatic.</p><p>Some acute cellular stresses are associated with acidosis. For example, measurements in mouse brain following ischemic stroke showed a pH of 6.4 in ischemic tissue compared to a pH of 7.0 in normal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McVicar et al., 2014</xref>). A decrease in cellular pH may give rise to destabilization of some proteins and/or a decrease in solubility for proteins with pI values between pH 6 and 7. Furthermore, the pH in normal eye lens fiber cells, which contain extremely high concentrations of the sHSPs HSPB4 and HSPB5 is ∼6.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassnett and Duncan, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mathias et al., 1991</xref>). Such observations raise the question as to the nature and determinants of pH-dependent properties of sHSPs in general and HSPB5 in particular.</p><p>Here, we report how pH affects structural, biochemical, and functional properties of HSPB5 (also known as αB-crystallin). Like all sHSPs, HSPB5 has a conserved central α-crystallin domain (ACD) flanked by variable N- and C-terminal regions. We carried out investigations both on the HSPB5-ACD, which forms the dimeric building block found in all sHSPs, and on full-length oligomeric HSPB5. We find that ACD dimer stability decreases over a narrow physiologically relevant pH range and we have identified a conserved histidine residue that is largely responsible for the observed destabilization. Surprisingly, the histidine is not on the dimer interface but its mutation to glutamine or lysine partly or fully recapitulates low pH behavior both in the context of the ACD dimer and in oligomers. The mutant proteins allowed us to probe the consequences of dimer interface destabilization without additional complicating factors that arise when comparing experiments performed at differing pH. Mutations that destabilize the dimer interface produce extremely large oligomers that can rearrange to form long-lived complexes with a model client protein. Our studies unmask a cryptic mode of HSPB5/client interaction not previously detected using the wild-type protein under non-stress conditions. The results highlight mechanistic differences in the ways in which holdases work and suggest that HSPB5 has a repertoire of ways in which it can carry out its function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NMR solution structure and <sup>15</sup>N relaxation reveal conformational plasticity in HSPB5-ACD</title><p>As ACD dimers are the fundamental, stably folded building blocks of sHSP oligomers, we first sought to define their response to changes in pH over a physiologically relevant range. Although multiple structures have been solved for HSPB5-ACD, there are differences among them as well as differences in the conditions under which the structures were obtained (i.e., pH 4.6, 6.0, 7.5, 8.5, 9.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 2011</xref>). We felt this situation necessitated structure determination under solution conditions relevant to our studies. The solution structure of HSPB5-ACD at pH 7.5, 22°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) was calculated from NMR data that included backbone and side chain chemical shifts, NOEs, and RDCs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). As in all previously determined HSPB5-ACD dimer structures (PDB 2WJ7, 3L1G, 2KLR, 2Y22, 4M5S, and 4M5T), each subunit adopts a six-stranded β-sandwich structure and two ACDs form a dimer through anti-parallel alignment of their long β6+7 strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,C</xref>). A notable difference among solved sHSP ACD structures is that dimers appear in different alignments of the two β6+7 strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hochberg et al., 2014</xref>).

Two NMR ensembles (solution-state reported here and solid-state PDB 2KLR) and five crystal structures all overlay well with the exception of the loop that connects β5 and β6+7 (called Loop 5/6; residues His-104–Gly-112). Loop 5/6 curves upwards in our solution ensemble (pH 7.5) and in three crystal structures (2WJ7 [pH 9.0], 3L1G [pH 4.6], and 2Y22 [pH 8.6]). In the ‘loop up’ conformation, Loop 5/6 residues make contacts across the dimer interface to the other subunit. In contrast, Loop 5/6 curves slightly downwards in the solid-state NMR ensemble (2KLR; pH 7.5) and in two crystal structures (4M5S [pH 6.0]; 4M5T [pH 6.5]). Thus, among structures solved between pH 6.5 and 7.5, both loop conformations have been observed, suggesting that the loop is dynamic in the physiological pH range.</p><p>To investigate dynamic processes in the HSPB5-ACD, we performed <sup>15</sup>N relaxation measurements. A majority of backbone amide nitrogens have <sup>15</sup>N T<sub>2</sub> values between 30 and 40 ms, but resonances in Loop 5/6 and the dimer interface have T<sub>2</sub> &lt; 30 ms, indicating they undergo a change in their environment in the millisecond timescale (data not shown). To better probe this time regime, we performed NMR <sup>15</sup>N relaxation-compensated CPMG relaxation dispersion measurements under the solution structure conditions (700 μM ACD at pH 7.5, 22°C). Examples of relaxation curves obtained from spectra collected at two magnetic field strengths (600 and 800 MHz) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Twenty resonances gave curves that could be analyzed; of these, half are well fit by a two-state model (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>χ</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>red</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>; reduced chi-square &lt; 10; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). This indicates that the ACD dimer is exchanging between a major species (i.e., the one revealed in the solution structure ensemble) and one or more minor species. The nature of the minor species will be discussed below. Values for <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub>, the rate of exchange, for individual resonances ranged between 760 s<sup>−1</sup> and 1119 s<sup>−1</sup>. The less than two-fold difference for the range of values obtained from fitting data for individual resonances suggests that the residues that exhibit exchange could be involved in the same dynamic phenomenon. The residues that undergo exchange are along the dimer interface and in Loop 5/6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These findings are consistent with the apparent plasticity of the dimer interface and Loop 5/6 inferred from crystal structures of the ACD dimer. Analysis of available HSPB5-ACD structures and NMR relaxation data combined indicate that (1) the HSPB5 protomer structure is retained over a wide pH range and (2) there are two regions of plasticity, namely the dimer interface and Loop 5/6.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07304.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><sup>15</sup>N-CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments detect dimer-to-monomer exchange.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relaxation dispersion measurements reveal a two-state transition.

Furthermore, spectra collected between pH 7.0 and pH 6.0 had significant peak doubling which is mostly resolved at pH 6.0, making analysis of the pH-induced spectral changes based solely on existing resonance assignments at pH 7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jehle et al., 2009</xref>) challenging. Therefore, we assigned the HSPB5-ACD spectrum at pH 6.5 using standard triple resonance spectra collected at both pH 6.5 and pH 6.0 so that we could follow individual resonances through a pH titration series. An expanded region of the <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC pH series is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. In the absence of another pH-dependent process, resonances arising from residues that undergo a protonation/deprotonation event as a function of pH will shift in a continuous manner. Resonances from residues that are proximal to titrating residues will also show similar behavior. Such processes will appear in the so-called ‘fast-exchange’ NMR regime due to the rapid on/off rate of acidic protons. At pH values above 6.7, some resonances in the HSPB5-ACD spectrum exhibit fast-exchange pH behavior, consistent with protonation/deprotonation of ionizable groups. This behavior is illustrated by the resonance for His-119 in spectra collected at pH 6.7 and above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). At pH &lt; 6.7, some resonances double and appear in a new position (for example, resonances labeled 87, 119, and 135 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Such behavior exemplifies intermediate-to-slow exchange and is indicative of the existence of two states that interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale. The relative intensities of the peaks reflect the relative population of the two states, so a new species of HSPB5-ACD is increasingly populated as the pH decreases.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07304.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>HSPB5-ACD undergoes a conformational transition between pH 7.5 and 6.5.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra acquired on a 200 µM sample of HSPB5-ACD at pH 7.5 and 6.5 (22°C) reveal two states.

Based on a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> (=<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>dm</italic></sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>md</italic></sub>) of 36 μM, the concentration of ACD monomers at 700 μM ACD subunits is ∼100 μM.

Thus, several NMR parameters plus ITC measurements provide a picture in which the long dimer interface dissociates at a rate of 400 s<sup>−1</sup> at pH 7.5, 37°C and is destabilized as pH decreases below 7.

Therefore, the rate at which subunits leave an oligomer is not determined by disruption of the ACD dimer and the results suggest that dimer interfaces within oligomers may break and reform many times during the residency of subunits within HSPB5 oligomers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A conserved histidine is responsible for destabilization of the HSPB5-ACD dimer</title><p>The arrangement of the ACD dimer creates patches of positively and negatively charged surface that cross the dimer interface on both faces of the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

A p<italic>K</italic><sub>R</sub> could not be determined for His-104 because its side chain resonances broaden and disappear at pH values below 7.5. Though His-104 is not positioned on the dimer interface, the behavior of its backbone NH resonance is similar to backbone NH resonances on the dimer interface undergoing exchange between dimer and monomer, indicating that it undergoes a change in environment as a result of the dimer-to-monomer transition. At pH 7.5 where its imidazole resonances are detectable, His-104 exists as the less common Nδ1H tautomer, while the other four His residues are in the more common Nε2H tautomer. A resonance is observed at a chemical shift of 12.4 ppm for the Nδ1H of His-104, indicating that it is hydrogen bonded. Among members of the solution ensemble, there are several potential H-bonding partners in proximity to His-104: the backbone carbonyls of His-83, Glu-105, and Glu-106 and side chain groups of Arg-107 and Arg-116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, the data reveal that His-104 is in a specific conformation in the ACD dimer at pH 7.5 that is stabilized through an H-bond.</p><p>The sensitivity of His-104 resonances to the dimer-to-monomer transition suggested it as a prime candidate for the pH trigger. His-104 was substituted with either Gln or Lys and the mutant ACDs were compared to WT-HSPB5-ACD. As discussed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), peak doubling is observed in the spectrum of WT ACD below pH 7, with new peaks appearing at lower pH corresponding to ACD monomers. The <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum of H104Q-ACD has peak doubling even at pH 7.5 and the two sets of peaks correspond to dimer and monomer peaks already assigned in the WT spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, lower panel). The H104K-ACD HSQC spectrum has a single set of resonances under both pH conditions, but the peaks correspond to the monomer, even at pH 7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>). Thus, substitution of His-104 with glutamine destabilizes the dimer so that approximately equal populations are observed at pH 7.5 and NMR concentrations. Glutamine at position 104 would have difficulty mimicking the Nδ1H-bond formed by His-104. Substitution of His-104 with a positively charged lysine yields an ACD that is predominantly monomeric at pH 7.5. We did not determine <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values for the mutants by dilution ITC experiments because the starting ACD concentration must be ten-fold above K<sub>D</sub>. Based on the relative populations of dimer and monomer peaks in the NMR spectra, we can estimate that the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> for H104Q-ACD is ∼100–500 μM (approximately equal populations of dimer and monomer at [ACD] = 200 μM) and the K<sub>D</sub> for H104K-ACD is &gt;1 mM (based on our inability to detect dimer resonances in samples containing 200 μM protein). Although only order-of-magnitude, these estimates reveal that substitution of His-104 with Gln or Lys destabilizes the dimer more than 100-fold. To ascertain whether the effect of mutating His-104 is specific, the other four His residues were each mutated to Gln. The mutant ACDs retained the pH-dependent spectral behavior of the WT-ACD (data not shown). Altogether, the data implicate His-104, which sits at the base of Loop 5/6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), as a hotspot whose conformation, H-bonding capacity, and protonation state strongly affect the stability of the HSPB5-ACD dimer interface.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A destabilized dimer interface triggers a large expansion in HSPB5 oligomers</title><p>To uncover consequences of dimer interface stability in HSPB5 oligomer structure, we compared properties of full-length H104Q- and H104K-HSPB5 with WT-HSPB5.

H104K-HSPB5 forms very large, polydispersed oligomers ranging from 785 to 840 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), with an average M<sub>w</sub> of 810 kDa (∼41 subunits). H104Q-HSPB5 oligomers elute at an intermediate position relative to WT- and H104K-HSPB5. Thus, more subunits are recruited when oligomers are assembled from destabilized dimers. We propose that oligomers composed of H104K-HSPB5 are made predominantly of monomeric units while oligomers composed of H104Q-HSPB5 contain both dimeric and monomeric units. If this model is accurate, we should be able to recapitulate intermediate-sized H104Q-containing oligomers by mixing together WT- and H104K-containing subunits. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, the elution position and oligomer mass in mixtures of WT-HSPB5 and H104K-HSPB5 titrate as a function of added H104K-HSPB5 subunits, consistent with a model in which oligomers are formed from both dimeric and monomeric units. WT-HSPB5 oligomers at pH 6.5 have a mass range that corresponds to a 1:2 ratio of WT:H104K subunits, indicating that the pH-dependent oligomeric assemblies likely arise from a combination of monomeric and dimeric subunits.</p><p>The results above suggest that H104K-HSPB5 oligomers represent an endpoint in a continuum of oligomer composition and that H104Q- and (pH 6.5) WT-HSPB5 are reflective of species that are favored under differing conditions including stress-induced acidosis. To ask if oligomers composed uniquely or partly of monomeric units have distinct structural features, negative-stain EM images of H104K-HSPB5 at pH 7.5 and WT-HSPB5 at pH 6.5 were collected and analyzed. In a majority of images, defined features, identified as light and dark regions of density, are apparent within the structures, indicating an organized arrangement of subunits. The particles are generally spherical, with some oblong-shaped structures also observed. Quantitative information on the size and distribution of oligomers was obtained by measuring the diameter of circular averages generated for each 2D projection average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Single particles were then binned based on diameter of their corresponding average to generate a distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The size distribution derived in this way is consistent with the SEC-MALS analysis: WT-HSPB5 at pH 7.5 has the smallest average diameter, 15 nm, (a range of 13–17 nm), H104K-HSPB5 has the largest, with an average of 17 nm, and WT-HSPB5 at pH 6.5 is intermediate, at 16 nm. Oligomers of WT-HSPB5 at pH 6.5 cover the entire range of diameters measured, between 14 and &gt;18 nm, while the distribution of H104K-HSPB5 is skewed to the largest dimensions, with a majority of particles (&gt;70%) greater than 16 nm. For comparison, the diameter of the WT-HSPB5 cryo-EM model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2011</xref>) determined similarly from the circular average measures 15 nm, in good agreement with our measurements. Altogether the results reveal that conditions and/or mutations that affect the stability of the antiparallel dimer interface have substantial impact on HSPB5 oligomer size and structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Oligomers with destabilized dimer interfaces are effective holdases that reorganize to bind client proteins</title><p>To ascertain the functional and mechanistic consequences of the expanded oligomer structures described above, standard holdase assays in which aggregation of a model client protein is monitored as a function of time in the absence and presence of sHSP were performed.

We took advantage of the long delay in αLac aggregation afforded by both the WT and mutant HSPB5 species to attempt to detect sHSP-client interactions. Mixtures of αLac and one of the HSPB5 species were analyzed by SEC-MALS following addition of DTT and before the onset of aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Although WT-HSPB5 maintains αLac in a soluble form during the time frame of the experiment, no interaction between the two proteins was detected by SEC or SDS-PAGE, indicating that its holdase function is achieved through highly transient interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In contrast, a mixture of αLac and H104K-HSPB5 elutes with a dramatically different profile. SDS-PAGE analysis across the broad peak that elutes between 7.5 and 9.2 ml shows that it contains both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). There is a broad range of molecular weights across this peak, from &gt;550 kDa to ∼250 kDa. A similar but less dramatic change in the elution profile was obtained for a mixture of αLac and H104Q-HSPB5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Thus, long-lived complexes are formed between αLac and the H104 mutant HSPB5s, and these are markedly smaller than the oligomers that are populated in the absence of client protein.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07304.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>H104K- and H104Q-HSPB5 oligomers reorganize into small, long-lived client-bound complexes in the presence of αLac model client protein.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) SEC-MALS analysis and corresponding M<sub>w</sub> of WT (<bold>A</bold>), H104K (<bold>B</bold>) and H104Q (<bold>C</bold>), HSPB5 oligomers (40 μM in subunit concentration) incubated with αLac (120 μM) in the absence (blue) and presence (red) of 50 mM DTT to destabilize αLac.

The 2D averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) show clear structural features and reveal that a major structural reorganization occurs in the mutant sHSP upon binding of a model client protein. Among the 2D averages, some smaller spherical oligomers similar to WT-HSPB5 are observed, but the ultra-large (&gt;16 nm) oligomers that predominate in H104K-HSPB5 alone are no longer detected.

Overall the results demonstrate that HSPB5 oligomers with destabilized dimer interfaces disassemble and undergo a dramatic reorganization to form stable complexes with a model client protein while the wild-type protein at pH 7.5 does not do so and performs its holdase function via highly transient interactions with client.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite their key roles in maintaining cellular protein solubility under and following stress conditions, the determinants of sHSP structure and function remain ill defined. Stresses such as ischemia and hypoxia are associated with acidosis in which cellular pH can decrease to as low as pH 6.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McVicar et al., 2014</xref>). As HSPB5 must function under stress conditions, we sought to investigate effects of pH on its structure and function. sHSPs have three structural regions, each of which plays a role in oligomer assembly. The highly conserved ACD is necessary and sufficient for dimer formation and dimers are thought to be the fundamental building blocks for oligomers. The N- and C-terminal regions appear to drive oligomer assembly, although the details of these interactions are not yet elucidated. We find that HSPB5-ACD dimers dissociate into folded monomers that are favored as the pH decreases. ITC and NMR measurements revealed a modest affinity for the ACD dimer (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 36 μM at pH 7.5, 37°C), with dimers dissociating at a rate of 400 s<sup>−1</sup>. The long β6+7 strands of two subunits align in an antiparallel fashion to form the dimer interface. This structure with its associated H-bonds might be expected to afford higher affinity. The juxtaposition of Glu-117 and Glu-117′ in the middle of the interface and the positively and negatively charged patches that cross the interface may contribute to the modest affinity and to the dynamics and plasticity we observed in the interface. Dimer affinity decreases 15-fold over 1 pH unit (pH 7.5 to pH 6.5) and this likely corresponds to a similar fold increase in the rate of dissociation at the dimer interface. A pH-dependent destabilization of the HSPB5-ACD dimer interface was inferred from native MS studies performed on oligomers as a function of pH; our results offer a direct confirmation and quantification of this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldwin et al., 2011b</xref>).</p><p>We identified a histidine residue that plays a key role in ACD dimer interface stability. Substitution of His-104 with Gln or Lys decreases dimer stability substantially. NMR spectra reveal that the His-104 ring is in the more unusual of the two possible tautomeric forms, stabilized by serving as an H-bond donor. Analysis of members of the solution structure ensemble and crystal structures with the Loop 5/6-up conformation identifies several backbone carbonyls as potential H-bond acceptors for His-104: His-83, Glu-105, and Glu-106. Alteration of the H-bonding potential or geometry (as in the H104Q mutant) or charge (as in the H104K mutant and low pH) destabilizes the dimer. Among the ten human sHSPs, His-104 is the most conserved His residue, appearing in eight of ten proteins, with the non-H104-containing sHSPs having a Gln (HSPB9) or a Lys (HSPB7) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Consistent with a conserved role for His-104, the unusual tautomeric state adopted by His-104 in HSPB5 is also observed for the analogous histidines in HSPB1 (His-124) and HSPB6 (His-103) (Rajagopal and Klevit, unpublished observation).</p><p>Identification of the role of His-104 in dimer stability was unexpected because while there are histidines on the dimer interface, His-104 is not one. His-104 is located at the beginning of Loop 5/6, the loop connecting strands β5 and the dimer interface strand, β6+7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). NMR relaxation dispersion analysis of the ACD dimer revealed that residues in the dimer interface (116–123) exist in two states consistent with a dimer-monomer equilibrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Residues in Loop 5/6 have similar exchange rates suggesting that loop movements and the structural transition may be coupled. However, a rigorous demonstration that the dynamics of the two regions are coupled requires a robust determination of <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> values as a function of [ACD] for loop residues as well as interface residues and the data collected did not allow for this determination with sufficiently high confidence. Nevertheless, consistent with this notion, inter-subunit contacts are observed that involve Loop 5/6 residues: His-111 at the apex of Loop 5/6 makes contacts to Arg-120’ and Tyr-122’ across the dimer interface. These inter-subunit contacts help to position Loop 5/6 in a ‘loop up’ conformation in the solution structure at pH 7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). A majority of residues in Loop 5/6 are charged (H<sup>104</sup>-E-E-R-Q-D-E-H<sup>111</sup>) so a possible consequence of His-104 protonation, which sits at the base of the loop, is to alter the conformation or position of Loop 5/6, disrupting inter-subunit contacts involving the loop and shifting the dimer–monomer equilibrium of the HSPB5-ACD. In structures with the ‘loop up’ conformation, side chains of Arg-107 and Arg-116 are in proximity to His-104; the ‘loop down’ conformation moves Arg-107 away from His-104 and Glu-106 closer to His-104 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In sum, we propose that in both loop conformations His-104 sits at the center of a dynamic network of electrostatic and H-bonding interactions that is responsible for modulating the stability of the dimer interface.</p><p>A survey of all 17 available mammalian sHSP-ACD structures (9 HSPB5 [WT and mutants], 3 HSPB1, and 3 HSPB6) reveals that Loop 5/6 is found in two conformations; a ‘loop up’ conformation as seen in the HSPB5-ACD solution structure and a ‘loop down’ conformation. In the ‘loop up’ structures, the details of the interactions between Loop 5/6 residues across the dimer interface vary, again pointing to the plasticity of this region. Nevertheless, the residues corresponding to His-111, Asp-109, and Arg-120 are involved in all cases. Furthermore, although Loop 5/6 contains predominantly polar and/or charged residues, it is remarkably well conserved among the human sHSPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). There are several reported examples where Loop 5/6 residues affect the dimer-monomer equilibrium. In HSPB5, residues His-104, Asp-109, and His-111 have recently been implicated in Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding and the binding of divalent cation appears to destabilize the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mainz et al., 2012</xref>). In HSPB1, which has an almost identical Loop 5/6 sequence to HSPB5, substitution of the two glutamate residues that correspond to HSPB5 Glu-105 and Glu-106 to Ala resulted in monomeric HSPB1-ACD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baranova et al., 2011</xref>). Also, a Loop 5/6 mutation in HSPB1, R127W (corresponding to Arg107 in HSPB5 numbering) is reported to promote monomer over dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida-Souza et al., 2010</xref>). In each case, a change in the net charge of Loop 5/6 leads to monomer being more favored. Altogether the observations suggest a model in which properties of Loop 5/6 are coupled to the stability of the dimer interface. It is notable that inheritance of single alleles of D109H-HSPB5 or R127W-HSPB1 is associated with cataract, myofibrillar myopathy, and distal hereditary motor neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nefedova et al., 2013</xref>). Both mutations alter the net charge of Loop 5/6, implying a critical role for structural and/or dynamic properties of Loop 5/6 in sHSP function.</p><p>Moving into the context of full-length HSPB5, we found that decreasing pH or substituting His-104 has dramatic effects on oligomer dimensions and subunit stoichiometry. A continuum of oligomer sizes is observed that trends reciprocally with ACD dimer interface stability. H104K-HSPB5, whose ACD will be predominantly monomeric, assembles into the largest oligomers containing over 40 subunits. While the notion that dimers are the fundamental building blocks of sHSP oligomers may describe the situation under certain conditions, our results indicate that oligomers can also be built from monomeric subunits and from combinations of dimeric and monomeric units and that more monomeric subunits can be incorporated into a given oligomer. This revelation will be important in any future attempts to determine HSPB5 oligomer structures for oligomers larger than the 24-mer previously determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jehle et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The His-104 mutants allowed us to ask if and how the dimer interface contributes to holdase function without the confounding complications of comparing aggregation of model denatured client proteins at differing pHs. Both dimer-destabilizing mutations yield an HSPB5 that can delay aggregation of model clients longer than the wild-type protein at pH 7.5. Unexpectedly, the His-104 mutant proteins, which form much larger oligomers than WT-HSPB5, reorganize to form long-lived complexes with a client protein. EM images reveal particles that are markedly smaller and distinct from the mostly spherical sHSP-alone structures. During the time period in which WT-HSPB5 inhibits client protein aggregation, we were unable to detect a complex with the client, either by SEC or by EM. Thus, the mutant sHSPB5 species perform holdase function via a different mechanism from the wild-type protein at pH 7.5. WT-HSPB5 acts via weak-and-transient interactions while the mutants act via stronger-and-longer interactions. Notably, two inherited missense mutations in HSPB1 associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome, R127W-HPSB1 (in Loop 5/6) and S135F-HSPB1 (on the dimer interface), engage in stronger, longer-lived interactions with client proteins than the WT-HSPB1, as evidenced from tandem affinity purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida-Souza et al., 2010</xref>). Two client binding modes have been observed in studies of the highly related HSPB4 (αA-crystallin), dubbed ‘high capacity’ and ‘low capacity’ based on differing client:sHSP stoichiometries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McHaourab et al., 2002</xref>). It remains for future studies to ascertain whether these reflect the species observed and reported here.</p><p>Solid-state NMR studies of WT-HSPB5 oligomers at pH 7.5 revealed three types of inter-subunit interactions: (1) ACD-to-ACD (i.e., the dimer interface), (2) C-terminal region-to-ACD, and (3) N-terminal region to either ACD or other N-terminal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jehle et al., 2011</xref>). The findings in the current study indicate that the relative strength and, perhaps, abundance of these interactions can affect not only the size and structure of oligomers but also the way in which client proteins are recognized. Subunit exchange in WT-HSPB5 is orders of magnitude slower than the exchange rate we measured for the dimer-to-monomer transition (10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> vs ca. 10<sup>3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, at pH 7.5, 37°C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peschek et al., 2013</xref>). So, while breaking the dimer interface is not the rate-limiting step in subunit exchange, destabilizing the ACD dimer yields oligomers that can more readily disassemble to form smaller species with clients and these complexes must be more stable than the mutant sHSP oligomers themselves. Long-lived sHSP-client complexes have been detected by SEC for Hsp18.1 from peas, but the complexes formed are larger than those of Hsp18.1 in the absence of client (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stengel et al., 2010</xref>). Hsp26 from yeast also forms larger complexes with client than in the absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Franzmann et al., 2005</xref>). These examples contrast with our findings, which imply that HSPB5 has evolved to perform its holdase function via weak-and-transient interactions and that small perturbations can unleash a second, cryptic mode of client interaction (long-and-strong). The highly charged ACD dimer interface and the proximal Loop 5/6 provide exquisite sensitivity to small changes in electrostatic environment that can be effected by slight changes in pH, temperature, divalent cations, other cellular conditions, and mutations. Of the approximately twenty inherited disease-related missense mutations documented in ACD regions of human sHSPs, more than half are in residues on the dimer interface or in Loop 5/6 and all these involve substitutions of charged residues.</p><p>Our original intent was to define how HSPB5 functions under pH conditions associated with stress-induced acidosis. Our results show unequivocally that the dimer interface stability decreases over a physiologically relevant pH range and that mutation (or protonation) of a single histidine residue is sufficient to destabilize the dimer. The His-104 mutants provide several general insights regarding the modulation of structure and function of sHSPs. First, the stability of an ACD dimer interface relative to other interactions involved in oligomer formation can modulate holdase function. In our study, destabilization of the dimer interface leads to enhanced holdase activity. It remains to be seen if the converse will be true. Second, dimer stability can be modulated by residues other than the dimer interface itself. Such effects are likely achieved through a network of conserved charged residues that ultimately favor or disfavor the dimer over monomer. Third, relatively small changes in pH or single missense mutations are capable of shifting HSPB5 from a weak, transient mode of client interaction to one that involves long-lived co-complexes. We propose that the continuum of oligomeric structures we observe for HSPB5 under differing pH (or mutation) may lead to a continuum of client-binding modes that allow the sHSP to ramp its holdase activity up or down as conditions require. A thorough understanding of the ways in which sHSP structure and activity can be modulated under differing cellular conditions will ultimately provide much needed insights into the cellular functions of this important, but previously intractable class of protein chaperones.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein purification and Cloning</title><p>HSPB5 and HSPB5-ACD (residues 64-152) were expressed and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jehle et al., 2009</xref>).

Data were processed with NMRPipe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delaglio et al., 1995</xref>) and analyzed with NMRViewJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johnson, 2004</xref>) and CcpNmr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vranken et al., 2005</xref>). NOEs were binned into short (3 Å), medium (4 Å), and long-range constraints (5 Å) and input as distance restraints into RosettaOligomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sgourakis et al., 2011</xref>). Intermolecular NOEs in homodimeric proteins are usually obtained from edited/filtered-type NOESY experiments on a mixed sample containing labeled and unlabeled protein. This method failed in the case of WT-ACD due to signal-to-noise issues. A preliminary structure of the dimer was determined with CS-Rosetta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vernon et al., 2013</xref>) and RosettaDock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schueler-Furman et al., 2005</xref>) (see below). The β-sandwich fold was determined from CS-Rosetta using backbone chemical shifts. RosettaDock gave a model of the dimer in the APIII register (where residue R116 from each subunit is across from each other). Using this preliminary model, intra- and inter-molecular NOEs could be parsed out from <sup>15</sup>N-edited and <sup>13</sup>C-edited NOESY spectra. The Hα-Hα NOEs observed in the <sup>13</sup>C-edited NOESY spectra unambiguously confirmed the APII register as the dimer interface (Glu-117-Glu-117′ across from each other). Intra- and inter-molecular NOE restraints, <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N RDCs, and all chemical shifts including the backbone and side-chain were input into RosettaOligomer for the final determination of the WT-ACD dimer structure.</p><p><sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were measured on a 500-µM protein sample dissolved in 500 µl of NMR buffer containing 10% Pf1 phage obtained from ASLA biotech. IPAP (In-Phase/Anti-Phase) <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra were acquired in-house on a Bruker Avance III 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a z-gradient, triple resonance cryoprobe. Spectra were analyzed in NMRView to obtain the values of RDCs. The program PALES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zweckstetter et al., 2004</xref>) was used to calculate RDCs for the different structures published in literature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RosettaOligomer</title><p>The Rosetta symmetric fold-and-dock protocol can be used to determine the structure of symmetric homodimers. Starting from an extended chain, this protocol simultaneously explores the folding and docking degrees of freedom. It consists of four low-resolution stages of increasing complexity in the energy function, in which symmetric fragment insertions are interleaved with symmetric rigid-body trials. During the low-resolution step, side chains are represented using a single, residue-specific pseudo-atom, positioned at the Cα carbon. Finally, symmetric repacking of the side chains and gradient-based minimization of the side chain, rigid body, and backbone degrees of freedom are applied. In this high-resolution step, Rosetta's full-atom energy function is used. The conformational search is largely guided by experimental data, including intra- and inter-molecular NOE distance constraints and RDCs. A penalty term that is proportional to the rmsd between experimental and calculated data was used in Rosetta during the Monte Carlo trials and gradient-based minimization. NOE distances are modeled as atom pair constraints in Rosetta. For a structural model, RDCs are fitted using Levenberg–Marquardt non-linear square fitting algorithm. The orientations of alignment tensor are optimized, while keeping the axial component (Dα) and Rhombic component (R) of the alignment tensor fixed. The values of Dα and R of 21.5 and 0.35, respectively, were estimated from a powder pattern distribution of the RDC data. A total of 10,000 models are generated, of which 1000 lowest ones are selected for cluster analysis. Ten models with the lowest Rosetta full-atom energy in the best-ranked cluster were selected as the final structural ensemble and deposited in the Protein Databank as PDB 2N0K.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>pH titration and determination of pK<sub>R</sub> by NMR</title><p><sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC-TROSY spectra were acquired on WT-ACD (200 µM) in NMR buffer at pH values 9.3, 8.56, 7.86, 7.44, 7.0, 6.83, 6.7, 6.52, and 6.0 at 22°C on an in-house Avance III 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a z-gradient, triple resonance probe. The pH of the solution was adjusted by adding small aliquots of 1N HCl or NaOH. The long-range correlations between the ring carbon-bound hydrogens (H<sup>ε1</sup> and H<sup>δ2</sup>) and the ring nitrogens (N<sup>ε2</sup> and N<sup>δ1</sup>) give information on the tautomeric states of the histidines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pelton et al., 1993</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Volker Dötsch, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a well written paper reporting, unexpectedly, that a human sHsp highly conserved histidine some distance from the alpha-crystallin domain dimer interface, modulates the stability of that interface as a function of pH, over a physiological range. The authors provide a range of convincing evidence, and also show that the effect is specific to His-104 (in the sequence of αB-crystallin). They provide a well argued overview of likely correlated structural changes. Using single site mutations they provide evidence that loss of His-104 results in large oliogmers built predominantly from monomers that function as stronger holdases than wild-type. They exploit this observation to isolate complexes of sHsp and model substrate that are smaller (unusually) than the native assembly.</p><p>Overall, this is a nice study that provides a consistent picture of the importance of the oligomeric state of this chaperone and the transitions between these different states.</p><p>Some points to clarify:</p><p>1) The authors claim that: “The two positions of Loop 5/6 were noted in an earlier analysis of HSPB5-ACD structures and proposed to be correlated to differences in pH among structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 2011</xref>). However, our analysis of the larger number of structures now available reveals that the Loop 5/6 position does not correlate with pH or with dimer register, suggesting it is a dynamic component of the structure under all conditions.”</p><p>This seems like a contradiction of their model that the position of this loop and its cross-interface interactions are important for determining the oligomeric state and that this changes with pH.</p><p>2) Does this loop show a higher mobility (sharper lines, longer T<sub>2</sub> times) than the rest of the protein? This would indeed indicate a high flexibility.</p><p>3) What are potential hydrogen bonding partners of His 104 and how does this interaction stabilize the dimer and why is it disrupted by protonation. Since this is the central mechanistical result of this study, the authors should provide a possible model. A detailed figure of the structure around this loop region would also be important.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07304.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors claim that: “The two positions of Loop 5/6 were noted in an earlier analysis of HSPB5-ACD structures and proposed to be correlated to differences in pH among structures (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8"><italic>Clark et al., 2011</italic></xref><italic>).

When we went back to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al, 2011</xref>, we found they had not proposed the loop conformer to be a function of pH. We have therefore removed that inaccuracy and changed the text to: “Thus, among structures solved between pH 6.5 and 7.5, both loop conformations have been observed, suggesting that the loop is dynamic in the physiological pH range”.</p><p><italic>2) Does this loop show a higher mobility (sharper lines, longer T</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub> <italic>times) than the rest of the protein? This would indeed indicate a high flexibility</italic>.</p><p>The <sup>15</sup>N T<sub>2</sub> values are, on average 30-40 msec for the ACD dimer. Only residues at the extreme termini show longer values. Importantly, resonances that arise from the dimer interface and from Loop 5/6 have <italic>shorter</italic> T<sub>2</sub> values than the average (&lt;30 msec), indicating that they undergo a change in their environment in the millisecond timescale. That is why we turned to the <sup>15</sup>N relaxation-compensated CPMG relaxation dispersion measurements experiments, which specifically report on processes in the millisecond time regime. We have clarified this point in the subsection “NMR solution structure and <sup>15</sup>N relaxation reveal conformational plasticity in HSPB5-ACD”.</p><p><italic>3) What are potential hydrogen bonding partners of His 104 and how does this interaction stabilize the dimer and why is it disrupted by protonation. Since this is the central mechanistical result of this study, the authors should provide a possible model. A detailed figure of the structure around this loop region would also be important</italic>.</p><p>There are several backbone carbonyl groups (His-83, Glu-105, Glu-106) and several side chain groups (Arg-107 and Arg-116) in proximity to His-104 in members of the solution ensemble. We have added that information in the subsection “A conserved histidine is responsible for destabilization of the HSPB5-ACD dimer” and in the Discussion. The same group of interacting groups is also seen, in different combinations, in crystal structures that have the Loop 5/6-“up” conformation. We therefore believe that this is a dynamic network of interactions and are hesitant to show a detailed static picture that would only reflect one of the many possible sets of interactions as a figure in the main text. Nevertheless, analysis of structures in the Loop 5/6-“down” conformation reveals that potential interactors move away from His-104 in this state, namely the side chain of Arg-107, and others appear to move into proximity, namely the side chain of Glu-106. We propose that in both loop conformations His-104 sits at the center of a dynamic network of electrostatic and H-bonding interactions that is responsible for modulating the stability of the dimer interface. We have clarified this point in the Discussion and have added a supplemental figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>–figure supplement 1 that shows the relevant region of ensemble members and an example of a loop-up and loop-down structure.</p></body></sub-article></article>
