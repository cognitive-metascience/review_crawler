We investigated the ribbon’s contribution to IHC synapse formation and function using KO mice lacking RIBEYE. Despite loss of the entire ribbon structure, synapses retained their spatiotemporal development and KO mice had a mild hearing deficit. IHCs of KO had fewer synaptic vesicles and reduced exocytosis in response to brief depolarization; a high stimulus level rescued exocytosis in KO. SGNs exhibited a lack of sustained excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). We observed larger postsynaptic glutamate receptor plaques, potentially compensating for the reduced EPSC rate in KO. Surprisingly, large-amplitude EPSCs were maintained in KO, while a small population of low-amplitude slower EPSCs was increased in number. The ribbon facilitates signal transduction at physiological stimulus levels by retaining a larger residency pool of synaptic vesicles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic ribbons</kwd><kwd>hair cells</kwd><kwd>ribeye</kwd><kwd>auditory</kwd><kwd>multivesicular release</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC009913</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ricci</surname><given-names>Anthony J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000703</institution-id><institution>Action on Hearing Loss</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rutherford</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC014712</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rutherford</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC013721</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Niwa</surname><given-names>Mamiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 44992</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ricci</surname><given-names>Anthony J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01-DC000002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Willy</given-names></name><name><surname>Kachar</surname><given-names>Bechara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIC DC000081</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Willy</given-names></name><name><surname>Kachar</surname><given-names>Bechara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The auditory hair cell synaptic ribbon maintains vesicle pools near release sites in order to support sustained and timed vesicle release.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The synaptic ribbon is an electron dense structure associated with presynaptic active zones at sensory synapses in the retina, lateral line and inner ear organs. RIBEYE is the major protein associated with the ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zanazzi and Matthews, 2009</xref>).It consists of a unique amino-terminal A domain, which forms the ribbon scaffold, and a carboxy-terminal B domain with lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity, which is almost identical to CtBP2, a transcriptional co-repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schmitz et al., 2000</xref>). The ribbon is anchored to the presynaptic membrane by Bassoon protein in mammalian IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khimich et al., 2005</xref>) as well as in retinal photoreceptors and bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dick et al., 2001</xref>). Although it is comprised predominantly of RIBEYE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zenisek et al., 2004</xref>), the ribbon complex may associate with over 30 different synaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Uthaiah and Hudspeth, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kantardzhieva et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>IHCs respond to sound with graded receptor potentials that drive rapid and precise synaptic release, encoding intensity and timing information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Matthews and Fuchs, 2010</xref>). The ribbon is thought to sustain continuous encoding by tethering a pool of vesicles that replenishes the local pool of docked and primed vesicles upon depletion. Other functions ascribed to the ribbon include: regulating vesicle trafficking from the cytoplasm to the active zone and serving as a vesicle trap to bind freely diffusing vesicles, as a location for vesicle formation, as a physical barrier for Ca<sup>2+</sup> ensuring a high local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, and as a primary structural component of the synapse anchoring Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels close to synaptic vesicle release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Parsons et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Frank et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graydon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kantardzhieva et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Postsynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) at ribbon synapses range in amplitude by up to 20-fold. The smallest and largest EPSCs have similar kinetics, which together suggest the existence of a mechanism to synchronize the release of multiple quanta (multivesicular release, MVR; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Glowatzki and Fuchs, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schnee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rudolph et al., 2015</xref>]). By holding vesicles and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the active zone, the ribbon may support MVR, occurring through various mechanisms including: (i) coordinated fusion of multiple single vesicles, (ii) release of large pre-fused vesicles, (iii) rapid sequential fusion in which the first fusion event triggers fusion of additional vesicles, or (iv) some combination of these mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Matthews and Fuchs, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Previous attempts to study ribbon function used genetic disruption of the anchoring protein Bassoon or acute destruction of the ribbon by fluorophore-assisted light inactivation (FALI). These manipulations resulted in smaller vesicle pool size, calcium channel mislocalization, increased auditory thresholds, asynchrony in neural responses and reductions in both tonic and phasic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Snellman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jing et al., 2013</xref>). However, neither of those manipulations were selective for the ribbon and so might be manifestations of accessory protein denaturing.</p><p>Recently, manipulation of the gene encoding CtBP2/RIBEYE allowed for deletion of RIBEYE by removing the A-domain of <italic>ctbp2</italic> to eliminate ribbons in mice, enabling a more precise examination of ribbon function. This mouse will be referred to as KO and the littermate controls as WT throughout the manuscript. Elimination of ribbons in the retina reduced phasic and tonic transmission and rendered release sites sensitive to the slow calcium buffer EGTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maxeiner et al., 2016</xref>). Here we present analysis of cochlear synaptic anatomy, hair cell and afferent fiber physiology and hearing function in the RIBEYE knockout mouse. Results are distinct from those in the retina and from a RIBEYE deletion in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lv et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting a more subtle function for the ribbon than previously assumed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IHC-sSpiral ganglia neuron (SGN) synapses are formed and maintained despite absence of the ribbon</title><p>The inner ear structure of the KO was assessed first for the presence of synaptic ribbons and synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maxeiner et al., 2016</xref>).

Bassoon and Homer puncta were similar in number in WT and KO mice (Bassoon — 40 ± 15 in WT, 43 ± 12 in KO, p=0.76; Homer — 17 ± 3 for both WT and KO; WT — n = 20 mice, KO — n = 19 mice, p=0.64). The number of paired Homer and Bassoon puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) were similarly comparable: 14 ± 2 (n = 20) for WT and 13 ± 2 (n = 19) for KO IHCs (p=0.18), suggesting that synapses were formed and maintained in comparable numbers regardless of the presence of ribbons. The higher number of Bassoon puncta probably reflects its localization at efferent synapses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> presents a lower-magnification image that illustrates the multiple roles of Bassoon at the auditory periphery. Bassoon is a major component of the presynaptic elements at the auditory periphery, including the efferent fibers and the hair cell afferent synapses. Thus it is not surprising that paired Bassoon puncta are much fewer in number than total puncta, because Bassoon serves multiple synapses. Similarly, when interpreting Bassoon KO data, it is not surprising that the KO phenotype may be more dramatic than the RIBEYE effect alone due to number of synapses involved and the scaffolding function of Bassoon that leads to structural changes at the synapse.</p><p>RIBEYE KO in zebrafish revealed a non-osmiophilic structure resembling a ribbon, which maintained organization of synaptic vesicles in the absence of the RIBEYE protein in hair cells of the lateral line neuromasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lv et al., 2016</xref>). We examined whether such a structure existed in the mammalian cochlea in the IHCs of the KO using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron-tomography. Representative examples of conventional TEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, 70 nm sections) and tomographic reconstructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>, 10 nm tomographic sections) are presented. The KO presynaptic synapses consistently showed a small osmiophilic density in contact with the pre-synaptic membrane at the center of the synapse, which resembled the arciform density seen at ribbon synapses in the retina. This density may be the Bassoon-enriched linker between the membrane and the ribbon. Interestingly, this density is not observed in the Bassoon KO mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Frank et al., 2010</xref>). Tomographic reconstructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, right) clearly show the presynaptic density, which is smaller than the ribbon and is present also at ribbon synapses in WT IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, left). We found no spatial organization of vesicles near active zones in KO IHCs, suggestive of the ‘ghost’ ribbons observed in the zebrafish lateral-line hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lv et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, in the KO mouse, IHCs lack synaptic ribbons and have no obvious compensatory structures. We surmise that the differences observed in the zebrafish model are a function of the KO being incomplete or there being a compensation mechanism in zebrafish that is not found in mammals.</p><p>KO IHCs may upregulate a similar protein to replace the lost RIBEYE. CtBP1 is a good candidate because it is similar to the RIBEYE-B domain, is expressed in hair cells and localizes to the synaptic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kantardzhieva et al., 2013</xref>). Antibody labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,K,L</xref>) demonstrates the presence of CtBP1 in both WT and KO animals, which overlapped with that of Homer in WT animals. A reduction in puncta number was identified in the KO animal due to loss of localization at the afferent synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K,L</xref>). Thus, the CtBP1 localization at the synapse requires the presence of RIBEYE, and CtBP1 does not substitute for RIBEYE in the KO animal.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Synaptic vesicles are normal in size but fewer in number</title><p>Vesicle diameters (distance between the outer edges of the bilayer in each vesicle) were measured in the reconstructed tomograms. We measured in both X and Y directions with no differences observed. In the WT, the average vesicle diameter was 33.6 ± 3 nm (n = 21), and in the KO, it was 33.8 ± 3 nm (n = 21).</p><p>Synaptic vesicles were conspicuously fewer in number the KO. Vesicles were counted in volumes around the center of the reconstructed synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), where one boundary was the presynaptic membrane.

DPOAEs are a direct measure of outer hair cell function and cochlear amplification. DPOAEs are not expected to be affected by the absence of RIBEYE and serve as a control for the developmental acquisition of mature cochlear mechanics. DPOAE threshold measurements were not different across frequencies from 4 to 46 kHz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Data are presented in decibels (dB) as referenced to sound pressure level (SPL) with lower values indicating enhanced sensitivity in the mid-cochlea. Normal DPOAEs indicate that cochlear amplification was not effected mechanically by the loss of outer hair cell ribbons, suggesting that sound-driven activation of IHCs was intact, and that any differences in auditory nerve activity should result from changes at the IHC afferent synapses.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30241.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Hearing in RIBEYE knockout mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distortion products of otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) show no significant differences in the tested frequency range (4–46 kHz in half-octave increments) between KO (red, n = 30) and WT littermates (blue, n = 22), suggesting normal outer hair cell function.

The subsequent waves of the ABR reflect the ensuing activation of brainstem nuclei in the ascending auditory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zheng et al., 1999</xref>). ABR thresholds were elevated by approximately 10 dB at all probe frequencies in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), except for at 48 kHz, where hearing threholds are already relatively high. The variance in our control data ranged from 8-12dB depending on frequency; this dictated the sample size needed to detect a 5% change as statistically different. ABR threshold was identified as the stimulus intensity required to evoke a voltage response 5x the root mean square (RMS) noise floor for the measurement. The companion paper found a similar elevation in threshold though it did not reach statistical significance. The difference is probably due to sampling size, where we powered our sample size on the basis of variance found in control measurements. The ABR waveform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>: 23 kHz, 60 dB) shows a large reduction in wave 1 amplitude with no effect on the subsequent peaks. This was surprising and suggests considerable plasticity in the central processing of data translated from the cochlea periphery. KO mice had smaller wave 1 peak amplitudes, for all sound levels that evoked a response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). When wave 1 growth functions were plotted relative to the maximal response amplitude within a genotype, the amplitude versus level function for KO scaled up to overlap with that for WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Considering wave 1 amplitude as a fraction of the maximal amplitude, the overlap of the normalized wave 1 growth curves suggested that loss of maximum output could produce an elevation of threshold in the ABR measurement, which does not necessarily reflect a sound detection limit or a change in the sensitivity of the auditory system. Indeed, normal ABR amplitudes beyond wave 1 indicate compensation in the cochlear nucleus. Future work should determine whether KO mice have increased behavioral thresholds.</p><p>In mice lacking Bassoon function, where IHCs lacked most of their membrane-anchored ribbons, there was an increase in wave 1 latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khimich et al., 2005</xref>) and in first-spike latency in recordings of SGNs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Buran et al., 2010</xref>). ABR wave 1 latencies did not differ between WT and KO at any stimulus intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), suggesting a milder phenotype in the KO as compared to mice with impaired Bassoon function.</p><p>As the ABR measurements are averaged responses of 260 stimulus repetitions, a possible explanation for the reduced ABR wave 1 amplitude in KO is that the response reduces over time. If the ribbon is providing a means of maintaining vesicles near the synapse, the concomitant loss of vesicles at ribbonless synapses might reduce the ongoing response to repetitive stimulation. Comparison of ABR amplitudes when the number of repeats was varied from 260 to 1000 showed no difference in amplitudes, nor did repeated measurements meant to evoke depletion. Thus, rundown alone is unlikely to account for the decrease in ABR wave 1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Characterization of molecular synaptic components indicates an increase in postsynaptic glutamate receptor distribution</title><p>To begin to identify cellular mechanisms that might underlie the measured reduction in ABR wave 1 amplitude, we investigated the distribution of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and postsynaptic glutamate receptors as indicators of functional synapses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> presents immunohistochemical localizations of presynaptic ribbons with anti-CtBP2, presynaptic voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels with anti-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3, and postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors with anti-GluA3 in P35 mice organ of corti.

The linear component was 52 ± 24 fF (n = 15, WT) compared to 42 ± 22 fF (n = 15, KO); and the superlinear component of release was 223 ± 79 fF (n = 17, WT) compared to 253 ± 116 fF (n = 17, KO).

In addition, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of release for the linear component was not different (0.9 ± 0.03 fF/pC, n = 37, for the WT as compared to 0.93 ± 0.03 fF/pC, n = 34, for the KO).

However, the widths of the functions were different, with values of 7.6 ± 2 for WT compared to 14.3 ± 3 for KO (p&lt;0.002). Thus, although the variance in release properties increased for the KO animals, there were no major differences in the ability of the synapses to respond to strong stimuli.</p><p>In contrast to the comparable maximal responses, smaller depolarizations revealed a reduction in release at early time points in the KO. The difference observed was masked at longer time points or by stronger depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–J</xref>). Comparing capacitance changes at short intermediate and longer time points in response to smaller depolarizations showed that the KO consistently had reduced release as compared to the WT. Fitting the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref> with a simple exponential demonstrated that, although both genotyes reached the same values of release with strong depolarizations, the relationships varied in two ways. For the shortest time point, release started at −40 mV as compared to −45 mV, with all other variables remaining constant. Given that the numbers for release are quite small and variable, conclusions should be conservative, but support the argument that fewer vesicles are available for release at this early time point and that recruitment is minimal. For the longer time point <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, the voltage-dependence (Cm/Vm) varied between groups, being 7.3 ± 3.6 for WT as compared to 12.7 ± 5.8 for KO. F-tests show these fits to be different at the p&lt;0.002 level. Longer time points, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I,J</xref>, show no difference between groups. In addition, for smaller depolarizations, the delay to release onset was greater in the KO IHCs, consistent with a reduction in the number of vesicles immediately available for release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). For example, depolarizations to −44 mV resulted in significantly shorter latency in WT (102 ± 98 ms, n = 16) compared to KO (204 ± 166 ms, n = 17, p=0.039). Stronger depolarizations (&gt;−39 mV) resulted in no difference in release latency. The time constants of endocytosis were not significantly different (6.0 ± 4 s, n = 13, WT and 7 ± 5 s, n = 13, KO). Together these data suggest that fewer vesicles were available for release at ribbonless synapses, but that with stronger depolarizations or longer time courses of depolarization, the recruitment of additional vesicles masked this immediate difference in release latency and amplitude.</p><p>The ribbon may be a barrier to Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion, creating a restricted space for sharp Ca<sup>2+</sup> nanodomains beneath the ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Roberts, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graydon et al., 2011</xref>). Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering can alter the release properties, depending on the relative distributions of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and release sites. In the retina, the KO increases buffering efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maxeiner et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting looser coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and release sites. To investigate the effects of ribbon absence on stimulus-secretion coupling in P11–P13 IHCs, we compared between genotypes the effects on release properties of changing concentration of the slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Examples of release obtained with either 0.1 or 5 mM EGTA are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> (control experiments all use 1 mM EGTA). Although increasing buffer concentration reduced release and lowering buffer increased release, the relative changes were comparable between WT and KO mice for release measured at 1 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Data previously demonstrated that increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering increased the time to superlinear release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schnee et al., 2011b</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> demonstrates that this effect is retained in the KO and that there are no major differences between WT and KO modulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering. These results contrast with findings from retinal bipolar cells and in the zebrafish KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maxeiner et al., 2016</xref>; see Discussion). Similarly, release rates measured for steps to −45 mV were not significantly different for the initial release components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We further investigated the first component of release, typically thought to represent vesicles in early release pools, not requiring trafficking. Comparing release at two voltages again showed that the buffer greatly altered release properties but not in a way that differed between genotypes. However, it should be noted that the difference in early release observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> with 1 mM EGTA was lost with 0.1 mM EGTA.

The start of the high K<sup>+</sup> response was defined as the point at which the mean EPSC rate exceeded the rate in normal external solution by two standard deviations. Examples of postsynaptic responses to K<sup>+</sup> applications are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–D</xref>. Two types of responses were observed, sustained responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>) and transient responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). WT responses were mainly of the sustained type (7 of 8), whereas the KO responses included a smaller proportion of sustained responses (7 of 11).

The peak release rates varied considerably across fiber populations (0–120 s<sup>−1</sup>) and there was a tendency for the KO neurons to reach a lower peak EPSC rate on average: 57 ± 30 s<sup>−1</sup> (n = 11) for WT compared with 44 ± 31 s<sup>−1</sup> (n = 18) for KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>).</p><p>The time to peak EPSC rate was less variable than the absolute rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>).

Frequency histograms of EPSC amplitudes could be fit with either a double Gaussian function or a Gaussian and gamma function, where the smallest peak was always fit by a Gaussian function (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J,K</xref>). The area under the smaller peak was calculated and plotted as a percentage of the total in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>, where the KO showed a statistically larger (p=0.034) percentage of small events at 5.5 ± 5.6% (n = 12) as compared to 1 ± 0.7% (n = 7) for WT. The increase in number of small events might suggest less coordination in release because there are fewer vesicles filling release sites. It might also suggest that smaller responses are visible because of an increase in receptor plaque size. Only fibers with more than 100 EPSCs were included for this analysis. No difference was found in the proportion of simple events for each unit, where a simple event is described as having a single rise and decay phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8M</xref>). We also compared the median amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8N</xref>). Although there was a tendency for EPSCs in the KO to be greater in amplitude (212 ± 46 pA, n = 13) than those in the WT (173 ± 36 pA, n = 7), the values were not statistically different. A difference here would support the argument for a postsynaptic compensatory increase in glutamate receptor plaque size. The coefficients of variation (CV) for the amplitude distributions were different on average (p=0.017; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8O</xref>). The control values are similar to those obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al. (2009</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grant et al. (2010</xref>).

As the ribbon is proposed to be involved with multivesicular release (MVR), and the kinetic similarities between large and small EPSCs are a signature of MVR, we investigated the decay of EPSCs in auditory nerve fiber recordings from WT and KO animals. Fitting the EPSC decay with single exponentials provided time constants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Calculating the CVs of EPSC decay time constants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) revealed more variability in KO but no significant difference compared to WT. The skewness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>) of the decay time constant distributions was significantly larger for the KO (0.46 ± 0.2, n = 13) compared to WT (0.29 ± 0.07, n = 7; p=0.04); the KO mean EPSC decay time was greater than the median decay time. In the WT population, 0.44% of EPSCs were &lt;100 pA in amplitude with decay time constants &gt;1 ms, whereas 1.9% of KO events fell into that category. Plotting the decay time constant against amplitude for each EPSC in all fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>) (WT — n = 7 recordings, 15,564 EPSCs; KO — n = 13 recordings, 17,210 EPSCs) identifies a population of small slow EPSCs in the KO that are present in greater proportion in these fibres than in WT fibres (upper left quadrant). The mean EPSC decay time constants, when plotted as a function of EPSC amplitude for each recording (bin of 10 pA), illustrate that all of the KO fibers had a proportion of EPSCs with slow time courses, whereas the WT have only two fibers with these slower events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). An example of the smaller, slower EPSC is provided in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>. The distributions of EPSC durations for all EPSCs &lt;100 pA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G,H</xref>) demonstrates the shift toward slower longer duration EPSCs in KO fibers (p&gt;0.001, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). The cumulative probability functions of EPSC duration for all fibers by genotype (thick red and blue lines) illustrate the larger proportion of slow EPSCs in the KO fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H</xref>). These data may also support the argument for a larger postsynaptic glutamate receptor plaque, where diffusion of glutamate, coupled with the lower glutamate concentration, might serve to slow the decay kinetics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The KO mouse provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the functional relevance of synaptic ribbons in driving information transfer at the primary auditory synapse.

These data agree qualitatively with the companion paper data, the lack of significance probably being a function of the sample size. The minor auditory deficit may not be expected to produce a change in behavioral sound detection threshold as the ensuing ABR peaks, representing brainstem nuclei, were unaffected. Alternatively, central compensation that masks peripheral deficits might occur. These data suggest that the ribbon is not essential for setting hearing threshold, and that its role in auditory function is more nuanced than, for example, that of otoferlin, which when absent or altered leads to deafness with threshold elevations of more than 100 dB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pangrsic et al., 2010</xref>). Further work is needed to better understand ribbon function at the systems level. Additional testing to better investigate auditory processing, such as sound localization experiments, may provide additional insight into how the ribbon might serve systems-level function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Synapse formation</title><p>Synapse formation is surprisingly normal in KO with an appropriate number of synapses and synaptic markers present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Little change in Ca<sup>2+-</sup>channel distribution or biophysics were observed in the KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) relative to animals in which Bassoon is disrupted, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+-</sup>channel distribution or regulation does not depend critically on the ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Frank et al., 2010</xref>). Our companion paper identifies minor changes in Ca<sup>2+-</sup>channel distribution and voltage sensitivity at older ages; but whether these changes are a function of ribbon absence or activity-dependent modulation remains to be explored. The lack of effect on calcium-channel properties and distributions at early ages supports the hypothesis that there is a compensatory mechanism that occurs later during synapse maturation. Given the reports of late development changes in ribbon size and glutamate receptor plaque sizes, activity-driven shaping of the synapses is a reasonable expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fernandez et al., 2015</xref>). Postsynaptically, both Homer and the glutamate receptors had larger volumes in the KO animals than in WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This change also may be an indication of activity-dependent synaptic shaping, where the reduced activity in KO animals results in a postsynaptic upregulation of receptors. The increase in the population of larger amplitude EPSCs in KO animals further supports this conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8I,J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Comparison to other systems</title><p>In zebrafish, a frameshift mutation was used to eliminate RIBEYE from ribbon synapses. This work revealed ghost-like ribbons where vesicles were organized around invisible ribbon-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lv et al., 2016</xref>). Neither our investigations, nor the companion paper nor the original work investigating the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maxeiner et al., 2016</xref>) found comparable ghosts in the KO mouse. We would conclude that either the frame-shift approach did not account for all RIBEYE or there is a strong compensatory mechanism in zebrafish that is not found or is much weaker in mammals. We investigated CTBP1 as a potential compensatory molecule, but as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows, there is no labeling near synapses in the KO mouse. The presence of ribbons in photoreceptors of zebrafish KO support the idea that there are fundamental differences between zebrafish and mammalian systems. In addition, work in zebrafish suggests a tight reciprocal relationship between calcium-channel numbers, calcium-current amplitude and ribbon size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lv et al., 2016</xref>). As no changes in calcium-channel distribution or numbers were observed in the KO animal, despite the loss of the ribbon, this relationship does not appear to exist in mammals or is greatly reduced, again supporting fundamental differences between model organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Mechanism of ABR amplitude reduction</title><p>The decrease in ABR amplitude is probably a function of the reduced frequency of EPSCs, leading to the generation of fewer action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). In addition, the increase in proportion of EPSCs that have lower amplitudes and longer durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H</xref>) is expected to increase the likelihood of spike generation failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rutherford et al., 2012</xref>). As larger EPSCs are better phase-locked than smaller EPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2014</xref>) and present works finds a 5–10% increase in smaller EPSCs, one might predict a lower vector strength and reduced phase locking. In fact, our companion paper does observe these differences in single-unit firing. Similarly, the increased population of smaller EPSCs is reminiscent of the morphology seen in young animals when compared to older animals and so might reflect a developmental delay in the KO. Fewer fibers fire together at sound onset, reducing auditory nerve synchrony and wave 1 amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Measurements of exocytosis from IHCs in response to small depolarizations, clearly showed a reduction in release and an increase in time to release in the KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). This suggests a decrease in the number of vesicles available at the synapse for immediate release (which is supported by TEM counts). The reduction in available vesicles for release, as well as the population of reduced amplitude EPSCs, might also predict a spike-timing deficit as described in the companion paper. However, the more rapid response in WT was masked by stronger stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), indicating that vesicle replenishment remained robust despite the absence of the ribbon-associated synaptic vesicle pool. Given the robust nature of vesicle trafficking, the primary role for the ribbon may be in ensuring that a population of vesicles is present for the timing of onset responses, whereas vesicle trafficking can serve to replenish vesicle populations during sustained release. A similar result was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maxeiner et al. (2016</xref>) in retina.</p><p>Postsynaptic recordings suggest that the KO reaches peak release sooner than WT and at a similar peak rate, implying that vesicle numbers for immediate release are comparable. By contrast, TEM suggests that fewer vesicles are available at the synapse, and the small increase in the population of small EPSCs also suggests a reduction in filled release sites. Thus, it is possible that the ribbon acts as a barrier for vesicle interaction with the release site, while simultaneously serving to increase the total number of available vesicles. Interestingly, this idea was first suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Furukawa and Matsuura (1978</xref>) and later supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schnee et al. (2013</xref>) as a possible mechanism for explaining neural adaptation. However, the companion paper suggests modifications at the synapse that might also be in accord with the postsynaptic measurements reported here, that is, more vesicles at the membrane. If there is an increase in presynaptic density area and more vesicles per active zone, it might be predicted that faster immediate release occurs but sustainability might be reduced, EPSC data also supports this idea. To resolve these possibililities, we need a better understanding of the molecular underpinnings of the active zone and the number of available release sites.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Synaptic vesicle replenishment for sustained release</title><p>Our data argue against a role for the ribbon in vesicle formation and replenishment. Total exocytosis, from both the linear and superlinear components, was not reduced in the KO, implying that a similar total number of vesicles could be recruited for release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A,B and</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). In contrast to the zebrafish lateral line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lv et al., 2016</xref>), we measured no change in vesicle size between KO and WT, indirectly supporting our view that the ribbon is not regulating or involved in vesicle formation, a result corroborated by the companion paper. Thus, no change in vesicle size or maximal release supports the conclusion that the ribbon is not involved in vesicle formation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Ca<sup>2+ </sup>influx and coupling to exocytosis</title><p>The ribbon may act as a barrier to Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion, creating a higher local Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that synchronizes the fusion of multiple vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graydon et al., 2011</xref>). In this case, the ribbon’s presence would reduce the sensitivity of exocytosis to exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers (by elevating concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>). Likewise, in retina from KO mice, EGTA reduced spontaneous release in the KO but not in WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maxeiner et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, our data shows that buffering efficacy was not altered in the KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), suggesting that the ribbon does not play a major role in the regulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration at IHC active zones. The similar response in WT and KO might indicate a small effect, but at a level below a clear detection limit for capacitance measurements. It is possible that the geometricand synaptic architecture differences between retina and cochlea alter the sensitivity to Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers or that the effect noted in retina is indirect, for example EGTA-AM might alter the presynaptic cell’s resting potential. Thus, our results are not fundamentally different from those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maxeiner et al. (2016</xref>), and both support the idea that the ribbon serves to consolidate vesicles near to release sites as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">von Gersdorff et al.

The majority of EPSCs measured in the KO remain large and uniformly fast in onset and decay times and the EPSC amplitude is not reduced, suggesting that the ribbon does not play a pivotal role in multivesicular release. Thus, mechanisms that involve sequential fusion of vesicles along the ribbon, and then release or rapid sequential vesicle release that piggybacks onto a release site from the ribbon, are unlikely to be valid as these should be dramatically altered by the loss of the ribbon. One remaining possibility is the synchronous release of vesicles from multiple release sites. Although the ribbon is not required for this mechanism, it may indirectly modulate this mechanism by influencing the number of docked vesicles available for release. The increase in the number of smaller slower EPSCs, probably arising from the availability of fewer docked vesicles for synchronous release, may support a ribbon role; however, the small relative contribution of this vesicle pool indicates a minor role. The phenomenon of large EPSC amplitude variability may still be explained by a univesicular mechanism that includes a dynamic fusion pore, which presumably would not require a ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chapochnikov et al., 2014</xref>). Where identified, the slow foot-like response described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chapochnikov et al., (2014</xref>) did not differ among genotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Comparison to Bassoon KO</title><p>In mice, the effects of KO are subtle compared with those of disruption of Bassoon protein. Loss-of-function mutation in Bassoon led to a reduction in the number of IHC ribbons associated with presynaptic elements, ABR threshold elevation of 30 dB, longer ABR wave 1 latency and first-spike latency, and fewer Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at active zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khimich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Buran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Frank et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jing et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the effects of loss of Bassoon protein (and membrane-anchored ribbons) were greater than those of loss of RIBEYE protein, consistent with a more critical role for Bassoon in scaffolding synaptic proteins. Also, given Bassoon’s presence at efferent synaptic endings in the organ of Corti, it is not surprising that the functional loss of Bassoon has a greater phenotype than that of RIBEYE loss (Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Summary</title><p>A central tenet for ribbon function is maintaining a large pool of vesicles near the synapse. The ribbon may serve as a conveyor belt that both maintains vesicles and traffics vesicles to release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Parsons et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nouvian et al., 2006</xref>). Our data suggest that the ribbon increases the time that a vesicle remains in the synaptic region. Robust vesicle trafficking and replenishment, via either the recycling or transport of new vesicles to the synaptic zone, provides vesicles to the synaptic zone, but the time that vesicles remain near to release sites may be shortened in the absence of the ribbon that serves to maintain them close to the synapses. A model for this basic idea has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graydon et al., 2014</xref>) that reproduced data from bipolar cell synapses. The addition of a more robust trafficking mechanism may allow this model to also reproduce hair cell synapses. The increase in variance was greater for KO, whether measured as coefficients of variance (CV), skewness or simply standard deviation in measured parameters, such as time to release, release rate and EPSC amplitude. The increased variance may simply reflect a nonuniform population of vesicles near the synapse in the absence of the ribbon. Thus, the ribbon may serve as a biological buffer, maintaining a uniform population of vesicles near release sites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice of both sexes from a mixed genetic background (C57bl6, 129/Ola) were bred from heterozygous breeding pairs and genotyped by PCR for the knockout of the A-domain of<italic>Ctbp2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maxeiner et al., 2016</xref>), while wild-type littermates served as controls.

The speakers were connected to an ear bar and calibrated in the ear canal prior to each experiment using a probe-tip microphone (microphone type 4182, NEXUS conditioning amplifier, Brüel and Kjær).</p><p>ABRs were recorded by placing three needle electrodes subcutaneously at the vertex, below the left ear, and a ground electrode close to the tail. The signals were amplified 10,000 times using a biological amplifier (Warner Instruments, DP-311) digitized at 10 kHz, and digitally band-pass filtered from 300 to 3,000 Hz. The stimulus for eliciting the ABR was a 5 ms sine wave tone pip with cos<sup>2</sup> envelope rise and fall times of 0.5 ms. The repetition time was 50 ms, and 260 trials were averaged.</p><p>At each frequency, the peak to peak voltages of ABR signals, at stimulus intensities ranging from 10 to 80 dB sound pressure levels (SPL), were measured in 10 dB steps and fitted and interpolated to find thresholds five standard deviations above the noise floor. For statistical purposes, we defined threshold as 80 dB SPL, if no ABR was detected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Distortion products of otoacoustic emission (DPOAE)</title><p>For stimulation of DPOAEs, two sine wave tones of equal intensity (l<sub>1</sub>=l<sub>2</sub>) and 1 s duration were presented to the ear. The tones ranged from 20 to 80 dB SPL attenuated in 10 dB increments and the two frequencies (f<sub>2</sub> = 1.2f<sub>1</sub>) ranged from f<sub>2</sub> with 4–46 kHz. The acoustic signaldetected by the microphone in the ear bar was sampled at 200 kHz and the magnitude of the cubic distortion product (2f<sub>1</sub>–f<sub>2</sub>) determined by FFT. Averaging 20 adjacent frequency bins surrounding the distortion product frequency determined the noise floor. DPOAE thresholds were reached when the signal was greater than three standard deviations above the noise floor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Tissue preparation, staining and confocal microscopy</title><p>For staining of pre- and postsynaptic markers, we used antibodies against Homer (Synaptic Systems, 160003, 1:800 dilution), Bassoon (AbCam, ab82958, 1:500 dilution), CtBP1 (BD-Biosciences, 612042, 1:600 dilution), CtBP2/RIBEYE (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-5966, 1:300 dilution; BD Transduction Lab, 612044, 1:400), Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 (Alomone Labs, ACC-005, 1:75), and GluA3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7612, 1:200 dilution). Cochlea of P22 or P35 mice were isolated in HBSS solution or artificial perilymph, a small hole was introduced at the apex, cochlea were gently perfused through round and oval windows with freshly prepared 4% (w/v) PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS until the fixative became visible at the apex. Organs were incubated in the same fixative solution for 30 min at room temperature. Whole-mount organs of Corti were microdissected and the tectorial membrane removed. The tissue was subsequently permeabilized for 30 min in 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100/PBS, and blocked for 2 hr in 4% (w/v) BSA/PBS at room temperature. Staining with all primary antibodies was performed overnight at 4°C in the same blocking buffer. For staining with antibodies against GluA2 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3, the protocol was slightly varied: fixation was 20 min at 4°C, followed by decalcification in 10% EDTA (Sigma) for 2 hr; permeabilization and blocking was carried out in a blocking buffer containing 16% donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100. After washing, all species-appropriate secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488, 546 or 555, 647: 1:600 dilution in 4% [w/v] BSA/PBS) were applied for 1 hr at room temperature. After further washing, the organs of Corti were mounted, hair bundles facing upward, in ProLong Gold© Antifade (Life Technologies). Samples were imaged using confocal microscopy (LSM700 or LSM880, Zeiss) using 1.4 NA oil immersion objectives for confocal imaging, and using 1.2 NA water immersion objective for Airyscan imaging. The optimal voxel size was adjusted to the green channel (confocal x/y/z: 100/100/350 nm; Airyscan x/y/z: 33/33/222 nm).

All counts were normalized to the number of IHCs in a region of interest.</p><p>To estimate the size of synaptic puncta, we used the surface algorithm in Imaris. For all stainings, the surface detail was set to 0.15 µm, background subtraction to 0.562 µm, and touching object size was 0.750 µm (Bassoon puncta were split at 0.36 µm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>TEM and tomography</title><p>Temporal bones of P21 mice (WT: n = 5, KO: n = 5) were isolated in HBSS, a small hole was introduced at the apex of the cochlea, gently perfused through round and oval windows with freshly prepared 4% (w/v) PFA, 2% (w/v) Glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in a buffer containing (in mM) 135 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 2.4 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4.8 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 30 HEPES, pH 7.4 until the fixative became visible at the apex. Temporal bones were soaked for 4 hr in the same buffer and shipped in PBS. Cochleae were microdissected out from fixed adult mouse temporal bones and slowly equilibrated with 30% glycerol as cryoprotection. Tissues were then plunge-frozen in liquid ethane at −180°C using a Leica Biosystems grid plunger. Frozen samples were freeze-substituted using Leica Biosystems AFS in 1.5% uranyl acetate in absolute methanol at −90°C for 2 days, and infiltrated with HM20 Lowicryl resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) over 2 days at −45°C. Polymerization of the resin was carried out under UV light for 3 days at temperatures between −45°C and 0°C.

Vesicle fusion was determined by monitoring membrane capacitance as a correlate of surface area change. Capacitance was measured with a dual sinusoidal, FFT-based method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Santos-Sacchi, 2004</xref>). In this RC analysis method, two voltage frequencies, f1 and f2 (twice the f1 frequency), are summed and the real and imaginary components of the current response are used to determine the magnitudes of the three model components. The time resolution of the Cm measurement is the period of f1, which we varied from 0.16 to 0.32 ms, corresponding to 6250 to 3125 Hz. Stimulation protocols were performed after 10 min in the whole-cell mode to allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> current run up and full exchange of the internal solution into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schnee et al., 2011a</xref>). A dual sinusoid of 40 mV amplitude was delivered superimposed to the desired voltage step. The mean IHC Cm was 10 ± 1 pF N = 25 and the uncompensated series resistance 10 ± 3 MΩ.

Cochlea were acutely dissected from the temporal bone in chilled (~4°C) standard extracellular solution containing 1 mM curare. The apical turn was excised after removing stria vascularis and tectorial membrane, and placed under two dental floss fibers on a recording chamber filled with the standard extracellular solution at room temperature. Recording pipettes were made from 1.5 mm, thick-wall borosilicate glass (WPI).

Data analysis was largely performed using unpaired two-tailed t-tests unless otherwise stated. When non-normal distributions were observed, as in the EPSC histograms, we selected different comparators as described with the data. Similarly, when large n values would bias comparisons, such as when analyzing immunohistochemistry data, we moved to alternative more appropriate tests as described in the text. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise stated. Sample size is presented in the legends or the text.

A six-fold increase in small EPSC events was observed, which could perhaps be due to univesicular events. However, the authors do not discuss or emphasize this in the Results or Discussion. These smaller events could be due to single vesicle fusions, which are now more clearly revealed without a synaptic ribbon, whereas in the presence of a synaptic ribbon small single vesicle events are suppressed relative to large multiquantal events. So the ribbon could be promoting large multiquantal events, in this alternative interpretation. Perhaps the authors should also mention this alternative interpretation of the results. I would also recommend more discussion of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>. It's a striking result!</p><p>2) The Abstract mentions that: &quot;Surprisingly, multiquantal EPSCs were not smaller in RBE(KO/KO),&quot;. I would suggest changing this to: &quot;Surprisingly, large EPSC events were not smaller in RBE(KO/KO), although they become less frequent than in wild type synapses.&quot; This seems like a more accurate summary of the results. The authors have not proven that their large EPSCs are multiquantal. They could also be due to smaller amounts of vesicle fusion (or glutamate release) than control, but which nevertheless produce large amplitude EPSCs because of the larger PSDs (or due to higher AMPAR concentrations in the PSDs).</p><p>3) Please state the total number of events present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J and 8I</xref>. It seems like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref> has a smaller number of events. The CV=0.3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8N</xref> for control is similar to the CV found by Li et al. (JNeurosci., 2009). Please mention this and also compare with the CV found by Grant et al. (JNeurosci. 2010).</p><p>4) &quot;[…]the increase in proportion of EPSCs with lower amplitudes and longer durations is expected[…]&quot; The authors should also mention that larger EPSCs are better phase-locked than smaller EPSCs (see Li et al., Neuron, 2014; see their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). So one would also expect lower vector strength and reduced phase locking in the KO mice. Indeed, this is exactly what the companion paper of Jean et al. (Moser group) found. So this is well worth mentioning here!</p><p>5) Move <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref> to the top of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.

(Moser group) found no change in the ABR thresholds and a slight change in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> current properties. They also find multiple small conventional active zones per afferent fiber in the RBE-KO-mice. This should be discussed briefly. Maybe the methods are different or the number of animals studied? German mice and American mice should behave the same, right?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30241.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, there is a major issue that needs to be resolved.

The recordings were done in whole cell mode. Our data suggests that maturation in terms of localization and voltage dependence were unaffected at this age. Our companion paper used perforated patch measurements at older ages and were done largely in 5 mM external calcium. Thus, the small changes observed between laboratories are likely a function of the technical differences used in making the recordings. We would surmise that the differences between genotype observed by the companion paper are compensatory responses manifesting at older ages or late onset specializations impacted by the absence of the ribbon. Both possibilities are justifiable and we don’t have data supporting either in particular. Importantly though, our data are not in conflict with the companion paper, they represent different time points and thus different conclusions. We have addressed this more carefully in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The work performed on the zebrafish Ribeye mutants also requires additional attention (Lv C et al., Cell Reports 2016).

It is a hard question to answer because neither we, nor our companion paper, nor the original work in retina find any evidence of ghost ribbons and so cannot attest to what differences in response properties between preparations can be ascribed to the ghosts. The morphological differences may be due to the genetic approach not eliminating all ribeye forms in zebrafish. The differences may also be due to strong compensatory mechanisms in zebrafish that are not present in mammal. We looked at CTBP1 as a potential compensatory molecule and found no evidence suggesting that this might be the case. Other data exists suggesting ties between calcium channel currents and ribbon sizes in zebrafish that do not appear to happen in mammal perhaps indicating fundamental differences in plasticity between these two systems. We have elaborated on these points in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>There are at least 2-3 major discrepancies between this and the companion paper, despite the fact that they are investigating the same RIBEYE KO mouse.

We address their three major points here and all others below following the points made. We consider the three points raised as follows:</p><p>1) The ABR measurements presented in this manuscript and the companion manuscript agree with each other. The present paper finds a statistically significant difference because we have a larger population of measurements. Our n was selected based on a power analysis using the variance of previous recordings and needing the ability to detect 5-10 dB changes. Thus, we expect that with a larger sample size based on observed variance the companion paper data would also be statistically different. The trend seen in the companion paper is very similar to our data. In the end, there are no methodological or biological differences between the measurements in the two manuscripts.</p><p>2) We measured calcium current properties at P10-P12 ages using 1 mM EGTA internal and 2 mM external calcium. The companion paper used perforated patch recordings of older animals and 5 mM calcium. We used earlier ages as a means of assessing currents with a minimum likelihood of accommodation occurring. Any of the differences described above in making the measurements might account for the small differences observed in activation properties between studies. Most likely the companion paper results reflect a later, perhaps activity dependent, secondary response to the loss of the ribbon, but at present neither we nor the companion work have data to support or negate this possibility. Importantly, the data between the manuscripts are not inconsistent with each other and neither support the argument that the ribbon is directly responsible for the clustering of the calcium channels at presynaptic sites.</p><p>The question of viability is one that all scientists struggle with, particularly those investigating more mature hair cell function. The criteria used for assessing viability are pretty standard and are based on morphological assessments and electrical properties such as input resistance and membrane capacitance. There is no evidence to suggest that differences exist between data collected between research teams or data sets, in the tissue viability or that cell degradation is impacting the presented data.</p><p>3) The take home message from the capacitance measurements is that there is a deficit in release with small stimulations. The two approaches taken for these recordings culminate in this conclusion despite using different technologies. We used whole cell recordings and the two-sine wave technique while the companion work used perforated patch and the single sine technique. The two-sine wave technique benefits from using single stimulations over time to evaluate release changes in real time but suffers from greater noise as there is no averaging between stimuli. We accept this as we have previously demonstrated that multiple stimulations used for averaging can alter the output response. Likely the differences between measurements is time point at which measurements were quantified and potential changes in responses due to different buffering capacities associated with perforated patch vs whole cell recordings. However, we further analyzed our data and include fitting of the capacitance responses at different time points across voltages. We could better compare across genotypes by investigating multiple points across voltages and in doing this found that the sensitivity range was much broader and more overlapping with the companion paper. Thus, in its present form, our manuscript is in even more agreement than in the first version despite a slightly more depolarized sensitivity range. Given the differences in technologies being used, it is remarkable to me that the data are in such good agreement and lead to very similar conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional points:</p><p>1) The authors have highlighted a significant difference in DCm at -40 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

We also agree that looking at individual release components in more detail is valuable and so we have added additional plots to illustrate the effects of buffer on the first component of release.

We are more conservative in our approach to interpreting these data in part because they represent a small component of the total events. Also given the increase in postsynaptic receptors it becomes more difficult to judge changes in amplitudes. By the reviewer’s interpretation one might expect a change in the large amplitude responses, if the ribbon is needed to promote them, but this is not observed, thus we have tempered our Discussion. We see the result as indicating that fewer vesicles available leads to more single events but we found no relationship with amplitude and response timing that might more clearly support this conclusion.
