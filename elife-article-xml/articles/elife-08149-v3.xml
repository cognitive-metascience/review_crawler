underlies visual processing. To find recognition proteins involved in lamination, we utilized microarray data from 13 subtypes to identify differentially-expressed extracellular proteins and performed a high-throughput biochemical screen. We identified ~50 previously-unknown receptor-ligand pairs, including new interactions among members of the FLRT and Unc5 families. These proteins show laminar-restricted IPL localization and induce attraction and/or repulsion of retinal neurites in culture, placing them in an ideal position to mediate laminar targeting. Consistent with a repulsive role in arbor lamination, we observed complementary expression patterns for one interaction pair, FLRT2-Unc5C, <italic>in vivo</italic>. Starburst amacrine cells and their synaptic partners, ON-OFF direction-selective ganglion cells, express FLRT2 and are repelled by Unc5C. These data suggest a single molecular mechanism may have been co-opted by synaptic partners to ensure joint laminar restriction.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08149.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08149.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08149.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A nervous system comprises complex circuits of neurons connected by junctions called synapses. These connections need to develop in a highly specific manner, which means neurons need to be able to recognize one another and ‘figure out’ with which neighboring neuron or neurons they should form connections. Neurons do this by physically interacting with one another via proteins on their cell surfaces; these proteins essentially provide instructions to each of the neurons. However, for most neurons, details remain unclear about how they recognize and ‘talk’ to one another to form the connections needed to develop into working neural circuits.</p><p>To form precise connections, neurons must navigate their way to the appropriate location that places them close to the other neurons with which they need to connect (also known as their “synaptic partners”). In many regions of the nervous system, neurons become organized in parallel layers during development such that synaptic partners reside within the same layer. This process is called lamination and it occurs in the retina in the back of the mammalian eye.</p><p>Now Visser et al. have searched for the cell surface proteins that are involved in lamination in the mouse retina. This search involved a number of different gene expression, biochemistry and cell biology-based techniques. Visser et al. identified two families of proteins that might control the lamination of many different subtypes of neurons. The findings reveal some of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the formation of neural circuits in the developing retina and suggest that a pair of synaptic partners may use the same recognition proteins to ensure that they target to the same layer. The next step will be to confirm whether the proteins identified are indeed responsible for organizing neurons into distinct layers during the development of the mouse retina.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08149.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08149.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>laminar organization</kwd><kwd>inner plexiform layer</kwd><kwd>starburst amacrine cells</kwd><kwd>receptor-ligand interactions</kwd><kwd>axon guidance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bowes Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Visser</surname><given-names>Jasper J</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Yolanda</given-names></name><name><surname>Perry</surname><given-names>Steven C</given-names></name><name><surname>Chastain</surname><given-names>Andrew Benjamin</given-names></name><name><surname>Parsa</surname><given-names>Bayan</given-names></name><name><surname>Masri</surname><given-names>Shatha S</given-names></name><name><surname>Wojtowicz</surname><given-names>Woj M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01EY024694</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kay</surname><given-names>Jeremy N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001717</institution-id><institution>Karl Kirchgessner Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kay</surname><given-names>Jeremy N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>E.

This organization provides an architectural framework that facilitates the assembly of neural circuits in a stereotyped fashion, a crucial feature that underlies function of the structure. Laminated structures are composed of multiple different classes and subtypes of neurons that form distinct connections in specific stratified layers. During development, the cell bodies and/or neurites of these different neuronal subtypes become restricted to one or more distinct strata. Costratification of arbors promotes synaptic specificity by placing appropriate synaptic partners in close proximity to one another. As such, understanding how lamination occurs is essential to uncovering the molecular basis of how highly-specific neural circuits form.</p><p>The mouse retina is an excellent system to study lamination. The inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina is a stratified neuropil composed of axons and dendrites belonging to ~70 different subtypes of neurons. These neurons synapse selectively on specific partners, forming a complex set of parallel circuits, so a high degree of specificity is required during the wiring process (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanes and Zipursky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoon et al., 2014</xref>). The IPL has been well-characterized structurally and functionally. Three major class of neurons (bipolar, amacrine, and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)) form connections with each other in five IPL synaptic sublayers, termed S1-S5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Most neurons project selectively to just one or a few of these sublayers. There are many genetic and cell biological tools available to study neurons with lamina-specific projections and retinal neurons are amenable to culture <italic>ex vivo</italic> allowing in-depth analysis of the receptor-ligand interactions that underlie laminar organization. For all these reasons we chose the IPL region of the mouse retina as a model system to study lamination.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08149.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Methodology to identify recognition proteins for an extracellular receptor-ligand binding screen.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow chart describing the process of conducting candidate-based binding screen.

The Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarray (Affymetrix, CA) contains 45,101 probeset IDs. Of these, 35,469 have UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot identifiers and, as such, correspond to protein-encoding genes. We downloaded the protein sequence for each gene from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database. Protein sequences were submitted to the SignalP server which predicts the presence of a signal peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Petersen et al., 2011</xref>) and the TMHMM server which predicts the presence of a transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krogh et al., 2001</xref>). Proteins containing a signal peptide and/or a transmembrane domain were analyzed 1) for the presence of domains known to be present in proteins expressed at the cell surface or secreted using SMART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schultz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Letunic et al., 2012</xref>), Pfam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Finn et al., 2014</xref>) and InterPro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hunter et al., 2012</xref>) and 2) for gene ontology (GO) cellular component terms consistent with cell surface or secreted proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>).

In this way, molecular recognition specificity (i.e. receptor-ligand interactions) translates into wiring specificity. To date, only a small number of interacting proteins and the instructions they provide to neurites during laminar organization of the mouse IPL has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matsuoka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A global understanding of how laminar organization of the ~70 different subtypes develops in the IPL requires four systems-level criteria: 1) knowledge of all the secreted and cell surface proteins present within the developing structure that are available to mediate recognition events; 2) an inclusive description of which of these recognition proteins can engage in receptor-ligand interactions (the 'interactome'); 3) a comprehensive understanding of the functional consequence each interaction has on developing neurites (i.e. attraction or repulsion); and 4) a complete atlas detailing the expression of every ligand and its cognate receptor in each neuronal subtype to know which cells are capable of recognizing and responding to one another. Together these data will provide a platform for understanding the molecular basis of how complex neural circuits form between many different subtypes of neurons within an entire structure.</p><p>Here we employed a combination of systems biology approaches to address these four criteria and begin the process of studying IPL lamination on a global level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To address the first criteria, we analyzed microarray data from 13 different subtypes of IPL neurons and selected genes encoding cell surface and secreted proteins that were differentially expressed – these are good candidates for mediating cell-cell recognition across subtypes. To address the second criteria, we used a modified version of a technology we previously developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wojtowicz et al., 2007</xref>) to perform a high-throughput, receptor-ligand biochemical screen that tested every pairwise combination of these candidate recognition proteins for binding. This screen identified ~50 previously-unreported receptor-ligand pairs, several between seemingly-unrelated proteins and others between new members within families of proteins previously known to interact.</p><p>To investigate whether the receptor-ligand interactions we identified have functional relevance for IPL development, we focused on one family of type I transmembrane receptor-ligand interactions, those between a set of three FLRTs (<underline>F</underline>ibronectin <underline>L</underline>eucine-<underline>R</underline>ich <underline>T</underline>ransmembrane, FLRT1-3) and four Unc5s (<underline>Unc</underline>oordinated<underline>5</underline>, Unc5A-D). Some interactions among these molecules have previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karaulanov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sollner and Wright, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamagishi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seiradake et al., 2014</xref>), while others are newly identified in our screen. Members of both the Unc5 and FLRT families exhibit multiple roles in development in a variety of different systems with various interaction partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bottcher et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dakouane-Giudicelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akita et al., 2015</xref>). Using immunostaining and single cell <italic>ex vivo</italic> stripe assays, we found FLRTs and Unc5s exhibit distinct sublaminar expression patterns in the IPL and elicit repulsion and/or attraction in subsets of retinal neurons. Together these findings are consistent with a role for these families of proteins in mediating differential recognition events between neurons during laminar organization. We propose that, like Contactins, Sidekicks and Dscams in the chick retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamagata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yamagata and Sanes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamagata and Sanes, 2012</xref>), FLRTs and Unc5s are positioned to provide a code for mediating laminar organization in the developing mouse IPL.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification and production of candidate IPL recognition molecules</title><p>Differential expression of extracellular proteins provides a molecular mechanism by which neuronal subtypes distinguish amongst one another. We therefore reasoned that good candidates for mediating neuronal subtype-specific recognition in the IPL are cell surface and secreted proteins that are differentially expressed in different subtypes of amacrine, bipolar and retinal ganglion cells. As no published list of all cell surface and secreted proteins in the mouse genome exists, we first predicted all of the cell surface and secreted proteins using a variety of bioinformatics approaches. A detailed description of this process is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. To identify differentially-expressed recognition proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we analyzed microarray data collected from 13 different subtypes of neurons that arborize within different combinations of IPL sublaminae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kay et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kay et al., 2012</xref>). The microarray analyses were performed using neurons harvested at P6, a developmental time when extensive neurite extension, arbor refinement, laminar organization and synapse formation are occurring in the IPL.</p><p>We identified ~200 genes encoding extracellular proteins that exhibited ≥3-fold difference in microarray expression levels amongst the neuronal subtypes. Based on the domains present in each protein and known players involved in cell-cell recognition, we selected 65 genes as primary candidates and cloned them from retinal cDNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Because many of the genes encode more than one protein isoform as a result of alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage, these primary candidates comprised 121 distinct cDNAs, including 15 splice variants that have not been previously reported (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). New splice variants were identified for Ncam1, Netrin5, several Semaphorins and all four Unc5s (i.e. Unc5A-D). The candidate proteins fall into three categories: secreted (26/121; 22%), GPI-linked (17/121; 14%) and type I transmembrane (78/121; 64%). Proteins with multiple transmembranes were not included because their extracellular region is not contiguous and, as such, recombinant protein comprising the entire extracellular domain cannot be readily produced. We cloned the extracellular region of our 121 candidate proteins into two expression plasmids that C-terminally tag the proteins with 1) alkaline phosphatase (AP) or 2) the Fc region of human IgG<sub>1</sub> (Fc). Additionally, there is a 6X-His epitope tag on the C-terminus of both AP and Fc.</p><p>Recombinant AP- and Fc-tagged proteins were produced by transient transfection of HEK293T cells. As these proteins have a signal peptide but no transmembrane domain or GPI-propeptide, they are secreted into the culture media. For AP-tagged proteins, 106 out of 121 (88%) proteins were produced at optimal concentrations; for Fc-tagged proteins, 110 out of 121 (91%) proteins were produced at optimal concentrations (see <italic>Materials and methods</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The amount of recombinant protein present in the culture media was quantified using an endpoint kinetic enzymatic assay (AP-tagged proteins) or quantitative Western blots (Fc-tagged proteins) and the levels of protein in the media were normalized. We prefer to use normalized protein concentrations so that the levels of binding can be directly compared between receptor-ligand pairs and interacting pairs with high levels of binding can be identified. However, some proteins were expressed at levels lower than the optimized concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Nevertheless, these proteins were included in the screen.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Biochemical screen for interactions between candidate recognition molecules</title><p>We next screened for interactions between candidate proteins utilizing a high-throughput, extracellular protein ELISA-based binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The screen is a modified version of an assay we previously described that is quantitative over a 70-fold range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wojtowicz et al., 2007</xref>) (see <italic>Materials and methods</italic>). For this study, the workflow was converted from an insect cell strategy to one that would accommodate mammalian proteins. It is largely the case that interactions at the cell surface exhibit low affinities (K<sub>D</sub> ~ µM) and fast dissociation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vandermerwe and Barclay, 1994</xref>), kinetic properties that allow transient, contact-dependent interactions to occur between recognition proteins expressed on neighboring cells <italic>in vivo</italic> but often make biochemical detection <italic>in vitro</italic> difficult. Our ELISA-based binding assay surmounts this limitation because it utilizes a strategy that tetramerizes the AP-tagged receptor and Fc-tagged ligand proteins (see <italic>Materials and methods</italic>). By inducing tetramers, which provides additive or avidity effects, the assay is highly sensitive allowing proteins with micromolar affinities to be detected at nanomolar concentrations. Such clustering of cell surface proteins (through dimerization, trimerization, tetramerization and pentamerization) is standard practice for detecting ligand-receptor interactions <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bushell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ramani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ozkan et al., 2013</xref>) as well as in culture experiments where cellular responses to ligands are investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>As extracellular interactions are refractory to detection by standard interactome methodologies such as yeast-two-hybrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2009</xref>), our ELISA-based binding assay provided the first platform for performing high-throughput screening of extracellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wojtowicz et al., 2007</xref>). The high-throughput nature of the assay is due, in large part, to the ability to test AP- and Fc-tagged extracellular domain proteins for binding directly in conditioned culture media following transient transfection, thereby obviating the requirement for arduous protein purification. Furthermore, by employing secreted, recombinant proteins, the assay monitors direct protein-protein interactions so it does not suffer the caveat that interactions may reflect indirect binding. As such, this assay, along with two similar, independently-developed ELISA-based binding methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bushell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ozkan et al., 2013</xref>), provides a significant advancement for the study of extracellular protein-protein interactions over low-throughput techniques such as co-immunoprecipitation that, additionally, cannot distinguish between direct and indirect interactions.</p><p>To assess which of the 121 candidate recognition proteins can engage in protein-protein interactions as cognate receptor-ligand pairs, we tested them (and five <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dscam1 controls, i.e. 126 proteins) for binding using the ELISA-based assay. The Dscam1 controls were included because some Dscam1-Dscam1 interacting pairs exhibit high levels of binding while others exhibit very low levels, thereby serving as a positive control for the sensitivity of the screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wojtowicz et al., 2007</xref>). We tested the 126 proteins for binding in a matrix which reciprocally tests every pair-wise combination (i.e. 126 x 126 = 15,876 binding reactions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Visser et al., 2015</xref>). This includes 126 homophilic pairs and 7,875 unique heterophilic pairs. We included reciprocal pairs because sometimes a receptor-ligand interaction will occur in one orientation but not the other. Therefore, by testing each binding pair in both orientations, we decrease our false negative rate.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08149.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>High-throughput binding screen results and FLRT-Unc5 interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 126 x 126 binding matrix.

Previous studies have shown that five classes of Sema ligands (Sema3-7) interact directly with four classes of Plxn receptors (PlxnA-D) or indirectly through binding to the Plxn co-receptors, Nrp1 and Nrp2 (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yoshida, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu and Giraudo, 2013</xref>). The specificity of Sema-Plxn interactions is largely restricted within distinct classes (e.g. Sema4s bind PlxnBs and Sema5s bind PlxnAs) with crosstalk occasionally observed (e.g. Sema4C binds PlxnD1). These broadly-defined principles of binding specificity have collectively emerged from a large number of studies that each investigated interactions between limited subsets of Semas and Plxns. Our screen included all members of these families (20 Sema, nine Plxn and two Nrp proteins) and, as such, is the first comprehensive study of Sema-Plxn and Sema-Nrp binding specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Notably, we observed 1) that Nrp1 and Nrp2 can directly interact with some members of both the Sema4 and Sema6 families; 2) that some Sema3s can interact directly with Plxns in the absence of Nrp1 or Nrp2 (previously only Sema3E was known to interact with PlxnD1 directly and signal in the absence of Nrp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gu et al., 2005</xref>); and 3) new Sema4/5/6-Plxn interaction pairs.

These families were selected for further study because they were some of the strongest hits, with binding levels comparable to positive controls such as Ncam1 homophilic binding and NetrinG1-Lrrc4c heterophilic binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, of the 12 possible FLRT-Unc5 interactions (i.e. 3 FLRTs x 4 Unc5s), prior to our screen, four had been described in the literature (three in mouse and one in zebrafish) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karaulanov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sollner and Wright, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamagishi et al., 2011</xref>) suggesting that the eight new FLRT-Unc5 binding pairs we identified were likely to represent biologically-relevant interactions rather than false positives.</p><p>To test the additional FLRT-Unc5 interactions observed in our screen, we performed titration binding experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) using purified protein. We utilized a fixed concentration of FLRT receptor on an ELISA plate and varied the concentration of purified Unc5 ligand. In all cases, we observed concentration-dependent binding curves. Because the extracellular region of the proteins used in these titration curves is tetramerized, the FLRT-Unc5 binding constants we observed (i.e. on the order of ~1–10 nM) are much higher than published affinities using monomeric protein in surface plasmon resonance experiments (0.3-21 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seiradake et al., 2014</xref>). This observation is similar to findings by Wright and colleagues which showed that pentamerization of extracelluar domains in their ELISA-based binding platform, AVEXIS, can improve the sensitivity of detection over monomeric proteins by at least 250-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bushell et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>To assess whether all FLRTs and Unc5s can interact between opposing cell surfaces, we performed cell aggregation assays.

Western blots confirmed that the full-length proteins were produced and immunostaining for the C-terminal epitope tag showed staining around the periphery of the cell consistent with surface expression (data not shown). Using the cell aggregation assay, we tested every combination of FLRTs and Unc5s and found that all pairs interact between opposing cells as evidenced by cell aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). By contrast, no clusters were observed between mock transfected cells, FLRT-FLRT or Unc5-Unc5 expressing cells.

Because the IPL contains arbors from ~70 different subtypes of neurons, each of which may respond differently (or not at all) to the same protein ligand, it was necessary for us to use a stripe assay that would provide single-cell resolution. The tremendous value of single-cell stripe assays is that they allow the response of an individual subtype of neuron to be observed within a mixed population. As such, we designed and fabricated microfluidic devices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <italic>Materials and methods</italic>) to pattern 30 µm stripes, a width appropriate for the growth of single IPL neurons whose cell bodies average between 10-30 µm (data not shown). Our design is similar to others that have been used to monitor the effect of a purified ligand on neurite outgrowth of single dissociated neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weinl et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamagishi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We dissected and dissociated neurons from wild-type P6 retinas and cultured individual neurons on FLRT or Unc5 stripes. We reasoned that proteins involved in mediating laminar organization, or other recognition events that play a role in neural circuit formation, would elicit a response (i.e. attraction or repulsion) in only a subpopulation of neurons. While the majority of neurons did not respond to FLRT or Unc5 stripes, growing indiscriminately across them, we observed small populations of neurons (5-18%) that responded to FLRT1 (n=61/375, 16% attractive; n=19/375, 5% repulsive), FLRT2 (n=63/344; 18% repulsive), FLRT3 (n=37/438, 8% attractive; n=33/438, 8% repulsive), Unc5C (n=45/396, 11% repulsive) and Unc5D (n=49/407, 12% repulsive) stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-I</xref>). No significant response of neurons was observed to Unc5B stripes (n=3/380, 1% repulsive) relative to control laminin stripes (n=1/88, 1% repulsive). There also were no attractive or repulsive responses to Unc5A stripes (n=257/257, 100% permissive) but we did observe a modest population-wide reduction in neurite outgrowth and decreased viability (data not shown). Together these data demonstrate that Unc5C, Unc5D, and all three FLRTs mediate recognition events between subtypes of retinal neurons and suggest that FLRTs and Unc5s may contribute to development of the retinal circuit.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08149.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Subpopulations of primary retinal neurons respond to FLRT and Unc5 protein in stripe assays.</title><p>Individual retinal neurons harvested from wild- type retinas at P6 were cultured for 4– 6 days on glass coverslips containing alternating stripes of laminin and a purified candidate recognition protein.

FLRT1 expression was largely restricted to neurites that arborize in S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), FLRT2 was most highly expressed in S2/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and FLRT3 expression was largely restricted to S3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Unc5B did not show laminar restriction—it was expressed at low levels uniformly across the IPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of the expression patterns observed at P6 with the patterns observed at P2 and P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) demonstrates that laminar-restricted expression of FLRT1-3 and Unc5A,C,D is spatio-temporally regulated. Three patterns of developmental regulation were observed. One subset of proteins, FLRT2 and Unc5C, showed broad expression across the IPL at P2 that gradually became sublamina-restricted by P6. A second group, FLRT1 and FLRT3, showed sublaminar bias already at P2 that changed only slightly as the IPL expanded with age. The final group, Unc5A and Unc5D, added new sublayers at later ages: Unc5A was not observed in the IPL until P6, even though immunoreactivity was detected in neuronal somata at earlier ages, suggesting that IPL innervation by Unc5A-positive cells happens later than other family members. Unc5D, meanwhile, exhibited S1 restriction at P2-4 and then added expression in S5 at P6. Interestingly, the expression pattern of Unc5D may remain dynamic after P6, as immunostaining published by Feldheim and colleagues suggests that, while S5 expression is maintained, S1 expression is lost by P8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sweeney et al., 2014</xref>). The three patterns of laminar restriction we observed – termed 'initially diffuse,' 'initially precise,' and 'stepwise' lamination – have been seen in previous studies of IPL laminar targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mumm et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). The spatio-temporal and laminar-specific expression patterns of the FLRTs and Unc5s suggest that members of both families may contribute to specific cell-cell interactions that mediate these developmental strategies for laminar organization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>FLRT2-Unc5C cognate ligand-receptor pairs are expressed in repelled neurons</title><p>Between P2 and P4, Unc5C and FLRT2 expression patterns become restricted to complementary sublaminae in the IPL with Unc5C concentrated in S1/3/5 and FLRT2 predominantly expressed in S2/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Complementary expression suggests that these lamina-specific stratifications may arise due to repulsive interactions between neuronal subtypes expressing FLRT2 and Unc5C. Consistent with this model, our <italic>ex vivo</italic> stripe assays revealed subpopulations of neurons that are repelled by FLRT2 and subpopulations of neurons that are repelled by Unc5C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, D, H</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that repulsion by Unc5C stripes is due to interactions with FLRT2 expressed on repelled neurons.

Conversely, neurons repelled by FLRT2 stripes expressed Unc5C (n=30/30) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Together these data are consistent with a model wherein interactions between FLRT2 and Unc5C induce mutual repulsion via bidirectional signaling in both the ligand- and receptor-expressing cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Unc5C is a repulsive ligand for the FLRT2 receptor</title><p>Repulsive signaling of Unc5 in response to ligand binding has been well-established (for review of Netrin1-induced repulsion see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moore et al., 2007</xref>; for FLRT2-induced repulsion via Unc5D see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamagishi et al., 2011</xref>). In our stripe assays we observe FLRT2-expressing retinal neurons that are repelled by Unc5C which is consistent with a model whereby Unc5C binding to FLRT2 induces repulsion in the FLRT2-expressing neuron; however, repulsive signaling downstream of FLRTs has not been reported. So we next asked whether Unc5C-FLRT2 interactions can induce repulsion in FLRT2-expressing retinal neurons by performing gain-of-function stripe assays. Using transient transfection, we ectopically expressed either full-length FLRT2-myc or full-length Unc5C-FLAG (control) in retinal neurons cultured on Unc5C stripes and monitored the response of neurons that expressed these exogenous proteins as assessed by anti-myc and anti-FLAG immunostaining, respectively. Importantly, this gain-of-function experiment was possible because only 11% of wild-type retinal neurons are repelled by Unc5C stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and, as such, the vast majority of neurons are available to exhibit a gain-of-function phenotype.</p><p>We tested several commercially-available transfection reagents and found one that was capable of giving rise to ~10% transfection efficiency in our retinal neuron cultures (n=67/691 neurons transfected, see <italic>Materials and methods</italic>).

In our control transfections, we obtained 28 neurons that expressed Unc5C-FLAG and observed that 27/28 neurons grew permissively across the Unc5C stripes (n=28/363 neurons transfected; 13 coverslips) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>). One neuron that ectopically expressed Unc5C-FLAG was repelled by Unc5C stripes. We hypothesize that this neuron is one of the 11% of wild-type neurons that is endogenously repelled by Unc5C. These data demonstrate that FLRT2 is sufficient to mediate repulsion in response to Unc5C and, as such, repulsive signaling can occur downstream of FLRT2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>SACs express FLRT2 and are repelled by Unc5C</title><p>We next sought to identify which of the ~70 different subtypes of IPL-projecting neurons are the ones that express FLRT2 and are repelled by Unc5C.

Together these findings demonstrate that SACs express FLRT2 both during and after the developmental time when their neurites are becoming restricted to S2/4 and that SACs are repelled by Unc5C. Since SACs do not express FLRT1 and FLRT3, SAC repulsion by Unc5C could be due to interactions with FLRT2. These data suggest that repulsive FLRT2-Unc5C interactions may contribute to laminar organization of SAC neurons in the developing IPL.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>ON-OFF direction-selective ganglion cells express FLRT2 and are repelled by Unc5C</title><p>By <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization we found that <italic>Flrt2</italic> is expressed in a non-SAC population in the GCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

The level of molecular recognition required at the cell surface to achieve this complex circuitry is likely to be staggering. To begin to understand how this molecular choreography is achieved on a global level, we need to be able to consider the complete IPL extracellular interactome in the context of cell subtype-specific expression and functional growth responses. Our approach is based on the widely-accepted notion that neuronal subtype-specific differences in composition and/or levels of cell surface and secreted proteins underlie the ability of neurons to recognize and respond to one another and the environment in a highly precise fashion. As such, it is the differentially-expressed proteins, the unique cell surface identity of each neuronal subtype, that reside at the heart of recognition specificity.</p><p>Here we present the first extracellular receptor-ligand screen comprising candidate cell surface and secreted proteins selected due to differential expression among multiple cell subtypes as assessed by gene profiling. Using this directed approach, we identified high confidence candidates for mediating cell recognition events in the developing IPL and then conducted a candidate-based biochemical screen. We identified new receptor-ligand pairs and, as such, have begun to characterize the extracellular interactome in the developing retina.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Identification of FLRT and Unc5 protein families as candidate IPL lamination molecules</title><p>The results of our binding screen drew our attention to FLRTs and Unc5s. We discovered that members of these protein families are expressed in strikingly specific laminar patterns during early IPL development. Using stripe assays, we found that all members of these families except Unc5A and Unc5B are capable of eliciting attractive and/or repulsive behavior from subsets of retinal neurons. Notably, Unc5A and Unc5B also showed the least laminar specificity in their IPL expression patterns. These two features of Unc5A and Unc5B biology suggest that they are unlikely to play a role in IPL lamination. By contrast, the other members of these two families are excellent candidates to mediate IPL lamination based on their expression patterns, bioactivities and receptor-ligand interactions that we report here.</p><p>The expression patterns of FLRT2 and Unc5C are remarkably complementary in the developing IPL, suggestive of a repulsive role for this receptor-ligand pair. Consistent with this notion, we found that neurons expressing FLRT2 are repelled by Unc5C and, conversely, neurons expressing Unc5C are repelled by FLRT2. Using transfected primary neurons, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of FLRT2 is sufficient to mediate repulsion in response to Unc5C. While we cannot rule out the possibility that this response to Unc5C arises due to the presence of another cell surface protein(s) that gets recruited in <italic>cis</italic> by exogenous FLRT2 expression, taken together our data suggest that FLRT2-Unc5C interactions can induce repulsion in a subset of primary retinal neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Interactions between Semaphorin, Plexin and Neuropilin proteins</title><p>Sema, Plxn and Nrp proteins comprise large numbers of diverse cell recognition proteins involved in neural circuit formation and an ever-increasing list of cell biological processes (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yoshida, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu and Giraudo, 2013</xref>). While many binding partners within these families have been described, a comprehensive study of all Sema-Nrp and Sema-Plxn pairs has never been conducted. We included the complete families because our microarray data demonstrated that many members are differentially expressed in different subtypes of IPL neurons. Additionally, at the time we were selecting candidates for our screen, Kolodkin and colleagues reported that Sema5A and Sema5B interactions with PlxnA1 and PlxnA3 play a role in laminar organization in the developing mouse IPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matsuoka et al., 2011</xref>). As such, we hypothesized that other family members are involved and reasoned that understanding the complete interaction network is necessary for evaluating genetic phenotypes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Previously, Sema3s were believed to require Nrp1 for signaling through PlxnA co-receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tamagnone et al., 1999</xref>) and Cntn2 was believed to interact with Sema3A only indirectly through <italic>cis</italic> interactions between Cntn2 and Nrp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dang et al., 2012</xref>). Direct protein-protein interactions observed in our screen between Sema3A-Cntn2 and Sema3A-PlxnA4 suggest that Sema3A may be able to signal directly through these receptors in the absence of Nrp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The additional interaction partners we identified will thus enable the field to better understand how the interplay among Semas-Plxns-Nrps, as well as other potential Sema receptors such as Cntn2 and PlxnA4, contribute to laminar organization of the IPL and other cellular responses in a variety of different systems.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>All FLRT and Unc5 family members interact heterophilically with one another</title><p>The three FLRTs and four Unc5s represent 12 potential heterophilic receptor-ligand pairs. Prior to our screen, four pairs had been reported amongst varying combinations of <italic>Xenopus</italic> and mouse proteins (FLRT1-Unc5B, FLRT2-Unc5D, FLRT3-Unc5B and FLRT3-Unc5D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karaulanov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sollner and Wright, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamagishi et al., 2011</xref>). Using a variety of binding assays, we observed interactions between all FLRTs and all Unc5s. Further confirmation that the eight additional FLRT-Unc5 pairs we observed are biologically-relevant has been provided by Seiradake et al. who recently reported several of these interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seiradake et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>FLRTs and Unc5s are broadly expressed in the developing nervous system as well as in other tissues. While in some regions FLRTs and Unc5s exhibit striking cell-type-specific expression patterns (including the cortex, hippocampus and the developing retina as we have shown here), in other areas multiple FLRTs and Unc5s are expressed in overlapping regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haines et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seiradake et al., 2014</xref>). As such, the promiscuous binding of all FLRTs to all Unc5s seemingly presents a conundrum. Based upon the observed binding properties, a FLRT2-expressing neuron might well interact with all neurons that express any one of the four Unc5s. As such, how can FLRT-Unc5 interactions provide recognition specificity? Does promiscuous binding reduce the total possible number of distinct FLRT-Unc5 binding specificities from 12 (i.e. 3 FLRTs x 4 Unc5s) to one (i.e. FLRT-Unc5)? Our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seiradake et al., 2014</xref>) have demonstrated that different FLRT-Unc5 pairs exhibit differences in binding affinity (while our binding curves plateau due to saturated levels of detection and therefore preclude the determination of binding constants, the qualitative determination that there are differences can be inferred from the shifting of curves relative to one another along the x-axis). We speculate that these differences in binding affinity contribute to recognition specificity. The diverse cadherin family of homophilic and heterophilic cell surface proteins provides a classic example where this is the case. As with FLRTs and Unc5s, several members of the cadherin family exhibit similar levels of promiscuous homophilic and heterophilic binding in cultured cell-based assays but, when binding constants are determined using SPR or analytical ultra centrifugation, differences in binding affinity are observed which, in turn, mediate the sorting of cells into different tissues <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katsamba et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>FLRT-FLRT interactions likely occur in <italic>cis</italic></title><p>Conflicting reports have been published regarding whether or not FLRTs engage in homophilic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karaulanov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamagishi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seiradake et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 2015</xref>).

Furthermore, in our stripe assays, FLRT2-expressing SACs and Drd4-GFP ooDSGCs did not respond to FLRT2 stripes. A recent study reported that FLRT homophilic binding is difficult to detect <italic>in vitro</italic> due to very low binding affinity and is highly sensitive to experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seiradake et al., 2014</xref>). When measured using surface plasmon resonance, homophilic binding of FLRTs was below the sensitivity of detection (~100 μM) and, in SEC-MALS experiments, a minor increase in molecular weight (from ~70 kDa to ~80 kDa) was seen with increasing concentration, but no well-defined FLRT dimer fraction was observed. In addition, detection of FLRT-mediated homophilic cell aggregation required five days of continuous cell shaking, a time period considerably longer than standard protocols which typically monitor cell aggregation after shaking for 1−4 hours.</p><p>In crystal structures of a portion of the FLRT2 and FLRT3 extracellular domains, conserved lattice contacts were observed between <italic>cis</italic>-oriented FLRT proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seiradake et al., 2014</xref>). Mutations at this interface impaired tangential spread of pyramidal neurons between adjacent cortical columns <italic>in vivo</italic> which the authors interpreted as a resulting from a defect in attractive FLRT homophilic binding. Subsequent structural and biochemical studies by Lu et al. investigating interactions between FLRT and latrophilin, a cell surface adhesion-type G-protein-coupled receptor, demonstrated that, while the FLRT mutant exhibits a decrease in dimerization via size-exclusion gel filtration, binding of the FLRT mutant to latrophilin is completely abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). These findings, in addition to the authors' inability to detect FLRT homophilic binding between cells, led them to conclude that the FLRT homodimer likely occurs in <italic>cis</italic> and that the <italic>in vivo</italic> pyramidal neuron phenotype may be due to a defect in FLRT-latrophilin binding. In our stripe assays we observe subpopulations of primary retinal neurons that are attracted to FLRT1 and FLRT3 stripes. As latrophilins are expressed in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arcos-Burgos et al., 2010</xref>) (J.N.K., unpublished observations), it will be interesting to determine whether attraction of these neurons is mediated by FLRT interactions with neuronally-expressed latrohpilin or another yet-unidentified <italic>trans</italic> interaction partner.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Repulsive signaling may be a conserved function of all Unc5 receptors</title><p>Repulsive signaling induced by FLRT2 ligand binding to Unc5D-expressing pyramidal neurons modulates radial migration in the developing mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamagishi et al., 2011</xref>).

These data suggest that, in addition to Unc5B and Unc5D, signaling downstream of Unc5C can elicit a repulsive response.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>FLRT2-Unc5C interactions may induce bidirectional repulsive signaling</title><p>We observed that FLRT2-expressing SACs and Drd4-GFP ooDSGCs are repelled by Unc5C ligand. These observations are consistent with a mechanism whereby binding of Unc5C ligand to FLRT2 receptor induces repulsive signaling in the FLRT2-expressing cell. Using a gain-of-function stripe assay, we found that FLRT2 expression is sufficient to elicit a repulsive response to Unc5C ligand. These findings suggest the intriguing possibility that a bidirectional mechanism of repulsive signaling can occur whereby FLRT2-Unc5C interactions induce repulsion in both FLRT2- and Unc5C-expressing cells. A mechanism of bidirectional signaling has been well characterized between Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park and Lee, 2015</xref>). Such a mechanism of Unc5C-FLRT2 mutual repulsion would provide an elegant and efficient molecular solution for directing laminar organization/restriction of both FLRT2- and Unc5C-expressing neurons into adjacent layers, S2/4 and S1/3/5, respectively, during development of the IPL. Our future studies will be aimed at identifying and characterizing the neuronal subtype(s) that arborizes in S1/3/5 and expresses Unc5C to determine whether they are repelled by FLRT2 and if they are necessary to ensure laminar restriction of SACs and ooDSGCs in S2/4. Furthermore, as additional subtypes that we have not yet characterized also express FLRT2, other neurons have the potential to utilize FLRT2 for laminar organization either through interactions with Unc5C or other FLRT2 binding partners.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>FLRT2 and the development of retinal direction-selective circuitry</title><p>IPL sublayers contain axons and dendrites of retinal neurons devoted to specific visual processing tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Masland, 2012</xref>). By projecting to the same sublayer, circuit partners interact specifically with each other, facilitating appropriate synaptic partner choices. A striking example is the retinal circuit that detects image motion, the so-called direction-selective (DS) circuit, which comprises cofasciculated arbors of SACs and ooDSGCs stratified in IPL sublayers S2 and S4. Precise inhibitory connections from SACs onto DSGCs regulate DSGC firing in response to motion in particular directions, producing direction-selective responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demb, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wei and Feller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vaney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Masland, 2012</xref>). The mechanisms mediating the initial assembly of these IPL sublayers, or the co-recruitment of SAC and ooDSGC to those layers, are not known. The laminar choices of ON and OFF SACs are influenced by repulsive interactions between Plxn2 and Sema6A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). However, in PlxnA2<sup>-/-</sup> and Sema6A<sup>-/-</sup>mutants, most SAC dendrites still assemble in the correct sublamina and even when SACs make errors they still target to S2 or S4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that an additional molecular mechanism(s) functions in parallel to mediate precise laminar restriction of SACs. Here we show that SACs and at least one subset of ooDSGCs (the Drd4-GFP population) express FLRT2 and are repelled by Unc5C. We propose that these (and perhaps other) direction-selective circuit neurons become laminar-restricted in S2/4, and/or maintain their laminar restriction once formed, due to repulsive interactions with Unc5C expressed on neighboring neurites in S1/3/5. Definitive evidence that SACs and/or Drd4-GFP cells require FLRT2 and Unc5C for laminar targeting in S2/4 awaits genetic loss-of-function analyses. Nevertheless, our results suggest that evolution may have co-opted the same repulsive mechanism in both pre- and post-synaptic cells as a strategy for ensuring they both arborize in close spatial proximity to one another, thereby facilitating interactions between synaptic partners and limiting opportunities for inappropriate connections with neurons devoted to different visual processing tasks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here we present an integrated systems-level approach using cell subtype-specific gene profiling to drive candidate-based, high-throughput, biochemical receptor-ligand screening.

However, this study represents merely the tip of the iceberg. Our biochemical screen sampled only a small fraction of the recognition proteins present in a limited number of neuronal subtypes in the developing IPL.

Cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> overnight, harvested with trypsin for exactly 5 minutes, resuspended in aggregation media (CHO.K1 media containing 70 U/ml DNAse I and 2 mM EGTA) and counted. FLRT-myc/GFP and Unc5-FLAG/RFP cells (0.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> each in 250 ul) were mixed together in a 24-well ultra-low adhesion plate (Corning Inc; Corning, NY) and incubated for four hours in a 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator on a belly dancer mixer at 90 rpm. Cells were diluted 1:5 in aggregation media and 100 ul was added to two 35 mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek Corp; Ashland, MA). Clusters containing &gt;10 cells were counted using an Axiovert S100 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss; Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s5-9"><title>Microfluidic device fabrication</title><p>Microfluidic devices were designed using the AutoCAD program (AutoDesk; San Rafael, CA). The design included nine groupings of ten channels. Channels were 30 μm wide, 100 μm high and separated from one another by 30 μm. Each grouping was separated by 150 μm. Microfluidic device features were fabricated using SU8 photoresist on a silicon wafer (Stanford Foundry; Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA) and coated with Teflon for quick feature release. Features were then transferred into polyurethane casting masters (Smoothcast 326). Devices were produced as follows: Poly-dimethyl-siloxane (PDMS, SYLGARD) was mixed in a 10:1 base to crosslinker ratio, poured into casting masters, degassed overnight and let cure at 37°C for a minimum of 24 hours. After release peel from the casting master, 1.2 mm inlet and outlet holes were punched (Ted Pella Inc; Redding, CA) and devices were mounted feature side up on glass slides before wrapping in aluminum foil and autoclaving for 10 minutes. Following autoclaving, devices were allowed to dry overnight at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s5-10"><title>Stripe assay</title><p>Glass coverslips (12 mm Assistant-Brand, Carolina; Burlington, NC) were washed with 70% ethanol for 7 days with ethanol changed every day and then stored in 70% ethanol. Upon removal from ethanol, coverslips were rinsed thoroughly with water, coated sequentially with 25 µg/ml poly-D-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich; St Louis, MO) and 50 µg/ml laminin (Sigma-Aldrich). Microfluidic devices were applied to coverslips and desiccated to strengthen seal. Stripes were prepared by pulling protein solutions through microfluidic devices using a vacuum at 7 psi. Protein solutions contained 100 µg/ml purified protein (FLRT-Fc-6X-His, Unc5-Fc-6X-His or laminin), mixed with 100 µg/ml BSA-TRITC or PLL-FITC (to visualize the stripes). Protein solutions were incubated in devices at 37°C in a humidified chamber overnight and then wet-peeled in autoclaved milliQ water and stored in 1X PBS until use.</p><p>Dissociated retinal neurons were prepared using a modified version of a protocol developed by Ben Barres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barres et al., 1988</xref>). Retinas from P6 (wild type; three independent experiments), P2 (<italic>Chat-Cre::Rosa<sup>LSL-tdTomato</sup></italic>; three independent experiments) and P3 (<italic>Drd4-GFP</italic>; two independent experiments) mice were quickly dissected from the eyecup into cold D-PBS (GE Healthcare HyClone; Logan, UT), followed by digestion in D-PBS containing (per 500 ml) 165 units of papain (Worthington Biochemical; Lakewood, NJ), 2 mg of N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (Sigma-Aldrich), 8 µl 1N Sodium Hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.4 mg DNase (Worthington Biochemical) for 45 minutes at 37°C. The retinas were gently triturated in low-ovomucoid (Worthington Biochemical) then high-ovomucoid (Worthington Biochemical), each trituration step followed by a 10 minute spin at 1000 rpm. Cells were resuspended in panning buffer (0.02% BSA in D-PBS, 5 µg/ml insulin), passed through a 40 μm cell strainer and then incubated for 30 minutes in a 15 cm petri dish coated with lectin I from Bandeiraea simplicifolia (BSL-1) (Vector Laboratories; Burliname, CA) to deplete macrophages (with vigorous shaking at 15 and 30 minutes to remove non-specifically attached cells). The supernatant was harvested, passed through a 40 μm cell strainer and 0.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded (1 x 10<sup>5</sup> for Drd4-GFP) per well of 24-well plates onto glass coverslips containing purified protein stripes. Cells were seeded into 750 μl neurobasal-based culture medium (Invitrogen) containing 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 5 µg/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 100 µg/ml transferrin (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 µg/ml crystalline BSA (Sigma-Aldrich), 60 ng/ml progesterone (Sigma-Aldrich), 16 µg/ml putrescine (Sigma-Aldrich), 40 ng/ml sodium selenite (Sigma-Aldrich), 160 µg/ml triiodo-thyronine (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), B-27 Supplement (Invitrogen), 50 µg/ml N-Acetyl Cysteine (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 ng/ml brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Peprotech; Rocky Hill, NJ), 10 ng/ml ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) (Peprotech) and 10 nM forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich). Cultures were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Every 2–3 days, half of the volume of the media in each well was removed and replaced with fresh media. Neurons were allowed to grow for 4–8 days.</p><p>For gain-of-function stripe assays, neurons were transfected in three independent experiments approximately 24 hours post seeding as follows using Attractene transfection reagent (Qiagen). 0.2 μg of plasmid DNA and 0.5 μl of Attractene was added to Opti-MEM in a final volume of 60 μl, incubated 15 minutes at room temperature and added dropwise onto cells. Following transfection, cells were allowed to grow as described above. Note that for expression in primary retinal neurons, the FLRT2-myc and Unc5C-FLAG transgenes were moved from pTT3 (vector used for cell aggregation assays) into the pUB vector, bearing the human Ubiquitin-C promoter. For reasons that are unclear to us, transfection of the pGreen vector gave rise to an ~10% transfection efficiency as determined by the number of Tuj1+/GFP+ vs Tuj1+/GFP- neurons but transfection with pTT3-FLRT2-myc yielded hardly any FLRT2-myc+ cells. When we moved the FLRT2-myc transgene into pUB, we obtained robust FLRT2-myc expression in ~10% of neurons. As such, expression vector choice can have a significant effect on transfection results and, in this case, was crucial for the success of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s5-11"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Retinas were dissected from P2, P4 and P6 wild-type mice, fixed 1.5 hours (P2 and P4) or 45 minutes (P6) in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C, equilibrated in 30% sucrose until retinas sank (2-3 hours), immediately embedded in O.C.T. (Tissue-Tek), frozen on dry ice and sectioned immediately or stored at −80°C until sectioning. Cryostat sectioning (10 µm) was performed using a Microm HM550 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sections were blocked 1 hour in 1X PBS containing 2% normal donkey serum, 2% BSA, 4% Triton X-100, 0.4% SDS (blocking buffer) and incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibodies were incubated in blocking buffer for 45 minutes at room temperature. Sections were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse E600 fluorescence microscope (Nikon; Japan). Primary neurons and CHO.K1 cells were fixed in ice cold 4% paraformaldehyde/1X PBS for 15 minutes, blocked 30 minutes and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C (blocking buffer for CHO.K1 cells was 1X PBS containing 2% normal donkey serum, 2% BSA, 0.05% Triton X-100). Secondary antibodies were incubated 2 hours at room temperature. Primary neurons were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse E600 fluorescence microscope with the exception of triple-labeling experiments (i.e. when far red secondary antibodies were used) and then neurons were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 710 AxioObserver confocal microscope. CHO.K1 cells were imaged using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 fluorescence microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s5-12"><title>Double staining by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Full-length <italic>Flrt2</italic> cDNA (NCBI accession #BC096471) was obtained from GE Dharmicon (Lafayette, CO) in vector pCMV-Sport6. Sequencing confirmed presence of the correct insert. Plasmid was linearized at the 5’ end of the insert and antisense digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes (DIG RNA labeling mix) (Roche Diagnostics; Switzerland) were synthesized using a T7 site present in the vector (MAXIscript kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The probes were purified on a G50 spin column (GE Healthcare) and hydrolysed at 60°C in bicarbonate buffer (40 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 60 mM Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) to an expected size of 500 bp. P1 and P6 retinas were quickly dissected from the eyecup in ice-cold Hank’s balanced salt solution buffered by 10 mM HEPES, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/1X PBS for 90 minutes on ice, washed twice with 1X PBS, and sunk in 30% sucrose/1X PBS for 1 hour. Immediately upon sinking, tissues were frozen in TFM (Triangle Biomedical Sciences; Durham, NC) and stored at −80°C until sectioning at 20 µm on a cryostat. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization was performed on retinal sections as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kay et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamagata et al., 2002</xref>). Probes were detected with peroxidase-coupled anti-digoxigenin followed by a Cy3-tyramide color reaction. After the color reaction, slides were washed at least 4 times over 2 hours in 1X PBS. They were then subjected to antibody labeling as follows. Slides were incubated in blocking solution (1X PBS containing 3% donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Primary antibodies, diluted in blocking solution, were applied overnight at 4°C. Slides were washed twice in 1X PBS and stained with donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa-488 (Jackson Immunoresearch; West Grove, PA, 1:1000). Retinas from four different mice were used at each age, and were stained in two independent experiments.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Thomas Holton (University of California, Los Angeles) for bioinformatics assistance, Matthew Nicotra and Uma Karadge (University of Pittsburgh) for help with cell aggregation assays, Ben Barres (Stanford University) and Marla Feller (University of California, Berkeley) and many members of their laboratories for much time and assistance with culturing retinal neurons, Marla Feller and Xiaokang (Paley) Han for mouse husbandry, John Ngai and members of his laboratory for histology assistance, helpful discussions and use of their Nikon Eclipse E600 fluorescence microscope.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor (Constance Cepko), and two reviewers, one of whom, Gavin Wright, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In its present form, this manuscript is preliminary and will need additional validation for acceptance in <italic>eLife</italic>. In particular, caution is urged in the assessment of the significance of interactions in the absence of a determination of the physiological relevance of identified binding partners; tetramerization of both ligand and receptor has the potential to generate binding interfaces that may not be representative of in vivo interactions. Further, pairwise interactions defined in vitro may not reflect the situation in vivo should additional proteins be part of the functional protein complex. Were the authors to address the following points to better support their molecular model for how SAC laminar specificity is generated, this work would be strengthened and could become a candidate for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The title of this manuscript claims to identify &quot;receptor-ligand interactions that direct neurite outgrowth in the retina&quot;, however neurite outgrowth is not directly examined in this manuscript (outgrowth and lamination are not the same), and functional roles for FLRT2 and Unc5C not examined in vivo. Therefore, these claims appear overstated. The authors really need to examine IPL lamination in <italic>Flrt2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>and <italic>Unc5C<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant retinas, mutant mice that are available, to ask if FLRT+ SACs (see point 3) are repelled by Unc5C to modulate IPL lamination in vivo. It is recognized, however, that though these mutant mice are available, assessment of SAC lamination in these mutants likely falls outside of the revision timeframe <italic>eLife</italic> strives to achieve, and thus data from the KO mice are not required for the revision. However, if the authors have obtained these strains and have been able to investigate the phenotype, and the data validate the role suggested by the in vitro activities, it would greatly strengthen the paper and they are urged to submit these data.</p><p>2) The authors show that some retinal neurons are repelled by stripes of Unc5C, but they do not comment on the other Unc5 family members. Are the other Unc5's also capable of repelling retinal neurons?</p><p>3) By only examining in vivo expression of FLRT2 and Unc5C at P6, the conclusions the authors are able to draw regarding the possibility that the FLRT2-Unc5C interaction &quot;mediates laminar organization of SAC neurons in the developing IPL via repulsion&quot; are limited. To ask if this interaction is poised to guide lamination, as opposed to maintaining lamination established by other mechanisms, the authors should characterize the expression of FLRT2 and Unc5C at earlier developmental time points, when SACs and RGCs are first making decisions about neurite lamination neurites in the developing IPL. FLRT2 and Unc5C expression at P2 and P4, time points flanking SAC lamination in the IPL, should at the very least be examined. The authors reference the remaining FLRT and Unc5 expression patterns in the IPL as &quot;data not shown&quot; in the Discussion. These data should be included in the supplement to allow readers a comprehensive view of FLRT/Unc5 expression.</p><p>4) FLRT2 undergoes ectodomain shedding, which confounds the source of FLRT2 that colocalizes with VAChAT in the IPL. To show that FLRT2 is indeed expressed by SACs in vivo, the authors should show that FLRT2 expression colocalizes with ChAT+ SAC somas, and/or tdTomato expression in a <italic>ChAT::cre;ROSA<sup>LSL-tdTomato</sup></italic>background in vivo, in addition to their in vitro analysis of FLRT2 expression in cultured SACs. Are FLRT2+ somas observable in the inner nuclear or ganglion cell layers? If this is not so at P6, what about at earlier time points? Does RNA in situ analysis allow for a clearer picture of which cell times express these proteins, and when?</p><p>5) To support the idea that Unc5C initiates FLRT2-mediated repulsive signaling in retinal neurons, the authors could capitalize on the specificity of the anti-FLRT2 reagent they use here to carry out function-blocking experiments in their stripe assay experiments. If retinal neurons cultured in the presence of anti-FLRT2 no longer avoid Unc5C stripes, and vice versa, this would strengthen the model that FLRT2 is indeed a receptor for repulsive signaling via Unc5C (and vice versa), as opposed to some other unidentified receptor for Unc5C. It is especially important to show that FLRT2 mediates the Unc5C repulsion, since the ectodomain of FLRTs can be shed.</p><p>6) The repulsive interactions observed from total dissociated retinas involve ~10-15% of total retinal neurites in these assays. Though SACs are subsequently investigated in this study, the double immunolabeling for distinct classes of retinal subtypes should be employed in these stripe assays to determine which classes of retinal neurons are indeed repelled by UNC5-are they all SACs, or do other subtypes similarly show these repulsive interactions?</p><p>7) The main contribution of this manuscript will be the novel interactions they have identified, but they really didn't make much of these novel interactions in the manuscript at all; rather, they focussed on providing a thorough analysis of known interactions e.g. the Sema-Plexin (Table 1) and Flrt-Unc5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) interactomes. The manuscript can be improved by a brief description/discussion of some novel interactions.</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> please explain why it was necessary to use antibodies independently on separate sections rather than double labelling on a single section. The finding that the expression is complementary is convincing, but it would be more so if double labelling were performed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08149.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The title of this manuscript claims to identify &quot;receptor-ligand interactions that direct neurite outgrowth in the retina&quot;, however neurite outgrowth is not directly examined in this manuscript (outgrowth and lamination are not the same), and functional roles for FLRT2 and Unc5C not examined in vivo.

As our data reflect responses of primary retinal neurons to FLRT and Unc5 proteins ex vivo, we believe it is most accurate to state very generally in the title that these proteins can mediate &quot;recognition&quot; (as evidenced by attraction and repulsion in stripe assays) and we will wait for future functional data to make any statements regarding a definitive role for these proteins in lamination.</p><p><italic>The authors really need to examine IPL lamination in Flrt2<sup>-/-</sup>and Unc5C<sup>-/-</sup> mutant retinas, mutant mice that are available, to ask if FLRT+ SACs (see point 3) are repelled by Unc5C to modulate IPL lamination in vivo. It is recognized, however, that though these mutant mice are available, assessment of SAC lamination in these mutants likely falls outside of the revision timeframe</italic> eLife <italic>strives to achieve, and thus data from the KO mice are not required for the revision. However, if the authors have obtained these strains and have been able to investigate the phenotype, and the data validate the role suggested by the in vitro activities, it would greatly strengthen the paper and they are urged to submit these data.</italic></p><p>We discussed the KO mouse experiments with the editor who, after consulting with the reviewers, decided that, since we had not obtained the <italic>Flrt2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>and <italic>Unc5C<sup>-/-</sup></italic>strains, these experiments would not be required for acceptance of our manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) The authors show that some retinal neurons are repelled by stripes of Unc5C, but they do not comment on the other Unc5 family members. Are the other Unc5's also capable of repelling retinal neurons?</italic></p><p>To address this important point, we decided to conduct a thorough analysis of all FLRTs and Unc5s and performed stripe assays using all proteins. We found that most members of these protein families elicit responses from subpopulations of neurons (5-18%) in primary retina cultures. Three proteins were exclusively repulsive (FLRT2, Unc5C, Unc5D) while two were capable of attracting some retinal neurons and repelling others (FLRT1, FLRT3). Only Unc5B (which is barely expressed in the developing retina; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and Unc5A were incapable of eliciting responses. Example images of the effect of the FLRTs and Unc5s on neuron outgrowth in culture and quantification of the data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) By only examining in vivo expression of FLRT2 and Unc5C at P6, the conclusions the authors are able to draw regarding the possibility that the FLRT2-Unc5C interaction &quot;mediates laminar organization of SAC neurons in the developing IPL via repulsion&quot; are limited. To ask if this interaction is poised to guide lamination, as opposed to maintaining lamination established by other mechanisms, the authors should characterize the expression of FLRT2 and Unc5C at earlier developmental time points, when SACs and RGCs are first making decisions about neurite lamination neurites in the developing IPL. FLRT2 and Unc5C expression at P2 and P4, time points flanking SAC lamination in the IPL, should at the very least be examined. The authors reference the remaining FLRT and Unc5 expression patterns in the IPL as &quot;data not shown&quot; in the Discussion. These data should be included in the supplement to allow readers a comprehensive view of FLRT/Unc5 expression.</italic></p><p>We conducted immunostaining for all FLRTs and Unc5s at P2, P4 and P6 and now present a thorough developmental analysis of all family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). For FLRT2 and Unc5C, we found that they both exhibit diffuse expression across the IPL at P2 but, by P4, exhibit laminar restriction in S2/4 and S1/3/5, respectively. As such, expression analyses demonstrate that these proteins are expressed at the right time and place to play a role in mediating and/or maintaining SAC lamination. Moreover, this analysis showed that only FLRT2 is specifically expressed in the DS circuit IPL sublayers S2/4 (i.e., none of the other FLRTs or Unc5s exhibit S2/4 laminar restriction), supporting our observations from immunostaining dissociated ChatCre neurons with antibodies against the other FLRTs and all of the Unc5s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, by performing P2, P4 and P6 developmental analyses of all members of the FLRTs and Unc5s families by immunostaining, we found that each protein (with the exception of Unc5B) exhibits a unique pattern of lamina-specific expression, suggesting that these proteins may play a role in mediating recognition events that direct laminar specificity.</p><p><italic>4) FLRT2 undergoes ectodomain shedding, which confounds the source of FLRT2 that colocalizes with VAChAT in the IPL. To show that FLRT2 is indeed expressed by SACs in vivo, the authors should show that FLRT2 expression colocalizes with ChAT+ SAC somas, and/or tdTomato expression in a ChAT::cre;ROSA<sup>LSL-tdTomato</sup>background in vivo, in addition to their in vitro analysis of FLRT2 expression in cultured SACs. Are FLRT2+ somas observable in the inner nuclear or ganglion cell layers? If this is not so at P6, what about at earlier time points? Does RNA in situ analysis allow for a clearer picture of which cell times express these proteins, and when?</italic></p><p>The reviewers requested analysis in vivo. As FLRT2+ somas are not observable in the INL or GCL at P6 (data from our previous submission), we performed FLRT2 immunostaining at P2 and P4 but observed no soma staining at these earlier points either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). As such, to obtain cell body staining, we performed <italic>Flrt2</italic> in situhybridization. We found that, at both P1 and P6, <italic>Flrt2</italic> is expressed in a subpopulation of cells that include: 1) SACs; 2) a small subset of non-SAC cells in the INL; and 3) a small subset of non-SACs in the GCL. This latter group was further shown to include ooDSGCs, another cell type that projects to S2/4. These data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Together, these analyses demonstrate that two cell types that project to S2 and S4 (i.e. SACs and ooDSGCs) express the <italic>Flrt2</italic> gene (based on in situhybridization) and FLRT2 protein (based on immunostaining of dissociated neurons).</p><p><italic>5) To support the idea that Unc5C initiates FLRT2-mediated repulsive signaling in retinal neurons, the authors could capitalize on the specificity of the anti-FLRT2 reagent they use here to carry out function-blocking experiments in their stripe assay experiments. If retinal neurons cultured in the presence of anti-FLRT2 no longer avoid Unc5C stripes, and vice versa, this would strengthen the model that FLRT2 is indeed a receptor for repulsive signaling via Unc5C (and vice versa), as opposed to some other unidentified receptor for Unc5C. It is especially important to show that FLRT2 mediates the Unc5C repulsion, since the ectodomain of FLRTs can be shed.</italic></p><p>We agree that this loss-of-function stripe assay is a terrific experiment and we pushed really hard on it prior to the initial submission of our manuscript. Unfortunately, even with adding fresh antibody to the media every 24 hours (a prohibitively expensive experiment), we were unable to detect any decrease in repulsion. Regrettably, this negative result does not allow us to distinguish between the possibility that the experiment failed for technical reasons and the possibility that blocking FLRT2 has no effect. Prior to resubmission we discussed this experiment with the editor who, after consulting with the reviewers, decided that these experiments would not be required for acceptance of our manuscript.</p><p>As an alternative route to addressing the question of whether FLRT2 can mediate repulsion, we sought to ask whether misexpression of FLRT2 can render retinal neurons sensitive to Unc5C stripes. Since only 11% of wild type neurons are repelled by Unc5C stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and <italic>Flrt2</italic> RNA is expressed by only a small subset of retinal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), we reasoned that a gain-of-function approach might be feasible. Our first step was to find a transfection reagent and conditions that would allow efficient transfection of primary retinal neurons, something we had tried prior to our initial submission but were never successful in achieving. We pushed really hard, testing many different commercially-available transfection reagents and conditions and, while most were incapable of producing transfected neurons in our primary retinal neuron cultures, we eventually found one that gave us a 10% transfection efficiency making it possible to perform this experiment. However, while we could easily get GFP transfected neurons in our cultures (this is how we tested the various transfection reagents), we were unable to get FLRT-myc expressed (this was a problem specific to our neuronal cultures as FLRT2-myc expressed well in CHO.K1 cells). In the end, moving our FLRT2-myc transgene into a different expression vector (ironically, pUb from the Cepko lab) solved the problem (!) and we were able to get transgene expression and perform the gain-of-function experiment.</p><p>We found that neurons ectopically expressing FLRT2-myc were repelled by Unc5C stripes while control- transfected neurons were not. As such, FLRT2 expression in primary retinal neurons is sufficient to confer repulsion in response to Unc5C. This finding, when taken together with our data demonstrating that FLRT2 binds directly to Unc5C in our biochemical assays, strongly suggests that transcellular FLRT2- Unc5C interactions initiate FLRT2-mediated repulsion. At the very least, we can conclude that FLRT2 expression assembles a repulsive signaling complex that can respond to extracellular Unc5C.</p><p><italic>6) The repulsive interactions observed from total dissociated retinas involve ~10-15% of total retinal neurites in these assays. Though SACs are subsequently investigated in this study, the double immunolabeling for distinct classes of retinal subtypes should be employed in these stripe assays to determine which classes of retinal neurons are indeed repelled by UNC5-are they all SACs, or do other subtypes similarly show these repulsive interactions?</italic></p><p>As the reviewers point out, in our initial submission we reported that we observed non-SAC, FLRT2+ neurons that are repelled by Unc5C in our stripe assays. To investigate the identity of these non-SAC neurons, we performed in situhybridization for <italic>Flrt2</italic> at P1 and P6 and observed that a small number of non-SAC cells are <italic>Flrt2</italic>+: 1) non-SACs in the INL and 2) non-SACs in the GCL. Based upon the large soma size of the <italic>Flrt2</italic>+ cells in the GCL, and the fact that DSGCs arborize in S2/4 and are post-synaptic partners of SACs, we investigated whether DSGCs might be part of the group of non-SAC neurons that are repelled by Unc5C. First, we found by double in situhybridization and antibody staining that <italic>Flrt2+</italic> GCL cells express CART, a marker of ooDSGCs. Using neurons harvested from Drd4-GFP mice (which label a subset of ooDSGCs), we found that Drd4-GFP neurons express FLRT2 protein and are repelled by Unc5C stripes. Thus, two members of the DS circuit, SACs and Drd4-GFP+ ooDSGCs exhibit identical growth responses to Unc5C in stripe assays. We were unable to determine the identity of the non-SAC cells in the INL, although their laminar position close to the IPL indicates they are an amacrine subtype. Furthermore, the fact that these cells are present at P1 further supports this conclusion, as bipolar cells are not yet born at P1.</p><p><italic>7) The main contribution of this manuscript will be the novel interactions they have identified, but they really didn't make much of these novel interactions in the manuscript at all; rather, they focussed on providing a thorough analysis of known interactions e.g. the Sema-Plexin (Table 1) and Flrt-Unc5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) interactomes. The manuscript can be improved by a brief description/discussion of some novel interactions.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for their kind words – we agree that this is an important contribution of our work, and that we did not include enough details in the first submission for readers to appreciate this. We have included a more thorough discussion of novel interactions in the Results and have added a main text figure describing selected interactions that we expect will be particularly interesting to the field.</p><p><italic>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> please explain why it was necessary to use antibodies independently on separate sections rather than double labelling on a single section. The finding that the expression is complementary is convincing, but it would be more so if double labelling were performed.</italic></p><p>We agree that double-labeling with FLRT2 and Unc5C is ideal. However, this experiment is not technically possible because both the Unc5C and the FLRT2 antibodies are rabbit. As such, we needed to show complementary expression using the S2/4 marker, VAChT. Note that in the Methods of our initial submission, the Unc5C antibody was erroneously listed as goat. This typo likely arose due to the fact that we do indeed have a goat Unc5C antibody in the lab but we did not use it for immunostaining because, upon initial biochemical characterization, it showed cross-reactivity with other Unc5s in ELISA experiments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
