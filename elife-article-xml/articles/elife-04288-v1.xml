stresses. Nevertheless, many pathogenic states are associated with protein misfolding, revealing in vivo limitations on quality control mechanisms. One contributor to these limitations is the physical characteristics of misfolded proteins, as exemplified by amyloids, which are largely resistant to clearance. However, other limitations imposed by the cellular environment are poorly understood. To identify cell-based restrictions on proteostasis capacity, we determined the mechanism by which thermal stress cures the [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>]/Sup35 prion. Remarkably, Sup35 amyloid is disassembled at elevated temperatures by the molecular chaperone Hsp104. This process requires Hsp104 engagement with heat-induced non-prion aggregates in late cell-cycle stage cells, which promotes its asymmetric retention and thereby effective activity. Thus, cell division imposes a potent limitation on proteostasis capacity that can be bypassed by the spatial engagement of a quality control factor.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04288.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04288.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04288.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins must fold into specific shapes to work inside cells, and the misfolding of proteins is associated with a growing number of diseases. For example, prions are misfolded proteins that form insoluble aggregates called amyloids. These aggregates are not easily destroyed and can cause other nearby proteins to misfold and join the amyloid. This process of amyloid assembly leads to progressive diseases such as mad cow disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, which are collectively known as amyloidoses.</p><p>A series of biological pathways called the proteostasis network control protein integrity in a cell. Under normal conditions or even mildly stressful conditions—such as at slightly increased temperatures—the proteostasis network is able to prevent proteins from misfolding. However, if a cell is placed under lots of stress this network may become overwhelmed and misfolded proteins can accumulate. To date, the proteostasis network has not been linked to the clearance of amyloids.</p><p>A protein called Sup35, which is found in budding yeast, can exist as two different prion forms. Previous studies have shown that briefly heating the yeast cells can ‘cure’ the so-called ‘weak’ form of the prion. The ‘strong’ prion form, however, was thought to be unaffected by elevated temperature. These previous studies had only tested yeast cells that had been dividing for a few generations; it was unknown if cells that had been dividing for longer might respond differently.</p><p>Klaips et al. found that a protein called Hsp104—which helps to fold proteins properly—can break down the amyloid aggregates. This protein is normally only present in small amounts, but heating causes the levels of Hsp104 to rise. Klaips et al. found that the extra Hsp104 protein associated with the aggregates and led to their disassembly. When Hsp104 was prevented from associating with the prions, the aggregates were not cured even if high levels of Hsp104 were present in the cell.</p><p>When budding yeast form new cells, a daughter cell ‘buds’ off from the mother cell. Klaips et al. found that mother cells exposed to heat retain most of the Hsp104 when the cell divides, and this retention allowed Hsp104 to accumulate to a level required for the breakdown of amyloid aggregates. Therefore, under normal conditions, amyloids persist because cell division keeps the amount of Hsp104 below this threshold.</p><p>Previously it had been thought that the physical characteristics of amyloids accounted for their resilience in the face of the cell mechanisms designed to counteract protein misfolding. However, Klaips et al. show that the balance of the different mechanisms involved in proteostasis can be manipulated to create environments where amyloids are either created and maintained or destroyed. Targeting these mechanisms could therefore present new treatment options for amyloidosis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04288.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04288.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>chaperone</kwd><kwd>protein misfolding</kwd><kwd>amyloid</kwd><kwd>prion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM069802001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Serio</surname><given-names>Tricia R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 AG034754</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klaips</surname><given-names>Courtney L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 GM099383</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Langlois</surname><given-names>Christine R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell division imposes a limit on proteostasis capacity by reducing chaperone accumulation, but chaperone-substrate interactions reverse these events to allow clearance of even chronically misfolded protein amyloids.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The proper folding of proteins is essential to cellular homeostasis, and an extensive collection of protein quality control (PQC) pathways, known as the proteostasis network, has evolved to protect nascent and metastable proteins from misfolding and to reactivate or remove proteins that have already misfolded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Powers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wolff et al., 2014</xref>). The PQC network is tailored to buffer protein folding in a distinct homeostatic niche but can adapt when these buffering thresholds are exceeded by elevating the expression of PQC factors, including proteases and molecular chaperones, to clear accumulating misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morimoto, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Powers et al., 2009</xref>). In cases such as thermal stress, these corrections are sufficient to restore balance, but in others such as aging, misfolded proteins assemble into ordered amyloid aggregates, which persist and dramatically alter cellular physiology by inducing disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tuite and Serio, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Voisine et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taylor and Dillin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). This proteostasis collapse has been linked to the unique ability of amyloids to incorporate and conformationally convert like protein to the misfolded state and to their high thermodynamic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiti and Dobson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jahn and Radford, 2008</xref>). Together, these properties are thought to enhance the production and restrict the resolution of the misfolded protein to the point that the buffering capacity and adaptability of the proteostasis network is chronically exceeded.</p><p>Despite this natural upper boundary on proteostasis capacity, the heterologous overexpression of molecular chaperones in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, mice, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, yeast, and tissue culture-cell models of amyloidoses reduces proteotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chernoff et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morimoto, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Broadley and Hartl, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holmes et al., 2014</xref>). While these observations are often interpreted as evidence of amyloid resolution, existing protein has not been demonstrated to transition from an amyloid to a non-amyloid form in any of the studies. Instead, two correlations have been observed where the reduced proteotoxicity has been linked to a change in amyloid state. Either amyloid accumulation is enhanced by chaperone overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Douglas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cushman-Nick et al., 2013</xref>), or amyloid accumulation is reduced. In the few cases where the mechanism has been determined, the reduction in amyloid accumulation results from an inhibition of amyloid assembly by the overexpressed chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kobayashi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schaffar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shorter and Lindquist, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Winkler et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, even the specific overexpression of individual chaperones is unable to extend the proteostasis upper boundary in vivo to resolve protein amyloids.</p><p>Although these targeted interventions have yet to succeed, studies conducted under conditions that reduce amyloid amplification indicate that amyloid clearance may not represent an insurmountable obstacle. For example, repressing expression of an amyloidogenic protein can reverse established toxicity and, at least in some cases, clear existing amyloid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yamamoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mallucci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lim et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, expression of a dominant-negative mutant also promotes disassembly of wild-type amyloid in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DiSalvo et al., 2011</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that amyloid clearance mechanisms exist in vivo, and indeed amyloid resolution is biochemically feasible in vitro using purified chaperones such as yeast Hsp104, alone or in combination with its co-chaperones Hsp40, Hsp70, and small heat shock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inoue et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shorter and Lindquist, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lo Bianco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shorter and Lindquist, 2008</xref>). What limitations, then, restrict the ability of cells to expand proteostasis capacity to effectively resolve continuously expressed wild-type protein amyloids in vivo?</p><p>To identify cell-based limitations on proteostasis capacity, we focused on the mechanisms controlling persistence of the yeast prion [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>], the alternative, self-templating, amyloid form of the Sup35 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cox, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Patino et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Paushkin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glover et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">King et al., 1997</xref>). In this study, we report that a transient thermal stress surprisingly leads to the complete disassembly of existing Sup35 amyloid. This process requires the accumulation of heat-induced non-prion protein aggregates in cells primarily at the later stages of the cell cycle. The engagement of Hsp104 with these substrates, and its inability to resolve them before cell division, leads to asymmetric retention of the chaperone in cells that experienced the thermal stress. As a result, Hsp104 accumulates to a level that is sufficient to resolve amyloid aggregates. Thus, the kinetics of substrate engagement by a PQC factor and its partitioning during cell division impose cell-based limitations on proteostasis capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sup35 amyloid is resolubilized by Hsp104 following thermal stress</title><p>Under normal growth conditions, [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>] propagates faithfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cox, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derkatch et al., 1996</xref>).

For example, the more thermodynamically stable but less efficiently propagated [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> variant is quantitatively ‘cured’ (i.e. converted to the non-prion [<italic>psi</italic><sup>−</sup>] state) at elevated temperature in comparison with [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Strong</sup>, whose propagation is unaltered under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derkatch et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jung et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tanaka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Newnam et al., 2011</xref>). This curing of [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> was linked to the inhibition of the molecular chaperone Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Newnam et al., 2011</xref>), an observation that is seemingly counter to the idea that proteostasis capacity increases in response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morimoto, 2011</xref>). However, in this study, stationary phase cultures were only briefly diluted into fresh medium to re-establish exponential growth before exposure to elevated temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Newnam et al., 2011</xref>). Because stationary phase alters chaperone expression and blocks [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>] curing at elevated temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Newnam et al., 2011</xref>), residual effects from the growth phase switch could alter the interaction between Sup35 aggregates and PQC factors. Therefore, we revisited the effects of elevated temperature on [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>] propagation, beginning with exponentially growing cultures.</p><p>To monitor transitions from the prion [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>] to the non-prion [<italic>psi</italic><sup>−</sup>] state, we used yeast strains encoding a premature termination codon (PTC) in the <italic>ADE1</italic> gene. In [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>] strains, Sup35 is functionally compromised, leading to stop-codon read-through and the formation of white or pink colonies on rich medium, but in [<italic>psi</italic><sup>−</sup>] strains, termination is faithful at the PTC, leading to the formation of red colonies on rich medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chernoff et al., 1995</xref>). Transiently elevating the growth temperature from 30°C to 40°C had no effect on viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or on [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Strong</sup> propagation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) but induced [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> curing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

To determine if the prion curing resulting from this disassembly was mediated by Hsp104, we chemically inhibited this factor with guanidine HCl (GdnHCl) treatment or reduced its dosage by creating a heterozygous disruption in a diploid strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eaglestone et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jung and Masison, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grimminger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kummer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tariq et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zeymer et al., 2013</xref>), and in both cases, [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> curing was reduced by more than 50% relative to the wild-type untreated strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).

These observations not only provide additional support for Sup35 amyloid disassembly as the mechanism of prion curing in response to thermal stress but also reveal that the inability of chaperones to resolve amyloid in vivo results from both the physical characteristics of these aggregates and cell-based limitations, which are bypassed in the distinct proteostasis niche created at elevated temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The asymmetric retention of Hsp104 is required for curing</title><p>Elevated temperature induces protein misfolding, and the cell responds to this stress by elevating the expression of PQC factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morimoto, 2011</xref>). To deconvolute the contributions of each of these events to [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> curing, we took advantage of the fact that we could modulate the efficiency of curing with variations in temperature. For example, while exposure to 40°C induced quantitative [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> curing, pretreatment at 37°C prior to exposure to 40°C slightly reduced curing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, compare proportion of fully cured colonies), and incubation at 37°C did not induce curing at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

One possibility is that the asymmetric localization of Hsp104, resulting from its engagement with heat-induced protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erjavec et al., 2007</xref>), increases its accumulation in a subpopulation of cells beyond that which can be achieved by its transcriptional up-regulation. To test this possibility, we first monitored the partitioning of Hsp104-GFP during cell division following incubation at various temperatures using microfluidics and fluorescence microscopy. Starting with budded cells, mother cells accumulated ∼60% of Hsp104-GFP following the completion of cell division at 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, gray), which is comparable to the accumulation of untagged GFP expressed from the same promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and thus likely reflects the volume differences between mother and daughter cells. This baseline asymmetry progressively increased as the temperature was increased to 37°C (∼65% retention), 37°C followed by 40°C (∼73% retention), and finally 40°C (∼75% retention; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, gray). Notably, both Ssa1-GFP and Sis1-GFP fusions also localized to cytoplasmic, and, in the case of Sis1, nuclear foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>), but neither was asymmetrically retained following incubation at 40°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>), although their levels were elevated relative to 30°C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) due to their enhanced expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Disruption of the formin <italic>BNI1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kohno et al., 1996</xref>) did not alter Hsp104 expression levels or the accumulation of protein aggregates at 30°C and 40°C relative to a wild-type strain, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>) but, Hsp104 asymmetric retention was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, green), as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Strikingly, curing was dramatically suppressed from ∼80% for a wild-type strain to ∼10% in the Δ<italic>bni1</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Likewise, GdnHCl treatment before thermal stress, which blocked both Hsp104 engagement with heat-induced aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and curing at elevated temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>), also reduced Hsp104-GFP asymmetric retention following exposure to 40°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, the asymmetric retention of Hsp104 is required for curing.</p><p>Our single-cell analyses of Hsp104-GFP partitioning indicated that a relatively minor change in chaperone retention from 65% to 75%, which corresponded to a 2.2-fold increase in accumulation based on fluorescence intensity (compare 37°C–40°C, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), correlated with a quantitative switch from prion stability to curing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), suggesting the existence of a biological threshold in this range. To determine directly if cells accumulating Hsp104-GFP corresponded to those cured of [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup>, we incubated a [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> culture at 40°C and then isolated single unbudded cells on rich solid medium at 30°C. Following budding and cell division, mother and daughter cells were separated by micromanipulation and grown into colonies, which were then dispersed on rich solid medium to quantify prion retention. Mother cells, which experienced the elevated temperature and accumulated Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), were more likely to be cured than their daughters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, note most data points fall below the diagonal), as predicted by our hypothesis. To more quantitatively correlate Hsp104-GFP accumulation with curing efficiency, we analyzed the distribution of Hsp104-GFP in a population of cells by flow cytometry. At 30°C, Hsp104-GFP fluorescence was distributed normally in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, dotted). Following incubation at 40°C, Hsp104-GFP fluorescence intensity in the population increased and its distribution was heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, solid). When these subpopulations were separated by FACS and analyzed for colony-based phenotype, the efficiency of curing correlated directly with the accumulation of Hsp104-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>). Together, these observations indicate that cells exposed to elevated temperature accumulate heat-induced protein aggregates, asymmetrically retain Hsp104 in a manner that is proportional to these substrates, and ultimately cure [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup>.</p><p>But, is Hsp104 enzymatic activity required for this curing, or is its asymmetric localization alone sufficient? As noted above, when cells are treated with GdnHCl before thermal stress, Hsp104 localization to cytoplasmic foci and asymmetric retention are both reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). However, we reasoned the Hsp104 association with its substrates would be dynamic and modulated by its ATPase cycle. Indeed, blocking the ATPase activity of Hsp104 after thermal stress with a 90-min treatment with GdnHCl failed to reduce Hsp104-GFP localization to cytoplasmic foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>) or its asymmetric retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), presumably because the chaperone bound to heat-induced substrates but was unable to release them once inhibited with GdnHCl. Despite the asymmetric localization of Hsp104-GFP under these conditions, [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> curing was reduced by nearly 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

One source of heterogeneity in the population was cell-cycle stage, as our experiments used asynchronous cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To determine if cell-cycle stage at the time of thermal stress impacted Hsp104 partitioning and explained this heterogeneity, we arrested cells in G1 with α-factor or at the G2/M transition with nocodazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amon, 2002</xref>), exposed these cultures to 40°C incubation, and analyzed them by flow cytometry. Treatment with α-factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) efficiently synchronized cultures at the non-budded or large-budded stages, respectively, and did not alter Hsp104 protein levels or localization relative to the asynchronous culture at 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). At 40°C, Hsp104-GFP protein levels increased to similar extents in the asynchronous and arrested cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and its localization to cytoplasmic foci was similar in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Arrest, without exposure to elevated temperature, did not induce curing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>). In α-factor arrested cells, exposure to 40°C at release inefficiently cured [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> (∼15%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), but in nocodazole-arrested cells, curing was nearly quantitative (∼90%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) consistent with the asymmetric localization of Hsp104-GFP in the latter but not the former case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). These observations suggest that cells at the end of the cell cycle are more sensitive to curing at elevated temperature than those at the beginning of the cell cycle. To test this idea, we released cultures from arrest and, after 30 min of growth at 30°C, exposed them to 40°C. For the culture originally arrested with α-factor, sensitivity to curing at elevated temperature increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) as cells progressed into the late stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and for the culture originally arrested with nocodazole, this sensitivity declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) with cell-cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, curing occurs most efficiently when cells at a late stage of the cell cycle are exposed to elevated temperature.</p><p>Our earlier experiments linked curing to the asymmetric retention of Hsp104 at elevated temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). To determine if cell-cycle stage impacts this asymmetry, we analyzed Hsp104-GFP distribution in mother–daughter pairs resulting from the growth and division of unbudded cells isolated from asynchronous cultures that were exposed to elevated temperatures. In comparison with budded cells, Hsp104-GFP retention was significantly reduced at all temperatures when unbudded cells were exposed to elevated temperature, but the magnitude of the effect was most severe for conditions that induced curing (30°C→40°C and 37°C→40°C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, orange), indicating a cell-cycle stage dependence on Hsp104-GFP retention at elevated temperature.</p><p>Because cell-cycle stage did not obviously alter the engagement of Hsp104-GFP with protein aggregates accumulating at elevated temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the more efficient partitioning of Hsp104-GFP and the reduced curing in unbudded cells could reflect the resolution of heat-induced protein aggregates and thereby the release of Hsp104-GFP during the extended time before cell division in comparison with budded cells. Indeed, nearly 100% of cells contained Hsp104-GFP foci immediately after thermal stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) but only ∼80% still contained foci when cell division re-initiated ∼150 min after incubation at 40°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Thus, the relative timing of substrate release and cell division could contribute to Hsp104 asymmetric retention and thereby curing. Consistent with this idea, 60% of unbudded cells, which are inefficiently cured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), resolved Hsp104-GFP foci prior to cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> [165–210 min], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), allowing the partitioning of the chaperone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig7">Figures 7B and 5A</xref>, orange). In budded cells, which are efficiently cured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), only ∼8% of cells had resolved heat-induced Hsp104-GFP foci by the time the cell divided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> [105 min], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), leading to the asymmetric retention of Hsp104-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig7">Figures 7B and 5A</xref>, gray). Together, these observations indicate that Hsp104 is retained in cells exposed to elevated temperature if it is unable to resolve its heat-induced substrates prior to cell division. Because sensitivity to curing at elevated temperature correlated with cell-cycle stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>) and Hsp104-GFP localization to these cytoplasmic foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), substrate–chaperone dynamics must create a temporal limitation on proteostasis capacity.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04288.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Substrate–chaperone engagement must exceed time to cell division to induce curing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The number of [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> <italic>HSP104GFP</italic> (SY2126) cells containing fluorescent foci was quantified in cultures recovering at 30°C over time following a 90 min incubation at 40°C (white).

These foci include aggresomes, the insoluble protein deposit (IPOD), the juxtanuclear quality control compartment (JUNQ), StiF-inducible foci (StiF), and Q-bodies, the latter of which form under the mild thermal stress conditions employed in our studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johnston et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erjavec et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Specht et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Malinovska et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Weisberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wolfe et al., 2013</xref>). While the relationship of each of these foci to one another is currently unclear, they are all defined by the co-localization of misfolded and/or aggregation-prone proteins with PQC factors, some of which can be found in more than one of type of focus. The PQC factors that localize to these foci, such as Hsp104, clearly promote survival under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sanchez et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>), but whether their localization into cytoplasmic foci specifically altered proteostasis capacity had not been previously established. Our studies indicate that the engagement of Hsp104 with heat-induced misfolded protein aggregates enhances proteostasis capacity by increasing the accumulation of this factor beyond the level attainable by changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and thereby permitting the disassembly of existing Sup35 amyloid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig5">Figures 1,5</xref>).</p><p>While our studies indicate that chaperone partitioning imposes a limitation on proteostasis capacity, other aspects of this process may be more relevant to this upper boundary in post-mitotic cells, such as neurons. Indeed, our observations reveal other cell-based limitations beyond chaperone partitioning. For example, in contrast to the proteostasis enhancement we observe following thermal stress in yeast, previous studies have linked the accumulation of protein aggregates to reduced proteostasis capacity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Broadley and Hartl, 2009</xref>). In these cases, protein aggregates, including those resulting from oxidative damage with age or proteotoxic stresses, have been linked to reduced replicative lifespan, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilaniu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hernebring et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rujano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erjavec et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tessarz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Knorre et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Unal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Spokoini et al., 2012</xref>) and, the presence of protein amyloids, such as polyglutamine-expanded proteins and other yeast prions, promote the misfolding of metastable proteins, interfere with proteolysis, reduce protein synthesis, inhibit endocytosis, and disrupt prion propagation through the sequestration of chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gidalevitz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meriin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kirstein-Miles and Morimoto, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). A comparison of these studies with our work suggests that the dynamics of chaperone engagement with distinct substrates, rather than simply their presence, correlates with the impact of these interactions on proteostasis capacity. In the studies resulting in chaperone sequestration, proteotoxicity correlates with imbalances in the system imposed by harsh conditions and/or the unnaturally high expression of amyloidogenic proteins. In contrast, we detect no differences in Hsp104-GFP localization in [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>] and [<italic>psi</italic><sup>−</sup>] strains expressing Sup35 at its endogenous level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, 30°C), and Sup35 amyloid can clearly be resolved at these native stoichiometries when the system is elevated to a distinct but accessible proteostatic niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, paralleling the studies in metazoans, [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>] can transition from a benign to a toxic state upon Sup35 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ter-Avanesyan et al., 1993</xref>), a condition that also induces Hsp70 co-localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Winkler et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, proteostasis capacity appears to be finely tuned to maintain a natively expressed proteome.</p><p>Additional evidence of the importance of this balance can be gleaned by a comparison of chaperone overexpression in different cellular contexts. For example, overexpression of Hsp104 alone, to the same level achieved here through asymmetric retention of this factor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), also induces curing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chernoff et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wegrzyn et al., 2001</xref>). While it has been suggested that Hsp104 overexpression dissolves Sup35 amyloid in vivo, this interpretation is complicated by a lack of temporal resolution and the ability to monitor existing protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Park et al., 2014</xref>) and is inconsistent with the increase in the size of SDS-resistant Sup35 aggregates under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kryndushkin et al., 2003</xref>). An alternative model, which is consistent with this biochemical evidence of Hsp104 inhibition, suggests that upon its overexpression, Hsp104 aberrantly and non-productively co-localizes with Sup35 amyloid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chernoff et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kryndushkin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagriantsev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Winkler et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, our studies indicate that Hsp104 overexpression within the context of a thermal stress transitions Sup35 amyloid from outside the buffering capacity of the proteostasis network to within its sphere of protection. Notably, Hsp104 co-localization with Sup35 amyloid varies based on its mode of overexpression (i.e. individual vs network up-regulation), again implicating substrate–chaperone dynamics, rather than simply chaperone availability, in proteostasis capacity. Intriguingly, this interplay is distinct for individual PQC factors within the same cell, as thermal stress induces localization of Hsp104, Ssa1, and Sis1 to cytoplasmic foci, but only Hsp104 is asymmetrically retained upon cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>), suggesting an additional point of proteostasis regulation.</p><p>Beyond these cell-based limitations on proteostasis capacity, our studies have deconvoluted the contributions of distinct physical characteristics of amyloid variants to their ability to exceed the PQC buffering capacity in vivo. Intriguingly, we find that [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup>, the more thermodynamically stable but less efficiently amplified variant of Sup35 amyloid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tanaka et al., 2006</xref>), is susceptible to curing at elevated temperature, while the less thermodynamically stable and more efficiently amplified [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Strong</sup> variant is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), indicating that amyloid amplification rather than stability imposes the primary limitation on amyloid clearance. Consistent with this idea, reducing [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Strong</sup> amplification by either expressing a Sup35 mutant or decreasing the expression of wild-type Sup35 promotes curing at elevated temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, manipulations that have minor effects on the dynamics of existing amyloid are also sufficient to move this alternative protein-folding pathway within the buffering capacity of the proteostasis network.</p><p>Together, our observations suggest an alternative to the view that the physical characteristics of amyloid complexes alone preclude their accessibility to the cell's natural defenses against protein misfolding. Rather, the dynamics and balance of the system as a whole, including both protein-based and cell-based contributors, create not only a niche that allows amyloid to arise and persist but also another that promotes amyloid clearance. Our studies, therefore, raise the possibility that the proteostasis limitations that allow the accumulation of chronically misfolded proteins may be distinct in a native context and under conditions of their overexpression. Within this framework, our studies provide a proof-of-principle example to support the idea that proteostasis regulators, which are aimed at transitioning proteostasis landscapes to new thresholds, may be the most effective interventions into amyloidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lindquist and Kelly, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid and strain construction</title><p>All plasmids used in this study were previously reported (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) except for SB1013 (pRS306P<sub>GPD</sub>-FFL-mCherry), which contains firefly luciferase as an <italic>Xba1/BamHI</italic> fragment and mCherry as a <italic>BamHI/XhoI</italic> fragment, separated by a three-repeat glycine–serine linker.

rich YPD medium supplemented with 0.3 mM adenine. Cultures were maintained at an OD<sub>600</sub> of less that 0.5 at 30°C for at least 10 doublings to ensure exponential growth. Where indicated, cultures were then transferred to 37°C or 40°C for the specified period. Pretreatment of cultures at 37°C prior to shift to 40°C was for 30 min. To analyze colony color phenotype, aliquots of cultures were diluted in H<sub>2</sub>O as needed to ensure well-separated single colonies upon plating to solid YPD medium. After growth at 30°C, each colony was scored based on colony color phenotype: fully cured (completely red, [<italic>psi</italic><sup>−</sup>]), sectored (part red and part white), or [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] (completely white). Unless otherwise indicated, fully cured and sectored colonies were combined in the ‘cured’ category. For all colony counting assays, at least 150 colonies were counted for each experimental condition/timepoint. For the galactose-inducible Hsp104 experiments, cells were grown in rich YP medium containing 3% raffinose supplemented with 3% galactose during induction. α-factor and nocodazole arrests were performed in YPD liquid medium containing final concentrations of 5 μg/ml α-factor or 15 μg/ml nocodazole, respectively, for ∼2 hr. Following confirmation of arrest based on cell morphology by bright-field microscopy, cultures were washed three times with medium containing 1 mM DMSO followed by one wash in YPD before resuspension for indicated manipulation. GdnHCl treatment was performed at 3 mM final concentration in liquid YPD, and for experiments involving recovery, cultures were washed three times with medium before resuspension in YPD for indicated manipulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Protein analysis</title><p>SDS-PAGE and quantitative immunoblotting were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pezza et al., 2009</xref>). Anti-Ssa1/2 rabbit serum was provided by E. Craig (U Wisconsin—Madison), and anti-Sis1 rabbit serum was provided by M. Tuite (U Kent, Canterbury, UK). Semi-native agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE) was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kryndushkin et al., 2003</xref>). The cycloheximide SDS-sensitivity assay was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DiSalvo et al., 2011</xref>) with the following modifications: 1) cultures were treated at the various experimental temperatures for 30 min prior to the addition of cycloheximide to allow for the induction of chaperone proteins, and 2) after cycloheximide treatment, cultures were incubated with shaking at 30°C for 2 hr before lysis and analysis. For the aggregation analysis, native lysates were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kryndushkin et al., 2003</xref>). Lysates were pre-cleared for 1 min at 500×<italic>g</italic> and total protein content was quantified using the BioRad Bradford assay in triplicate. Lysates were subjected to 15,000×g centrifugation for 15 min, and pellets were washed with 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH7.5) containing 2% NP-40 before being resuspended in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH7.5) and quantified again in triplicate using the Bradford assay. For the Hsp104 immunocapture, native lysates were prepared at 4°C in IP buffer (50 mM HEPES–NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors (2 mM PMSF, 5 µg/ml pepstatin, complete protease inhibitor tablets (Pierce, Rockford, IL), protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)). Lysates were pre-cleared for 1 min at 500×<italic>g</italic>, and then incubated for 1 hr with Protein G magnetic beads (NEB, Ipswich, MA) with nutation. Immunocapture was performed using Protein G magnetic beads and anti-GFP mouse monoclonal antibody (Roche, Switzerland). Beads were washed 4× with IP buffer and 1× with 50 mM HEPES–NaOH (pH 7.5), and protein was eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Co-captured proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by gel staining with Flamingo (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and fluorescent scanning on a Typhoon imager (GE Lifesciences, Marlborough, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions or by western blot for GFP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Imaging and microfluidics</title><p>Static images were obtained on a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 fluorescence light microscope equipped with a 100× objective.

Serio et al. showed that Hsp104 must engage heat-induced protein aggregates for a period that exceeds the time to the next cell division. As a result, Hsp104 is asymmetrically localized to the cells that experienced the thermal stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figures 4, 7</xref>), and this increase in chaperone accumulation promotes [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> curing in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figures 4, 7</xref>). This study provides evidence that the engagement of Hsp104 with heat-induced misfolded Sup35 aggregates enhances proteostasis capacity by increasing the accumulation of this factor, perhaps beyond the level attainable by changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), thereby enabling the disassembly of existing Sup35 amyloid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig4">Figure 1, 4</xref>), restoring homeostasis to the mother cell. While the spatial engagement of proteostasis network components is not new, there are enough novel attributes to this work to render it an interesting <italic>eLife</italic> paper.</p><p>Please carefully consider the three thoughtful reviews pasted below when revising your manuscript. The points common to at least two reviews include:</p><p>1) It is important for the model presented in this work that Hsp104 interacts specifically with aggregated proteins, and that this interaction is dependent on the enzymatic activity of Hsp104. Is it possible to demonstrate this specific interaction, e.g. by co-immunoprecipitation? How does the sequestration of Hsp104 by heat-induced aggregates affect its activity? Is it solely the consequence of achieving high local concentrations?</p><p>2) A broader context here would be useful as a number of laboratories have made observations on Q-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>), iPOD, JUNQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaganovich et. al., 2008</xref>), aggresomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johnston et. al., 1998</xref>), and spatial sequestration and symmetrical inheritance in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Song et al., 2014</xref>) have demonstrated that aggregates have spatial restrictions and numerous papers have shown that multiple chaperones are associated with these aggregate structures using a wide range of proteomic and co-localization methods, often with substantial consequences on cellular activity. Some of these would seem to have opposing outcomes, which then poses questions how the mother-daughter cell relationship of yeast relates to metazoan cell division, and broader relevance to neurons being post-mitotic. Integrating these observations into this work without dramatically expanding the Discussion would be useful.</p><p>3) The use of Sup35 as a client and the yeast cellular environment while highly relevant on its own, may not offer broadly relevant concepts than can be extrapolated to metazoans. For example, Hsp104 as a disaggregase activity is restricted to prokaryotes, plants, and yeast whereas a corresponding class of activity in metazoans appears to be a reconfiguration of the Hsp70 and J-domain apparatus by Hsp110, leading to questions whether these concepts on Hsp104 are specific to yeast (which is still interesting) or can help us to understand the larger questions posed by the authors on the upper limit of the cellular environment. Some brief comments addressing this issue will allow the reader to comprehend the bigger picture.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>Protein aggregation is linked to many degenerative diseases, either through loss of function of the aggregated protein, or through a novel gain of toxic function of the aggregate. It is therefore of high importance to identify pathways that can prevent or reverse protein aggregation. The submitted manuscript investigates the relationship between protein aggregation and the aggregate-remodeling factor Hsp104.</p><p>The authors report the seemingly paradoxical observation that incubation of cells at an elevated temperature of 40<sup>°</sup>C strongly reduces aggregation of the model substrate Sup35 in its prion form [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup>. Heat shock treatment reduces the size of the aggregates and increases the amount of soluble Sup35 after a recovery period. This process is dependent on the activity of Hsp104. The authors convincingly demonstrate that heat-induced aggregates of proteins other than Sup35 asymmetrically retain Hsp104 during cell division, in a process that is dependent of the enzymatic activity of Hsp104, and thereby increase Hsp104 concentration in mother cells to a level that allows Sup35 disaggregation and prion curing during recovery from heat stress.</p><p>The concept that the (temporary) sequestration of important proteostasis factors into an aggregate can be beneficial instead of detrimental is novel and exciting, and provides insight into an unanticipated role of asymmetric cell division in protein aggregate management. The paper is clearly written and the main conclusions are generally well supported by data.</p><p>There are however a few points the authors should address:</p><p>1) It is important for the model presented in this work that Hsp104 interacts specifically with aggregated proteins, and that this interaction is dependent on the enzymatic activity of Hsp104. Is it possible to demonstrate this specific interaction, e.g. by co-immunoprecipitation?</p><p>2) The use of nocodazole in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> seems problematic as it may influence several other pathways that are involved in the formation and degradation of aggregates. Since the cell cycle analysis is not contributing critically to the overall model, it might be better to remove this section, or move it to the supplement.</p><p>3) Some of the colors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are hard to distinguish (especially dark blue and black in 4d) and are not explained in the panels.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>Klaips et. al. (Serio) have explored the mechanism of curing of Sup35 prion aggregates upon exposure of yeast to transient thermal stress to test a hypothesis that the cellular environment sets limits on protein quality control (PQC). The authors show that exposure of yeast (S. cerevisiae) at specific stages of the cell cycle to short periods of thermal stress leads to the disassembly of Sup35 amyloid, and propose that this is due to the spatial sequestration of Hsp104 in the mother cell rather than the result of overall elevated levels of Hsp104 or other chaperones. The sequestration of Hsp104 is correlated with the accumulation of heat-induced, non-prion aggregates upon thermal stress and the data suggest that the disassembly of Sup35 is more a function of amplification efficiency than thermodynamic stability. FACS experiments coupled with the use of two different cell-cycle inhibitors demonstrated that prion curing was highly dependent upon the cell-cycle stage.</p><p>Overall, the experiments are well done, the results are intriguing and the paper is nicely presented. Some of the conclusions are correlative rather than causal, thus limiting the overall enthusiasm. Also, the use of Sup35 as a probe and the yeast cellular environment while highly relevant on its own, may not offer broadly relevant concepts than can be extrapolated to metazoans. For example, Hsp104 as a disaggregase activity is restricted to prokaryotes, plants, and yeast whereas a corresponding class of activity in metazoans appears to be a reconfiguration of the Hsp70 and J-domain apparatus by Hsp110, leading to questions whether these concepts on Hsp104 are specific to yeast (which is still interesting) or can help us to understand the larger questions posed by the authors on the upper limit of the cellular environment. How does the sequestration of Hsp104 by heat-induced aggregates affect its activity? Is it solely the consequence of achieving high local concentrations? An argument is made that it is the asymmetrical partitioning of Hsp104 by its association with thermal aggregates that leads to a sufficiently high concentration of Hsp104 to resolve Sup35 amyloids. What is this concentration, what is the nature and basis of the interaction? Will elevated levels of Hsp104 achieved using conditional systems or shield-based metastable DHFR achieve the same outcome? Finally, the effects of different temperature conditions are intriguing. What is the nature of the biophysical transformation of Sup35 in 30C cells compared to those exposed to 40C beyond that rather vague terminology of shift from SDS-resistant to SDS-sensitive? What is special about 40C? Is this a useful tool to understand more completely the cellular environment?</p><p>A broader context here would be useful as a number of laboratories have made observations on Q-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>), iPOD, JUNQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaganovich et. al., 2008</xref>), aggresomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johnston et. al., 1998</xref>), and spatial sequestration and symmetrical inheritance in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Song et al., 2014</xref>) have demonstrated that aggregates have spatial restrictions and numerous papers have shown that multiple chaperones are associated with these aggregate structures using a wide range of proteomic and co-localization methods, often with substantial consequences on cellular activity. Some of these would seem to have opposing outcomes, which then poses questions how the mother-daughter cell relationship of yeast relates to metazoan cell division, and broader relevance to neurons being post-mitotic.</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p>1) Evidence for involvement of Hsp104 in Sup35 amyloid disassembly comes both from the literature and new data presented here, that (i) the GdnHCl curing of [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> and a ∼50% decrease in curing efficiency was observed in a heterozygous deletion of Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>), (ii) Hsp104 was asymmetric localized upon thermal stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figure 4, 6</xref>) and (iii) no significant changes were observed for Hsp104, Ssa1 and Sis1 chaperone expression levels upon heat stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This establishes necessity, but not sufficiency and therefore does not rule out other 'factor(s)' induced upon heat stress that could contribute to amyloid disassembly.</p><p>These arguments can be strengthened by: (a) demonstrating whether the expression of other chaperone candidates (ie., other Hsp70 and Hsp40 isoforms) are affected by these thermal stress conditions. For example, there could be small changes in the expression of a number of chaperones that affects the cellular environment and enables amyloid resolubilization. Examples of candidates to test include chaperones examined in studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chernoff et. al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shorter and Lindquist, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duennwald et. al., 2012</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Winkler et. al., 2012</xref>, and (b) showing the over-expression data, currently not shown (p.18) that establishes that the o/e of Hsp104 alone, to the same level achieved in this study through its asymmetric retention, suffices to induce curing.</p><p>2) The authors' evidence for the formation of heat-induced, non-prion aggregates that accumulate upon heat stress and sequester Hsp104 in the mother cell rests on SDD-AGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), differential centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) and that formation of aggregates correlates with other Hsp104 specific observations.</p><p>The protocol used for differential centrifugation is not sufficiently well described. It appears that the aggregates were quantified using a Bradford assay after pelleting in a tabletop centrifuge and a mild detergent wash. If the aggregates were not denatured before quantification, the presence of large particles may cause artifacts while making colorimetric measurements in a spectrophotometer. Since the quantification of these aggregates is an important aspect of this story, the authors should quantify aggregate formation with more vigor, using alternative procedures such as sucrose-density gradients and ultra-centrifugation to separate aggregates from other cellular debris. More central, the differential accumulation of aggregates in mother vs. daughter cells should be quantified and compared to the values on the differential retention of Hsp104.</p><p>3) An important conclusion is that the heat-induced aggregates directly retain Hsp104, but there is no evidence for the direct interaction between these two factors, other than strong correlation. This would be greatly strengthened by an experiment that isolates these aggregates (see point 2 above) and demonstrates the presence of Hsp104 bound to these aggregates, using a digest and mass spectrometric quantification, for example. Alternatively, the authors could perform a co-IP experiment if they had more information on one of the proteins that is a constituent of these heat-induced aggregates.</p><p>4) Have the authors ruled out an effect on protein synthesis? Heat shock, in particular, is well known to inhibit protein synthesis, which could affect the flux, and shift equilibria in the proper cellular environment towards dissociation?</p><p>5) A point is regarding the relevance of the conclusions the authors make on the existence of cell-based limitations that preclude amyloid resolubilization in vivo to disease conditions. Since it is clear from their data that the cell-cycle stage is an important determinant that affects the success of resolubilization in vivo, this would not influence our understanding of the PQC in non-dividing neuronal cells. The authors should place their results in the broader context of protein misfolding diseases in the discussion.</p><p>6) Another point in the discussion on spatial engagement of PQC factors and effects on proteostasis capacity is a recent observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yu et. al., 2014</xref>) on aggregate-associated sequestration of Hsc70 leading to down regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Does this suggest that the interactions of chaperones with aggregates could have different outcomes?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study, Klaips et al. perform an elegant set of studies, which demonstrate that Hsp104 dissolves Sup35 prions that encode weak [PSI+] at elevated temperatures in yeast. Interestingly, this curing process depends upon an unprecedented spatiotemporal mechanism. Thus, asymmetric Hsp104 retention by heat induced, non-prion aggregates in late cell cycle-stage cells, leads to high enough Hsp104 levels to promote dissolution of Sup35 prions encoding weak [PSI+]. Upon recognizing this potential mechanism, the authors then cleverly tweak the system to enable curing of Sup35 prions that encode strong [PSI+]. Although Sup35 prion dissolution by Hsp104 is not very surprising per se, the spatiotemporal mechanism revealed by these studies is entirely novel and should interest a broad audience. Indeed, this paper will raise awareness that spatiotemporal mechanisms can have a profound impact on proteostasis and amyloid resolution. In my view, the study is high quality and is carefully conducted and controlled, and I do not have any issues with the experiments or data as presented. A limitation is that several conclusions are based upon correlative evidence, but it has already been shown in vitro that Hsp104 can rapidly dissolve Sup35 prions. My only minor objections concern several statements in the Introduction that are incorrect or misleading:</p><p>1) 'but a direct demonstration of amyloid resolubilization in vivo has yet to be reported in any system'. Serio and colleagues have themselves already convincingly demonstrated amyloid resolublization by Hsp104 in vivo in their 2011 NSMB paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DiSalvo et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Park et al. 2014</xref> also provide compelling evidence that Hsp104 promotes amyloid solubilization in vivo. Moreover, there are numerous examples of amyloid clearance in conditional animal models of neurodegenerative disease models (e.g. Yamamoto et al. Cell 2000; Lim et al., J. Neuorosci. 2011). Hence, this statement is incorrect and misleading.</p><p>2) 'Rather, the effects of chaperone overexpression have been shown in some cases to be independent of their catalytic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carmichael et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chai et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jana et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Park et al., 2014</xref>)'. This statement is a little misleading as in several cases the effect has been shown to depend on catalytic function (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cushman-Nick et al. 2013</xref> PLoS Genet.)</p><p>3) 'Extracts from <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammalian tissues and cell lines similarly promote amyloid solubilization (Cohen et al., 53 2006, Murray et al., 2010).' This statement should also be revised since Murray et al. subsequently published (Protein Sci. 2013 Nov;22(11):1531-41.) that 'our interpretation of the kinetic fibril disaggregation assay data previously reported in Bieschke et al., Protein Sci 2009;18:2231-2241 and Murray et al., Protein Sci 2010;19:836-846 is invalid when used as evidence for a disaggregase activity.'</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04288.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) It is important for the model presented in this work that Hsp104 interacts specifically with aggregated proteins, and that this interaction is dependent on the enzymatic activity of Hsp104. Is it possible to demonstrate this specific interaction, e.g. by co-immunoprecipitation</italic>?</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the interaction of Hsp104 with heat-induced aggregates is an essential component of our model. To address this point, we have added two new pieces of data to the manuscript. First, we demonstrate that Hsp104 co-localizes with a model substrate (firefly luciferase-mCherry), which denatures upon thermal stress and is reactivated in an Hsp104-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>; Parsell et al. 1994). Second, we demonstrate by immunocapture of Hsp104-GFP, SDS-PAGE and general protein staining, that Hsp104-GFP associates with a larger number of proteins upon thermal stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Importantly, the number of co-captured proteins increases with the severity of the stress (i.e. 40°C &gt; 37°C) and decreases with GdnHCl treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), which blocks Hsp104 activity. Thus, the engagement of Hsp104-GFP with heat-induced substrates parallels the efficiency of [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> curing, which is increased at 40°C relative to 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a, b</xref>) and is inhibited by treatment with GdnHCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), providing additional support for our model of prion curing.</p><p><italic>How does the sequestration of Hsp104 by heat-induced aggregates affect its activity? Is it solely the consequence of achieving high local concentrations</italic>?</p><p>Our studies together indicate that both the high local concentration of Hsp104 and its activity are required for [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> curing. To summarize here, curing correlates only with the highest levels of Hsp104 accumulation (37°C → 40°C and 40°C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) and is blocked by treatments that reduce Hsp104 asymmetric accumulation (GdnHCl treatment [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig5">Figure 2a, 5d</xref>] and disruption of <italic>BNI1</italic> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b, c</xref>]). In addition to these observations, we now include an additional experiment, in which cells are treated with GdnHCl after the thermal stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f, g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Under these conditions, Hsp104-GFP still localizes to heat-induced aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f</xref>) and is asymmetrically retained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), but [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> curing is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1g</xref>), indicating that both Hsp104-GFP localization and activity are required for curing.</p><p>Prolonged overexpression of Hsp104 from a galactose-inducible promoter alone has been previously reported to induce prion curing of both [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Strong</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chernoff <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>) and [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wegrzyn <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). We have also previously shown that lower-level overexpression (∼5-fold) is insufficient to cure [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Strong</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DiSalvo et al. 2011</xref>). Using short induction of a galactose-inducible Hsp104 construct that transiently raises Hsp104 accumulation to the level observed with thermal stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>), we now demonstrate that [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> curing does occur, but at a lower frequency than with thermal stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Studies from the Ter-Avanesyan lab revealed that Sup35 SDS-resistant aggregates isolated from a [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Strong</sup> strain increase in size upon Hsp104 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kryndushkin <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). We have confirmed this result and further demonstrated that the same holds true for SDS-resistant aggregates isolated from a [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e</xref>). This observation is in contrast to our analysis of Sup35 SDS-resistant aggregates following thermal stress.

As we address in the Discussion, these observations together indicate that the mechanisms of curing by specific overexpression of Hsp104 and by thermal stress are distinct.</p><p><italic>2) A broader context here would be useful as a number of laboratories have made observations on Q-bodies (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22"><italic>Escusa-Torete et. al., 2013</italic></xref><italic>), iPOD, JUNQ (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37"><italic>Kaganovich et. al., 2008</italic></xref><italic>), aggresomes (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34"><italic>Johnston et. al., 1998</italic></xref><italic>), and spatial sequestration and symmetrical inheritance in yeast (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76"><italic>Song et al., 2014</italic></xref><italic>) have demonstrated that aggregates have spatial restrictions and numerous papers have shown that multiple chaperones are associated with these aggregate structures using a wide range of proteomic and co-localization methods, often with substantial consequences on cellular activity.

We have reworked the Discussion to more clearly link our studies to the literature available on spatial quality control and to address the distinctions between our observations of enhanced proteostasis capacity and those in the literature demonstrating reduced proteostasis capacity.

Under these conditions, Hsp104 expression is elevated ∼3-fold, but we see no evidence of asymmetric localization by microscopy presumably due to the continued misfolding of newly-made proteins in both mother and daughter cells. Thus, both elevation of Hsp104 and its asymmetric localization are required for [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> curing, as noted above in point 2 under “Response to points common to at least two reviews.”</p><p><italic>Finally, the effects of different temperature conditions are intriguing. What is the nature of the biophysical transformation of Sup35 in 30C cells compared to those exposed to 40C beyond that rather vague terminology of shift from SDS-resistant to SDS-sensitive</italic>?</p><p>We have previously demonstrated that the prion domain Sup35 transitions from an SDS-sensitive form in its monomeric state to an SDS-resistant form in its amyloid state both <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Serio <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Satpute-Krishnan and Serio, 2005</xref>). We have clarified this point in the text.</p><p><italic>What is special about 40C? Is this a useful tool to understand more completely the cellular environment</italic>?</p><p>Based on our studies, 40°C-treated cells accumulate more heat-induced aggregates than cells treated at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This increase in accumulation correlates with an increase in the Hsp104 interactome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), an increase in asymmetric localization of Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figure 4b, 5a</xref>) and an increase in [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> curing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a, b</xref>). Thus, the more severe thermal stress creates a unique proteostatic niche that allows Hsp104 to resolve amyloid <italic>in vivo</italic>. We have stressed these points in the revised manuscript both with the additional of new data and with modifications to the text.</p><p><italic>A broader context here would be useful as a number of laboratories have made observations on Q-bodies (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22"><italic>Escusa-Torete et. al., 2013</italic></xref><italic>), iPOD, JUNQ (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37"><italic>Kaganovich et. al., 2008</italic></xref><italic>), aggresomes (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34"><italic>Johnston et. al., 1998</italic></xref><italic>), and spatial sequestration and symmetrical inheritance in yeast (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76"><italic>Song et al., 2014</italic></xref><italic>) have demonstrated that aggregates have spatial restrictions and numerous papers have shown that multiple chaperones are associated with these aggregate structures using a wide range of proteomic and co-localization methods, often with substantial consequences on cellular activity. Some of these would seem to have opposing outcomes, which then poses questions how the mother-daughter cell relationship of yeast relates to metazoan cell division, and broader relevance to neurons being post-mitotic</italic>.</p><p>Please see the response to point 3 under “Response to points common to at least two reviews” above.</p><p><italic>Additional comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) Evidence for involvement of Hsp104 in Sup35 amyloid disassembly comes both from the literature and new data presented here, that (i) the GdnHCl curing of [PSI+]weak and a ∼50% decrease in curing efficiency was observed in a heterozygous deletion of Hsp104 (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2a, b</italic></xref><italic>), (ii) Hsp104 was asymmetric localized upon thermal stress (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6"><italic>Figure 4, 6</italic></xref><italic>) and (iii) no significant changes were observed for Hsp104, Ssa1 and Sis1 chaperone expression levels upon heat stress (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>).

We believe that establishing these points represents a significant advance in the field because up until this point, the engagement of chaperones with substrates has been correlated with reduced, not enhanced, activity. As we address in the Discussion, we believe that our system, which retains all factors within their native balance, is a major reason for this distinction.</p><p>We also agree that there are likely to be other factors that are necessary to promote Sup35 amyloid disassembly in response to thermal stress. In this manuscript, we focused the assessment of this possibility on factors that are known to be required for Hsp104-mediated fragmentation of Sup35 amyloid <italic>in vivo</italic> (Ssa1 and Sis1). We find no evidence for asymmetric localization of these factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d, e</xref>).</p><p>With regard to curing by overexpression of Hsp104 alone, we have previously published this result for [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Strong</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Disalvo et al. 2011</xref>). For [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup>, please see the response to point 2 under “Response to points common to at least two reviews” above.</p><p><italic>2) The authors' evidence for the formation of heat-induced, non-prion aggregates that accumulate upon heat stress and sequester Hsp104 in the mother cell rests on SDD-AGE (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1c</italic></xref><italic>), differential centrifugation (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3b</italic></xref><italic>) and that formation of aggregates correlates with other Hsp104 specific observations</italic>.</p><p><italic>The protocol used for differential centrifugation is not sufficiently well described. It appears that the aggregates were quantified using a Bradford assay after pelleting in a tabletop centrifuge and a mild detergent wash. If the aggregates were not denatured before quantification, the presence of large particles may cause artifacts while making colorimetric measurements in a spectrophotometer. Since the quantification of these aggregates is an important aspect of this story, the authors should quantify aggregate formation with more vigor, using alternative procedures such as sucrose-density gradients and ultra-centrifugation to separate aggregates from other cellular debris. More central, the differential accumulation of aggregates in mother vs. daughter cells should be quantified and compared to the values on the differential retention of Hsp104</italic>.</p><p>We have clarified our protocol for quantifying aggregates. While we did not denature the proteins before Bradford analysis, our protocol does include a preclear step to remove cellular debris. In lieu of additional characterization of aggregates on their own, we have instead included a more rigorous assessment of the Hsp104 interactome by co-immunocapture, SDS-PAGE and general protein staining. This experiment leads to the same conclusion: Hsp104 interacts with more proteins following a 40°C thermal stress than following a 37°C thermal stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).</p><p>We have not quantified the differential retention of aggregates following thermal stress because Hsp104GFP has been previously demonstrated to co-localize with model proteins (VHL, ubc9ts), which misfold upon thermal stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaganovich <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>), and with oxidatively damaged proteins, which are asymmetrically retained in mother cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erjavec et al. 2007</xref>). However, we now show that the asymmetrically retained Hsp104GFP foci co-localize with a model substrate firefly luciferase-mCherry upon thermal stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) An important conclusion is that the heat-induced aggregates directly retain Hsp104, but there is no evidence for the direct interaction between these two factors, other than strong correlation. This would be greatly strengthened by an experiment that isolates these aggregates (see point 2 above) and demonstrates the presence of Hsp104 bound to these aggregates, using a digest and mass spectrometric quantification, for example. Alternatively, the authors could perform a co-IP experiment if they had more information on one of the proteins that is a constituent of these heat-induced aggregates</italic>.</p><p>Please see the response to point 1 under “Response to points common to at least two reviews” above.</p><p><italic>4) Have the authors ruled out an effect on protein synthesis? Heat shock, in particular, is well known to inhibit protein synthesis, which could affect the flux, and shift equilibria in the proper cellular environment towards dissociation</italic>?</p><p>There are two pieces of evidence, included in our original submission, that argues against this possibility. First, Sup35 protein levels are unchanged by the thermal stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>), a point that we now clarify in the text. Second, treatment with cycloheximide alone does not lead to Sup35 solubilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), a point that we now highlight in the text.</p><p><italic>5) A point is regarding the relevance of the conclusions the authors make on the existence of cell-based limitations that preclude amyloid resolubilization in vivo to disease conditions. Since it is clear from their data that the cell-cycle stage is an important determinant that affects the success of resolubilization in vivo, this would not influence our understanding of the PQC in non-dividing neuronal cells. The authors should place their results in the broader context of protein misfolding diseases in the discussion</italic>.</p><p>Please see the response to point 3 under “Response to points common to at least two reviews” above.</p><p><italic>6) Another point in the discussion on spatial engagement of PQC factors and effects on proteostasis capacity is a recent observation (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99"><italic>Yu et. al., 2014</italic></xref><italic>) on aggregate-associated sequestration of Hsc70 leading to down regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Does this suggest that the interactions of chaperones with aggregates could have different outcomes</italic>?</p><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point. It is certainly possible that sequestration of chaperones can lead to different outcomes in different situations. Another possibility is that the outcomes are dictated by the experimental conditions. Our studies are distinct from those of Yu <italic>et al.</italic> in that the latter study employs aggregation-prone proteins that are expressed to high levels, which could promote imbalance in the system, as we address in the Discussion. We are in the early stages of understanding non-transcriptional mechanisms for regulating chaperone activity in cells, and these distinctions highlight interesting lines of investigation to pursue in the future.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>1) 'but a direct demonstration of amyloid resolubilization in vivo has yet to be reported in any system'.

Hence, this statement is incorrect and misleading</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for the confusion regarding this sentence. The text in question was meant to refer to studies in which chaperones were specifically overexpressed in amyloid model systems. We do agree with the reviewer that additional literature demonstrating amyloid clearance upon repression of synthesis of the amyloidogenic protein, as well as the effects of dominant-negative mutants are important to consider as well. We have re-written this part of the Introduction to highlight the facts that 1) chaperone overexpression has not been demonstrated to resolve amyloid <italic>in vivo</italic> and 2) amyloid clearance mechanisms must exist <italic>in vivo</italic>, although they are ineffective against continuously expressed, wildtype amyloid proteins.</p><p>With regard to the studies of Park <italic>et al.</italic> 2014, we disagree with the reviewer on the strength of the evidence supporting amyloid resolubilization <italic>in vivo</italic>. First, these studies are conducted under conditions of continued protein synthesis and over extended time frames, and as we have previously demonstrated (Satpute-Krishnan and Serio, 2005); newly-made protein quickly accumulates in a soluble form when Hsp104 activity is inhibited. Second, the interpretation of these microscopy experiments is inconsistent with previous biochemical studies that demonstrate an increase in the size of Sup35 aggregates upon Hsp104 overexpression, which we have reproduced for both the [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Strong</sup> and [<italic>PSI</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e</xref>).
