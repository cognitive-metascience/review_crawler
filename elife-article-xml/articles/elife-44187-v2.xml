pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44187.001</object-id><p>Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare liver cancer. FLCs uniquely produce DNAJ-PKAc, a chimeric enzyme consisting of a chaperonin-binding domain fused to the Cα subunit of protein kinase A. Biochemical analyses of clinical samples reveal that a unique property of this fusion enzyme is the ability to recruit heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). This cellular chaperonin is frequently up-regulated in cancers. Gene-editing of mouse hepatocytes generated disease-relevant AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cell lines. Further analyses indicate that the proto-oncogene A-kinase anchoring protein-Lbc is up-regulated in FLC and functions to cluster DNAJ-PKAc/Hsp70 sub-complexes with a RAF-MEK-ERK kinase module. Drug screening reveals Hsp70 and MEK inhibitor combinations that selectively block proliferation of AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cells. Phosphoproteomic profiling demonstrates that DNAJ-PKAc biases the signaling landscape toward ERK activation and engages downstream kinase cascades. Thus, the oncogenic action of DNAJ-PKAc involves an acquired scaffolding function that permits recruitment of Hsp70 and mobilization of local ERK signaling.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44187.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Fibrolamellar carcinoma (or FLC for short) is a rare type of liver cancer that affects teenagers and young adults. FLC tumors are often resistant to standard radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatments. The only way to treat FLC is to remove tumors by surgery. However, often the tumors come back after initial treatment and spread to other locations. Therefore, there is a genuine need to improve the treatment options available to FLC patients.</p><p>The tumor cells of FLC patients contain a genetic defect that fuses together two genes, which produce proteins called DNAJ and PKAc. Normally, DNAJ helps other proteins in the cell to fold into their correct shapes, while PKAc is an enzyme that can control how cells communicate. However, it is not clear what the abnormal DNAJ-PKAc fusion protein does, or how it causes FLC.</p><p>Turnham, Smith et al. have now used gene editing to make mouse liver cells that mimic the human FLC mutation. Biochemical experiments on these cells showed that the DNAJ-PKAc protein brings together unique combinations of enzymes that drive uncontrolled cell growth. Analyzing cells taken from tumors in FLC patients confirmed that these enzymes are also activated in the human disease. Turnham, Smith et al. also found that combinations of drugs that simultaneously target the DNAJ-PKAc protein and the recruited enzymes slowed down the growth of FLC cells. More experiments are now needed to test these drug combinations on human FLC cells or in mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Protein kinase A</kwd><kwd>combination therapy</kwd><kwd>fibrolamellar carcinoma</kwd><kwd>MAP kinase</kwd><kwd>intratumoral heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>local signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2T32CA080416</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turnham</surname><given-names>Rigney E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32DK121415</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Omar</surname><given-names>Mitchell H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21CA177402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ong</surname><given-names>Shao-En</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10 OD021502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ong</surname><given-names>Shao-En</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21CA201867</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riehle</surname><given-names>Kimberly J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006058</institution-id><institution>St. Baldrick's Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riehle</surname><given-names>Kimberly J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007909</institution-id><institution>Fibrolamellar Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yeung</surname><given-names>Raymond S</given-names></name><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK119192</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fibrolamellar carcinoma results from a genetic lesion that produces the DNAJ-PKAc fusion kinase, which is recruited into macromolecular complexes and is sensitive to combinations of signal transduction inhibitor drugs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a variant of liver cancer that has distinctive histologic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Craig et al., 1980</xref>). This rare cancer afflicts healthy adolescents and young adults between the ages of 15–25 with no history of liver disease. This latter feature can compromise early diagnosis of FLC as patients frequently present with vague symptoms that include abdominal pain, loss of appetite, or a palpable mass. The diagnosis is often made after disease has spread outside the liver, leading to an overall survival of 35% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ang et al., 2013</xref>). Unfortunately, FLC frequently recurs, as it is intractable to standard chemotherapies and radiation. Surgical resection is currently the only opportunity for a cure. The search for new therapies for these patients is hindered by the limited availability of clinical samples and a lack of disease relevant cell lines or animal models that faithfully recapitulate the pathogenesis of FLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dinh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engelholm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kastenhuber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oikawa et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Recent transformative advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of FLC offer renewed hope for the development of drug therapies to treat this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Honeyman et al., 2014</xref>). Sequencing tumor genomes of FLCs identified the underlying genetic defect as a heterozygous in-frame deletion of ~400 kb in chromosome 19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Honeyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). This genetic lesion leads to translation of a de novo chimeric gene product where the chaperonin-binding domain of heat shock protein 40 (DNAJ) is fused to the Cα subunit of PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Honeyman et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We have recently shown that DNAJ-PKAc is solely expressed in FLCs, is cAMP-responsive, and importantly is incorporated into A-Kinase Anchoring Protein (AKAP) signaling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggle et al., 2016a</xref>).

Whole exome sequencing from independent patient cohorts have identified pathological mutations in PKAc that are linked to Cushing’s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sato et al., 2014</xref>). This disease occurs either as consequence of pituitary tumors that overproduce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or as a consequence of aberrant signaling events that stimulate excess cortisol release from the adrenal glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beuschlein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lacroix et al., 2015</xref>). In the latter instance, amino acid substitution of arginine 205 to lysine in PKAc prevents binding to the regulatory (R) subunits of PKA to promote mislocalization of uncontrolled PKA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2014</xref>). In this report, we define a mechanism of action of DNAJ-PKAc, the fusion kinase exclusively expressed in fibrolamellar carcinoma. We have discovered that this fusion kinase is recruited into AKAP signaling complexes where, by virtue of its DNAJ domain, selectively interacts with the chaperonin heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). This cellular chaperonin facilitates protein folding thereby providing an explanation as to why levels of DNAJ-PKAc protein are elevated over wildtype PKA in FLCs. The association of Hsp70 with DNAJ-PKAc also creates a unique therapeutic target for combinations of Hsp70 and kinase inhibitor drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DNAJ-PKAc in fibrolamellar carcinomas</title><p>Immunoblot screening of clinical samples with antibodies against PKAc revealed that human FLCs are heterozygous in that they express both wildtype PKA and the DNAJ-PKAc fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top panel). This unique PKA fusion is solely expressed in FLCs, remains responsive to the second messenger cAMP, and importantly is incorporated by A-Kinase Anchoring proteins (AKAPs) into signaling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggle et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Riggle et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Turnham and Scott, 2016</xref>). Immunofluorescent analysis of normal liver and FLC sections illuminated the distinctive morphology of this subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma where liver tumor is infiltrated with fibroid bands interspersed between cancerous hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Craig et al., 1980</xref>). This ‘intratumoral heterogeneity’ is distinct from the undulating sinusoidal pattern of normal liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C &amp; D</xref>).

Counterstaining with DAPI (blue) is included to denote nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C &amp; D</xref>). Additional biochemical characterization of these clinical samples substantiated the elevated expression of the type Iα regulatory subunit of PKA (RIα) in FLC tumors as compared normal adjacent tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, top panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggle et al., 2016a</xref>).

Immunoblot analyses using a phospho-PKA substrates antibody detects a different pattern of PKA phosphorylation in tumors as compared to adjacent liver extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition, an RII overlay survey of AKAPs reveals a distinct pattern of anchoring proteins in FLC as compared to adjacent liver tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These findings infer that introduction of DNAJ-PKAc results in changes in the substrate preference of this kinase or its access to subcellular targets. Yet, it remained important to ascertain whether the substrate specificity of this pathological fusion enzyme is altered in FLC. Phosphoproteomic profiling of human FLC and adjacent normal liver samples by label-free LC-MS/MS analysis identified 7697 phosphopeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hogrebe et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; n = 6 technical replicates). Of these, 628 phosphopeptides were significantly enriched in FLCs as compared to adjacent normal liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; orange). Substrate profiling with the NetworKIN platform predicted consensus kinase phosphorylation motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Horn et al., 2014</xref>). Of the phosphosites increased in FLC, 20% were putative PKC targets and 8% were ERK-MAPK sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This analysis revealed a systemwide rewiring of several protein kinase networks leading to increases and decreases in phosphorylation of specific substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, PKA phosphosites were only enriched by 6.5%. However, phosphorylation of several key signaling effectors, scaffolding and anchoring proteins were enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). One plausible explanation for this surprisingly modest effect on PKA signaling is that oncogenesis driven by the fusion kinase may not only solely proceed through the kinase domain but also involves the chaperonin-binding site. Thus, DNAJ-PKAc may function to recruit additional elements that underlie the pathology of FLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Further immunoprecipitation experiments from clinical samples revealed that DNAJ-PKAc interacts with heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), a cellular chaperonin that facilitates protein folding and is frequently up-regulated in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calderwood et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mayer and Bukau, 2005</xref>). Proximity ligation (PLA) is an in situ technique that amplifies detection of native protein-protein interactions that occur within in a range of 40–60 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Whiting et al., 2015</xref>). This approach was used to identify interaction between endogenous Hsp70 and PKAc in liver sections from FLC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J &amp; K</xref>). PLA puncta indicative of native DNAJ-PKAc/Hsp70 sub-complexes were readily detected in regions of tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

This finding was confirmed in situ by immunofluorescent detection. Phospho-ERK signal was barely detectable in control AML12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F &amp; G</xref>), but clearly evident in the cytoplasm of AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H &amp; I</xref>). Actin (red) and DAPI (blue) were used as cytoskeletal and nuclear markers respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G &amp; I</xref>). We next monitored the efficacy of Hsp70/MEK inhibitors on basal ERK activity in AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cells. In wildtype cells, treatment with Ver-155008 (3 μM) alone had no effect on ERK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, top panel, lanes 1 and 2). However, administration of cobimetinib (100 nM) or a combination of both drugs abolished detection of the phospho-ERK signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, top panel, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, basal phospho-ERK levels were high in AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cells, treatment with Ver-155008 (3 μM) alone had a modest effect on phospho-ERK signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, top panel, lanes 5 and 6). Application of cobimetinib (100 nM) or in combination with Ver-155008 abolished detection of phospho-ERK signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, top panel, lanes 7 and 8). Thus, dual inhibition of Hsp70 and elements of the RAF-MEK-ERK cascade impedes mitogenic signals to preferentially block proliferation of AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cells. This postulate was confirmed by clonogenic growth assays that monitor colony formation. Crystal violet staining showed that the synergistic effect of cobimetinib (100 nM) and Ver-155008 (3 μM) blocked AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cell proliferation more potently than either drug alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>).

Mutation of a conserved HPD motif that demarks a critical loop in the DNAJ domain abolishes interaction with Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hennessy et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Thus, substitution of H33 to Q in the context of DNAJ-PKAc would be expected to prevent association with endogenous Hsp70 in AML12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Wildtype AML12 cells were transfected with vectors encoding DNAJ-PKAc or DNAJ-PKAc H33Q. Additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments used transiently transfected AKAP-Lbc as the scaffold to isolate DNAJ-PKAc-Hsp70 sub-complexes. Introduction of the H33Q mutation greatly reduces the level of Hsp70 in AKAP-Lbc complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, top panel, lane 3). The simplest explanation of this result is that addition of the J-domain onto the N-terminus of PKAc induces a novel interaction with Hsp70, thereby permitting the recruitment of this chaperonin to AKAP signaling islands. Immunoblot detection confirmed that basal levels of phospho-ERK were elevated upon introduction of DNAJ-PKAc in wildtype AML12 cells while transfection with the DNAJ-PKAc H33Q mutant diminished ERK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, top panel). Densitometry analysis of four independent experiments confirmed this result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, graph).

More specifically, we show that the chaperonin-binding domain of this fusion enzyme supports recruitment of the co-chaperonin Hsp70. This creates a unique molecular context in which the DNAJ-PKAc chimera acts in FLCs. Chaperonopathies are a group of diseases caused by genetic lesions or aberrant post-translational modifications of molecular chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Macario and Conway de Macario, 2007</xref>). ‘Chaperonopathies by mistake’ are a sub-group of related disorders, including certain cancers, in which chaperonin activity is normal, but becomes inappropriately assimilated into molecular pathways that enhance disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Macario and Conway de Macario, 2007</xref>). We believe that formation of DNAJ-PKAc/Hsp70 sub-complexes in FLC is an example of this latter category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calderwood et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mayer and Bukau, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Whitesell and Lindquist, 2005</xref>). Chaperonins can repair misfolded proteins to reduce cellular stress or, as we believe is the case in FLC, recruitment of Hsp70 through the DNAJ domain preferentially stabilizes the chimeric PKAc fusion protein. This hypothesis is borne out by data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2G</xref> wherein we demonstrate that protein levels of the DNAJ-PKAc variant are elevated in tumor samples and disease-relevant cell lines as compared to native PKA. In addition, the abnormal pairing of Hsp70 with DNAJ-PKAc creates new and unique drug targets. This rationale provided the impetus to screen a panel of recognized chemotherapeutics in combination with an Hsp70 inhibitor. This new precision pharmacology approach ascertained if certain drug pairings act synergistically to inhibit proliferation of cells harboring macromolecular complexes of this chaperonin and the fusion kinase.</p><p>Since aberrant kinase activity is known to drive many cancers, we further reasoned that augmented PKA activity could also contribute to the pathobiology of FLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Druker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Turnham and Scott, 2016</xref>). However, one confounding factor is that the pathological DNAJ-PKAc fusion and its native kinase counterpart share similar sensitivities to the inhibitor PKI and efficiently bind R subunits to form type I and type II PKA holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggle et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Scott et al., 1985</xref>). Although physiochemically similar, notable differences between the PKA holoenzyme subtypes include lack of an autoregulatory phosphorylation site in RI isoforms, different in vitro binding affinities for cAMP and dispersal to distinct subcellular sites via interaction with distinct AKAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burgers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feramisco et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Means et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>). Another noteworthy feature is that expression of the DNAJ-PKAc enhances production or stabilization of the RIα subunit. Interestingly this phenomenon occurs in both FLCs and AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Langeberg and Scott, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggle et al., 2016a</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Such increased availability of RIα subunits may be indicative of tumor-specific variation in the ratio of type I to type II PKA activity. Switching of PKA isotypes may be clinically relevant as lesions in RI subunit genes are linked to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho-Chung and Nesterova, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stratakis, 2013</xref>). For example, nonsense and insertion mutations reduce levels of RIα in the endocrine neoplasia Carney complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stratakis, 2013</xref>). Similarly, mutations in the cAMP binding sites that render RIα less sensitive to cAMP have been linked to the rare skeletal dysplasia syndrome acrodysostosis type I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rhayem et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, perhaps the most intriguing example is a single case report of inactivating mutations in RIα that induce sporadic fibrolamellar carcinomas in the absence of classic DNAJ-PKAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Graham et al., 2018</xref>). Although the molecular mechanism surrounding this unusual case is not clear, one can postulate that reduced type I PKA activity, loss of anchoring to RI selective AKAPs, or overcompensation by type II PKA holoenzymes contributes to pathogenesis. Thus, marked changes in the quantity, isotype ratio and subcellular distribution of PKA holoenzymes, combined with the availability of DNAJ-PKAc may be factors that contribute to the etiology of FLC. A second postulate is that re-localization of Hsp70 to AKAP complexes by DNAJ-PKAc may be a critical event in transformation in FLC patients. Thus, the chaperonin binding properties of DNAJ-PKAc may as pertinent to oncogenesis as the intrinsic kinase activity of the fusion enzyme. Hence, we propose that the genetic lesion in chromosome 19 that is a hallmark of FLC incorporates a new binding interface that transforms PKA from an essential ‘homeostatic enzyme’ into a dual-function kinase/scaffolding protein with pathological implications.</p><p>Our combination drug screen implicates mobilization of the ERK signaling cascade as a likely factor in the progression of FLC. Although mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways feature prominently in many cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kolch et al., 2015</xref>), we propose that the impact of RAF-MEK-ERK signaling on FLC is complex and atypical. Three factors contribute to this view. First, whole exome sequencing confirms that FLCs lack activating mutations in Ras or B-RAF, but rather arise from a monogenic lesion in chromosome 19 that produces the DNAJ-PKAc fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cornella et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lalazar and Simon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Simon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Second, our screen of FDA approved anti-cancer compounds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and I</xref> reveals that drugs targeting upstream elements of the ERK cascade, including EGF receptor antagonists erlotinib, lapatinib and afatinib and the B-RAF inhibitors dabrafenib and vemurafenib were ineffective, or at best exhibited modest antiproliferative effects when used in combination with Ver-155008. Interestingly, the ERK inhibitor GDC-0994 had little effect on proliferation in these combination screens. Therefore, we interpret the exquisite sensitivity of AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cells to MEK inhibition to suggest that DNAJ-PKAc may be acting downstream of Ras-Raf activation. A third contributing factor seems to be the atypical pattern of ERK activation in FLCs, which impacts downstream phosphorylation events. We base this conclusion on the regional immunofluorescent detection of phospho-ERK and its substrate P90RSK in FLC sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C &amp; G</xref>). If these findings are reconciled with immunoblot data indicating that global levels of phospho-ERK and phospho-P90RSK minimally change tumor lysates, it argues for heterogeneous activation of both kinases occurs only in pockets of tumor. Collectively, these observations argue that the distinctive morphological features of FLC where cancerous cells are intermingled with fibrous tissue creates a heterogeneous tumor microenvironment that is prone to irregular activation of the ERK signaling cascade.</p><p>Although molecular links between ERK and DNAJ-PKAc were not immediately evident, we reasoned that one commonality was the proto-oncogene AKAP-Lbc. Anchored PKA activity has been implicated in the phosphorylation of RAF kinase and KSR-1 in the context of AKAP-Lbc signaling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takahashi et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, AKAP-Lbc is upregulated in human FLCs, and interacts directly with RAF-MEK-ERK kinase signaling scaffolds. In keeping with this molecular mechanism, our phosphoproteomic analysis identifies elevated PKA phosphorylation of serine 838 on KSR in FLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This is especially interesting in light of early findings that Hsp90 and certain Hsp70 isoforms are elements of KSR scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stewart et al., 1999</xref>) and data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref> showing that the chaperonins including the Hsp70-DNAJ-PKAc subcomplex are selectively recruited to AKAP-Lbc-KSR signaling units in FLC.</p><p>The relationship between cAMP and ERK signaling in cancer is complex and context dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dumaz and Marais, 2005</xref>). For example, PKA has pleotropic effects on tumor-initiation. Paradoxically, a recent report postulates that PKA activity leads to mesenchymal-to-epithelial transitions that impede oncogenesis; yet DNAJ-PKAc kinase activity is thought to be necessary for tumor initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kastenhuber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pattabiraman et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, one pertinent and unanswered question is whether or not the kinase activity residing within DNAJ-PKAc is an absolute requirement for FLC progression. This view is further substantiated by the phosphoproteomics data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref> showing that DNAJ-PKAc/Hsp70 macromolecular assemblies skew the signaling landscape toward enhanced ERK signaling rather than simply potentiating the action of PKA. Together, these results imply that recruitment of Hsp70 enhances basal ERK signaling in AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cells by preferentially stabilizing this oncogenic signaling unit. Indirect support for this notion is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> showing that abolishing the binding of Hsp70 to DNAJ-PKAc complex decreases ERK signaling. Thus, we postulate that the preferential stabilization of DNAJ-PKAc proceeds through the local action of Hsp70. Such a mechanism could explain why greater amounts of the DNAJ-PKAc fusion kinase are detected in FLCs and our AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cells as compared to wildtype PKA. That said, we do not discount the kinase activity of DNAJ-PKAc as a pathological factor in FLC. Rather, we propose that recruitment of Hsp70 via the DNAJ domain in the chimeric DNAJ-PKAc kinase is an important new element that contributes to the dysregulation of this unique fusion enzyme.</p><p>One shared objective of the FLC research community and those investigating rare adolescent cancers is to identify and test therapeutic targets in the most efficient possible manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kastenhuber et al., 2019</xref>). One advantage of screening FDA-approved compounds is that the pharmacotoxicity, therapeutic indices, and off-target effects of most components are well documented. Accordingly, each MEK inhibitor identified in our screen has been approved for the treatment of melanoma and other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caunt et al., 2015</xref>). Another benefit of the combination screening approach is the potential to identify drug pairings that can be used at lower effective doses; though there is also the possibility that new drug combinations may prove more toxic. This could be an important consideration for Ver-155008 as clinical trials with other Hsp70 inhibitors hold promise for the treatment of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goloudina et al., 2012</xref>). Although the utility of Hsp70 and MEK inhibition as combination therapy for FLC is far from clear, our discovery of drug pairs that selectively halt the growth of cells expressing DNAJ-PKAc but not wildtype hepatocytes provides a valuable tool to further the investigation for new treatments of this debilitating disease of adolescents.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

id="s4-2"><title>Phosphoproteomics</title><p>Human FLC and normal adjacent liver was harvested according to above IRB and flash frozen. AML12 and AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cells were grown on a 15 cm dish and after rinsing twice with ice cold PBS, cells were harvested in 750 μL of 6M aq. Guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn*HCl) containing 100 mM Tris, 5 mM TCEP*HCl, and 10 mM chloroacetamide (CAM), pH 8.5, using a cell scraper. Frozen human FLC specimens of ca. 100 mg wet weight were ground into a fine powder using the CryoGrinder Kit from OPS Diagnostics (Lebanon, NJ) and added to the Gdn*HCl buffer described above. Cell lysates were pipetted into 1.5 mL microtubes, voretexed briefly and heated to 95C for 5 min. Samples were then sonicated in a Qsonica cup sonicator (Newton, CT) at 100 W for 10 min (30 s on, 30 s off) on ice. Protein content was measured using the Pierce 660 nm assay reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Aliquots of 300 μg of protein were pipetted into a new tube and diluted 2-fold with 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) pH = 8.5. 3 μg of sequencing-grade endoproteinase Lys-C (Wako, Richmond, VA) were added (1:100 ratio) and the mixture agitated on a thermomixer at 1400 rpm at 37°C for 2 hr. The mixture was diluted another 2-fold with 100 mM TEAB pH = 8.5 and 3 μg of trypsin were added. The mixture was agitated on a thermomixer at 1400 rpm at 37°C for overnight, acidified with formic acid (1% final), and cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at RT and 14,000 rcf. Peptides were extracted from the supernatant using Oasis HLB 1cc (10 mg) extraction cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA). Cartridges were activated by passing through 200 μL of methanol followed by 200 μL 80% aq. ACN containing 0.1% TFA, equilibrated with 400 μL 1% aq. formic acid. Peptides were loaded and then washed with 400 μL 1% aq. formic acid. Peptides were eluted with 300 μL 80% aq. ACN containing 0.1% TFA and directly subjected to the published batch IMAC phosphopeptide enrichment protocol with the following minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Golkowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Villén and Gygi, 2008</xref>). 20 μL of a 50% IMAC bead slurry composed of 1/3 commercial PHOS-select iron affinity gel (Sigma Aldrich), 1/3 in-house made Fe3+-NTA superflow agarose and 1/3 in-house made Ga3+-NTA superflow agarose were used for phosphopeptide enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ficarro et al., 2009</xref>). The IMAC slurry was washed three times with 10 bed volumes of 80% aq. ACN containing 0.1% TFA and phosphopeptide enrichment was performed in the same buffer. Phosphopeptides were desalted using C18 StageTips according to the published protocol with the following minor modifications; after activation with 50 μL methanol and 50 μL 80% aq. ACN containing 0.1% TFA the StageTips were equilibrated with 50 μL 1% aq. formic acid. Then the peptides that were reconstituted in 50 μL 1% aq. formic acid were loaded and washed with 50 μL 1% aq. formic acid. The use of 1% formic acid instead of 5% aq. ACN containing 0.1% TFA prevents the loss of highly hydrophilic phosphopeptides.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>nanoLC-MS/MS phosphoproteomics analysis</title><p>The LC-MS/MS analyses were performed on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Orbitrap Elite instrument (AML12 cell lines) or a Thermo Fisher Scientific Orbitrap Fusion (human FLC specimens) as described previously with the following minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Golkowski et al., 2017</xref>). Peptide samples were separated on a Thermo-Dionex RSLCNano UHPLC instrument (Sunnyvale, CA) using 20 cm long fused silica capillary columns (100 μm ID) packed with 3 μm 120 Å reversed phase C18 beads (Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch, DE). For phosphopeptide samples the LC gradient was 120 min long with 3–30% B at 300 nL/min. LC solvent A was 0.1% aq.acetic acid and LC solvent B was 0.1% acetic acid, 99.9% acetonitrile.

MS/MS spectra were searched against the UniProt human database (updated July 22nd, 2015). MaxQuant search parameters: Variable modifications included Oxidation (M) and Phospho (S/T/Y). Carbamidomethyl (C) was a fixed modification. Max. missed cleavages was 2, enzyme was Trypsin/P and max. charge was 7. The MaxQuant ‘match between runs’ feature was enabled. The initial search tolerance for FTMS scans was 20 ppm and 0.5 Da for ITMS MS/MS scans.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data processing and statistical analysis</title><p>MaxQuant raw data were processed, statistically analyzed and clustered using the Perseus software package v1.5.6.095 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>). Human gene ontology (GO) terms (GOBP, GOCC and GOMF) were loaded from the Perseus Annotations file downloaded on the 01.08.2017. Expression columns (phosphopeptide MS intensities) were log2 transformed and normalized by subtracting the median log2 expression value of each column from each expression value of the corresponding column. Potential contaminant, reverse hits and proteins only identified by site were removed. Reproducibility was analyzed by column correlation (Pearson’s r) and replicates that showed a variation of &gt;0.25 in the r value compared to the mean r-values of all replicates of the same experiment were removed as outliers. Significant differences in phosphopeptide expression between experiments were quantified with a two-tailed two sample t-test with unequal variances and Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons was applied (FDR = 0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>NetworKIN analyses</title><p>For human FLC and normal adjacent liver, significantly enriched phosphosites in FLC were input into the NetworKIN platform.

These cells were developed by the Nelson Fausto lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 1994</xref>). The cells from this study came from Dr. KJR and are also available at ATCC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.atcc.org/Products/All/CRL-2254.aspx">https://www.atcc.org/Products/All/CRL-2254.aspx</ext-link>). The cells were verified and mycoplasma free before beginning these studies and are currently being re-tested by STR and mycoplasma detection at IDEXX (Westbrook, ME). AML12 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.04 µg/mL dexamethasone, 0.1% gentamicin, 1 µg/mL recombinant human insulin, 0.55 µg/mL human transferrin, and 0.5 ng/mL sodium selenite. All cell lines were maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. For lysates probed with phospho-ERK, cells were serum-starved for 16–24 hr and lysed. Serum-starved medium was prepared as above with the exception of addition of FBS. Cells for cobimetinib and Ver-155008 treatment were serum-starved for 16–24 hr and then incubated with 3 μM Ver-155008 for 30 min, and either DMSO or 100 nM Cobmetinib was incubated for 10 min. AML12 cells for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref> were transfected with constructs as indicated with TransIT-LT1 (Mirus Bio).

After several washes in PBS, samples were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min and washed extensively in PBS. Cells were then subjected to PLA or immunofluorescence. Human liver tissue for PLA was fresh frozen, cut on a cryostat at 8 µm, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS at RT for 4 min. For PLA, samples were processed according to manufacturer’s instructions with anti-mouse and anti-rabbit reagents (Sigma) using PKAc (BD Transduction, 610981) and Hsp70 (Proteintech, 10995–1). Z-stacks of fluorescent images were collected using a Keyence BZ-X710 using relevant filter cubes. Maximum intensity projections were quantified for puncta number using Fiji/ImageJ. For AML12 cell PLA, images were smoothened and a duplicate image was created for use as a mask. The duplicate file was thresholded to capture as many puncta as possible without significant blending of densely packed signal. The binary mask was then used to measure selected regions from the original image. Total cell number per field of view was counted as DAPI-stained nuclei. For quantification of human liver tissue PLA, unfocused light was removed using the Keyence haze reduction function. Puncta number and fluorescence intensity were measured by automation using Keyence hybrid cell counter set to detect thresholded puncta between 0 and 1.0 µm in diameter. Puncta counts were normalized to the total image area.</p><p>Human liver tissue for immunostaining was formalin fixed and paraffin embedded.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor.

Evaluation of this model reveals an interaction of the DNAJ-PKAc fusion protein with HSP70 and difference in phosphorylation in substrates for multiple kinases in cells that express the fusion kinase. The authors focus on ERK signaling due to the selective effect of MEK inhibitors to synergize with the Hsp70 inhibitor Ver-155008. This is a strength of the study. However, there are also weaknesses. The study would be improved by the inclusion of some in vivo analysis and application to cancer therapy – for example, no studies of drug efficacy in vivo are presented and there are no PDX studies. However, this is mitigated by the focus of the present study on molecular mechanism – accordingly, this evaluation will focus on the mechanistic aspects of the study. It is noted that the data presented do not fully support the mechanistic conclusions that are presented.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Much of the Discussion section appears to be an extension of the Results section. Several figures are presented for the first time in this section. This should be corrected with all new data presented in the Results section of the manuscript.</p><p>2) The study is focused on ERK. Do FLCs show evidence of increased ERK activity?</p><p>3) Are AML12 DNAJ-PKAc cells transformed? The observation that 15/15 FLC samples contained the fusion protein (Honeyman et al., 2014) support its role in tumor formation. It is not clear if this fusion is a driver of tumorigenesis in the model the authors created, yet the authors refer to it as oncogenic (Abstract, Introduction, subsection “Hsp70 is recruited to DNAJ-PKAc complexes”). This point is important because a major conclusion of this study is that combination therapy with Ver-155008 plus MEK inhibitor may suppress FLC. If the AML12 DNAJ-PKAc cells are not transformed, the relevance of the Ver-155008 plus MEK inhibitor combination is diminished. Although in vivo experimentation is not deemed essential for the response to this critique, it should be noted that the efficacy of the proposed drug combination using a FCL model (e.g., FCL PDX, Oikawa et al., 2015) could be tested.</p><p>4) Were the three hits from the screen the only MEK inhibitors in the screen? Were ERK or Raf inhibitors included? If so, why do the authors think they were not effective? If not, do these inhibitors provide the same level of sensitivity as the MEK inhibitors when tested in combination with Ver-155008?</p><p>5) Figure 1 shows colocalization of PKAc and RIIa. While there is some overlap in FLC there is no evidence to suggest that this colocalization is in association with the DNAJ-PKAc fusion protein versus the native PKAc since all tumors appear to retain a native PKAc. Moreover, there is no insight into the relevance of RIIa versus other regulatory subunits, including other disease associated isoforms like RIa.</p><p>6) Figure 3. The characterization of PKA activity in AML12DNAJ-PKAc lacks a statistical comparison with the parental line. Furthermore, it is unclear if the level of PKA activity in AML12DNAJ-PKAc accurately reflects that of patients (documented in Figure 1). It may be best not to minimize the importance of the PKA activity of DNAJ-PKAc based on data in the AML12DNAJ-PKAc cells without first confirming that this model reflects PKA activity in FLC.</p><p>7) The proposed mechanism involves the interaction of DNAJ-PKAc with AKAP-Lbc (Figure 4). This conclusion is speculative because no studies of AKAP-Lbc function are presented. Specifically, does loss of AKAP-Lbc decrease DNAJ-PKAc mediated increased ERK activity and cell proliferation?</p><p>8) The reduction in pERK activation with the H33Q mutation is subtle, despite the loss of interaction with HSP70. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the association with AKAP-Lbc changes with the H33Q mutation. The MAPK recruitment interaction could occur through PKA and not HSP70; this is not addressed.</p><p>9) The proposed mechanism involves HSP70, although the function of HSP70 in this context is unclear. For example, the authors suggest (subsection “Hsp70 is recruited to DNAJ-PKAc complexes”) that the &quot;oncogenic nature of DNAJ-PKAc….results from the recruitment of Hsp70&quot; and in subsection “DNAJ-PKAc in FLC tumors” that the stability of the DNAJ-PKAc fusion protein may be enhanced by Hsp70? Does the DNAJ-PKAc H33Q mutant have reduced stability and impaired transforming capacity relative to DNAJ-PKAc? The authors should also comment on previous analyses of the ERK pathway that have identified HSP70 in complexes with KSR (PMC84397).</p><p>10) Figure S4 presents important data using the drug 1NM-PP1 that demonstrate that the effects of DNAJ-PKAc are not mediated by PKA activity, but these data are not described in the Results section of the manuscript. In support of Figure S4, were predicted PKA substrates from Figure 1E less phosphorylated following 1NM-PP1 treatment? The authors adapt their model from Smith et al., (2010). In that paper, the PKA in complex with AKAP-Lbc mediates phosphorylation of Ser838 on KSR1 to enhance ERK activation. This contradicts the model published in 2010 and adapted for Figure 4A. The authors should clarify this point by determining the extent to which KSR1 and Ser838 phosphorylation on KSR1 contribute to the effect of the DNAJ-PKAc fusion when it is expressed in AML12 cells.</p><p>11) Figure 1E and Figure 5D. There is no discussion of the phosphorylation sites that decrease in abundance. Does phosphorylation of some ERK substrates (or substrates of the other noted kinases) fall? If so, this would suggest an effect of the fusion protein on a shift or reprioritization of substrates rather than a mere increase in the amount of phosphorylation.</p><p>12) The inhibitors in the chemical library and the data obtained should be provided as supplemental data. A list of all the phosphorylation sites from Figure 1 and Figure 5 together with relative detection (q value and fold change) should also be included as supplemental data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44187.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Much of the Discussion section appears to be an extension of the Results section.

Do FLCs show evidence of increased ERK activity?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers astutely raise an important question. The seminal case report of Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma (FLC) noted that this liver tumor is infiltrated with fibroid bands interspersed between cancerous hepatocytes (Craig et al., 1980). This morphological feature known as “intratumoral heterogeneity” is key to answering the reviewer’s question (Pribluda et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2018).</p><p>Immunoblot analyses of FLC tumor lysates presented in a newly added figure 4A, detect a slight reduction in the overall phospho-ERK signal in patient samples. Yet immunofluorescent staining of tumor sections detects clusters of prominent and moderate phospho-ERK signal in the cancerous hepatocytes (Figure 4B and C, yellow; from “patient 3”). Such regional detection of phospho-ERK is consistent with heterogeneous intratumoral activation of the ERK cascade in FLC tumors. Likewise, the phosphoproteomic screen presented in figures 1E and F identifies numerous ERK substrates that are elevated in FLC tumors as compared to normal liver. To emphasize this point we include a list of enriched ERK substrates in figure 4D. This includes the protein kinase P90RSK, a well characterized downstream target of ERK (Dalby et al., 1998). Targeted validation of this ERK phosphorylation event in FLC tumors is provided in two ways. (1) Immunoblot detection reveals elevated levels of pSer 221-P90RSK in the same cohort of FLC tumor samples (Figure 4E). (2) Immunofluorescent detection of phospho-P90RSK in tissue sections reveals clusters of cells containing activated kinase (Figure 4F and G, magenta; example from patient 3). The heterogeneous staining profile for phospho-P90RSK shown in Figure 4F and 4G is reminiscent of the pattern of intratumoral ERK activation detected in FLC tumors (Figure 4B). Collectively these new data infer that the ERK kinase cascade is active in a subset of cells within the heterogeneous intratumoral environment of FLCs. These new data are introduced in the Results section and the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"> <p>3) Are AML12 DNAJ-PKAc cells transformed?

These properties are consistent with the very slow growth of cells from the PDX model of FLC that has been noted by other FLC investigators and discussed in our cover letter and mentioned in the Oikawa et al., article cited by the reviewers (Oikawa et al., 2015). Nevertheless, several lines of evidence indicate that the DNAJ-PKAc fusion kinase is oncogenic: (1) To further address this issue we have used colony formation assays to reinforce our data that AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cells have increased proliferative capacity as compared to their wildtype counterparts Figure 3D. Images and quantitation of data from multiple expeFriments is included in figure 3E. These results in subsection “Hsp70 is recruited to DNAJ-PKAc complexes”. (2) Two groups have independently used CRISPR to induce expression of the DNAJ-PKAc fusion in mice (Kastenhuber et al., 2017; Engelholm et al., 2017). In both cases, expression of DNAJ-PKAc promotes very slow growing liver tumors that share some phenotypic characteristics of FLC. One overriding limitation is that these animal models only develop tumors after two years. The tumorigenesis in old age phenotype of these mice contradicts the early onset of FLC in healthy adolescents (15-25 years). This prompted us to note in the original manuscript that “FLC research to date has been hampered by the limited availability of patient samples, a paucity of disease-relevant cell-lines, and mouse models with a long latency to develop hepatic tumors in old age”. For these reasons, our work is primarily focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie DNAJ-PKAc action in FLC. We hope that the next phase of this study will be to move our findings to GEMMs, future PDX mouse models and organoids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Were the three hits from the screen the only MEK inhibitors in the screen?

Drugs against upstream elements of MAP kinase signaling cascades such as EGFR were also tested. The HER inhibitors poziotinib and neratinib had modest effect in combination with Ver155008. Interestingly, the lone ERK inhibitor included, GDC-0994, had little effect on proliferation in these screens. This is discussed in the Discussion section. We have included additional details on the drug screen, including the raw data for single and combination assays, as supplemental materials (see response to point 12 below).</p><p>Interestingly, our combination drug screen also included analysis of the Raf/Braf inhibitors sorafenib, dabrafenib and vemurafenib. Acting on the advice of the reviewers, we have further investigated the effects of sorafenib in combination with Ver155008. Interestingly this drug combination has no effect on cell growth at low concentrations, but paradoxically enhances cell growth at higher concentrations (300 nM – 1 µM) in wild type and AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cells. On the basis of these studies, we interpret the exquisite sensitivity to MEK inhibition to suggest that DNAJ-PKAc may be acting downstream of Ras-Raf activation, at the level of MEK.

Moreover, there is no insight into the relevance of RIIa versus other regulatory subunits, including other disease associated isoforms like RIa.</p></disp-quote><p>There are multiple issues raised in this section:</p><p>5a) The reviewers are correct that FLC tumors retain a single allele of wild type PKA along with the DNAJ-PKAc fusion. This chimeric enzyme consists of the first 69 amino acids of Hsp40 fused in frame to residues 11 to 351 of the PKAc-α subunit. Thus, one can clearly delineate native PKA from the larger fusion kinase by immunoblot using monoclonal antibodies against PKAc (see Figure 1B, 1H, Figure 2G, 2H, Figure 5B-D and Figure 6C). However, antibodies are not available that recognize the GEEVKE junction between the DNAJ and PKAc moieties. Thus, we are currently unable to discern if PKAc and DNAJ-PKAc adopt distinct subcellular locations inside cells or tumor sections. For the record, we have tried unsuccessfully to raise antibodies against the DNAJ to PKAc junction and are currently working under the auspices of the FLC foundation to screen for monobodies that selectively recognize the fusion kinase.</p><p>5b) It is well established that DNAJ-PKAc can associate with R subunits to form functional PKA holoenzymes in FLC tumors (Honeyman et al., 2014; Riggle et al., 2016; Cao et al., 2019). In 2016 we reported that RI expression is enhanced and RIIβ levels decrease in FLC (Riggle et al., 2016). This article was cited as reference 10 in the original manuscript. As a further response to the reviewer’s request, we have incorporated new biochemical data substantiating the elevated expression of RI in FLC tumors as compared normal adjacent tissue (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, top panels). Related experiments demonstrate that RII levels do not fluctuate (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, bottom panel). This data is introduced in subsection “DNAJ-PKAc in fibrolamellar carcinomas” and initially discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>5c) The reviewers consider RIa as “a disease associated isoform’. Yet, the issue of whether the type I and type II regulatory subunits of PKA fulfill distinct biological roles remains an open question. Listed below are points of clarification.</p><p>i) Physiochemically, the main differences between RI and RII is the lack of an autoregulatory phosphorylation site in RI isoforms and subtle variance in the in vitro cAMP binding affinities of both R subunits isotypes (Taylor et al., 2012).</p><p>ii) Although it was originally proposed that RII subunits were compartmentalized by AKAPs and RI was soluble (Corbin et al., 1977; Colledge, et al., 1999), many labs including our own have shown that RI subunits are sequestered by anchoring proteins. Since then, 3 out of the 42 known human anchoring protein genes SKIP, Integrin-α4 and smAKAP have been shown to selectively interact with type I PKA holoenzymes (Means et al., 2011; Lim et al., 2007; Burgers et al., 2012).</p><p>iii) There are three examples where lesions in RI subunit genes have been linked to disease. In the rare endocrine neoplasia Carney complex nonsense and insertion mutations reduce levels of RIα (Horvath et al., 2010; Stratakis, 2013). Changes in the cAMP binding sites that render RIα less sensitive to cAMP have been linked to the rare skeletal dysplasia syndrome acrodysostosis type I (Rhayem et al., 2015). Perhaps the most relevant case to our study is a single case report that inactivating mutations in RI can induce sporadic fibrolamellar carcinomas in the absence of the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion gene (Graham et al., 2018). Although the molecular mechanism surrounding this latter case is unclear, one can postulate that loss of type I PKA, loss of anchoring to RI selective AKAPs, or overcompensation by type II PKA holoenzymes contribute to pathogenesis.</p><p>We have expanded our Discussion section to consider “the relevance of RIIa versus other regulatory subunits, including other disease associated isoforms like RI” and how changing the balance of R subunit expression might impact PKA holoenzyme signaling in FLC. We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3. The characterization of PKA activity in AML12DNAJ-PKAc lacks a statistical comparison with the parental line. Furthermore, it is unclear if the level of PKA activity in AML12DNAJ-PKAc accurately reflects that of patients (documented in Figure 1). It may be best not to minimize the importance of the PKA activity of DNAJ-PKAc based on data in the AML12DNAJ-PKAc cells without first confirming that this model reflects PKA activity in FLC.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this missing part of the analysis and concerns about the impression that we “minimize the importance of the PKA activity of DNAJ-PKAc”. Our response is in three parts.</p><p>6a) We have decided to move our PKA activity measurements to supplemental information and have incorporated the analysis of R subunit levels suggested by the reviewers (see response 5b). This new format also allows us to clarify our views on the importance of aberrant PKA activity in etiology of FLC. Our intention is certainly not to discount the kinase activity of DNAJ-PKAc as a factor that contributes to the pathology of FLC. Rather, we have discovered that recruitment of Hsp70 via the J domain of the fusion kinase is an important new element that contributes to the dysregulation and effects this enzyme in a manner that drives oncogenesis. This point is emphasized in the Discussion section.</p><p>6b) We believe that our results, when considered with data from Riggle et al., suggests that the AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cells represent a valid and sustainable model system to evaluate PKA activity in FLC. For example, RI expression levels are elevated in AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cells in a similar manner has detected in FLC tumors (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). Moreover, cAMP-stimulated PKA activity is potentiated in cells or tumor tissue expressing DNAJ-PKAc (Riggle et al; Figure 4).</p><p>We respect the reviewer’s point that it may be best not to minimize importance of PKA activity in FLC. In response to this suggestion we include new supplemental data (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-D) suggesting that the pattern of PKA phosphorylation may be different in tumors and have emphasized this issue in subsection “DNAJ-PKAc in fibrolamellar carcinomas”.</p><p>6c) We provide three additional pieces of supplementary data about PKA functionality in FLC. (1) An RII overlay survey of A-kinase anchoring proteins reveals a distinct pattern of anchoring proteins in FLC tumor as compared to adjacent liver tissue (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). This argues that the subcellular distribution of PKA and DNAJ-PKAc may be altered in FLC. This substantiates data in figures 5B-D showing increases in AKAP-Lbc expression in FLC tumors as well as the AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cells. (2) immunoblot data using the phospho-PKA substrates antibody detects a different pattern of PKA substrates in tumors as compared to adjacent liver extracts (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E). (3) One interpretation of this latter finding is that introduction of DNAJ-PKAc alters substrate preference or access to a different repertoire of local targets. This comports with phosphoproteomic data that identifies PKA substrates upregulated in FLC tumor samples (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F). Issues and speculation on the role of PKA activity in FLC are covered in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The proposed mechanism involves the interaction of DNAJ-PKAc with AKAP-Lbc (Figure 4). This conclusion is speculative because no studies of AKAP-Lbc function are presented. Specifically, does loss of AKAP-Lbc decrease DNAJ-PKAc mediated increased ERK activity and cell proliferation?</p></disp-quote><p>First of all, we would like to point out that we can isolate the AKAP-Lbc DNAJ-PKAC subcomplex from FLC tumor and AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cells (Figure 5B and C). Moreover, biochemical analyses suggest this anchoring protein is upregulated in clinical samples of FLC (Figure 5B). In transient assays, we are unable detect a change in ERK activation after siRNA-mediated knockdown of AKAP-Lbc. We are currently attempting to establish both lentiviral and inducible shRNA knockdown and CRISPR knockout of AKAP-Lbc on the background of our AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> cells. This is something we continue to develop in hopes of providing a Research Advance for this article in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The reduction in pERK activation with the H33Q mutation is subtle, despite the loss of interaction with HSP70. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the association with AKAP-Lbc changes with the H33Q mutation. The MAPK recruitment interaction could occur through PKA and not HSP70; this is not addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>There are two responses to this section.</p><p>8a) We have performed additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments in AML12 cells using AKAP-Lbc as the scaffold to isolate DNAJ-PKAc-Hsp70 sub-complexes. These data show that the H33Q mutation greatly reduces the level of Hsp70 in AKAP-Lbc complexes. The simplest explanation of this result is that addition of the J-domain onto the N-terminus of PKAc induces a novel interaction with Hsp70, thereby permitting the recruitment of this chaperonin to AKAP signaling islands. This new data is presented in figure 6C and subsection “AKAP-Lbc scaffolds promote ERK activation in FLC”.</p><p>8b) We did not suggest, nor conclude that additional MAPK cascade members are recruited through Hsp70 (or through direct interaction with the PKA catalytic subunit). There is no evidence for such a mechanism. We have added narrative to the Discussion section to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The proposed mechanism involves HSP70, although the function of HSP70 in this context is unclear. For example, the authors suggest (subsection “Hsp70 is recruited to DNAJ-PKAc complexes”) that the &quot;oncogenic nature of DNAJ-PKAc….results from the recruitment of Hsp70&quot; and in subsection “DNAJ-PKAc in FLC tumors” that the stability of the DNAJ-PKAc fusion protein may be enhanced by Hsp70? Does the DNAJ-PKAc H33Q mutant have reduced stability and impaired transforming capacity relative to DNAJ-PKAc? The authors should also comment on previous analyses of the ERK pathway that have identified HSP70 in complexes with KSR (PMC84397).</p></disp-quote><p>The work of Stewart et al., (1999) is foundational in the understanding of KSR function. We have now cited this work in the revised manuscript. As the reviewer is undoubtedly aware, this article predominantly focuses on evidence that MEK is a component of this complex, as well as identifying HSP90/cdc37 and Hsp70 interactions with the KSR scaffold. This work was conducted a decade before our discovery of the AKAP-Lbc-KSR signaling unit, and at a time when the sensitivity of protein identification within signaling scaffolds was much less sophisticated than the quantitative mass spectrometry approaches today. Nonetheless, these findings of Stewart et al. remain in agreement with the conclusion in Figure 5A-E that the chaperonins including the Hsp70-DNAJ-PKAc subcomplex are only recruited to AKAP-Lbc-KSR signaling units in FLC. As per reviewer suggestion we have added a note in the Discussion section acknowledging that Hsp90 and certain Hsp70 isoforms may interact with KSR via other mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure S4 presents important data using the drug 1NM-PP1 that demonstrate that the effects of DNAJ-PKAc are not mediated by PKA activity, but these data are not described in the Results section of the manuscript. In support of Figure S4, were predicted PKA substrates from Figure 1E less phosphorylated following 1NM-PP1 treatment? The authors adapt their model from Smith et al., (2010). In that paper, the PKA in complex with AKAP-Lbc mediates phosphorylation of Ser838 on KSR1 to enhance ERK activation. This contradicts the model published in 2010 and adapted for Figure 4A. The authors should clarify this point by determining the extent to which KSR1 and Ser838 phosphorylation on KSR1 contribute to the effect of the DNAJ-PKAc fusion when it is expressed in AML12 cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. There are two responses to this section.</p><p>10a) We have reevaluated the data with the analog sensitive DNAJ-PKAc M176A and now propose an alternative explanation as to why application of 1NM-PP1 has no apparent effect on ERK activation. Since PKA holoenzymes are dimers of dimers, AKAP-Lbc has the capacity to simultaneously sequester one copy of wildtype PKAc with an analog sensitive DNAJ-PKAc ortholog in the context of active and intact holoenzymes (Smith et al., 2017). Under this scenario, only one element of the anchored PKA holoenzyme would be sensitive to 1NM-PP1 and regulation of KSR mediated activation of the ERK cascade may still proceed. Due to possibility of this alternate interpretation we have removed the analog data and thank the reviewer for their astute observations that led us to this outcome.</p><p>10b) Our published work shows that anchored PKA promotes phosphorylation of Ser838 on KSR to support cAMP responsive activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK cascade(Smith, et al., 2010). Recent work confirms that S838 on KSR is an important regulatory site for PKA that influences association with BRAF (Takahashi, et al., 2017). Experimental support for our model of DNAJ-PKAc regulation of KSR phosphorylation and ERK activity is found in the phospohproteomic data presented in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1F. This data revealed elevated phosphorylation of the PKA site serine 838 on KSR in FLC tumors. Thus, we propose that DNAJ-PKAc is promoting KSR phosphorylation to support MAPK pathway activation. Unfortunately, we do not have antibodies that can specifically recognize phospho-Ser838 in KSR. Mention of this new information along with a more general statement recognizing the potential role of PKA activity as a pathological factor in the development of FLC in now included in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 1E and Figure 5D. There is no discussion of the phosphorylation sites that decrease in abundance. Does phosphorylation of some ERK substrates (or substrates of the other noted kinases) fall? If so, this would suggest an effect of the fusion protein on a shift or reprioritization of substrates rather than a mere increase in the amount of phosphorylation.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct to point out that phosphoproteomic analysis always detects changes in phosphorylation sites in both directions. We initially omitted discussion of sites that decrease for the sake of simplicity. We now include an analysis of bi-directional changes in phosphorylation sites for the normal vs tumor data (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) in subsection “DNAJ-PKAc in fibrolamellar carcinomas” and subsection “AKAP-Lbc scaffolds promote ERK activation in FLC”.</p><p>In addition, we are attaching an Excel spreadsheet with all the phosphoproteomic data from the tumors and AML12<sup>DNAJ-PKAc</sup> and AML12<sup>WT</sup> cells. This data shows the collective phosphorylation events that change in both directions for these analyses (see also response to point 12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The inhibitors in the chemical library and the data obtained should be provided as supplemental data.
