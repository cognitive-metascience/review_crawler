To study the role of Oct1 in ESC pluripotency and transcriptional control, we constructed germline and inducible-conditional Oct1-deficient ESC lines. ESCs lacking Oct1 show normal appearance, self-renewal and growth but manifest defects upon differentiation. They fail to form beating cardiomyocytes, generate neurons poorly, form small, poorly differentiated teratomas, and cannot generate chimeric mice. Upon RA-mediated differentiation, Oct1-deficient cells induce lineage-appropriate developmentally poised genes poorly while lineage-inappropriate genes, including extra-embryonic genes, are aberrantly expressed. In ESCs, Oct1 co-occupies a specific set of targets with Oct4, but does not occupy differentially expressed developmental targets. Instead, Oct1 occupies these targets as cells differentiate and Oct4 declines. These results identify a dynamic interplay between Oct1 and Oct4, in particular during the critical window immediately after loss of pluripotency when cells make the earliest developmental fate decisions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20937.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20937.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20937.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Humans and most other animals are composed of hundreds of different types of cell, including nerve cells, muscle cells and blood cells. Despite performing many different roles, these cells all develop from a single fertilized egg, which divides to make a particular group of cells that when studied in the laboratory are called embryonic stem cells (or ESCs for short).</p><p>The ability of a cell to become a different cell type is defined as “potency”. ESCs are unique because they can specialize into any type of cell present in the adult organism, and they are therefore called “pluripotent”. However, as the embryo develops, its ESCs gradually lose their potency, and become more and more specialized. The activity of a great number of genes must be regulated during the transition from pluripotent to specialized cells, and some of the mechanisms involved in this transition are still unclear.</p><p>ESCs are known to need a gene-regulating protein called Oct4 to remain pluripotent and Shen, Kang, Shakya et al. now show that a similar protein named Oct1 is essential for their transition to becoming more specialized. When the gene for Oct1 was deleted from mouse ECSs, they behaved largely like “normal” ESCs, but could not properly mature into certain cell types such as heart and nerve cells. Molecular analyses revealed that Oct4 and Oct1 compete to regulate the activity of many common genes with opposing outcomes: Oct4 keeps ESCs pluripotent while Oct1 leads them to specialize. The Oct4 protein is abundant in ESCs and prevails over Oct1, but as the cells mature, the levels of Oct4 drop, and Oct1 takes over in the regulation of their common target genes.</p><p>Going forward, a better understanding of how ESCs become specialized will help basic research in the laboratory and allow scientists to tackle new questions about how the human body develops and how our organs work. In the longer-term, these findings might also have applications in the field of regenerative medicine, which aims to repair or replace a person’s cells, tissues or organs to improve their health.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20937.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20937.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>embryonic stem cells</kwd><kwd>Oct1 (Pou2f1)</kwd><kwd>Oct4 (Pou5f1)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI100873</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tantin</surname><given-names>Dean</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Oct1 replaces Oct4 at critical targets shortly after ESC differentiation to promote expression of lineage-specific genes and repress lineage-inappropriate genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian blastocyst inner cell mass (ICM) contains undifferentiated, pluripotent cells capable of generating all tissue lineages of the embryo proper. Cultured embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from these cells and have similar capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abranches et al., 2009</xref>). The POU transcription factor Oct4/Pou5f1 is an indispensable component of the regulatory circuitry underlying these properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Morey et al., 2015</xref>). It is expressed in the ICM and in ESCs where its loss accompanies differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nichols et al., 1998</xref>). Oct4 is also widely used to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Together with other factors, Oct4 sustains pluripotency by activating ‘core’ targets such as <italic>Pou5f1</italic> (encoding Oct4 itself) and <italic>Nanog</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyer et al., 2005</xref>). It also maintains ‘poised’ targets, including developmentally critical transcription regulators, in a silent but readily inducible state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Meissner et al., 2008</xref>). These genes frequently encode developmentally important transcription factors and are marked with a bivalent chromatin signature defined by the simultaneous presence of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azuara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ku et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pan et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Oct1/Pou2f1 is a widely expressed protein related to Oct4. The two proteins have similar DNA-binding specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tantin, 2013</xref>). In somatic cells, it regulates stem cell and immune memory phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maddox et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shakya et al., 2015b</xref>) and is associated with cytotoxic stress resistance, glycolytic metabolism and malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellance et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shakya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tantin et al., 2005</xref>). Oct1 amplification and/or overexpression correlates with tumor aggressiveness in esophageal, gastric, prostate, lung, cervical, and colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vázquez-Arreguín and Tantin, 2016</xref>). It is also co-expressed with Oct4 in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Okamoto et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rosner et al., 1990</xref>). Oct1-deficient mice undergo implantation but show defects following gastrulation, most prominently in extra-embryonic tissues, where trophoblast stem cell development is arrested and expression of the direct Oct1 target <italic>Cdx2</italic> is defective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sebastiano et al., 2010</xref>). Tetraploid complementation bypasses this developmental restriction, allowing embryos to survive to E8.5–9.5 where they die from an embryo-intrinsic block. These embryos are runted, developmentally arrested, and lack beating hearts. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sebastiano et al., 2010</xref>). A slightly less severe germline allele dies in mid-gestation and manifests runting, anemia, hemorrhaging, and other defects with variable penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that ESCs lacking Oct1 have no discernable defects when maintained in an undifferentiated state, but that silent, normally poised developmental-specific genes fail to induce properly upon differentiation. Additionally, genes specific for alternative developmental lineages are inappropriately expressed. Most prominently, placenta-specific genes not normally expressed in any ESC-derived lineage are induced, indicating that Oct1 restricts extra-embryonic gene expression in differentiating ESCs. Additionally, these cells show phenotypic defects when differentiated into multiple lineages, form smaller and less differentiated teratomas, and fail to generate chimerism when injected into blastocysts. ChIPseq identifies a group of targets co-bound by Oct1 and Oct4 in ESCs associated with non-classical binding sites termed MOREs (<underline>M</underline>ore Palindromic <underline>O</underline>ctamer <underline>R</underline>elated <underline>E</underline>lements, ATGCATATGCAT). These sites are inducibly bound by Oct1 in somatic cells lacking Oct4. The function of Oct1 at these genes is to insulate their expression against repression by oxidative stress, and consistently Oct1-deficient ESCs are hypersensitive to oxidative stress. Oct1 associates with developmentally poised targets upon differentiation and Oct4 loss, explaining the altered gene expression observed with RNAseq. These results establish Oct1 as a key mediator of both developmental-specific gene induction and repression, and identify a dynamic interplay in which Oct1 replaces Oct4 at target genes as ESCs differentiate and early decisions about induction or repression of lineage-specific genes are made.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Oct1 germline-deficient ESCs are phenotypically normal but differentiate abnormally</title><p>We derived Oct1-deficient ESC lines by intercrossing <italic>Pou2f1</italic> germline heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2004</xref>).

Oct1-deficient ESCs were able to aggregate into EBs at d four with morphology similar to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Similar results were obtained at days 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). During EB formation, <italic>Pou5f1</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic> were down-modulated with similar kinetics in Oct1-deficient and WT cells, while <italic>Pou2f1</italic> (Oct1) remained undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). <italic>Sox17</italic> (endoderm), <italic>Brachyury</italic> (<italic>T</italic>, definitive mesoderm), and <italic>Fgf5</italic> (definitive ectoderm) expression in Oct1-deficient EBs was grossly similar to WT at some (days 4, 9, or 14) timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), consistent with findings that Oct1 is dispensable for gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sebastiano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). However, there were consistent defects in expression in the Oct1-deficient condition at day 14 for <italic>Sox17</italic> and day 4 for <italic>T</italic> and <italic>Fgf5. Sox17</italic>, <italic>T</italic> and <italic>Fgf5</italic> are known Oct4 targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). By day 5, Oct1-deficient EBs were somewhat smaller in appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We therefore looked for further evidence of defects in induction kinetics in three other known silent but developmentally inducible Oct4 target genes: <italic>Hoxa5</italic>, <italic>Hoxc6,</italic> and <italic>Gata2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Each of these genes showed a similar pattern of defective induction in Oct1-deficient EBs relative to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>To study gene induction using a more developmentally restricted system, we analyzed expression of known developmentally inducible Oct4 target genes during RA-mediated differentiation of WT and Oct1-deficient ESCs. RA treatment of ESCs ultimately results in a largely neuronal phenotype, but waves of gene expression, differentiation, proliferation, and cell death take place during the course of RA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Walker et al., 2007</xref>). Upon differentiation, ESCs ±Oct1 lose their clustered, spherical, refractile morphology with similar kinetics (not shown). <italic>Pou5f1</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic> were also lost with similar kinetics ±Oct1, while <italic>Pou2f1</italic> was not detectable in KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To study developmental gene expression, we tested <italic>Hoxa5</italic>, <italic>Hoxc6</italic>, <italic>Cdx2,</italic> and <italic>Sox17</italic>. These genes encode developmentally important transcription factors and are known Oct4 targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2008</xref>), but are silent in ESCs. Upon RA-mediated differentiation, lineage-appropriate (ectoderm) genes such as <italic>Hoxa5</italic> and <italic>Hoxc6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>) normally ‘resolve’ their bivalent state by losing H3K27me3 and becoming induced, while lineage-inappropriate (e.g. endoderm) genes such as <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Sox17</italic> normally resolve by losing H3K4me3, gaining DNA methylation, and becoming stably silenced. Induction of <italic>Hoxa5</italic> and <italic>Hoxc6</italic> was robust following RA-mediated differentiation of WT cells, but defective in the Oct1 KO condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Cdx2</italic> was ectopically activated upon RA-mediated differentiation of Oct1-deficient ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similarly, the definitive endoderm-specific gene <italic>Sox17</italic> is not normally induced upon RA-mediated differentiation, but showed ectopic expression in the absence of Oct1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The ectopic <italic>Sox17</italic> expression observed with RA differentiation differed from the expression defects observed in Oct1-deficient EBs, which include endodermal lineages and which showed 100-fold stronger <italic>Sox17</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These results indicate that Oct1-deficient ESCs induce lineage-appropriate developmental genes poorly, while ectopically expressing lineage-inappropriate genes.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20937.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effect of Oct1 loss on RA-mediated differentiation and neurogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantitative RT-PCR results are shown for <italic>Pou5f1</italic> (Oct4), <italic>Sox2,</italic> and <italic>Pou2f1</italic> (Oct1) mRNA relative to a GAPDH standard.

We confirmed that cells transduced with this vector overexpressed Oct1 by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Cells were infected over 2 consecutive days and selected with puromycin throughout the remained of the 14-day differentiation timecourse. At timepoints after day 6, infection and selection with empty vector skewed the expression of genes such as <italic>Hoxa5</italic>, suggesting that infection and selection were skewing the populations of cells in the culture. Cells infected at 4 and 5 days, however, did not show major differences (not shown), suggesting that the composition of cells in culture was not being significantly altered. We therefore infected differentiating Oct1-deficient cells consecutively on days 4 and 5, prepared cDNAs at day 14 and examined gene expression. By RT-qPCR, Oct1 was undetectable in cells transduced and selected with empty vector but robustly expressed by cells transduced with Oct1 (not shown). Expression of the developmentally-inducible <italic>Hoxa5</italic> gene was significantly augmented (p=0.026) by ectopic Oct1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These results indicate that restoration of Oct1 expression at these times and conditions can correct at least some of the gene expression defects associated with Oct1 deficiency.</p><p>RA-mediated differentiation yields neuronal precursor cells but not neurons. We used a differentiation system involving EB generation and culture in insulin, transferrin and selenium (see Materials and methods) to generate arborized neurons that express the marker β-tubulin III (<italic>Tubb3</italic>) and the neuroectoderm genes Nestin (<italic>Nes</italic>) and <italic>Map2</italic>. Staining of 2-day-old EBs for β-tubulin III prior to laminin/poly-L-lysine dish attachment – early in the differentiation protocol - revealed fewer β-tubulin III-positive cells in the Oct1 deficient condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Upon complete differentiation (8 d EBs, 8 days in neuralizing monolayer culture), WT ESCs formed neurons robustly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, asterisk) while few β-tubulin III-expressing neurons were formed from Oct1-deficient ESCs. Oct1-deficient cells that did induce β-tubulin III tended to do so at lower levels, and the few cells that did express β-tubulin III robustly were nevertheless abnormal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>, arrow). To test if Oct1 loss induced a kinetic delay that could be overcome by longer culture, cells were incubated for 8 or 16 additional days (16 or 24 days in neuralizing medium, 24 or 32 days total differentiation). In neither case were neurons formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref> and data not shown). To study gene expression, individual wells of common genotypes differentiated for 16 days were pooled and subjected to RT-qPCR for <italic>Tubb3</italic>, <italic>Nes</italic> and <italic>Map2</italic>. Each of these genes showed defective expression in the absence of Oct1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p><p>To test an unrelated developmental system, we performed cardiomyocyte differentiation by culturing EBs in hanging drops followed by culture with gelatin (see Materials and methods). Oct1-deficient ESCs failed to form beating cardiomyocytes, unlike WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media12">12</xref>).

We observed <italic>Mlc2v</italic> expression defects in the Oct1-deficient condition equivalent to non-beating cardiomyocyte colonies from WT ESCs. <italic>Mlc2a</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> expression was even weaker than non-beating WT cardiomyocyte colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Hand1</italic> showed no expression defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating that Oct1 deficiency does not globally down-regulate genes associated with cardiomyocyte differentiation. Cumulatively, the results indicate that although Oct1-deficient ESCs appear normal in the absence of differentiation cues, they do not induce poised developmentally inducible genes and fail to repress lineage-inappropriate genes such as <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Sox17</italic>, resulting in multiple cellular defects following differentiation.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20937.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Defective cardiomyocyte differentiation in ESCs lacking Oct1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cardiomyocytes were generated from individual EBs using 24-well dishes with gelatin.

expression upon differentiation</title><p>Although the ESC lines described above were derived from littermate animals and had normal karyotypes, it was possible that the developmental phenotypes and altered gene expression patterns resulted from differences unrelated to Oct1 status. Furthermore, the observed gene expression defects could result from compensatory changes due to development in an Oct1-deficient environment. Finally, the allele used to generate these lines is a severe hypomorph rather than a complete null (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2004</xref>).

Oct1 deficiency dramatically increases mitochondrial amino acid oxidation and oxygen consumption while decreasing glycolysis and to a lesser extent glucose oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shakya et al., 2009</xref>). These changes contribute to failure of fibroblasts to undergo oncogenic transformation, despite the fact that they grow at normal rates and can be immortalized by serial passage. To test if similar changes occur in ESCs lacking Oct1, we analyzed the metabolic profile of these cells. Few differences were noted, with only phosphoethanolamine (also known as phosphorylethanolamine, p=0.047) and inositol (p=0.037) showing significant changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In contrast, target regions preferentially associated with Oct1 were enriched for the simple octamer element ATTTGCAT (shown by the software as an Oct4 motif in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Interestingly, co-occupied peaks strongly associate with a motif termed a MORE that is known to bind two Oct protein molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reményi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tomilin et al., 2000</xref>).

Oxidative stress-induced binding occurs via phosphorylation of a conserved serine residue in the DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kang et al., 2009</xref>).

Instead, 1066 genes with altered expression in differentiated Oct1-deficient cells showed Oct4 but not Oct1 enrichment. These findings indicate that (1) identified Oct1 targets were not differentially expressed upon differentiation, and (2) developmental genes shown to be differentially expressed in RA treated Oct1-deficient cells were not Oct1 targets in ESCs.</p><p>The above findings could be reconciled by postulating that (1) Oct functions at co-bound targets in ESCs to buffer them against oxidative stress as described previously in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shakya et al., 2011</xref>), and (2) developmental genes that are differentially expressed in Oct1-deficient cells but exclusively bound by Oct4 in ESCs become Oct1 targets during the differentiation process as Oct4 is lost. To test the first hypothesis, we studied the effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure on the expression of two co-bound genes, <italic>Ahcy</italic> and <italic>Polr2a</italic>, in ESCs ±Oct1.

In differentiating cells, Oct1 occupies MORE genes in response to oxidative stress and buffers their expression, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shakya et al., 2011</xref>).

Material was collected from 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 d of differentiation with RA. We chose a gene, <italic>Hoxc5</italic>, that contains a conserved perfect octamer sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), but is not an Oct1 target based on ChIPseq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). <italic>Hoxc5</italic> also shows poor induction in upon RA-mediated differentiation of <italic>Pou2f1<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Oct1 ChIP-qPCR revealed no binding in ESCs, as expected based on the ChIPseq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), however robust binding was transiently observed at 6 d. By 14 d of differentiation Oct1 binding was again undetectable. We also examined a target region between the linked <italic>Myf5</italic> and <italic>Myf6</italic> (<italic>Mrf4</italic>) loci on chromosome 10 that contains several near-perfect octamer sites (not shown), and is strongly bound by Oct4 but not Oct1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Oct1 inducibly occupied this region even more rapidly (2 d) as Oct4 binding was lost, and in this case Oct1 binding was maintained, at varying levels, during ESC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Finally, we studied two additional genes, <italic>Pou5f1</italic> and <italic>Rest</italic> (Nrsf), which also contain conserved perfect octamer sequences in their regulatory regions and also show exclusive Oct4 binding. These genes are both expressed in ESCs and silenced as differentiation proceeds. Here early Oct1 binding was identified, which was maintained at low levels during the differentiation timecourse in the case of <italic>Pou5f1</italic> but transient in the case of <italic>Rest</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). These results indicate a highly dynamic interplay between Oct1 and Oct4 in differentiating cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results indicate that Oct1-deficient ESCs are unperturbed in terms of morphology, growth, metabolism, and gene expression. EBs formed from these cells are microscopically normal at early timepoints and express genes associated with all three germ layers. However, Oct1-deficient ESCs show phenotypic and molecular defects upon differentiation. These cells fail to form neurons and cardiomyocytes, generate smaller and less differentiated teratomas, and fail to contribute to adult mouse tissues. Prior work has shown that partial knockdown of Oct1 also inhibits neuron formation in the context of knockout of the related protein Oct2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Theodorou et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Three molecular defects manifest upon differentiation of Oct1-deficient ESCs. First, loss of Oct1 results in a failure to fully induce genes associated with a given developmental lineage. Second, Oct1 is necessary for the repression of alternative embryonic developmental lineages. As a result, upon differentiation gene expression programs are marked not only by poor induction of lineage-appropriate gene expression, but also by ectopic expression of genes specific to alternative lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). The third defect is mis-expression of genes associated with extra-embryonic lineages. These genes are normally under tight repression in ESCs and their differentiated progeny. For example, <italic>Prl8a6</italic> and <italic>Prl3b1</italic> are mis-expressed in RA-differentiated ESCs. Other genes such as <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Hand1</italic> are examples of genes expressed both in extra-embryonic and alternative embryonic lineages. For example, the <italic>Cdx2</italic> promoter contains a perfect consensus octamer element and is a known Oct1 target in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jin and Li, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). In the early embryo, <italic>Cdx2</italic> promotes trophectoderm fate and is under tight repression by Oct4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yeap et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>). Later in development, <italic>Cdx2</italic> is induced in the endoderm-derived developing gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lu et al., 2008</xref>) and during primitive hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), but is not widely expressed in ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Suh and Traber, 1996</xref>). In RA-differentiated cells, <italic>Cdx2</italic> thus represents both a lineage-inappropriate gene and an extra-embryonic lineage. <italic>Cdx2</italic> is mis-expressed following RA-mediated differentiation of both germline and inducible-conditional Oct1-deficient ESCs. Interestingly Oct1 may execute the opposite function in extra-embryonic tissue, as germline Oct1-deficient mice show defects in extra-embryonic tissues including poor expression of <italic>Cdx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sebastiano et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>ChIPseq experiments reveal that Oct1 and Oct4 regulate common and distinct targets in ESCs. These differences in bound targets lead to functional consequences, as the two proteins recruit different cofactors such as Jmjd1a in the case of Oct1 and Jmjd1c in the case of Oct4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shakya et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2011</xref>). Oct4 occupies a large group of &gt;5000 genes, including developmentally poised genes such as <italic>Hoxc5</italic> and <italic>Myf5</italic>, and core pluripotency genes such as <italic>Pou5f1</italic> and <italic>Nanog</italic>. Oct1 does not occupy these genes in ESCs, consistent with the ability of Oct1-deficient ESCs to maintain pluripotency. Instead Oct1 co-occupies a cohort of 325 genes with Oct4 that are highly enriched for a motif known as a MORE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reményi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tomilin et al., 2000</xref>). Oct proteins are known to homo- and hetero-dimerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tantin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tomilin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Verrijzer et al., 1992</xref>). The configuration of Oct proteins can determine cofactor association and hence regulatory output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reményi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tomilin et al., 2000</xref>). Many of these constitutively co-bound genes were previously shown to become occupied by Oct1 upon oxidative stress exposure in differentiated cells lacking Oct4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kang et al., 2009</xref>). The function of Oct1 at these genes is to insulate them against inhibition by oxidative stress. Fibroblasts lacking Oct1 show inappropriate repression of MORE-containing genes following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shakya et al., 2011</xref>). We demonstrate the identical phenotype using Oct1-deficient ESCs. Oct1 also exclusively associates with a small number (~200) of other genes including <italic>Taf12</italic>, which contains another binding site variant known as a TMFORE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Notably, in undifferentiated cells Oct1 does not associate with developmental targets that become deregulated upon differentiation of Oct1-deficient ESCs. Oct4 is present at higher levels in ESCs compared to Oct1, suggesting that mass action may contribute to the lack of Oct1 binding. This model predicts that Oct1 would occupy these genes as Oct4 is lost during differentiation. We tested four regions bound by Oct4 but not Oct1 in ESCs, <italic>Hoxc5</italic>, <italic>Myf5</italic>/<italic>Myf6</italic>, <italic>Rest</italic> and <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, predicting that Oct1 binding will manifest as cells differentiate and Oct4 is lost. In all cases, Oct1 binding was observed at one or more points during the differentiation timecourse. We propose that Oct1 transiently replaces Oct4 at many such Oct4 target genes upon differentiation, where it promotes lineage-appropriate target gene expression, and represses expression of lineage-inappropriate targets. The binding events occur during a brief but important window during which critical decisions about suppression or potentiation of lineage-specific developmental Oct4 target genes are made. Binding also occurs before many of the affected target genes are induced, suggesting that Oct1 is not the principal driver of expression of these genes, but instead establishes a chromatin context in which these genes remain poised for expression, or become permanently repressed. Of the genes tested in ChIP-qPCR RA differentiation timecourses, the lineage-appropriate <italic>Hoxc5</italic> gene shows poor induction in upon differentiation of Oct1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), <italic>Myf5</italic> and <italic>Myf6</italic> are mesoderm-specific and lineage-inappropriate, <italic>Rest</italic> is both pluripotency-associated and lineage-inappropriate, and <italic>Pou5f1</italic> is more restricted to ESCs. These latter genes showed no evidence of ectopic expression. This observation can be reconciled with our model by positing that redundant mechanisms, perhaps mediated by other Oct proteins such as Oct6/Pou3f1, enforce their repression in differentiating ESCs.</p><p>The bipotential function of Oct1 is consistent with previous findings in fibroblasts and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shakya et al., 2011</xref>). Oct1 functions are mediated in part through association with the inhibitory chromatin remodeling complex NuRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shakya et al., 2011</xref>), or with Jmjd1a/KDM3A, a histone H3K9me2 lysine demethylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shakya et al., 2015b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2011</xref>). H3K9me2 also controls developmental gene induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zylicz et al., 2015</xref>) and reprogramming to pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sridharan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The ability of Oct1 to suppress genes for alternative developmental lineages is reminiscent of findings using T cells in which Oct1 suppresses alternative T cell lineage genes via inter-chromosomal communication between gene loci that execute opposing gene expression programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Oct1 interacts with CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2014</xref>), helping it foster exclusive gene expression programs in T cells. More work is required to determine if Oct1 insures mutually exclusive embryonic developmental gene expression programs through similar mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Derivation of Oct1 germline and conditional ESCs</title><p>All mice were C57BL/6J background.

For ChIPseq, reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm10) with the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA, version: 0.5.9). Reads were filtered for alignment quality of &gt;Q10 and duplicates were removed using Picard tools (function MarkDuplicates). After filtering there were 21.1 (H3K4me3), 27.3 (Oct1), and 23.7 (Oct4) million reads. MACSv2 peak caller (version: 2.1) was used to call ChIPseq regions of enrichment with the following parameters (-p 1e-5 --nomodel --shiftsize &lt;fragment_length/2&gt; for Oct1, Oct4 and -p 1e-2 --broad for H3K4me3). To estimate the --shiftsize parameter (predominant fragment length divided by 2) we performed strand cross-correlation analysis using SPP R package (version: 1.10.1) with default parameters. Peaks overlapping with ENCODE blacklisted regions were filtered using BEDtools (function itersectBed). We also discarded peaks localized to mitochondria, chromosome Y, and unmapped contigs. After filtering we had 692 (Oct1), and 8673 (Oct4) peaks. Signal to noise ratio was assessed by calculating normalized strand coefficient (NSC) and relative strand correlation (RSC) using the SPP R package with default parameters (version: 1.10.1). The obtained values of NSC and RSC (H3K4me3: 2.28, 1.25; Oct1: 1.02, 1.45; Oct4: 1.05, 2.32) indicate highly enriched datasets with large fragment-length peak as compared to read-length peak. The NSC value for Oct1 transcription factor was somewhat smaller but typical for high quality datasets generated for factors with small numbers of genuine binding sites (692 MACS2-identified peaks for Oct1).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript entitled: &quot;Enforcement of developmental lineage specificity by transcription factor Oct1&quot;, Shen et al. have addressed the role of Oct1 in pluripotency and differentiation, by analysing the phenotype of Oct1 null ES cells via both conditional deletion in vitro and after deriving a null ES line. They show that the Oct1 null cells can be propagated under pluripotency conditions with no overt phenotypic differences from the parental line, but cannot undergo normal differentiation when challenged using multiple assays (differentiation to cardiomyocytes and neurons in vitro, and capacity to form teratomas and contribute to chimeras in vivo). Consistent with this, while pluripotency genes are down-regulated normally in the differentiation protocols, differentiation markers are expressed aberrantly. The authors then use RNAseq and ChIPseq (for Oct1, Oct4 and H3K4me3) to address the role of Oct1 during RA-induced ES differentiation. From this, they conclude that part of its effect is to insulate a set of target genes, co-bound by Oct4, from repressive effects of oxidative stress. They also reveal a dynamic interplay between Oct4 and Oct1 binding, where Oct1 takes over from Oct4 as Oct4 levels drop, and suggest this is required to promote lineage-appropriate and suppress lineage-inappropriate expression during differentiation. Overall, the findings are novel and interesting, and the manuscript is well presented. The reviewers have requested the following revisions, which should be addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We request that the authors distinguish between two possible explanations of their data, as detailed below: Oct1/Pou2f1 belongs to the POU family, in which the members share the POU domain as a DNA binding domain. Oct4/Pou5f1 is also a member of the POU family and known as a key transcription factor for establishment and maintenance of pluripotency. The authors have shown that Oct1 and Oct4 bind to mostly different targets in ES cells, although a small proportion of their target sites are shared, indicating their distinct role. Most of the genes occupied by Oct1 do not show differential expression during differentiation, suggesting that these are housekeeping genes. If the regulation of these housekeeping genes by Oct1is required for the survival of a set of differentiated cells, which may happen depending on particular metabolic states, the deficiency of Oct1 would eliminate these cells. Although the authors emphasized that the dysregulation of developmentally-regulated genes is responsible for the defect of differentiation of Oct1-null ES cells, it could alternatively be due to the elimination of the differentiated cells rather than the defect of differentiation event. RA-induced ES cell differentiation is quite a crude system for addressing this point. The authors are encouraged to apply a cleaner system of differentiation and to induce the conditional KO at intermediate states of differentiation event to distinguish these two possibilities.</p><p>2) Related to this, the authors are requested to show whether the defects in expression of differentiation marker genes and misexpression of alternative marks shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> occurs equally across the whole population or only in a subset of cells. These are both possible interpretations of expression data taken from the whole population, but would could lead to different interpretations of the function and mechanism of Oct1 in controlling cell fate. The authors are also requested to clarify whether the defect in the formation of β-tubulin III-expressing neurons in the null versus wild-type cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> corresponds to a failure to fully differentiate, or if the null cells are showing slower differentiation kinetics. Was this experiment continued beyond the normal time period of the differentiation protocol, and if so, did the null cells eventually 'catch up' or did they genuinely fail to robustly produce the appropriate neurons?</p><p>3) It was previously shown that Oct1-knockdown (~ 50%) in ESCs does not result in any phenotype during neuronal differentiation because of functional redundancy with Oct2 (Theodorou et al. Genes &amp; Dev. 2009. 23: 575-588). To address this inconsistency with their data, the authors are requested to carry out rescue experiments to make sure that Oct1 can rescue the differentiation capacity of Oct1 KO ES cells (e.g. with a constitutively-active Oct1 transgene), in order to confirm the Oct1-dependency of the phenotype.</p><p>4) The authors are also requested to deal with the following queries related to data presentation or analysis:i) The authors have generated two germline Oct1 KO lines and littermate WT lines as well as two Oct1 inducible KO lines, however it is not clear whether they have carried out all their qPCR and RNA seq analysis from both lines and pooled together or they have just used one line. It is important to carry out all their experiments in both lines and plot them separately so one can see the variation between the different lines (same genotype) and that between the WT and KO.</p><p>ii) The authors have not indicated how many biological replicates they have carried out for their ChIP-seq data. They are requested to clearly indicate the variation between the replicate libraries, which can then be pooled for later analysis.</p><p>iii) The authors have only used one algorithm to carry out motif analysis, this analysis should be repeated using a different algorithm (such MEME-ChIP).</p><p>iv). Similarly, the authors should examine whether Oct2 can functionally compensate the loss Oct1 and rescue the differentiation phenotype of Oct1 KO ES cells.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Enforcement of developmental lineage specificity by transcription factor Oct1&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>As you will see from the reviewers’ comments, there was a remaining concern regarding the interpretation of some of your data. In particular, the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-J</xref> do not unequivocally demonstrate that switching from Oct4 to Oct1 is required for differentiation (as noted in the comments from reviewer 1). Therefore, we ask that you add Oct1 staining to the YFP staining presented and, in addition, that you address in the text the possible alternative explanations for these results (you might also consider changing the title in this light). If you do not feel able to make these changes, we would require the rescue experiment outlined by reviewer 1 to be included before the manuscript could be accepted for publication. We also request that you attend to both of the issues raised by reviewer 3, which can be dealt with by textual changes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In the revised manuscript, the authors made several changes to address the points mentioned by the reviewers. The most important point the authors should confirm was the functional confirmation of the switching from Oct4 to Oct1 on induction of differentiation-associated genes to undergo proper differentiation event. Neuronal differentiation was well-established system and the combination of the inducible KO of Oct1 would allow them to give a clear answer to this question as the reviewers expected. However, the experiment performed by the authors was not well organized and the result was equivocal. If the switch from Oct4 to Oct1 at the beginning of differentiation event is functionally important, the constitutive KO ES cells will fail to give rise to terminally differentiated cells whereas the conditional KO induced after switching will differentiate, even in lower efficiency than WT ES cells. However, induction of KO event at day 4 of differentiation culture, the time point when Oct1 was already replace Oct4 at several target sites as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, completely abolished differentiation to mature neurons. This result suggested that Oct1 function is required for the late period of differentiation event or maintenance of the mature differentiated phenotype in cell-type-dependent manner. The assessment of KO event at cellular level was incomplete in this experiment. Why did the authors detect YFP expression, an indirect marker of inducible KO, rather than the loss of Oct1 protein with anti-Oct1 Ab?</p><p>An alternative way to address this point precisely is the rescue by the inducible Oct1 expression in Oct1-null ES cells after induction of differentiation. According to the answers to the reviewers' comments, the authors tried to rescue Oct1-null ES cells by transfection of constitutively-active Oct1 transgene at different time point, and failed. Why not using the inducible expression system such as Tet-on system to drive Oct1 transgene? It is well-established system and commercially available.</p><p>The strict confirmation of this point is very important to support the hypothesis the authors proposed. Without such confirmation, the other data is insufficient to support the hypothesis. The role of Oct1 for normal proliferation, protection against stress, and maintenance of certain metabolic state in differentiated cell types would explain the defect of Oct1-null ES cells in chimera assay, teratoma assay and slower growth of EBs rather than the defect in differentiation event.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>I think Tantin and colleagues have addressed most of the major concerns raised by the reviewers in the first round. After fixing few minor issues (see below), I would recommend the publication of this manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Issue 1: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>. The authors compare RNA-seq data of parental vs. KO in both undifferentiated and differentiated conditions. The authors conclude that the KO show more gene expression differences during differentiation. However, it is important to show variability across parental and KO samples separately in both conditions. i.e. one would expect that cells are more heterogeneous during RA-differentiation compared to pluripotency state. So, it is expected to see more difference in RA-differentiation state.</p><p>Issue 2: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> (bottom). the known Oct4-Sox2 motif was enriched in 22.9% of Oct4 unique peaks as compared to Oct4 motif which was enriched 15.3%. This does not make sense as Oct4 motif is the exact first half of the Oct4-Sox2 composite motif. One would expect Oct4 motif to be present in all Oct4-Sox2 (22.9%) sites plus few more sites that only contain Oct4 motif. The authors need to clarify what those percentages mean in the legend.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20937.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) We request that the authors distinguish between two possible explanations of their data, as detailed below: Oct1/Pou2f1 belongs to the POU family, in which the members share the POU domain as a DNA binding domain.

Neurons are generated by first differentiating ESCs into EBs in low-attachment plates, followed by subsequent plating in CultureSlide chambers with insulin, selenium and transferrin. Cells then grow out from the fragmented EBs and fill the chamber as a monolayer. Deletion of Oct1 by tamoxifen administration is inefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-C</xref>). Only a fraction of ESCs within colonies become YFP<sup>+</sup>, and not all of those delete both Oct1 alleles. Unlike in ESCs, where we can pick and characterize individual colonies, in differentiating neurons we do not know which yellow cells have deleted one vs. both Oct1 alleles, and so we have to rely on the power of numbers. We treated differentiating cells with 4-OHT at different points during EB formation and subsequent differentiation of neurons. Deletion in EBs was highly inefficient. At only one timepoint (4 days after plating in chambers, 12 days into differentiation) did we generate YFP-positivity at an efficiency (40-50%) that allowed us to conduct this experiment. We fixed the neurons at endpoint and performed immunofluorescence with antibodies against YFP (red) and β-III-tubulin (green). We observe a much smaller fraction of YFP<sup>+</sup> cells that express β-III-tubulin, and an even smaller fraction of YFP<sup>+</sup> cells that form true arborized neurons (2 out of ~750 cells analyzed). These few cells are likely to be Oct1 heterozygous, though it is not possible to prove this. Representative images and quantified data from these results are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I-J</xref>. For completeness, we also now show the effect of conditional Oct1 deletion in ESCs on neuron formation. The effect is identical to that seen in germline-deficient ESCs, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-H</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the larger reviewer rationale behind this experiment (that cells might be dying and skewing populations): we and others have shown that although it binds and regulates housekeeping genes Oct1 is not a housekeeping factor. Oct1 is dispensable for cell viability. Oct1 loss, either by knockout or RNAi) does not impede proliferation rates in standard culture conditions such as we use here. Published examples include primary MEFs, A549 and MD-MBA-231 cell lines, fetal liver blood progenitors, developing and activated primary T cells, total B cells and macrophages. Submitted work using CRISPR shows the same result in primary MEFs and MCF-7 cells. In unpublished work, deletion in the gut retains normal architecture and homeostasis, maintaining deletion for &gt;100 days. Instead Oct1 loss specifically impairs regeneration following epithelial cell damage. The ratio of oxidative to glycolytic metabolism in these situations is changed as expected, but in rich media and without some form of stress, cells are surprisingly resilient to such metabolic alterations. In our EB, cardiomyocyte, true neuron and RA/neuronal differentiation experiments, we note no differences in cell death (e.g., Supp. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, work from others shows that germline Oct1 null embryos, in which lethality due to trophoblast defects is circumvented with tetraploid complementation, do not die until E9.5, which seems incompatible with a model that has large populations of embryonic cells dying upon implantation and initial specification/differentiation.</p><p><italic>2) Related to this, the authors are requested to show whether the defects in expression of differentiation marker genes and misexpression of alternative marks shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> occurs equally across the whole population or only in a subset of cells. These are both possible interpretations of expression data taken from the whole population, but would could lead to different interpretations of the function and mechanism of Oct1 in controlling cell fate. The authors are also requested to clarify whether the defect in the formation of β-tubulin III-expressing neurons in the null versus wild-type cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> corresponds to a failure to fully differentiate, or if the null cells are showing slower differentiation kinetics. Was this experiment continued beyond the normal time period of the differentiation protocol, and if so, did the null cells eventually 'catch up' or did they genuinely fail to robustly produce the appropriate neurons?</italic> </p><p>There are two points here, both of which are valid. The first is whether the defects observed with Oct1 loss are partial in nature across many cells, or whether a much smaller fraction of cells differentiate completely normally. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> already provides a sense of this: in the neuron differentiation cultures we can find multiple examples of Oct1 deficient cells with poor β-III-tubulin staining, but nevertheless show staining above background. Rarely however we do see positive cells that have a neuronal appearance (as quantified in panels 2D, 4H and 4J, though 4J may be quantifying heterozygotes). To illustrate this better, we now show new images with quantifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-D</xref>). Therefore, in the absence of Oct1 we observe many more Oct1 deficient cells with poor/incomplete differentiation, at least based on β-III-tubulin staining and arborization as criteria. Regarding the second, kinetic, question, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> shows that even early during differentiation into EBs, abnormal β-III-tubulin staining is evident in the differentiating knockout cells. To further address this comment, we fixed and stained germline Oct1-deficient ESCs that had been differentiated into neurons for longer periods. We again used the terminal differentiation marker β-III-tubulin. At no point do Oct1 deficient cells “catch up”, indicating that the defects observed with Oct1 deficiency are not due to changes in kinetics. Data from 8 day-extended cultures are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E-F</xref>. We reference the 16 day-extended culture results as data not shown.</p><p><italic>3) It was previously shown that Oct1-knockdown (~ 50%) in ESCs does not result in any phenotype during neuronal differentiation because of functional redundancy with Oct2 (Theodorou et al. Genes &amp; Dev. 2009. 23: 575-588). To address this inconsistency with their data, the authors are requested to carry out rescue experiments to make sure that Oct1 can rescue the differentiation capacity of Oct1 KO ES cells (e.g. with a constitutively-active Oct1 transgene), in order to confirm the Oct1-dependency of the phenotype.</italic> </p><p>We added language to the Discussion section acknowledging the above study, which shows that partial Oct1 knockdown reduces neuron formation in the context of an Oct2 knockout. It is not clear there is any inconsistency here, given that the knockdown in the prior study was only 50%, and given that transient transfection of siRNAs was used. Oct1 germline null heterozygotes are viable and fertile, suggesting that a 50% reduction is insufficient for the phenotypes we describe here to manifest. Additionally, we use multiple cell lines derived using two different methods (germline Oct1-deficient ESCs and WT lines derived in parallel, and conditional-inducible knockout ESCs in which Oct1 is deleted and tested compared to matched vehicle-treated parental controls). Both methods arrive at the exact same conclusions. We did attempt additional experiments to address this point. The language is not clear but generating a mouse transgene was not feasible for this study. As an alternative, we used the RA differentiation paradigm with MSCV viral transduction of a vector construct encoding Oct1 and a puromycin resistance cassette. We attempted viral transductions at nearly every day of RA differentiation. We attempted multiple infections of concentrated virus. Nonetheless infection rates were &lt;10%, possibly because there is not much cell division at any given time point, and the results were uninterpretable. It would be possible to circumvent this issue by sub-cloning the mouse Oct1 cDNA into a lentiviral vector, however even this approach has caveats. For example, Oct1 levels fluctuate during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and it is not clear if constitutive expression from a viral promoter constitutes “rescue.” The relative levels of Oct1 and Oct4 clearly have effects on gene occupancy, and it is likely that similar mass-action effects occur with Oct1, Oct2, Oct6 and other neuronal Oct binding transcription factors. It is also not clear whether the cells remaining after infection and selection are similar in composition to un-manipulated RA-differentiated cells, although empty vector controls partially address this. Lastly, the timing of the infection may be important, so one could try to complement Oct1 at day 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 or 14. For all these reasons it would take many additional months to carry through with such an experiment, with a high potential for uninterpretable results.</p><p><italic>4) The authors are also requested to deal with the following queries related to data presentation or analysis:i) The authors have generated two germline Oct1 KO lines and littermate WT lines as well as two Oct1 inducible KO lines, however it is not clear whether they have carried out all their qPCR and RNA seq analysis from both lines and pooled together or they have just used one line. It is important to carry out all their experiments in both lines and plot them separately so one can see the variation between the different lines (same genotype) and that between the WT and KO.</italic> </p><p>We did not mix lines, but did confirm the phenotypes shown with multiple lines. We have clarified in the manuscript text that data are shown for a single example of either germline or conditional KO and controls, rather than pooling different lines. We anticipated this concern in the manuscript, which is why we also generated inducible-conditional ESCs and tested knockout in these lines compared to the vehicle-treated parent line.</p><p><italic>ii) The authors have not indicated how many biological replicates they have carried out for their ChIP-seq data. They are requested to clearly indicate the variation between the replicate libraries, which can then be pooled for later analysis.</italic> </p><p>We have clarified the text that ChIPseq libraries were prepared exactly as in Shakya et al. MCB 2015 and Shakya et a JEM 2015, using a single a IP per condition, from single clones of parent or matched derived Oct1 deficient ESCs. The ChIP material was first validated using <italic>Pou5f1</italic> for Oct4 and <italic>Polr2a</italic> for Oct1. H3K4me3 was used as an internal quality control. All ChIP-qPCR in the manuscript uses at least three experimental replicates, and these results substantiate the ChIPseq. Analysis of the DNA sequences within the ChIPseq peaks robustly identifies octamer DNA binding sites for both Oct1 and Oct4, and specific octamer variants for sites co-bound by both proteins (below). We recognize that this is not ideal, but because a large number of reads is required in order to validate each experimental condition, splitting the cells three ways, then performing ChIP and sequencing separately, then combining again, increases expense without a commensurate increase in the likelihood of generating meaningful data.</p><p><italic>iii) The authors have only used one algorithm to carry out motif analysis, this analysis should be repeated using a different algorithm (such MEME-ChIP).</italic> </p><p>We performed the same analysis using MEME-ChIP. The top motifs found by both software packages are nearly identical, with similarly strong E-values for MEME-ChIP (HOMER uses P-values). This result confirms that our ChIPseq and analysis were robust (see the point above). We now state this in the manuscript text, though did not think the results were relevant enough to be included (they can be derived from our data and we can provide them on request). Of import here, both algorithms identify MOREs as the top sequence simultaneously occupied by Oct1 and Oct4. MOREs are known to bind Oct protein dimers in a novel configuration, and we had previously identified inducible Oct1 occupancy of MOREs following oxidative stress exposure in differentiated cells (PMID: 19171782). In the future, we hope to determine how Oct1 and Oct4 constitutively occupy sites that are inducibly occupied by Oct1 following stress in cells lacking Oct4.</p><p><italic>iv) Similarly, the authors should examine whether Oct2 can functionally compensate the loss Oct1 and rescue the differentiation phenotype of Oct1 KO ES cells.</italic> </p><p>We have not studied Oct2 (and Oct6, and Oct11), both in order to make the manuscript straightforward and due to financial constraints. Whether or not Oct2 complements certain gene expression phenotypes is an interesting question, but regardless of the outcome would not alter any of the fundamental conclusions in the current study. We therefore maintain that such experiments are more appropriate for a future study.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>As you will see from the reviewers’ comments, there was a remaining concern regarding the interpretation of some of your data. In particular, the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-J</xref> do not unequivocally demonstrate that switching from Oct4 to Oct1 is required for differentiation (as noted in the comments from reviewer 1). Therefore, we ask that you add Oct1 staining to the YFP staining presented and, in addition, that you address in the text the possible alternative explanations for these results (you might also consider changing the title in this light). If you do not feel able to make these changes, we would require the rescue experiment outlined by reviewer 1 to be included before the manuscript could be accepted for publication. We also request that you attend to both of the issues raised by reviewer 3, which can be dealt with by textual changes.</italic> </p><p>The short answer to this is that we performed the rescue experiment, for which we show results with <italic>Hoxa5</italic> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-D</xref>). For technical reasons Oct1 and β-III-tubulin co-staining cannot be performed and generate satisfying results. This is why we used YFP, and one of the reasons why we engineered the LSL-YFP reporter cassette into the ESCs. The long explanation: Our results in the first resubmission show that tamoxifen treatment and Cre induction significantly diminishes formation of true neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-J</xref>). We can interpret this as Oct1 deletion because of the robustness of the effects. If we had not observed strong differences, then the need to corroborate the YFP induction as reading out Oct1 deletion would have been more important. Nevertheless, we tried and failed to perform Oct1/β-III-tubulin co-staining, as outlined below. Because we knew that it would be a lingering issue, we then sub-cloned Oct1 into a lentiviral vector with a puromycin resistance cassette and infected differentiating Oct1-deficient ESCs. We chose to use RA-mediated differentiation, both because we have a clearer understanding of gene expression, and because at ~3 weeks these experiments take half as long compared to those using formation of true neurons. After several rounds of experiments, we now know that infection and selection with empty vectors at most differentiation timepoints, particularly late timepoints, changes expression of developmental targets genes such as <italic>Hoxa5</italic> and <italic>Cdx2</italic>. This confirms our initial concern, raised in the prior round of review, that selection skews the populations of cells remaining on the plate. However empty vector infection on day 4-5 (we performed two rounds of infection), generated minimal gene expression changes, at least on an averaged population level. This suggests, but does not prove, that population skewing by lentiviral infection is minimal at this time point. Subsequent experiments using vectors containing Oct1 shows that infection and selection infection significantly augments <italic>Hoxa5</italic> expression, complementing Oct1 loss. We hope these findings now address the reviewer’s remaining issues.</p><p>We are willing to change the title should it be deemed necessary. One possibility, more observational and less interpretive, would be “Transcription factor Oct1 both ensures robust expression of lineage- appropriate developmental genes, and represses expression of lineage-inappropriate genes, in differentiating ESCs.”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>In the revised manuscript, the authors made several changes to address the points mentioned by the reviewers. The most important point the authors should confirm was the functional confirmation of the switching from Oct4 to Oct1 on induction of differentiation-associated genes to undergo proper differentiation event. Neuronal differentiation was well-established system and the combination of the inducible KO of Oct1 would allow them to give a clear answer to this question as the reviewers expected. However, the experiment performed by the authors was not well organized and the result was equivocal. If the switch from Oct4 to Oct1 at the beginning of differentiation event is functionally important, the constitutive KO ES cells will fail to give rise to terminally differentiated cells whereas the conditional KO induced after switching will differentiate, even in lower efficiency than WT ES cells. However, induction of KO event at day 4 of differentiation culture, the time point when Oct1 was already replace Oct4 at several target sites as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, completely abolished differentiation to mature neurons. This result suggested that Oct1 function is required for the late period of differentiation event or maintenance of the mature differentiated phenotype in cell-type-dependent manner. The assessment of KO event at cellular level was incomplete in this experiment. Why did the authors detect YFP expression, an indirect marker of inducible KO, rather than the loss of Oct1 protein with anti-Oct1 Ab?</italic> </p><p><italic>An alternative way to address this point precisely is the rescue by the inducible Oct1 expression in Oct1-null ES cells after induction of differentiation. According to the answers to the reviewers' comments, the authors tried to rescue Oct1-null ES cells by transfection of constitutively-active Oct1 transgene at different time point, and failed. Why not using the inducible expression system such as Tet-on system to drive Oct1 transgene? It is well-established system and commercially available.</italic> </p><p><italic>The strict confirmation of this point is very important to support the hypothesis the authors proposed. Without such confirmation, the other data is insufficient to support the hypothesis. The role of Oct1 for normal proliferation, protection against stress, and maintenance of certain metabolic state in differentiated cell types would explain the defect of Oct1-null ES cells in chimera assay, teratoma assay and slower growth of EBs rather than the defect in differentiation event.</italic> </p><p>There is no reason why Oct1 cannot both replace Oct4 at certain genes early in differentiation, and also continue to be required other aspects and fate transitions later in development. The reviewer is equating the ChIP timecourse result using RA differentiation culture in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> with 4-OHT treatment after 8 days of EB formation, followed by 4 days culture in chamber slides with neuron differentiation medium in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I-J</xref>. Binding of Oct1 to target genes in these two assays systems can’t be equated.</p><p>We used 4-OHT at the only point at which deletion was efficient. The reason we used YFP instead of Oct1 for immunofluorescence is 1) the YFP antibody is superior to the Oct1 antibody for IF, 2) the Oct1 and β-III-tubulin antibodies are both rabbit polyclonal (we circumvented this by purchasing additional antibodies), 3) the staining protocols for Oct1 and β-III-tubulin are incompatible, relying on formaldehyde vs. methanol fixation, and no mutually compatible protocol could be found. But most importantly, we obtained the positive result that Oct1 inducible-conditional cells exposed to Cre recombinase 12 days after differentiation (4 days in chamber slides) fail to form neurons efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-J</xref>). The YFP staining would have been a significant issue of there had been no or small differences, in which case the possibility of heterozygous deletion and remaining Oct1 protein could be raised and a follow-up Oct1 stain would have been critical.</p><p>To further address this reviewer, we sub-cloned Oct1 into a lentiviral vector, providing us the opportunity to infect post-mitotic cells. As outlined in the response to the first round of reviewer comments, there are multiple factors that make this experiment non-ideal. Two are the fact that an infected and selected population of cells may not recapitulate the original population, due to preferences in the cell types or growth states infected, and the fact that Oct1 levels modulate significantly during differentiation and expression from a viral LTR may not recapitulate this complex regulation. The latter becomes a significant issue in light of the findings from the manuscript that relative levels of Oct1 and Oct4 (and presumably other Oct proteins) is a significant controller of gene occupancy and regulation. We infected RA-differentiating cultures of germline Oct1-deficient ESCs with lentiviruses encoding Oct1 (or empty vector) at multiple timepoints during differentiation, selected with puromycin, and tested gene expression by RT-qPCR. At most of these times, especially late in differentiation, infection and selection with empty vector was sufficient to skew expression of test genes such as <italic>Hoxa5</italic> and <italic>Cdx2</italic> (now shown). This result strongly suggests that infection and selection at these time points skews the population of cells under study. We therefore focused on one time at which gene expression changes caused by empty vector infection were minimal: day 4 and 5 of differentiation. We infect the cells twice to maximize efficiency, and apply puromycin selection 24 hr after the second infection throughout the remainder of the 14-day timecourse. After differentiation we collected RNA, prepared cDNA and tested gene expression. We confirmed that Oct1 was over- expressed in 293T cells transfected with Oct1-encoding vectors but not empty vector controls at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) and in the RA cultures infected with lentivirus at the mRNA level (not shown).</p><p>We focused on <italic>Hoxa5</italic>, which is inappropriately repressed upon RA-mediated differentiation of Oct1 deficient ESCs. Infection of differentiating Oct1 deficient ESCs using constructs expressing Oct1 increased <italic>Hoxa5</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). These results suggest that complementing with Oct1, at least at this timepoint, restores at least some gene expression. We have added to the text, figure legends and Methods sections to incorporate these findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>Issue 1: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>. The authors compare RNA-seq data of parental vs. KO in both undifferentiated and differentiated conditions. The authors conclude that the KO show more gene expression differences during differentiation. However, it is important to show variability across parental and KO samples separately in both conditions. i.e. one would expect that cells are more heterogeneous during RA-differentiation compared to pluripotency state. So, it is expected to see more difference in RA-differentiation state.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s enthusiasm about the work. Although RA-differentiated cells are more heterogenous than undifferentiated ESCs, the variance in gene expression in the population of cells between RNAseq replicates is not. If it were, the <italic>P</italic>-values would not be robust and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> would not show differences on the Y-axis. To further solidify this, we are attaching a Pearson correlation of the RNAseq raw expression count data for all genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response images 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">2</xref>). These figures recapitulates the finding that the differences in gene expression in differentiated vs. pluripotent are stronger than differences due to inducible knockout. Relevant here, replicate variance (as groups of nine squares) are all high at ~.99 regardless of the condition. We have modified the text to state that the findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and associated figure supplements are not due to increased variance in the differentiated condition.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20937.034</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20937.034">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20937.034</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-20937-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20937.035</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20937.035">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20937.035</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-20937-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>Issue 2: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> (bottom). the known Oct4-Sox2 motif was enriched in 22.9% of Oct4 unique peaks as compared to Oct4 motif which was enriched 15.3%. this does not make sense as Oct4 motif is the exact first half of the Oct4-Sox2 composite motif.
