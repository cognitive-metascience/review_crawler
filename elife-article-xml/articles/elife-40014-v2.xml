In adulthood, the visual cortex retains some flexibility and adapts to sensory deprivation. Here we show that short-term (2 hr) monocular deprivation in adult humans boosts the BOLD response to the deprived eye, changing ocular dominance of V1 vertices, consistent with homeostatic plasticity. The boost is strongest in V1, present in V2, V3 and V4 but absent in V3a and hMT+. Assessment of spatial frequency tuning in V1 by a population Receptive-Field technique shows that deprivation primarily boosts high spatial frequencies, consistent with a primary involvement of the parvocellular pathway. Crucially, the V1 deprivation effect correlates across participants with the perceptual increase of the deprived eye dominance assessed with binocular rivalry, suggesting a common origin. Our results demonstrate that visual cortex, particularly the ventral pathway, retains a high potential for homeostatic plasticity in the human adult.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40014.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The world around us changes all the time, and the brain must adapt to these changes. This process, known as neuroplasticity, peaks during development. Abnormal sensory input early in life can therefore cause lasting changes to the structure of the brain. One example of this is amblyopia or ‘lazy eye’. Infants who receive insufficient input to one eye – for example, because of cataracts – can lose their sight in that eye, even if the cataracts are later removed. This is because the brain reorganizes itself to ignore messages from the affected eye.</p><p>Does the adult visual system also show neuroplasticity? To explore this question, Binda, Kurzawski et al. asked healthy adult volunteers to lie inside a high-resolution brain scanner with a patch covering one eye. At the start of the experiment, roughly half of the brain’s primary visual cortex responded to sensory input from each eye. But when the volunteers removed the patch two hours later, this was no longer the case.</p><p>Some areas of the visual cortex that had previously responded to stimuli presented to the non-patched eye now responded to stimuli presented to the patched eye instead. The patched eye had also become more sensitive to visual stimuli. Indeed, these changes in visual sensitivity correlated with changes in brain activity in a pathway called the ventral visual stream. This pathway processes the fine details of images. Groups of neurons within this pathway that responded to stimuli presented to the patched eye were more sensitive to fine details after patching than before.</p><p>Visual regions of the adult brain thus retain a high degree of neuroplasticity. They adapt rapidly to changes in the environment, in this case by increasing their activity to compensate for a lack of input. Notably, these changes are in the opposite direction to those that occur as a result of visual deprivation during development. This has important implications because lazy eye syndrome is currently considered untreatable in adulthood.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ultra-high field magnetic resonance</kwd><kwd>visual cortex</kwd><kwd>homeostatic plasticity</kwd><kwd>monocular deprivation</kwd><kwd>spatial frequency selectivity</kwd><kwd>population receptive field</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC ECSPLAIN 338866</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Binda</surname><given-names>Paola</given-names></name><name><surname>Kurzawski</surname><given-names>Jan W</given-names></name><name><surname>Morrone</surname><given-names>Maria Concetta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010686</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Institute of Innovation and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NextGenVis 641805</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kurzawski</surname><given-names>Jan W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003407</institution-id><institution>Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRIN2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lunghi</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name><name><surname>Morrone</surname><given-names>Maria Concetta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERA-NET Neuro-DREAM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lunghi</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name><name><surname>Morrone</surname><given-names>Maria Concetta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondazione Roma</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrone</surname><given-names>Maria Concetta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two hour deprivation of vision in one eye transiently boosts the representation of the deprived eye (suppressing the non-deprived eye) in adult human V1 and along the ventral pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To interact efficiently with the world, our brain needs to fine-tune its structure and function, adapting to a continuously changing external environment. This key property of the brain, called <italic>neuroplasticity,</italic> is most pronounced early in life, within the so called <italic>critical period</italic>, when abnormal experience can produce structural changes at the level of the primary sensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berardi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hubel and Wiesel, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hubel et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wiesel and Hubel, 1963</xref>). During development, occluding one eye for a few days induces a dramatic and permanent reorganization of ocular dominance columns (the V1 territory representing each eye) in favor of the open eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berardi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gordon and Stryker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hubel and Wiesel, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hubel et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wiesel and Hubel, 1963</xref>), while the deprived eye becomes functionally blind or very weak. These forms of structural plasticity have been documented in animal models, including non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gordon and Stryker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kiorpes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Levi and Carkeet, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wiesel and Hubel, 1963</xref>). A corresponding perceptual phenomenon known as amblyopia is observed in humans, and may result from exposing infants to monocular deprivation during the critical period, for example due to cataracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braddick and Atkinson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maurer et al., 2007</xref>). In infants, even a partial deprivation produced by optical defects like astigmatism and myopia leads to a permanent acuity loss that cannot be compensated in adulthood, even after correction the optical aberrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freeman and Thibos, 1975</xref>) through Adaptive Optics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rossi et al., 2007</xref>). Hebbian plasticity, endorsed by Long-Term synaptic Potentiation and Depression (LTP/LTD) of early stage of cortical processing, underlies these changes in animal models and probably also in humans.</p><p>After the closure of the critical period, structural changes of V1 resulting from Hebbian plasticity are not typically observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mitchell and Sengpiel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sato and Stryker, 2008</xref>). However, there is evidence that Hebbian plasticity can be restored in adult animal models under special conditions, associated with manipulation of the excitability of the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frégnac et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maya Vetencourt et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Besides Hebbian plasticity, other mechanisms can reshape primary visual cortex processing both within and outside the critical period. At the cellular level, there is evidence for homeostatic plasticity, which increases the gain of cortical responses following sensory deprivation; for example, after a brief monocular deprivation, the response gain of the deprived eye increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maffei et al., 2004</xref>). This is interpreted as an homeostatic response to preserve cortical excitability in spite of the synaptic depression produced by Hebbian plasticity, suggesting a close link between these two types of plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maffei and Turrigiano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mrsic-Flogel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In adult animal models and humans, there is clear evidence for both functional plasticity and for stability of the early sensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baseler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baseler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wandell and Smirnakis, 2009</xref>). Functional changes have been observed with perceptual learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dosher and Lu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fahle and Poggio, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fiorentini and Berardi, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karni and Sagi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Karni and Sagi, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Watanabe and Sasaki, 2015</xref>), adaptation that, in some cases, may be very long-lasting, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McCollough, 1965</xref>), and short-term visual deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Binda and Lunghi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lunghi et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lunghi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lunghi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mon-Williams et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). The effect of short-term deprivation in adults is paradoxical, boosting the perception of the deprived stimulus – opposite to the long-term deprivation effects during development. One of the first examples of short-term deprivation in adults is by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mon-Williams et al., 1998</xref>, who found that thirty minutes of simulated myopia (optical blur achieved by wearing a +1D lens) was followed by a transient improvement of visual acuity – opposite to the long-lasting acuity deficit produced by early onset myopia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rossi et al., 2007</xref>). Contrast attenuation for 4 hr leads to improved contrast discrimination thresholds and enhanced BOLD response in V1/V2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>). A few hours deprivation of one cardinal orientation leads to enhanced sensitivity to the deprived orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) – opposite to the reduced sensitivity to orientations deprived during development, for example due to astigmatism. Similarly, two hours of monocular contrast deprivation is followed by a transient boost of the deprived eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Binda and Lunghi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lunghi et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lunghi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lunghi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lunghi et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>) and an enlargement of the deprived-eye representation at the level of V1 in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Begum and Tso, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tso et al., 2017</xref>) – opposite to the amblyopia induced by monocular deprivation during the critical period. The mechanism supporting the perceptual boost of the deprived information could be either a form of homeostatic plasticity (like that observed in animal models), and/or a release of contrast adaptation for the deprived stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blakemore and Campbell, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boynton et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gardner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Maffei et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Movshon and Lennie, 1979</xref>). Irrespective of the interpretation, the data clearly indicate that effects can be long-lasting or even permanent. For example, in patients with keratoconus (adult-onset corneal dystrophia, often monocular), best corrected visual acuity is worse than in emmetropic eyes, but it is better than predicted by the corneal dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sabesan and Yoon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sabesan and Yoon, 2010</xref>): when corneal aberrations of the keratoconic (KC) eyes are simulated in the emmetropic eyes, visual acuity is worse than in the KC eyes, demonstrating a permanent perceptual boost of the deprived information. Moreover, in adult amblyopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lunghi et al., 2018</xref>), short-term monocular deprivation (of the amblyopic eye) may lead to permanent partial recovery of acuity (of the amblyopic eye). This observation resonates with the idea – introduced in the context of work at the cellular level – that homeostatic plasticity and Hebbian plasticity may be fundamentally linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maffei and Turrigiano, 2008</xref>) and may open important new pathways for the therapy of amblyopia and, in general, for the rehabilitation of early-onset visual dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Legge and Chung, 2016</xref>).</p><p>This possibility highlights the importance of understanding the neural substrates of short-term deprivation in adult humans. So far, monocular deprivation effects have been indirectly studied with MR spectroscopy (showing a GABA concentration change in the occipital cortex, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lunghi et al., 2015b</xref>) and Visual Evoked Potentials (showing a modulation of the early visual response components, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lunghi et al., 2015a</xref>). Indirect evidence also indicates that deprivation effects are not generalized but preferentially involve the parvocellular pathway – given that effects are more prominent and longer-lasting for chromatic equiluminant stimuli in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lunghi et al., 2013</xref>), and strongest in macaques when deprivation mainly affects the parvocellular activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Begum and Tso, 2016</xref>). Here we directly measure the changes in early visual cortical areas using 7T fMRI in adult humans, before and after two hours of monocular deprivation. Assessing the BOLD change and its selectivity to spatial frequency with a newly developed approach (conceptually similar to the population Receptive Field method, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008</xref>), we demonstrate a change of ocular drive of BOLD signals in primary visual cortex, selective for the higher spatial frequencies and strongest along the ventral pathway, consistent with a stronger plasticity potential of the parvocellular pathway in adulthood.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Monocular deprivation boosts V1 responses to the deprived eye and shifts BOLD ocular dominance</title><p>To investigate the visual modulation of BOLD signal by short term deprivation, we performed ultra-high field (UHF, 7T) fMRI during the presentation of high contrast dynamic visual stimuli, delivered separately to the two eyes, before and after 2 hr of monocular contrast deprivation (see schematic diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40014.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Monocular deprivation modulates 7T BOLD responses in early visual cortex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of the methods. The icons show a band-pass noise stimulus shown to either eye through the MR compatible goggles.

However, after deprivation (‘POST’), the response in the two eyes changes in opposite directions, with a boost of the BOLD response (measured as GLM Beta values, expressed in units of % signal change) of the deprived eye and a suppression of the non-deprived eye (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, panel B). This was formally tested with a two-way repeated measure ANOVA, entered with the mean BOLD responses across all vertices in the left and right V1 region, for the four conditions and each participant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> show averages of this values across participants).

For each vertex, we defined an index of Ocular Dominance computed as the difference of BOLD response to the deprived and non-deprived eye. This index is not to be confused with the anatomical arrangement of vertices with different eye preference that define the ocular dominance columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yacoub et al., 2007</xref>), that cannot be directly imaged with voxel size of 1.5 mm. However, at this low resolution, each voxel is expected to average signals from a biased sample of ocular dominance columns leading to an eye preference of that particular voxel (the Ocular Dominance index in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Before deprivation, the Ocular Dominance index is symmetrically distributed around zero, indicating a balanced representation of the two eyes before deprivation (yellow distribution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). After deprivation (black distribution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), the Ocular Dominance distribution shifts to the right of 0, indicating a preference for the deprived eye (non-parametric Wilcoxon sign-rank test comparing the PRE and POST Ocular Dominance medians, z = 115.39, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>In principle, the boost of responses to the deprived eye seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> could be produced by enhancing the response of vertices that originally preferred the deprived eye (without shifting ocular dominance) or by changing Ocular Dominance of vertices that originally preferred the non-deprived eye, driving them to prefer the deprived eye. The shift of the Ocular Dominance histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> is more compatible with the latter case, implying a recruitment of cortical resources for the representation of the deprived eye. To investigate this further, we monitored the final POST-deprivation Ocular Dominance of individual vertices that, PRE-deprivation, preferred the deprived eye (yellow half distribution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The majority of vertices continue to prefer the same eye before and after deprivation. The median Ocular Dominance is significantly larger than 0 both PRE and POST (Wilcoxon sign-rank test, z &gt; 101.54, p &lt; 0.0001 in both cases) and the correlation between Ocular Dominance indices before and after deprivation is strong and positive (Pearson’s R(32236) = 0.22 [0.21–0.23], p &lt; 0.0001). Note that a completely random reassignment of Ocular Dominance after deprivation would have produced a histogram centered at 0 and no correlation between Ocular Dominance indices PRE- and POST deprivation. This is not consistent with the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, which thereby provide evidence that our estimates of Ocular Dominance before and after deprivation are congruent, even though they were collected in different fMRI sessions separated by 2 hr. In addition, the distribution of Ocular Dominance after deprivation is well predicted by adding only a small amount of noise to the original half distribution (Gaussian noise with 0.12 standard deviation, black line), suggesting that these vertices were largely unaffected by monocular deprivation. This is also supported by the repeated measure ANOVA of individual subject data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), revealing a strong main effect of eye (F(1,18) = 48.28901, p &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>): the response to the deprived eye is stronger than the non-deprived eye, both before deprivation (due the selection, t(18) = −8.616, p &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>), and after deprivation (t(18) = −4.281, p &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>), with no effect of time and no <italic>time</italic> × <italic>eye</italic> interaction (all F(1,18) = 0.20429, p &gt; 0.5).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40014.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Monocular deprivation shifts 7T BOLD Ocular Dominance in V1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>C</bold>) Average BOLD responses with the same conventions as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> but analysing data from two sub-regions of V1.

Again, this is not consistent with a random reassignment of Ocular Dominance after deprivation, which predicts a distribution centered at 0. Contrary to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the POST- Ocular Dominance distribution cannot be predicted by injecting Gaussian noise to the PRE- Ocular Dominance distribution (black line, 0.12 standard deviation like for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>): for these vertices, there is a shift of Ocular Dominance with short term monocular deprivation. This is confirmed with the repeated measure ANOVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), where the <italic>time</italic> × <italic>eye</italic> interaction is significant (F(1,18) = 44.82812, p &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>), implying a different modulation PRE and POST deprivation. In addition and crucially, POST-deprivation BOLD responses to the deprived eye are significantly larger than POST-deprivation responses to the non-deprived eye (t(18) = −2.775 p = 0.012; whereas, by selection, the opposite is true before deprivation: t(18) = 12.034, p &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>).</p><p>In summary, Ocular Dominance before deprivation defines two similarly sized sub-regions of V1 vertices (44.58 ± 5.38% and 55.42 ± 5.38% of analyzed V1 vertices; 44.84 ± 5.12% and 55.16 ± 5.12% of all V1 vertices) with radically different behaviors that are not consistent with an artifact induced by vertex selection. The sub-region that originally represents the deprived eye does not change with deprivation; the sub-region that originally represents the non-deprived eye is rearranged with deprivation, as a large portion of vertices turn to prefer the deprived eye.</p><p>If plasticity were not eye-specific and/or we failed to match our V1 vertices before/after deprivation, we would expect that splitting the distribution of V1 ocular dominance generates opposite effects in the two subpopulations: vertices preferring the deprived eye before deprivation should swap to prefer the other eye, mirroring the effect seen in the vertices preferring non-deprived eye. This is not seen, implying that we did successfully match vertices across the 2 hr of deprivation and that the selective Ocular Dominance shift, observed for about half of our vertices, is not an artifact.</p><p>We also measured the perceptual effects of short-term monocular deprivation effects using Binocular Rivalry, just before the PRE- and POST-deprivation fMRI sessions. In line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Binda and Lunghi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lunghi et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lunghi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lunghi et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lunghi and Sale, 2015</xref>), short-term monocular contrast deprivation induced a 30% increase of phase duration for the deprived eye (POST to PRE-deprivation ratio: 1.31 ± 0.30) and a 15% decrease of phase duration for the non-deprived eye (ratio: 0.86 ± 0.30), producing a significant <italic>time</italic> × <italic>eye</italic> interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, repeated measure ANOVA on the mean phase durations for each participant, interaction: F(1,18) = 23.56957, p = 0.00013).

Values larger than one imply a relative increase of the deprived eye phase duration, that is the expected effect; a value less than 1 indicates the opposite effect and a value of 1 indicates no change of mean phase duration across eyes. All but two subjects have values larger than 1, indicating a strong effect of deprivation. However, the scatter is large with values ranging from 0.7 to 3, suggesting that susceptibility to visual plasticity varies largely in our pool of participants. Capitalizing on this variability, we tested whether the size of the psychophysical effect correlates with the BOLD effect across participants. Using the same <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6">Equation 6</xref> to compute the deprivation effect on BOLD responses (DI<sub>BOLD</sub>), we observed a strong correlation between the effect of monocular deprivation on psychophysics and BOLD (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Subjects who showed a strong deprivation effect at psychophysics (DI<sub>psycho</sub> &gt;2) also showed a strong deprivation effect in BOLD responses (DI<sub>BOLD</sub> = 1.85 ± 0.42). Given that the psychophysics was measured only for central vision and at two cpd stationary grating, whereas BOLD responses were pooled across a large portion on V1 and were elicited using broadband dynamic stimuli, the correlation suggests that the psychophysical effect may be used as a reliable proxy of a general change of cortical excitability, which can be measured by fMRI.</p><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Monocular deprivation shifts BOLD spatial frequency tuning for the deprived eye</title><p>The BOLD measure we use here gives us the chance to measure the effect of Monocular Deprivation across spatial frequencies and as function of eccentricity.

Independently of the exact bandwidth and peak preference of the neuronal population contributing to the final BOLD selectivity, we find that the shape of all these curves is captured with a simple one-parameter model: what we term the population tuning for Spatial Frequency. This is given by a Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) function with one free parameter, the spatial constant (while the excitation/inhibition spatial constant ratio is fixed; see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref> in the Materials and method and curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The free parameter sets the high spatial frequency cut-off at half-height of the filter. The continuous lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> show how the model fits the grand-average of V1 responses, with best fit cut-off around five cpd similar for all conditions except for the POST-deprivation deprived eye, where the cut-off is 6.2 cpd (single vertex examples are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> panels C-I). The DoG equation has been successfully used in previous studies to model CSF and neural responses at variable stimulus parameters for example illumination levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hawken et al., 1988</xref>), validating this equation for modeling the overall selectivity of large neuronal ensembles.</p><p>Using this model to analyze single vertex responses, we evaluated the best-fit spatial frequency cut-off of the neural population contributing to the vertex BOLD response (see details in the Materials and method and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> panels A-C; briefly, we used the DoG model to predict the response elicited by our five band-pass noise stimuli in populations with different spatial frequency selectivity, that is filters with different cut-off; we then found the cut-off value that maximizes the correlation between the predicted responses and the observed BOLD responses). We used this procedure to fit BOLD responses in each of our four conditions, estimating spatial frequency selectivity in individual vertices in each condition: separately for the two eyes, PRE/POST deprivation. Before deprivation, the spatial frequency cut-off decays with eccentricity as expected. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> maps both eccentricity (pRF eccentricity estimates from a separate retinotopic mapping scan) and spatial frequency cut-off values, obtained by fitting responses to the deprived eye, before deprivation (averaged across hemispheres and subjects). The cut-off is around 16 in the para-fovea (eccentricity around 1.5 deg) and down to four in the periphery (eccentricity around 8 deg). This relationship between eccentricity and spatial frequency preference is consistent with previous fMRI results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D’Souza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Henriksson et al., 2008</xref>) and with psychophysics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rovamo et al., 1978</xref>).

Given that the <italic>time</italic> × <italic>eye</italic> interaction in the full V1 region is not significant, and to minimize noise contamination, we evaluated the effect of deprivation on spatial frequency cut-off at the individual level by a ‘Deprived Eye Change (DepC<sub>cutoff</sub>)’ index (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation 7</xref> in the Materials and method), that is taking the POST vs. PRE-deprivation ratio of the spatial frequency cut-off for the deprived eye alone.

BOLD activity across the V1 cortical region paradoxically increases for the eye that was deprived of contrast vision, and decreases for the eye exposed to normal visual experience.</p><p>The enhanced response to the deprived eye fits well with the concept of homeostatic plasticity, first observed in rodent visual cortex, both juvenile and adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maffei et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mrsic-Flogel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004</xref>), which is the tendency of neural circuits to keep the average firing rates constant in spite of anomalous stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maffei and Turrigiano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mrsic-Flogel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004</xref>). More recently, similar observations have been made in the adult macaque V1 after two hours of monocular deprivation during anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Begum and Tso, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tso et al., 2017</xref>). The post-deprivation gain boost observed in the monkey is consistent with our observations of an increased BOLD response to the deprived eye. We also observe an antagonistic suppression of the non-deprived eye BOLD response; together, the two effects lead to a shift of ocular preference of individual vertices in favor of the deprived eye. However, this effect is only observed in those V1 vertices that responded preferentially to the non-deprived eye before deprivation. No change of ocular preference is seen in vertices that already prefer the deprived eye before deprivation, which maintain their eye-preference after deprivation. This pattern of results cannot be explained by an overall gain increase; rather, it is consistent with the idea that the representation of the deprived eye recruits cortical resources (which may or may not correspond to cortical territory), normally dedicated to the other eye.</p><p>A similar antagonist effect on the two eyes (boosting the deprived eye and suppressing the non-deprived eye) was also observed in the VEP responses after short-term monocular deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lunghi et al., 2015a</xref>), and could be implemented through a modulation of the excitatory/inhibitory circuitry. Regulation of the excitation/inhibition balance through GABAergic signaling is considered to be a key factor for cortical plasticity, including homeostatic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maffei and Turrigiano, 2008</xref>). Interestingly, the involvement of GABAergic signaling in the effect of short-term monocular deprivation is directly supported by MR Spectroscopy data in adult humans, showing that resting GABA in a large region of the occipital cortex is specifically reduced after short-term monocular deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lunghi et al., 2015b</xref>).</p><p>The functional relevance of the BOLD changes we observe is demonstrated by their correlation with our behavioral assay of plasticity, obtained through binocular rivalry. This correlates both with the BOLD ocular dominance change (relative boost/suppression of the deprived/non-deprived eye), and with the BOLD acuity change for the deprived eye (change of spatial frequency tuning, assessed with our pRF-like modeling approach). The correlation holds despite binocular rivalry being restricted to foveal vision, whereas the assessment of BOLD plasticity is pooled across V1 (including the mid-periphery). This implies that the change of binocular rivalry dynamics is a proxy for the more general plasticity effects that involves the whole primary visual cortex. This finding has long reaching implications, as it could validate the use of binocular rivalry as a biomarker of adult cortical plasticity, based on the neural mechanisms revealed by the present 7T fMRI results. Interestingly, the binocular rivalry phenomenon originates in the primary visual cortex – probably at the earliest stages – and is an expression of the dynamics of excitatory transmission and inhibitory feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tong et al., 2006</xref>); as such it is a measure that could reflect the overall excitation-inhibition ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Loon et al., 2013</xref>), and its modulation in plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lunghi et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maffei and Turrigiano, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our data support the notion that V1 circuitry may be optimized by perceptual experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fiorentini and Berardi, 1980</xref>). They are also consistent with a large perceptual learning literature suggesting that associative cortical areas retain a high degree of flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dosher and Lu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dosher and Lu, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fuchs and Flügge, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kahnt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Karni et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lewis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shibata et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Watanabe and Sasaki, 2015</xref>). Although the monocular deprivations effects observed here are more robust in V1, they are reliable in V2 and V3 as well. However, a clear difference emerges between extra-striate visual areas in the ventral and dorsal stream. While ventral area V4 shows a strong deprivation effect, area V3a, located at a similar tier in the dorsal stream, shows no BOLD change after short-term monocular deprivation. V4 is a primary target of the parvocellular system, which is best stimulated by our highest spatial frequency stimulus; V3a and hMT+ are preferential targets of the magnocellular system, which respond more strongly to our lower spatial frequency stimuli (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The different plasticity response of the ventral and dorsal stream, together with the selectivity for the high spatial frequencies of the V1 plasticity, suggests that the parvocellular pathway is most strongly affected by short-term plasticity. This is consistent with the finding in non-human primates that deprivation of the stimuli that optimally drive the parvocellular system is sufficient to produce a reliable plasticity effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Begum and Tso, 2016</xref>). It is also consistent with the finding that the effect of short-term monocular deprivation is strongest and more long-lasting for chromatic equiluminant stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lunghi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Other evidence shows that short-term deprivation may affect other properties of vision. In particular, selective deprivation of orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) or spatial frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>) or color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>) or even simply phase scrambling of the image in one eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2017</xref>) may lead to a boost of the deprived signal. These effects have been interpreted as a form of release of inhibition from the adapted signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) – a concept that is not distant from homeostatic plasticity, where the network aims to keep overall activity constant. The conceptual border between adaptation and plasticity is fuzzy, given that some mechanisms are shared and both effects have the same outcomes. Be it adaptation or plasticity, the monocular deprivation mechanisms are probably cortical and affect mainly the deprived eye. There is evidence that the boost of the deprived eye is also observed when the two eyes receive equally strong stimulation, but perception of one eye stimulus is suppressed experimentally (by the continuous flash suppression technique, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2017</xref>); this result dismisses the retinal or thalamic contribution to the deprivation effect. Only in rare occasions does adaptation induce effects that last over days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McCollough, 1965</xref>), yet our recent work shows that deprivation effects of short-term monocular deprivation is retained across 6 hr sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Menicucci et al., 2018</xref>), consistent with plasticity reinforcement during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Raven et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Timofeev and Chauvette, 2017</xref>). Most importantly, in adult amblyopic patients, short-term monocular deprivation is able to induce improvement of visual acuity and stereovision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lunghi et al., 2018</xref>) for up to one year. All this evidence supports the concept that homeostatic plasticity in the human adult cortex may be linked with or may promote more stable forms of Hebbian-like plasticity. This may endorse stable changes even in the adult brain, well after the closure of the critical period. Functional changes in associative cortex in adults have been demonstrated by short-term paired TMS studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chao et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the decay of this functional connectivity change has a similar time-course as the monocular deprivation effect, about one hour. Also, Hebbian changes at the single cell level can be observed in V1 of adult anaesthetized cat, following activity pairing over a similar time-scale (from minutes to a few hours) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frégnac et al., 1988</xref>). All these results demonstrate that V1 retains potential for Hebbian plasticity outside the critical period – although it may need particular conditions to exploit such potential.</p><p>Understanding homeostatic plasticity and its relation to Hebbian plasticity may be fundamental to open the way to new approaches to treat brain dysfunction. Particularly important is Ocular Dominance plasticity in amblyopia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Webber and Wood, 2005</xref>), a cortical deficit still without cure in adults, although recent advancements in training procedures are opening new hopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Levi and Li, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sengpiel, 2014</xref>). Endorsing plasticity may increase the effectiveness of these treatments and preliminary data from our laboratory suggest that monocular deprivation of the amblyopic eye may indeed boost sensitivity of the deprived eye and improve its acuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lunghi et al., 2018</xref>) – just like an acuity change is revealed by the present BOLD measurements in normally sighted participants. Our data demonstrate that two hours of abnormally unbalanced visual experience is sufficient to induce a functional reorganization of cortical circuits, particularly of the parvocellular pathway, leading to an alteration of basic visual perceptual abilities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent <break/>type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Freesurfer v6.0.0</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fischl et al., 2002</xref>)</td><td valign="top">SCR_001847</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">SPM</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friston, 2007</xref>)</td><td valign="top">SCR_007037</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">BrainVoyager</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goebel et al., 2006</xref>)</td><td valign="top">SCR_006660</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">FSL</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jenkinson et al., 2012</xref>)</td><td valign="top">SCR_002823</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MATLAB</td><td valign="top">MathWorks</td><td valign="top">SCR_001622</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">PsychToolbox</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brainard, 1997</xref>)</td><td valign="top">SCR_002881</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Human subjects</title><p>Experimental procedures are in line with the declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the regional ethics committee [Comitato Etico Pediatrico Regionale—Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Meyer—Firenze (FI)] and by the Italian Ministry of Health, under the protocol ‘Plasticità e multimodalità delle prime aree visive: studio in risonanza magnetica a campo ultra alto (7T)’ version #1 dated 11/11/2015.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper examined the consequences of depriving one eye of pattern vision for two hours in adult humans, as assessed with functional MRI and binocular rivalry. The measurements were made both immediately before and after the 2-hour deprivation period. Among the major findings are altered BOLD response which increased for stimuli viewed through the deprived eye and decreased for stimuli viewed through the non-deprived eye, particularly for stimuli comprised of high spatial frequencies. The deprived eye was also favored during binocular rivalry. These effects were correlated across participants: those who showed the biggest BOLD effect also showed the biggest rivalry effect. The interpretation is that visual cortex retains a high degree of plasticity in adult humans, especially for signals carried by the parvocellular pathways.</p><p>The manuscript was well received by both reviewers. They were both positive about the approach, the strength of the data and its analysis as well as on the clarity of the presentation. However, there was some significant concerns about the interpretation, and the reviewers highlighted several problems that must be addressed before the paper will be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. These are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Both reviewers were concerned with the way the problem addressed in the paper was framed and the results interpreted. They pointed out that – contrary to the message conveyed by the paper that the adult cortex is hard-wired – short-term plasticity such as adaptation in the adult visual cortex is well known and not particularly controversial. This issue should be addressed with appropriate references to the existing literature. This point was initially raised by reviewer 1 and was shared by the reviewer 2 during the discussion that followed.</p><p>2) Please clarify how (and whether) your data showing short-term plasticity in the adult brain relate to the critical periods and long-term effects of deprivation during development.

Of particular interest are potential differences in the effects for central and peripheral visual fields that could emerge from such a comparison.</p><p>5) Please discuss how the removal of phase information during deprivation may have affected your results.</p><p>6) Please address the question whether stimulation of the nondeprived eye during retinotopic mapping during deprivation may have affected the outcome of your study.</p><p>7) Please address the reliability of the analysis of MT activation.

This work should be referenced here.</p><p>9) The phrase '… sensory cortex is resilient to plastic change' is used multiple times including the Abstract and Discussion. We think 'resilient' should be 'resistant', and 'plastic change' is redundant, and should perhaps just be 'change'. We suspect the authors have an idea of 'plastic change' that is different from other kinds of change, but if so they should define it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Binda and colleagues examined the consequences of depriving one eye of pattern vision for 2 hours in adult humans, as assessed with functional MRI and binocular rivalry. The measurements were made both immediately before and after the 2-hour deprivation period, with a few main findings. First, the BOLD response in visual cortex was altered by the deprivation, increasing for stimuli viewed through the deprived eye and decreasing for stimuli through the non-deprived eye, particularly for stimuli comprised of high spatial frequencies. Second, binocular rivalry tended to favor the deprived eye. Third, the two effects were correlated across participants: those who showed the biggest BOLD effect also tend to show the biggest rivalry effect. The interpretation is that visual cortex retains a high degree of plasticity in adult humans, especially for signals carried by the parvocellular pathways.</p><p>The study is well done and the results are clear. The correlation between the BOLD effects and psychophysics at the level of individual subjects is an important observation. The quantification of the results as a function of stimulus spatial frequency content and visual area is useful and leads to several interesting patterns of results. For all of these reasons, this is a generally strong study.</p><p>However, there is one major problem with the paper as written (as I see it), and that is the framing and interpretation. A reader might come away with the mistaken impression that some scientists think adult cortex has no plasticity, whereas others think it does, and that this study will resolve the issue. For example, the authors cite papers in support of the claims that adult cortex is essentially hard-wired (Mitchell and Sengpiel, 2009; Sato and Stryker, 2008) or is characterized more by stability than plasticity (Baseler et al., 2002; Baseler et al., 2011; Wandell and Smirnakis, 2009). As far as I can tell, none of these papers argues against the kind of short-term, adaptation effects observed here. In fact, the Wandell and Smirnakis paper goes so far as to state, 'There can be no serious debate as to whether the brain is plastic or not: it is both.'</p><p>While there is no hard-line separating adaptation from plasticity, this paper is clearly framed in terms of plasticity, based on both the title and the motivation. For example, the Introduction discusses the issue of critical periods. Yet it is not clear what this paper has to do with critical periods, or with the kind of long-term effects seen with deprivation in early development, since all of the effects in this study are measured within minutes of the deprivation (which some might call contrast adaptation). As the authors note in the Discussion, the effects are in the opposite direction of deprivation effects in development. In development, deprivation results in long-term loss of function. Here, as in many adaptation papers, the deprivation results in a short-term boost in function.</p><p>Such short-term effects of adaptation of the early visual system are widely known in vision science. For example, twenty minutes in the dark will greatly change psychophysical sensitivity and presumably BOLD responses to faint flashes of light. Few would argue that this demonstrates that adult cortex remains plastic in the same way as in early development. Similarly, Mon-Williams and colleagues (1998) showed that 30 minutes of defocus caused increased acuity and a change in spatial frequency sensitivity. There are also studies showing the effects of contrast adaptation on BOLD responses (e.g. Gardner et al., 2005).</p><p>In short, the notion that early visual cortex in adults alters its response properties following prolonged exposure to particular stimuli is widely known and uncontroversial. The results do not support the authors' main conclusion: 'Given these strong indications that the effect of monocular deprivation is a form of plasticity, our observation that the effect is present in V1 calls for a reconsideration of the established idea that human adult primary sensory cortex is resilient to plastic change.' Most of the evidence cited in the Discussion that these effects reflect substantial, long-term changes in the visual system, akin to developmental plasticity, is based on other work, not the experiments in this paper.</p><p>Nonetheless, as indicated above, the study is a very nice characterization of visual system responses to monocular contrast adaptation. The fMRI results are interesting and well characterized, and the relationship between the BOLD changes and the behavioral changes make for a nice contribution.</p><p>Finally, there is one issue with regard to the BOLD results that I found puzzling. The authors measure the ocular dominance of cortical locations ('surface vertices') but do not want the reader to confuse this with the notion of ocular dominance columns. What, exactly, is the interpretation of reasonably reliable and repeatable measures of ocular preference?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a fascinating, well-designed and technically-sophisticated study demonstrating short-term visual plasticity in adult human visual cortex. In particular, the authors show evidence that just 2 hours of monocular deprivation induces changes in 7T BOLD signal related to ocular dominance, which correlate strongly with behavioral performance (binocular rivalry) in the same subjects. The methods used to analyze the fMRI results include several thoughtful determinations, including the extraction (and subsequent assessment of change in) population tuning for spatial frequencies, and the ability to assess that changes in BOLD signal post-deprivation occurred preferentially in units that were selective for the non-deprived eye prior to the onset of deprivation.</p><p>I have some suggestions for additional information and discussion I would like to see included:</p><p>1) The translucent eye patch used to induce the 2 hours of visual deprivation allowed light to reach the retina, but prevented pattern vision. This patch did not only remove high spatial frequency and orientation information (I assume) but likely also removed phase information from the scene. Is this correct and/or relevant to the present experiments and findings? If so, can the authors discuss what implications this may have had in terms of impact on eye specific processing and brain activity measured presently.</p><p>2) In the Materials and methods, it becomes clear that the subjects were not just idly and freely reading or using a computer during the 2 hours of deprivation, as stated in the subsection “Short-term Monocular Deprivation”, but that they underwent retinotopic fMRI &quot;immediately after application of the patch&quot;. What proportion of the 2 hours was spent with the non-deprived eye being stimulated with the high-contrast, broadband stimuli typical of retinotopic mapping? Given the clear demonstration that only 2 hours of monocular form deprivation appears to have significant impact on neural properties in the visual system, could the stimulation received by the non-deprived eye have influenced the outcome obtained here and if so, how?</p><p>3) In the fMRI flat maps shown (Figures 1B, 5A), area MT appears to have <italic>very</italic> few significant voxels. So few in fact, that one wonders how reliable the analyses performed with respect to MT are. Please discuss.</p><p>4) Are the authors certain that the area they label as MT is truly MT, and not the MT complex, or hMT+?</p><p>5) In the Results, subsection “Figure 4: Deprivation affects spatial frequency selectivity in V1”, it is claimed that prior to deprivation, the BOLD response in V1 has broad-band selectivity with peak SF around 1 cpd. However, the graph in Figure 4A suggests that the peak is closer to 0.4 to just under 1 cpd. Please fix or discuss.</p><p>6) In the context of both motivating the present study (i.e. in the Introduction) and providing an example of how the present knowledge gained could be applied in the context of a clinical population, reference should be made to keratoconic patients. Much more so than amblyopia, keratoconus develops in early adulthood, well after the end of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. Moreover, just like the deprivation used here, it does not deprive the eye of light, but rather introduces severe optical aberrations, largely to one eye in many cases, filtering out high spatial frequency and phase information. Several excellent studies of neural adaptation to keratoconus have been published (see Sabesan, Yoon and colleagues, among others), at least some of which should be referenced in the present work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40014.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Both reviewers were concerned with the way the problem addressed in the paper was framed and the results interpreted.

We also changed the title and most of the Introduction. We share the view that the border between adaptation and adult plasticity is not a sharp one and that we cannot definitely assign the effects of short-term monocular deprivation to either phenomenon (plasticity or adaptation). Lacking direct evidence that short-term deprivation in adults leads to anatomical reorganization of the cortex, we decided to stress the functional aspect. We have consequently rephrased the title (from “Short-term plasticity of…” to “Response to short-term deprivation…”) and made this one of the key points of the Introduction. We are particularly grateful for the suggestion to discuss the literature on short- and long-term effects of blur and higher order aberrations (including keratoconus). Optical defocus causes both enhancement (especially in the short-term), and suppression (if maintained for a long period or a lifetime), suggesting that the two phenomena are linked and that, in essence, the results of optical defocus parallel the effects of monocular deprivation that we measured.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please clarify how (and whether) your data showing short-term plasticity in the adult brain relate to the critical periods and long-term effects of deprivation during development. This is of particular interest because of the opposite direction of the short-term effects in the adult and the effects of deprivation during development.</p></disp-quote><p>This important point is now directly addressed in the Introduction.We agree that the link between the short-term effects in the adult and the long-term effects seen in development is largely unexplored. However, there is animal work indicating that multiple forms of plasticity co-exist in the visual cortex: Hebbian plasticity (leading to suppression of the deprived input through a change of synaptic connectivity) and homeostatic plasticity (leading to the opposite effect, boosting the deprived input, through response gain modulation). Turrigiano and coworkers (but also many others) suggest that the two phenomena correspond to two sides of the same coin, with homeostatic plasticity acting to stabilize the network after the potentially destabilizing effects of Hebbian plasticity (e.g. LTP implements a positive feedback loop, bound to lead to excessive excitation in the absence of a mitigating mechanism). This opens the possibility that stimulating homeostatic plasticity (possibly of the form we observe here) might be instrumental to reinstating Hebbian plasticity in the adult, which could explain the efficacy of the short-term deprivation paradigm in improving acuity in adult amblyopes. However, irrespectively of the interpretation, it is a fact that a boost of the deprived information has been repeatedly observed, both during critical period and in adulthood, in mice and rat visual cortex (thoroughly reviewed in Maffei and Turrigiano, 2008; Turrigiano, 2012; Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please explain your interpretation of ocular dominance columns and ocular preferences.</p></disp-quote><p>Our voxel resolution does not allow to detect individual ODC or the “stripes” they form on the cortical surface. However we were forced to use large voxels size of 1.5mm to increase s/n ratio of the acquisition, given the limited time to measure the effect at its maximum. Also the positioning of the acquisition slices was not optimized for ODC imaging – slice prescription being aimed at covering both ventral and dorsal visual areas. Due to these limitations of our technique, we cannot directly image ODCs and how monocular deprivation affects them. However, each of our voxels draws a biased sample of neurons spanning several ODCs, and this bias leads to the eye preference of that particular voxel. We stress the need for further studies that reach a higher level of anatomical detail and might actually image a dynamic change of the ODC – if it occurs. Text clarifying this point has been added in the Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) If possible, provide fMRI maps of responses to stimuli presented to each eye. Of particular interest are potential differences in the effects for central and peripheral visual fields that could emerge from such a comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>Two new panels in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 show maps of average BOLD responses (% signal change in response to the highest SF stimulus) separately for the two eyes, before and after deprivation. The maps support the main analyses showing that the two eyes undergo opposite effects: suppression for the non-deprived, enhancement for the deprived. In addition, the maps show that the effects are spread across the V1 territory (they do not cluster in the fovea/periphery). This homogenous retinotopic distribution of the effects is consistent with the homogeneous change of spatial frequency tuning observed across eccentricity (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please discuss how the removal of phase information during deprivation may have affected your results.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity on this methodological aspect. Contrary to what was done in Lunghi et al. (2016), here we used a monocular patch that removed all contrast at a large range of spatial frequencies: leaving no power, hence no phase information – although the patch would of course preserve temporal luminance contrast (abrupt change of overall luminance) without phase alteration. Thus, our data cannot speak to the issue of amplitude attenuation or phase scramble as deprivation signal; however, it is interesting to note that the mere removal of phase information, with no manipulation of contrast, is sufficient to induce a short-term deprivation effect (Bai et al., 2017). This issue is now addressed in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please address the question whether stimulation of the nondeprived eye during retinotopic mapping during deprivation may have affected the outcome of your study.</p></disp-quote><p>Retinotopic mapping was performed over a relatively small portion of the deprivation time (less than 30’), and we have revised the text to state this more clearly. We agree that the kind of stimulation provided during the retinotopic mapping experiment is highly atypical and could have affected the outcome of the monocular deprivation procedure. In principle, increasing contrast in the non-deprived eye should have the same consequences as decreasing contrast in the deprived eye (through the patch). If so, the two manipulations could add up, implying that the MD protocol used in this experiment produces exaggerated consequences (and possibly larger V1 changes) compared to the previously published MD effects. However, this is not the case. From a re-analysis of recent published studies on MD and binocular rivalry in human adults, we find that the average effect size is 1.78 ± 0.20 (measured as the deprived/non-deprived ratio after deprivation on 46 subjects) and that the current effect (average ratio = 1.71 ± 0.32 on 19 subject) is well within this “normal” range. This argument is now reported in the Results section (near the description of Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Please address the reliability of the analysis of MT activation. The small number of voxels could make it difficult to assess the result.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge and clarify this issue, which we discuss in the Results section (near the description of Figure 7, edited to include an additional panel with hMT+ average BOLD responses). Significance of the activation map of Figure 1 is calculated vertex by vertex and FDR corrected; with this strict test, activation maps indeed fail to reveal a significant response in hMT+. We believe that this is due to increased variability of BOLD responses in individual vertices within this region of interest, compared to the other regions. This could be due to more variable retinotopy in hMT+ compared to the other regions (Smith et al., 2006) and/or more variable mapping of spatial frequencies. To factor out this variability, and make a fair comparison across regions, we average activity across all vertices within the ROI. The result of this analyses is presented in Figure 7, where the SF response curve is shown for V4, V3A and now also for hMT+. Once vertices within the ROI are pooled, hMT+ and V3A behave similarly, showing a low-pass behavior and yet a strong and significant response to the highest SF stimulus. Importantly both ROIs display no effect of monocular deprivation. Not only the deprivation index (bottom panel) in hMT+ (and V3a) is non-significantly different from 0, which could either mean no effect of deprivation or too variable/unreliable effects to reach statistical significance, it is also significantly smaller than V4, which means that the hMT+ (and V3a) measurements do afford sufficient statistical power to measure a statistically reliable difference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Could you relate the results to studies of neural adaptation to deprivation in keratoconus, a relatively common condition that affects young adults? This work should be referenced here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included reference to this interesting and relevant literature that we had unfortunately overlooked. Keratoconus, and other optical distortions, appear to be accompanied by both enhancement (Sabesan and Yoon, 2010) and suppression (Sabesan and Yoon, 2009), in a sense recapitulating the effects of monocular patching. We have stressed this similarity and added mention to this condition as further motivation to study the mechanisms that allow the visual system to adjust to experience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The phrase '… sensory cortex is resilient to plastic change' is used multiple times including the Abstract and Discussion.

We eliminated repetitions and the term resilient. We have edited the text to introduce the term “functional plasticity” (referring to the effects of short-term deprivation and related phenomena in the adult brain) and differentiated it from “structural changes”, which we use with reference to the plasticity phenomena typically triggered within the critical period.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] However, there is one major problem with the paper as written (as I see it), and that is the framing and interpretation.

Most of the evidence cited in the Discussion that these effects reflect substantial, long-term changes in the visual system, akin to developmental plasticity, is based on other work, not the experiments in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to item #1 and #2 in the editorial assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Nonetheless, as indicated above, the study is a very nice characterization of visual system responses to monocular contrast adaptation. The fMRI results are interesting and well characterized, and the relationship between the BOLD changes and the behavioral changes make for a nice contribution.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive criticism and the important suggestions for reframing the presentation of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, there is one issue with regard to the BOLD results that I found puzzling. The authors measure the ocular dominance of cortical locations ('surface vertices') but do not want the reader to confuse this with the notion of ocular dominance columns. What, exactly, is the interpretation of reasonably reliable and repeatable measures of ocular preference?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to item #3 in the editorial assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] I have some suggestions for additional information and discussion I would like to see included:</p><p>1) The translucent eye patch used to induce the 2 hours of visual deprivation allowed light to reach the retina, but prevented pattern vision. This patch did not only remove high spatial frequency and orientation information (I assume) but likely also removed phase information from the scene. Is this correct and/or relevant to the present experiments and findings? If so, can the authors discuss what implications this may have had in terms of impact on eye specific processing and brain activity measured presently.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to item #5 in the editorial assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the Materials and methods, it becomes clear that the subjects were not just idly and freely reading or using a computer during the 2 hours of deprivation, as stated in the subsection “Short-term Monocular Deprivation”, but that they underwent retinotopic fMRI &quot;immediately after application of the patch&quot;. What proportion of the 2 hours was spent with the non-deprived eye being stimulated with the high-contrast, broadband stimuli typical of retinotopic mapping? Given the clear demonstration that only 2 hours of monocular form deprivation appears to have significant impact on neural properties in the visual system, could the stimulation received by the non-deprived eye have influenced the outcome obtained here and if so, how?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to item #6 in the editorial assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the fMRI flat maps shown (Figures 1B, 5A), area MT appears to have very few significant voxels. So few in fact, that one wonders how reliable the analyses performed with respect to MT are. Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to item #7 in the editorial assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Are the authors certain that the area they label as MT is truly MT, and not the MT complex, or hMT+?</p></disp-quote><p>It is indeed hMT+ (defined by pooling the MT and MST sub-regions in the Glasser atlas), thank you for pointing this out. This is now stated in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the Results, subsection “Figure 4: Deprivation affects spatial frequency selectivity in V1”, it is claimed that prior to deprivation, the BOLD response in V1 has broad-band selectivity with peak SF around 1 cpd. However, the graph in Figure 4A suggests that the peak is closer to 0.4 to just under 1 cpd. Please fix or discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, this has been revised to “peaking at intermediate SFs, between 0.4 and 1.1 cpd, similar for the two eyes”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the context of both motivating the present study (i.e. in the Introduction) and providing an example of how the present knowledge gained could be applied in the context of a clinical population, reference should be made to keratoconic patients. Much more so than amblyopia, keratoconus develops in early adulthood, well after the end of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. Moreover, just like the deprivation used here, it does not deprive the eye of light, but rather introduces severe optical aberrations, largely to one eye in many cases, filtering out high spatial frequency and phase information. Several excellent studies of neural adaptation to keratoconus have been published (see Sabesan, Yoon and colleagues, among others), at least some of which should be referenced in the present work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.
