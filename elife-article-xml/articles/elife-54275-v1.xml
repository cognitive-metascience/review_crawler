melanin-concentrating hormone-producing (MCH) neurons are co-extensive in the hypothalamus and project throughout the brain to regulate sleep/wakefulness. Ablation of orexin neurons decreases wakefulness and results in a narcolepsy-like phenotype, whereas ablation of MCH neurons increases wakefulness. Since it is unclear how orexin and MCH neurons interact to regulate sleep/wakefulness, we generated transgenic mice in which both orexin and MCH neurons could be ablated. Double-ablated mice exhibited increased wakefulness and decreased both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Double-ablated mice showed severe cataplexy compared with orexin neuron-ablated mice, suggesting that MCH neurons normally suppress cataplexy. Double-ablated mice also showed frequent sleep attacks with elevated spectral power in the delta and theta range, a unique state that we call ‘delta-theta sleep’. Together, these results indicate a functional interaction between orexin and MCH neurons in vivo that suggests the synergistic involvement of these neuronal populations in the sleep/wakefulness cycle.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>narcolepsy</kwd><kwd>orexin/hypocretin neurons</kwd><kwd>mch neurons</kwd><kwd>ablation</kwd><kwd>transgenic

Orexin/hypocretin-(encoded by the <italic>Hcrt</italic> gene) and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH, encoded by the <italic>Pmch</italic> gene)-producing neurons are distributed within the LH; MCH neurons also extend caudally into the zona incerta.

Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mahoney et al., 2019</xref>) caused by the specific degeneration of orexin neurons by the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peyron et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Latorre et al., 2018</xref>). Narcolepsy patients have characteristic symptoms including excessive daytime sleepiness, hallucinations and cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by positive emotions such as laughter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">American Sleep Disorders Association, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgess and Scammell, 2012</xref>). Optogenetic activation of orexin neurons induces wakefulness from sleep while optogenetic inhibition induces sleep from wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamantidis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsunematsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schöne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Williams et al., 2019</xref>). Together, these studies indicate that orexin neurons play an important role in the maintenance of wakefulness and prevent cataplexy induced by positive emotions.</p><p>The neuropeptide MCH was originally isolated from fish pituitary as a substance that controls skin pigmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawauchi et al., 1983</xref>). In mammals, MCH neurons are mainly distributed in the tuberal hypothalamus within which the orexin neurons are also located. Optogenetic activation of MCH neurons increases the total time in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and reduces non-REM (NREM) sleep in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jego and Adamantidis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Konadhode et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsunematsu et al., 2014</xref>). Ablation of MCH neurons promotes wakefulness and decreases time in NREM sleep but has no effect on REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsunematsu et al., 2014</xref>). These observations suggest that MCH neurons are likely involved in the regulation of both NREM and REM sleep. We recently reported that REM sleep-active MCH neurons are involved in memory erasure during REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Izawa et al., 2019</xref>), further supporting the concept that MCH neurons are involved in multiple physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diniz and Bittencourt, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arrigoni et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While the orexin and MCH neurons have different roles in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Konadhode et al., 2014</xref>), they have similar projection areas and receptor distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Trivedi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hervieu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kilduff and de Lecea, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marcus et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saito et al., 2001</xref>). Orexin and MCH neurons have also been reported to interact with each other. For example, application of orexin peptide increases spike frequency in MCH neurons in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van den Pol et al., 2004</xref>) and optogenetic activation of orexin neurons inhibits MCH firing through GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apergis-Schoute et al., 2015</xref>), while MCH reverses hypocretin-1-induced enhancement of action potentials in orexin neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rao et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, it is still unclear how interactions between orexin and MCH neurons contribute to sleep/wake regulation.</p><p>To understand the functional communication between orexin and MCH neurons and sleep/wakefulness regulation, we generated transgenic mice in which both orexin and MCH neurons were simultaneously ablated by tetracycline trans-activator (tTA)-induced expression of the diphtheria toxin A fragment (DTA). Analysis of the sleep patterns of orexin and MCH neuron double-ablated mice (OXMC mice) revealed that these mice exhibited very high levels of cataplexy and sleep/wake abnormalities. OXMC mice had increased wakefulness and profound reductions in REM sleep (particularly during the dark phase) and a corresponding increase in cataplexy, suggesting that MCH neurons have a suppressive role on cataplexy. OXMC mice also frequently showed short episodes of behavioral arrest with high δ and θ power. We defined this unique state as ‘delta-theta sleep’ (DT sleep) since this state was distinct from other states of sleep/wakefulness or cataplexy. Behavioral and pharmacological assessments showed some similarities as well as characteristic differences between DT sleep and cataplexy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dual ablation of orexin and MCH neurons using the tetracycline transactivator (tTA)/TetO system</title><p>We previously reported that <italic>Hcrt-tTA; TetO DTA</italic> (OX) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tabuchi et al., 2014</xref>) or <italic>Pmch-tTA; TetO DTA</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsunematsu et al., 2014</xref>) enabled us to induce specific ablation of orexin neurons or MCH neurons in a timed-controlled manner, respectively. Here, we generated triple transgenic <italic>Hcrt-tTA</italic> (Tg/-)<italic>; Pmch-tTA</italic> (Tg/-); <italic>TetO DTA</italic> (Tg/-) (OXMC) mice to enable simultaneous ablation of both orexin and MCH neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). DTA induces cell death by inactivating eukaryotic elongation factor 2 through ADP ribosylation, thereby blocking protein synthesis. DTA expression can be controlled by the presence or absence of doxycycline (DOX)-containing chow since the Tet-off system is used to control the timing of DTA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

In addition, OXMC DOX(-) mice frequently showed behavioral arrest episodes that were similar to cataplexy (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) but which occurred after a sustained period of wakefulness. However, these behavioral arrest episodes were different from cataplexy based on a number of criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), particularly the EEG, which showed high amplitude spectral power in the δ and θ bandwidths during the behavioral arrests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These episodes were defined as a sudden cessation of motor activity characterized by decreased EMG and relatively high-power ratios of δ and θ in the EEG, preceded by at least 40 s of wakefulness (10 epochs) and followed by a return to wakefulness. The relative power ratio of δ and θ bands during these arrests was significantly different from NREM sleep, REM sleep or cataplexy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>).

Double-ablated mice exhibited pronounced cataplexy and the total time in cataplexy and mean cataplexy bout duration were significantly increased, suggesting that MCH neurons normally have a suppressive role on cataplexy. Double-ablated mice also had exaggerated sleep abnormalities compared to singly-ablated or intact mice; specifically, increased time in wakefulness and decreased time in NREM and REM sleep. Double-ablated mice also exhibited a novel state that we called DT sleep, defined as an episode of sudden behavioral arrest of brief (~15 s) duration preceded by at least 40 s of wake and characterized by high δ and θ power in the EEG. Behavioral, electrophysiological and pharmacological assessments discriminated DT sleep from NREM, REM and cataplexy.</p><p>Cataplexy is well-known to be triggered by strong positive emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mignot, 1998</xref>). Previously we showed that cataplexy is prevented by orexin but not by other co-localized neurotransmitters in the orexin neurons, such as glutamate and dynorphin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chowdhury et al., 2019</xref>). Orexin neuron activity is thought to prevent cataplexy through activation of OX2R when positive emotion occurs since <italic>Hcrt</italic> or <italic>Hcrtr2</italic> gene knockout or ablation of orexin neurons induces cataplexy. The amygdala is implicated in the emotional stimulation that facilitates cataplexy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgess et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hasegawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hasegawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mahoney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Snow et al., 2017</xref>). Neurons in the amygdala project to the brainstem, which is crucial for the regulation of muscle tone and REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wallace et al., 1989</xref>). Serotonergic neurons in the raphe nucleus projecting to the amygdala are thought to be the neural pathway responsible for suppression of cataplexy by orexin neurons, since activation of serotonergic neurons or activation of serotonergic nerve terminals in the amygdala prevents cataplexy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hasegawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hasegawa et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we show that MCH neurons decrease cataplexy duration but not cataplexy bout frequency. This difference might suggest that the mechanism of MCH neurons to prevent cataplexy is different from that of serotonergic neurons.</p><p>Our in situ hybridization results as well as previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mickelsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mickelsen et al., 2019</xref>) suggest that both orexin and MCH neurons are glutamatergic neurons. Among LH glutamatergic neurons, these two types of neurons are a relatively minor population (the proportion of MCH neurons and orexin neurons was 15% and 24%, respectively). These results suggest that ablation of a small number of additional LH glutamatergic neurons (10–15%) that co-express MCH exacerbates the narcolepsy phenotype in orexin neuron-ablated mice, underscoring the important role of MCH neurons to suppress cataplexy.</p><p>Neurons in the amygdala innervate and suppress the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey (vlPAG/LPT), DR, LC and tuberomammilary nucleus (TMN), areas that are known to be involved in the regulation of REM sleep or cataplexy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgess et al., 2013</xref>). It has been reported that MCH neurons also inhibit DR, LC, TMN and vlPAG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Torterolo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sapin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Del Cid-Pellitero and Jones, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jego et al., 2013</xref>). These areas might be part of the neural circuit contributing to cataplexy prevention since MCH neurons may innervate different types of neurons in these areas. Alternatively, other downstream targets of MCH neurons such as the sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus might be involved in the regulation of cataplexy and REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boissard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Monti et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, chemogenetic activation of MCH neurons in <italic>Hcrt</italic> knockout mice was shown to increase cataplexy bout duration without affecting the number of bouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Naganuma et al., 2018</xref>), a finding that is inconsistent with our results. However, the absence of orexin during development in constitutive <italic>Hcrt</italic> knockout mice might induce compensatory changes in neural circuitry, since <italic>Hcrt</italic> knockout mice have many fewer cataplexy bouts per night than DTA mice in which orexin neurons are ablated after maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tabuchi et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, the chemogenetic activation paradigm used by Naganuma et al. could have induced strong activation of MCH cells above the physiological range. Recently, we reported that MCH neurons can be divided in three types by activation pattern: wake-active, REM-active and wake- and REM-active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Izawa et al., 2019</xref>). Activation of wake-active MCH neurons within the physiological range in orexin neuron-ablated mice would likely be valuable to further understand the role of MCH neurons in cataplexy.</p><p>Orexin- and MCH-neurons double-ablated mice frequently displayed brief (~15 s) episodes of behavioral arrest during wakefulness that we called DT sleep, which was characterized by high power δ and θ waves in the EEG with low EMG amplitude. The first appearance of DT sleep was at 1 week DOX(-), which was sooner after DOX removal than the appearance of cataplexy at 2 weeks and suggests that DT sleep may be due to a smaller reduction in the number of orexin and MCH neurons. When initially observed, we assumed that DT sleep was cataplexy since both behaviors shared the characteristic of sudden behavioral arrest during wakefulness. However, the EEG spectrum was clearly distinct from cataplexy. Another critical difference between DT sleep and cataplexy was that mice responded to tactile stimulation by immediately returning to wakefulness from DT sleep but not from cataplexy. Furthermore, the behavioral arrest of DT sleep was observed without complete muscle atonia; thus, mice could maintain posture during DT sleep. This observation underscores the difference between DT sleep and cataplexy, since muscle atonia is an indispensable component of cataplexy.</p><p>Pharmacological assessments further confirmed differences between DT sleep and cataplexy. Chocolate is known to increase cataplexy by activating the prefrontal cortex and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgess et al., 2013</xref>). Chocolate increased cataplexy in double-ablated mice, but did not increase DT sleep. Clomipramine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor that can inhibit REM sleep and cataplexy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Willie et al., 2003</xref>). Clomipramine significantly decreased cataplexy in double-ablated mice, but did not affect the number of bouts or mean bout duration of DT sleep. Modafinil is known to be a dopamine reuptake inhibitor that can promote wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Willie et al., 2005</xref>). Although modafinil significantly increased wakefulness, decreased NREM sleep and decreased the duration of DT sleep, the number of DT bouts was unaffected. Based on these results, DT sleep is classified as sleep but is distinct from NREM or REM sleep. Modafinil decreased the duration of DT sleep and DT sleep was often observed after grooming behavior, suggesting that dopaminergic neurons might be involved in the initiation of DT sleep since dopaminergic neurons are activated during grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fornaguera et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cromwell et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The transition from NREM to REM sleep is well known to be characterized by relatively high power in δ and θ waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benington et al., 1994</xref>). Thus, we compared DT sleep to the transition from NREM to REM sleep. We found that δ, θ, α and β wave power were not significantly different between DT sleep and NREM to REM sleep transitions. The activity of orexin neurons is high in wakefulness and low in NREM and REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). In comparison, the activity of MCH neurons is high in REM sleep and low in NREM sleep and wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hassani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanco-Centurion et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Izawa et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the minimum activity of these two types of neurons should occur just before initiation of REM sleep. It is possible that this transition might be manifest as DT sleep, since the brains of dual orexin- and MCH neuron-ablated mice are similar to conditions in which both orexin neurons and MCH neurons are inactive. Furthermore, NREM and REM sleep were attenuated in double-ablated mice, suggesting that DT sleep enables a compensatory role of both NREM and REM sleep. Whereas the loss of orexin neurons in narcolepsy has been proposed to disrupt a ‘flip/flop switch’ that facilitates the normal transition from wakefulness to sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saper et al., 2001</xref>), the dual loss of orexin and MCH neurons appears to prolong the normal transition from NREM to REM sleep through the DT sleep state.</p><p>To date, specific degeneration of MCH neurons has not been reported in humans. Ablation of MCH neurons in mice induces a relatively weaker effect on sleep and wakefulness compared with ablation of orexin neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tabuchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsunematsu et al., 2014</xref>). MCH concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is not typically measured in sleep disorders patients. However, a patient with hypersomnia had low concentrations of both orexin (95 pg/ml) and MCH peptide (6 pg/ml) in the cerebrospinal fluid (Wada et al., Japan sleep annual meeting 2018, P-128). Detailed study of this and similar cases will help to understand the role of MCH neurons on sleep/wakefulness in humans.</p><p>Here, we revealed a new role of MCH neurons to prevent cataplexy and regulate sleep and wakefulness. Orexin neurons and MCH neurons interact in the hypothalamus and potentially in terminal projection sites to influence sleep/wake control. Since human studies have already suggested interaction between these two systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blouin et al., 2013</xref>), further investigations are warranted to reveal the regulatory mechanisms underlying the roles of these two systems in the control of sleep/wakefulness and cataplexy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Hcrt-tTA</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tabuchi et al., 2014</xref></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_APB:7778">IMSR_APB:7778</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Pmch-tTA</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsunematsu et al., 2014</xref></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_RBRC05844">IMSR_RBRC05844</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>TetO DTA</italic></td><td>Jackson lab</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:008468">IMSR_JAX:008468</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Hcrt-tTA;TetO DTA</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tabuchi et al., 2014</xref></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5583048">MGI:5583048</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Hcrt-tTA;

Carprofen (Zoetis Inc, Japan), 20 mg/kg (subcutaneous injection), was administered the day of, and the day after, surgery for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. After surgery, mice were housed separately for about 7 days for recovery. A cable with a slip ring (Kissei Comtec Co., Ltd, Japan) was connected to mice in the cage for 7 days before the initiation of EEG and EMG recordings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Sleep/wake recordings</title><p>EEG and EMG signals were filtered at EEG 1.5–30 Hz and at EMG 15–300 Hz and amplified by an amplifier (AB-610J, Nihon Koden, Japan). The digital sampling rate was 128 Hz. Animal behavior was monitored through a Charged Coupled Device (CCD) video camera (SPK-E700CHP1, Keiyo Techno, Japan) and an infrared activity sensor (Kissei Comtec). All EEG and EMG data were recorded by VitalRecorder (Kissei Comtec) and analyzed by SleepSign software (Kissei Comtec).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title>Vigilance state analysis</title><p>EEG analysis was performed by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Power spectra profiles over a 0–10 Hz window with 1 Hz resolution for δ (1 ≤ δ &lt;6 Hz) and θ (6 ≤ θ &lt;11 Hz) bandwidths were calculated. EEG and EMG were automatically screened in 4 s epochs by SleepSign and classified as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsunematsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tabuchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsunematsu et al., 2014</xref>). Wake was characterized by high EMG amplitude or locomotion score with low EEG amplitude, NREM sleep was characterized by low EMG amplitude and high EEG δ power, and REM sleep was characterized by low EMG and low EEG amplitude with over 50% of θ activity. Cataplexy was defined by muscle atonia lasting more than 10 s after more than 40 s of wakefulness, and low amplitude with over 50% of θ activity in the EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scammell et al., 2009</xref>). DT sleep was defined by the following criteria: (1) a period of behavioral arrest, (2) that was preceded by at least 40 s of wakefulness, (3) characterized by high δ and θ power (at least 60–80% of the δ power found in NREM sleep) in the EEG, (4) low EMG activity, and (5) was terminated by a return to wakefulnes. Vigilance state classifications were automatically assigned by SleepSign software and then visually corrected. The transition from NREM to REM sleep was identified as the three epochs (12 s) before a REM sleep bout. EEG power spectral density were analyzed and viewed using the Signal Processing Toolbox of Matlab (Mathworks, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-6"><title>Behavioral assessment</title><p>Behaviors were manually identified from video recordings.

After freezing in embedding solution at −80°C, embedded brains were sectioned at 25 µm thickness and mounted on glass slides. The slides were then treated with RNAscope multiplex fluorescent v2 (#323100, Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA) according to the RNAscope standard protocol. Briefly, slides were incubated with hydrogen peroxide at RT for 10 min, followed by boiling with target retrieval reagent at 98 ~ 102°C for 5 min, and protease digestion (Protease III) at 40°C in an HybEZ hybridization oven (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) for 30 min. Subsequently, slides were incubated at 40°C with target probes for 2 hr and slides were then washed in wash buffer (WB) twice (2 min each) at room temperature. Sections were then incubated in AMP1 buffer for 30 min, AMP2 buffer for 30 min, and AMP3 buffer for 15 min. After each hybridization step, slides were washed twice in WB. For fluorescent detection, the RNA probes were conjugated to Opal 520 or 620 with the TSA Plus Fluorescence system (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Slices were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). One fourth of brain slices were randomly chosen from 5 mice for four in situ hybridization combinations, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.

Specifically, MCH neuron-ablated mice increased wakefulness and decreased NREM sleep without affecting REM sleep amount (Tabuchi et al., 2014) and also improved retention hippocampus-dependent memories (Izawa et al., 2019). These facts suggest that MCH neurons have multiple roles in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness and memory.</p><p>Regarding the possibility of humans with degeneration of both orexin and MCH neurons: this suggestion is based on a collaboration with clinical investigators that is beyond the scope of the present study. Although the results have not yet been published, a patient with hypersomnia that had low concentrations of both orexin (95 pg/ml) and MCH peptide (6 pg/ml) in the CSF was reported (Wada et al., 2018).</p><p>We modified the sentence in the Discussion as follows:</p><p>â€œHowever, a patient with hypersomnia had low concentrations of both orexin (95 pg/ml) and MCH peptide (6 pg/ml) in the cerebrospinal fluid (Wada et al., 2018).

Based on Mickelsen et al., (Mickelsen et al., 2017; Mickelsen et al., 2019), MCH neurons express Glutamate decarboxylase 1 (Gad1) but not vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT). In addition, MCH neurons express vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGlut2). This means that, although MCH neurons are able to produce GABA, they do not release GABA; rather, they release glutamate. We confirmed this using RNAscope in situ hybridization to label MCH, orexin, vGAT and vGlut2. Figure 1—figure supplement 1 indicate that most MCH neurons and orexin neurons co-localize vGlut2 (MCH neurons: 96.3 ± 3.1%, n=4; orexin neurons: 99.6 ± 0.2%, n=5) but not vGAT (MCH neurons: 5.1 ± 0.9%, n=4; orexin neurons: 1.7 ± 0.9%, n=3), suggesting that most of MCH and orexin neurons are glutamatergic neurons rather than GABAergic neurons. In the center of lateral hypothalamic area (indicated by dashed circle in the pictures), MCH neurons and orexin neurons are a minor subset of the entire glutamatergic neuron population (MCH neurons: 14.6 ± 2.4% (n=4); orexin neurons: 23.6 ± 3.2% (n=5)). These results suggest that ablation of a small number (10-15%) of additional MCH/glutamatergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area exacerbated narcolepsy phenotypes in orexin neuron-ablated mice. Although it would be very difficult to ablate a similar number of glutamatergic non-MCH neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, we believe that these facts emphasize the important role of MCH neurons to suppress cataplexy.</p><p>We added the following sentences in the Results section and Discussion section.</p><p>Results section</p><p>&quot;In situ hybridization confirmed that MCH neurons and orexin neurons coexpressed vGlut2 mRNA but not vGAT mRNA. Figure 1—figure supplement 1 indicates that most MCH and orexin neurons are co-localized with vGlut2 (MCH neurons: 96.3 ± 3.1%, n=4; orexin neurons: 99.6 ± 0.2%, n=5) but not with vGAT (MCH neurons: 5.1 ± 0.9%, n=4; orexin neurons: 1.7 ± 0.9%, n=3), suggesting that most MCH and orexin neurons are glutamatergic rather than GABAergic neurons as also suggested by others (Mickelsen et al., 2017; Mickelsen et al., 2019). In the center of the LH (indicated by dotted circle), MCH neurons and orexin neurons were a relatively minor subset of the glutamatergic neuron population (MCH neurons: 14.6 ± 2.4% (n=4); orexin neurons: 23.6 ± 3.2% (n=5)).&quot;</p><p>Discussion section</p><p>&quot;Our in situ hybridization results as well as previous reports (Mickelsen et al., 2017; Mickelsen et al., 2019) suggest that both orexin and MCH neurons are glutamatergic neurons. Among LH glutamatergic neurons, these two types of neurons are a relatively minor population (the proportion of MCH neurons and orexin neurons was 15% and 24%, respectively). These results suggest that ablation of a small number of additional LH glutamatergic neurons (10-15%) that co-express MCH exacerbates the narcolepsy phenotype in orexin neuronablated mice, underscoring the important role of MCH neurons to suppress cataplexy.&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
