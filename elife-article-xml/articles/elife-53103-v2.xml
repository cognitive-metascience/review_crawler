Previously, we showed that a group of octopaminergic (OA) neurons mediated starvation-induced hyperactivity, an important aspect of food-seeking behavior (Yu et al., 2016). Here we find that HFD specifically enhances this behavior. Mechanistically, HFD increases the excitability of these OA neurons to a hunger hormone named adipokinetic hormone (AKH), via increasing the accumulation of AKH receptor (AKHR) in these neurons. Upon HFD, excess dietary lipids are transported by a lipoprotein LTP to enter these OA<sup>+</sup>AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons via the cognate receptor LpR1, which in turn suppresses autophagy-dependent degradation of AKHR. Taken together, we uncover a mechanism that links HFD, neuronal autophagy, and starvation-induced hyperactivity, providing insight in the reshaping of neural circuitry under metabolic challenges and the progression of metabolic diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>foraging</kwd><kwd>octopamine</kwd><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>AKHR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31522026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Liming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31800883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Rui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFA0802400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Liming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFA0801900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Liming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010871</institution-id><institution>Thousand Talents Plan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Liming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016QN81010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Liming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015XZZX004-33</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Liming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019CDYGYB009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Rui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fruit flies fed with high-fats diets are hyper-sensitive to a hunger hormone AKH and exhibit enhanced food-seeking behavior when starved.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity and obesity-associated metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases have become a global epidemic. Chronic over-nutrition, especially excessive intake of dietary lipids, is one of the leading causes of these metabolic disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bray and Popkin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hill et al., 2000</xref>). Accumulating evidence has shown that HFD imposes adverse effects on the physiology and metabolism of liver, skeletal muscle, the adipose tissue, and the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dietrich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gómez-Pérez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shimobayashi et al., 2018</xref>). It is therefore of importance to understand the mechanisms underlying HFD-induced changes in different organs and cell types, which will offer critical insight into the diagnosis and treatment of obesity and other metabolic diseases.</p><p>The central nervous system plays a critical role in regulating energy intake and expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao and Horvath, 2007</xref>). In rodent models, neurons located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, particularly neurons expressing Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Agouti-Related Neuropeptide (AgRP) or those expressing Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), are important behavioral and metabolic regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belgardt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ollmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stanley and Leibowitz, 1984</xref>). These neurons detect various neural and hormonal cues such as circulating glucose and fatty acids, leptin, and ghrelin, and modulate energy intake and expenditure accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belgardt et al., 2009</xref>). Upon the reduction of the internal energy state, NPY/AgRP neurons are activated and exert a robust orexigenic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belgardt et al., 2009</xref>). Genetic ablation of NPY/AgRP neurons in neonatal mice completely abolishes food consumption whereas acute activation of these neurons significantly enhances food consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aponte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>). NPY/AgRP neurons also antagonize the function of POMC neurons that plays a suppressive role on food consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roseberry et al., 2004</xref>). Taken together, these two groups of neurons, among other neuronal populations, work in synergy to ensure a refined balance between energy intake and expenditure, and hence organismal metabolism.</p><p>In spite of their critical roles, the function of the nervous system to accurately regulate appetite and metabolism may be disrupted by sustained metabolic stress, resulting in eating disorders and various metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Several lines of evidence have begun to reveal the underlying neural mechanisms. For example, HFD increases the intrinsic excitability of orexigenic NPY/AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vernia et al., 2016</xref>), induces leptin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mazor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Olofsson et al., 2013</xref>), and enhances their inhibitory innervations with anorexigenic POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Newton et al., 2013</xref>), altogether resulting in hypersensitivity to starvation and increased food consumption. Interestingly, besides HFD, other metabolic challenges, including maternal HFD, alcohol consumption, as well as aging, also disrupt normal food intake via affecting the excitability and/or innervation of NPY/AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cains et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Füredi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rivera et al., 2015</xref>). All these interventions may contribute to the onset and progression of metabolic disorders.</p><p>Before the actual food consumption, food-seeking behavior is a critical yet largely overlooked behavioral component for the localization and occupation of desirable food sources. Food-seeking behavior has been characterized in rodent models, primarily by the elevation of locomotor activity and increased food approach of starved animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davidson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mistlberger, 2011</xref>). It has been reported that NPY/AgRP neurons also play a role in food-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aponte et al., 2011</xref>). However, to ensure adequate food intake, food seeking and food consumption are temporally and spatially separated and even reciprocally inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). It remains largely unclear how the neural circuitry of food seeking and food consumption segregated and independently regulated in rodent models. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether HFD also affects food seeking, and if so whether its effects on both food seeking and food consumption share common mechanisms or not. To fully understand the intervention of energy homeostasis by sustained metabolic stress, we need to dissect the neural circuitry underlying food seeking and examine whether and how it is affected by HFD.</p><p>Fruit flies <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> share fundamental analogy to vertebrate counterparts on the regulation of energy homeostasis and organismal metabolism despite that they diverged several hundred million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pandey and Nichols, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rajan and Perrimon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reiter et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, it offers a good model to characterize food-seeking behavior in depth and provides insight into the regulation of energy intake and the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders in more complex organisms such as rodents and human.</p><p>Our previous work showed that fruit flies exhibited robust starvation-induced hyperactivity that was directed towards the localization and acquisition of food sources, therefore resembling an important aspect of food-seeking behavior upon starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). We also identified a small subset of OA neurons in the fly brain that specifically regulated starvation-induced hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). Analogous to mammalian systems, a number of neural and hormonal cues are involved in the systemic control of nutrient metabolism and food intake in fruit flies. Among them, Neuropeptide F (NPF), short NPF (sNPF), Leucokinin, and Allatostatin A (AstA), have been shown to regulate food consumption, all of which have known mammalian homologs that regulate food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pool and Scott, 2014</xref>). In particular, starvation-induced hyperactivity is regulated by two classes of neuroendocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). One is functionally analogous to pancreatic α cells and produce AKH upon starvation, whereas the other produces <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like peptides (DILPs), resembling the function of pancreatic β cells. These two classes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> hormones exert antagonistic functions on starvation-induced hyperactivity via the same group of OA neurons in the fly brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Based on these findings, we therefore sought to examine whether HFD disrupted the regulation of starvation-induced hyperactivity in fruit flies and aimed to investigate the underlying mechanism. In this present study, we found that HFD-fed flies became significantly more sensitive to starvation and exhibited starvation-induced hyperactivity earlier and stronger than flies fed with normal diet (ND). Meanwhile, HFD did not alter flies’ food consumption, suggesting that starvation-induced hyperactivity and food consumption are independently affected by HFD. Several days of HFD treatment did not alter the production of important hormonal cues like AKH and DILPs, but rather increased the sensitivity of the OA neurons that regulated starvation-induced hyperactivity to the hunger hormone AKH. In these OA neurons, constitutive autophagy maintained the homeostasis of AKHR protein, which determined their sensitivity to AKH and hence starvation. HFD feeding suppressed neuronal autophagy via AMPK-TOR signaling and in turn increased the level of AKHR in these OA neurons. Consistently, eliminating autophagy in these neurons mimicked the effect of HFD on starvation-induced hyperactivity whereas promoting autophagy inhibited the induction of hyperactivity by starvation. Furthermore, we also showed that a specific lipoprotein LTP and its cognate receptor LpR1 likely mediated the effect of HFD on the neuronal autophagy of OA neurons and hence its effect on starvation-induced hyperactivity. Taken together, we uncovered a novel mechanism that linked HFD, AMPK-TOR signaling, neuronal autophagy, and starvation-induced hyperactivity, shedding crucial light on the reshaping of neural circuitry under metabolic stress and the progression of metabolic diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HFD specifically enhanced starvation-induced hyperactivity</title><p>We previously reported that starvation induced hyperactivity in fruit flies (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>). In this present study, we first confirmed that starvation-induced hyperactivity was a behavioral trait observed across different wild-type fly strains, though its magnitude might differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, the timing of the onset of starvation-induced hyperactivity might differ across different wild-type strains, too. In some strains the response started in Day 1 after starvation while some started in Day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that starvation-induced hyperactivity is a common behavioral phenomenon albeit considerable variabilities.</p><p>We then asked whether HFD affected starvation-induced hyperactivity in fruit flies. Flies were fed with ND or HFD (by adding 20% coconut oil in ND) for five consecutive days before tested in a locomotion assay that measured the frequency to cross the midline of tubes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Activity Monitor System (DAMS, Trikinetics) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). The midline-crossing frequency assayed by DAMS offered a reliable measure of flies’ locomotor activity and hence starvation-induced hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). ND-fed flies exhibited a robust increase in locomotion upon starvation in both Day 1 and Day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, E–F and H–I</xref>, blue). Compared to ND-fed flies, flies fed with HFD exhibited further enhanced hyperactivity upon starvation in both days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, E–F and H–I</xref>, orange). Meanwhile, the baseline activity of fed flies was not affected by HFD feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B, D and G</xref>). These results suggest that HFD-fed flies are behaviorally more sensitive to starvation. We also compared the effect of adding 5%, 10%, and 20% coconut oil in ND and found that the effect of HFD to enhance starvation-induced hyperactivity was dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HFD promotesstarvation-induced hyperactivity in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Wild-type <italic>Oregon-R</italic> virgin female flies fed with normal fly food (A, ND, blue) or high-fat diet (B, HFD, orange) were assayed in the presence (dark color) and absence (light color) of 5% sucrose using DAMS-based locomotion assay (n = 46–63).

These data further confirm that HFD feeding enhanced starvation-induced food seeking.</p><p>We then examined what specific aspect of HFD food induced such behavioral changes. We added three types of dietary lipid, coconut oil, soybean oil, and lard, in ND. Coconut oil and lard, which were rich in saturated fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Segarra et al., 2002</xref>), significantly enhanced starvation-induced hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). In contrast, soybean oil, which was mostly unsaturated fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henkel et al., 2018</xref>), did not affect starvation-induced hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). High-sugar diet (HSD) did not enhance starvation-induced hyperactivity, either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). These results suggest that excess intake of dietary saturated fat may be the cause of the observed behavioral change.</p><p>We also asked whether HFD feeding modulated other starvation-induced behavioral changes, especially food consumption. In contrast, ND-fed and HFD-fed flies exhibited comparable feeding activity in the FLIC assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ro et al., 2014</xref>) and the BARCODE assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>).

One possible explanation was that HFD might decrease flies’ energy storage and/or increase flies’ energy expenditure, reducing their resistence to starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, flies’ body weight was not affected by HFD, and their lipid storage was actually significantly elevated by HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L and M</xref>), a likely consequence of the uptake of more nutritious food, HFD. The energy expenditure of flies was not affected by HFD. Evidently, when fed ad libitum, the CO<sub>2</sub> production of HFD-fed and ND-fed flies was comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that HFD-fed flies are behaviorally more sensitive to starvation despite their elevated energy storage.</p><p>Consistently, upon 24 hr starvation, the body weight and lipid storage of both ND-fed and HFD-fed flies decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O and P</xref>), whereas the food consumption of these two groups of flies increased in the MAFE assay, in comparable manners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q</xref>, note that flies exhibited no food ingestion in the MAFE assay when fed ad libitum) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qi et al., 2015</xref>).

AKHR protein levels in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons are well maintained via protein expression and autophagic protein degradation. Under ND feeding, starvation induces the expression and release of AKH, which in turn activates AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons and hence the release of OA. OA signaling promotes starvation-induced hyperactivity in these starved flies. Upon HFD feeding, however, the regulation of starvation-induced hyperactivity is disrupted and greatly enhanced. Mechanistically, LTP delivers excess dietary lipids to AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons via its cognate receptor LpR1. Subsequently, neuronal autophagy is suppressed in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons via AMPK-TOR signaling, which leads to AKHR accumulation. As a result, AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons become hyper sensitive to AKH and therefore starvation-induced hyperactivity is enhanced.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig8sdata1"><label>Figure 8—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Raw data of the behavioral experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-53103-fig8-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53103-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We then asked whether diet-independent hyperlipidemia had similar effects on AKHR accumulation and starvation-induced hyperactivity as HFD feeding.

But the effect of HFD on another critical food intake related behavior, food seeking, remains largely uncharacterized. Conceptually, food-seeking behavior in the fruit fly is composed of two behavioral components, increased sensitivity to food cues, and enhanced exploratory locomotion, which altogether facilitates the localization and acquisition of desirable food sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Root et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). Previous work from our lab has shown that starvation promotes starvation-induced hyperactivity, the exploratory component of food-seeking behavior, via a small group of OA neurons in the fly brain. These hunger-sensing OA neurons sample the metabolic status by detecting two groups of functionally antagonistic hormones, AKH and DILPs, and promote starvation-induced hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this present study, we demonstrated that this behavior was compromised by metabolic challenges. After a few days of HFD feeding, flies became behaviorally hypersensitive to starvation and as a result their starvation-induced hyperactivity was greatly enhanced, despite that their food intake and expenditure were not affected. These results suggest that HFD feeding may specifically modulate the activity of the neural circuitry underlying starvation-induced hyperactivity and offer us an opportunity to further elucidate the cellular and circuitry mechanisms underlying behavioral abnormalities upon metabolic challenges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>).</p><p>As an insect counterpart of mammalian glucagon, AKH acts as a hunger signal to activate its cognate receptor AKHR expressed in the fat body and subsequently triggers lipid mobilization and energy allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bharucha et al., 2008</xref>). In the fly brain, a small number of OA neurons also express AKHR. We and other labs have shown that these neurons are responsive to starvation and modulate various behaviors including food seeking and drinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jourjine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). In that sense, these OA<sup>+</sup>AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons are functionally analogous to mammalian NPY/AgRP neurons in the hypothalamus, which also senses organismal metabolic states and regulates specific food intake behaviors. In this present study, we found that OA<sup>+</sup>AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons exhibited higher AKHR protein accumulation and became hypersensitive to AKH after HFD feeding. Notably, HFD feeding in mammals also increases the excitability of NPY/AgRP neurons, which contributes to the hypersensitivity to starvation and increased food consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vernia et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, HFD may exert a conserved effect in the regulation of neuronal excitability and food intake related behaviors in both fruit flies and mammals.</p><p>Autophagy, a lysosomal degradative process that maintains cellular homeostasis, is critical for energy homeostasis. Upon cellular starvation, autophagy generates additional energy supply by breaking down macromolecules and subcellular organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klionsky, 2007</xref>). At the organismal level, autophagy also contributes to the regulation of food intake and hence organismal energy homeostasis. For example, fasting induces autophagy in NPY/AgRP neurons via fatty acid uptake and promotes AgRP expression, which in turn enhances food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaushik et al., 2011</xref>). In line with these results, eliminating autophagy in NPY/AgRP neurons reduces food intake and hence body weight and fat deposits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaushik et al., 2011</xref>). Conversely, loss of autophagy in POMC neurons displays increased food intake and adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coupé et al., 2012</xref>).

In this present study, we showed that HFD suppressed neuronal autophagy in OA<sup>+</sup>AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons and enhanced AKHR accumulation in these neurons.

It will be of interest to examine whether HFD also reduces autophagy and increases the accumulation of specific membrane receptors in mammalian NPY/AgRP neurons.</p><p>We also sought to examine the cellular mechanism that linked HFD feeding to the reduction of autophagy. We found that HFD feeding activated TOR signaling. TOR, a highly conserved serine-threonine kinase, controls numerous anabolic cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Proud, 2007</xref>). We found in this present study that TOR signaling was tightly associated with the activity of AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons and the behavioral responses upon HFD feeding. Genetic enhancement of TOR activity in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons increased AKHR protein accumulation, the sensitivity of these neurons to AKH, and hence starvation-induced hyperactivity, all of which mimicked the effect of HFD feeding. Inhibiting TOR activity exerted an opposite effect. In addition, we also found that the effect of HFD on TOR signaling was mediated by AMPK signaling. These results altogether suggest that AMPK-TOR signaling in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of these neurons and determining the responsiveness to HFD feeding. Similarly, rodent studies have shown that manipulating AMPK-TOR signaling results in the dysfunction of NPY/AgRP neurons as well as POMC neurons, which leads to abnormal food consumption and adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). It will be of interest to examine whether HFD also modulates AMPK-TOR signaling in these specific hypothalamic neurons.</p><p>We next sought to understand how AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons detected HFD, or more specifically, excess lipid ingested by the flies. As an essential nutrient and important energy reserve, dietary lipids were transported via their carrier proteins, named lipoproteins, in the circulation system and regulated multiple cellular signaling pathways. Proteomic analysis helped us to identify that one lipoprotein LTP was enriched in flies’ hemolymph after HFD feeding. Single-cell RNAseq of AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons identified a number of lipoprotein receptors, especially LpR1, highly expressed in these neurons. Therefore, we proposed that AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons might sense HFD feeding via LTP-LpR1 signaling. Evidently, we found that eliminating LpR1 in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons could protect flies from HFD, reducing AKHR accumulation and abolishing the effect of HFD to enhance starvation-induced hyperactivity. Conversely, eliminating LpR1 in the fat body, the major lipid reservoir of flies, created diet-independent hyperlipidemia and mimicked the effect of HFD feeding on flies’ starvation-induced hyperactivity. Taken together, we propose a working model that upon HFD feeding, excess dietary lipids are transported by LTP in the hemolymph, which interacts with its cognate receptor LpR1 in OA<sup>+</sup>AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons. As a result, these neurons undergo a number of cellular signaling processes and eventually become hypersensitive to starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>).</p><p>To summarize, our present study establishes a link between an unhealthy diet and abnormalities of food intake related behaviors in a model organism. We also decipher the underlying mechanism involving intracellular AMPK-TOR signaling, reduced neuronal autophagy, accumulation of a specific hormone receptor, and increased excitability of a small group of hunger-sensing neurons. Our study will shed crucial light on the pathological changes in the central nervous system upon metabolic challenges. Given that the central control of metabolism and food intake related behaviors are highly conserved across different species, it will be of importance to further examine whether similar mechanisms also mediate the effect of HFD feeding on food intake and metabolic diseases in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td> <italic>UAS-TOR<sup>TED</sup></italic></td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila </italic>Stock Center</td><td>Cat. #7013;

Steps of the pathway are investigated, using many experimental approaches. The authors found the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on starvation-induced hyperactivity in flies, and further dissected the molecular mechanisms of it using various approaches such as behavioral analysis, calcium imaging, pharmacological studies, single-cell sequencing, etc. They identified an HFD-AMPK-TOR-autophagy-AKHR candidate pathway underlying HFD-enhanced starvation-induced hyperactivity. The pathway that emerges is analogous to corresponding pathways in mammals at several steps, but some steps have not been described in mammals and may provide a useful guide to those studying mammalian metabolism. Overall the work represents a valuable contribution to the field. However, several improvements on the experiments and manuscript could be made to make this study more solid and better interpreted. The concerns are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The behavioral output that is measured here is hyperactivity, not food-seeking. An earlier paper by these authors (Yang et al., 2015) provided some evidence that this hyperactivity is related to food-seeking. However, the present paper shows that a high-fat diet (HFD) did not alter flies' food consumption or energy expenditure. The significance of hyperactivity needs more discussion.</p><p>2) The major interest of this study is to dissect the mechanisms underlying HFD-enhanced starvation-induced hyperactivity. In this context, there are two variables for this behavioral output: HFD comparing with ND (normal diet), and starvation (ST) comparing with feeding (FED). The authors used Daily crossings (x1,000) to measure the FED activity, and used ST/FED to measure starvation-induced hyperactivity. As the most important measurement, a detailed description of the calculation method of ST/FED should be made in the manuscript. Is it referring to the ratio of daily crossings between ST and FED, under ZT0-ZT24?</p><p>3) The authors show that flies exhibit comparable feeding activity on HFD and a ND. If the HFD is more calorically dense, does this mean that their caloric intake is higher? If so, is this a confounding variable?</p><p>4) In Figure 2, the authors suggest that HFD enhances starvation-induced hyperactivity through AKHR based on two results: (1) AKHR protein expression was increased in HFD flies at FED status; (2) AKHR neurons are more sensitive to AKH in HFD flies.</p><p>More evidences are needed to make this statement more convincing. For example:</p><p>a) What's the AKHR protein level under ST in HFD and ND flies comparing with FED?</p><p>b) What's the phenotype of <italic>AKHR<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies fed with HFD under starvation?</p><p>c) What's the effect of silencing/activation AKHR neurons on this HFD enhanced starvation-induced hyperactivity?</p><p>5) Much of the activity data is presented as a ratio of Starved/Fed. To help interpret this ratio it would be useful to see the Starved values separately.</p><p>6) In Figure 4F, the blockage of AKHR&gt;ATG-5 RNAi on the ST/FED change between ND and FED seems to be majorly caused by a huge and significant increase of ST/FED at ND comparing with the control groups, but not a decrease of ST/FED at HFD, which makes the conclusion of HFD enhancing ST/FED through autophagy less convincing. Is autophagy blockage affecting starvation-induced hyperactivity under ND rather than affecting starvation-induced hyperactivity under HFD? And the way the statistical difference being labeled in this kind of graphs is also confusing: are the authors comparing the 1st bar with the 3rd bar, or comparing the red group with the blue group?</p><p>7) Is the pathway AMPK-TOR-autophagy-AKHR an HFD specific pathway or a ND/HFD common pathway? As shown in Figure 6F, TOR inhibition also significantly decreased ST/FED under ND. Is HFD enhancing a ND starvation-induced hyperactivity pathway?</p><p>8) The statistical difference in Figure 1I and Figure 7D is similar, but the interpretation is quite different. In Figure 1I, the difference between ND and HFD is neglected, described as &quot;One possible explanation was that HFD might decrease flies' energy storage and/or increase flies' energy expenditure, reducing their resistance to starvation (Figure 1C). It seemed unlikely, since flies' body weight was not affected by HFD and their lipid storage was actually slightly elevated by HFD (Figure 1H and I).&quot;, while in Figure 7D, the difference is confirmed, described as &quot;Meanwhile, both triglycerides and cholesterol were enriched in the hemolymph of HFD-fed flies (Figure 7C-D). Therefore, it was possible that LTP was the major carrier for excess circulating lipids after HFD feeding.&quot; This is kind of selective interpretation.</p><p>9) Subsection “HFD enhanced AKHR accumulation by suppressing neuronal autophagy”: the body of the text should explain why the ratio of GFP-ATG8 I and II is a measure of autophagy, and a reference should be provided.</p><p>10) Dosage of AKH in Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments: Figure 2K shows that HFD-fed flies exhibited more robust calcium transients than ND-fed flies when stimulated with AKH, but the experiment shows doses only up to 31.6 μM. In subsequent experiments, such as Figure 4A, it seems that 3.16 mM was used. This needs to be commented on. Also, the line graphs in Figure 2K are misleading – there is no 3.16 μM dose so the x-axis is not uniform in scale.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53103.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The behavioral output that is measured here is hyperactivity, not food-seeking.

Besides showing that HFD-feeding enhanced starvation-induced hyperactivity (Figure 1), we have now added more direct measure of food-seeking behavior in the manuscript. As shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 3, starved flies were allowed to explore in a behavioral chamber with the presence of food sources. HFD-fed flies exhibited higher walking speed during the exploration period, and shorter latency to locate and occupy the food sources. These data further support the notion that HFD-feeding enhanced food-seeking behavior. We have also added more discussions in the main text (subsection “HFD specifically enhanced starvation-induced hyperactivity”, third paragraph).</p><p>We have also shown in our previous studies (Yang et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2016) that starvation-induced hyperactivity and starvation-induced increase in food consumption were regulated independently, aka manipulations that altered starvation-induced hyperactivity did not affect food consumption. Therefore, our current results that HFD feeding enhanced hyperactivity without altering food consumption are in line with our previous work. We have added more discussions in the manuscript (see the fifth paragraph of the aforementioned subsection).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The major interest of this study is to dissect the mechanisms underlying HFD-enhanced starvation-induced hyperactivity.

If the HFD is more calorically dense, does this mean that their caloric intake is higher? If so, is this a confounding variable?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, HFD-fed flies probably had higher caloric uptake than ND-fed flies when fed ad libitum, which was also consistent with their higher triglyceride storage (Figure 1M). However, we did not consider this a confounding variable.</p><p>In particular, HFD-fed flies, despite their likely higher caloric update and higher triglyceride storage, exhibited increased (rather than decreased) response to starvation (Figure 1A-B, F). This seemingly counterintuitive result led to the suggestion that these flies exhibited enhanced starvation-induced hyperactivity <italic>not</italic> because of their lack of energy storage, but rather because of their hypersensitivity to hunger signals. The majority of our current study was built on and was to confirm this hypothesis (Figures 2-8).</p><p>We have added more discussions to clarify this point (subsection “HFD specifically enhanced starvation-induced hyperactivity”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 2, the authors suggest that HFD enhances starvation-induced hyperactivity through AKHR based on two results: (1) AKHR protein expression was increased in HFD flies at FED status; (2) AKHR neurons are more sensitive to AKH in HFD flies.</p><p>More evidences are needed to make this statement more convincing.

We have added the relevant discussions in the last paragraph of the subsection “HFD increased the sensitivity of hunger-sensing, AKHR+ neurons”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Much of the activity data is presented as a ratio of Starved/Fed. To help interpret this ratio it would be useful to see the Starved values separately.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the Starved values in Figure 1 (and Figure 1—figure supplements 1-5). However, we feel that adding Starved values into all figures (esp. those with already complicated genetic manipulations) would be making the figures a lot busier and harder to interpret. Furthermore, the Starved values alone do not offer much new insight since they are determined by both the baseline locomotion level (FED values) as well as the increase in locomotion upon starvation (ST/FED ratios), which are both already shown. Alternatively, we have added all the Starved values (and plots) into source data files for whom interested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 4F, the blockage of AKHR&gt;ATG-5 RNAi on the ST/FED change between ND and FED seems to be majorly caused by a huge and significant increase of ST/FED at ND comparing with the control groups, but not a decrease of ST/FED at HFD, which makes the conclusion of HFD enhancing ST/FED through autophagy less convincing. Is autophagy blockage affecting starvation-induced hyperactivity under ND rather than affecting starvation-induced hyperactivity under HFD? And the way the statistical difference being labeled in this kind of graphs is also confusing: are the authors comparing the 1st bar with the 3rd bar, or comparing the red group with the blue group?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, as the reviewer suggested, ATG5 KD led to significantly enhanced starvation-induced hyperactivity under ND (Figure 4F). But this is exactly as expected, since we proposed that HFD-feeding enhanced starvation-induced hyperactivity via suppressing autophagy and increasing AKHR levels.</p><p>Under ND feeding, ATG5 KD in AKHR<sup>+</sup> neurons led to increased AKHR expression and enhanced neuronal sensitivity to AKH, mimicking the effect of HFD-feeding (Figure 3H-I and Figure 4A-B). Consistently, under ND-feeding, ATG5 KD flies exhibited enhanced starvation-induced hyperactivity (Figure 4F, dark bars), also mimicking HFD-feeding conditions (Figure 4F, dark vs. light bars for ATG5 KD flies).</p><p>Meanwhile, since HFD feeding has already suppressed autophagy to a low level (Figure 3F-G), further suppressing autophagy under HFD feeding did not exert any further increase in starvation-induced hyperactivity (Figure 4F, light bars).</p><p>We have added more clarifications in the Results.</p><p>We have modified the figures so that the statistical differences were indicated more clearly. Briefly, two short vertical lines indicate the two groups of data for statistical comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Is the pathway AMPK-TOR-autophagy-AKHR an HFD specific pathway or a ND/HFD common pathway? As shown in Figure 6F, TOR inhibition also significantly decreased ST/FED under ND. Is HFD enhancing a ND starvation-induced hyperactivity pathway?</p></disp-quote><p>The data shown in Figures 3-6 suggest that AMPK-TOR-autophagy-AKHR signaling is involved in starvation-induced hyperactivity under both ND and HFD conditions. Under HFD condition, this pathway is further modulated (AMPK down, TOR up, autophagy down, AKHR up) in a way that enhances starvation-induced hyperactivity.</p><p>As a result, as shown in Figure 6D, suppressing TOR signaling led to reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity under ND condition, and also the diminished behavioral response to HFD feeding.</p><p>We have added more clarifications in the manuscript. “These data suggest that TOR signaling is required for starvation-induced hyperactivity as well as the effect of HFD to further enhance this behavior”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The statistical difference in Figure 1I and Figure 7D is similar, but the interpretation is quite different. In Figure 1I, the difference between ND and HFD is neglected, described as &quot;One possible explanation was that HFD might decrease flies' energy storage and/or increase flies' energy expenditure, reducing their resistance to starvation (Figure 1C). It seemed unlikely, since flies' body weight was not affected by HFD and their lipid storage was actually slightly elevated by HFD (Figure 1H and I).&quot;, while in Figure 7D, the difference is confirmed, described as &quot;Meanwhile, both triglycerides and cholesterol were enriched in the hemolymph of HFD-fed flies (Figure 7C-D). Therefore, it was possible that LTP was the major carrier for excess circulating lipids after HFD feeding.&quot; This is kind of selective interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for point out this problem and we have revised the interpretation (esp. for Figure 1M, Results), so that our interpretations for elevated TAG levels are consistent.</p><p>We would like to emphasize that in both experiments, the elevated triglyceride storage were supporting (not against) our conclusions.</p><p>In Figure 1M, the elevated triglyceride storage suggests that the enhanced starvation-induced hyperactivity upon HFD feeding is not a result of decreased energy supply, but rather a result of increased hunger sensitivity (which was proven right in the subsequent analysis). In Figure 7C-D, the elevated triglyceride and cholesterol levels in the hemolymph suggest that there should be some lipoprotein carrier for them (which was consistent with the elevated expression of LTP in the hemolymph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Subsection “HFD enhanced AKHR accumulation by suppressing neuronal autophagy”: the body of the text should explain why the ratio of GFP-ATG8 I and II is a measure of autophagy, and a reference should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more discussions and related references in the manuscript (subsection “HFD enhanced AKHR accumulation by suppressing neuronal autophagy”). Briefly, ATG8-I is the soluble form of ATG8 whereas ATG-II is the membrane-bound form. Upon the induction of autophagy, ATG8 is recruited to the membrane of newly formed autophagosomes. Therefore, an increased ratio of II/I indicates the induction of autophagy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Dosage of AKH in Ca2+ imaging experiments: Figure 2K shows that HFD-fed flies exhibited more robust calcium transients than ND-fed flies when stimulated with AKH, but the experiment shows doses only up to 31.6 μM. In subsequent experiments, such as Figure 4A, it seems that 3.16 mM was used. This needs to be commented on. Also, the line graphs in Figure 2K are misleading – there is no 3.16 μM dose so the x-axis is not uniform in scale.</p></disp-quote><p>In the last revised manuscript, we have revised the figures to show Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging results of 316 nM AKH (Figure 4A-B, Figure 5G-H). We have added the information in the figure legends.</p><p>We have revised Figure 2K according to the reviewer’s suggestion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
