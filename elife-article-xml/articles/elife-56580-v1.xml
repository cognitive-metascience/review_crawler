Replication, detoxification, and a cancer-protective form of regulated cell death termed <italic>ferroptosis</italic>, all depend on iron metabolism. Ferrous iron accumulates over adult lifetime in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Here, we show that glutathione depletion is coupled to ferrous iron elevation in these animals, and that both occur in late life to prime cells for ferroptosis. We demonstrate that blocking ferroptosis, either by inhibition of lipid peroxidation or by limiting iron retention, mitigates age-related cell death and markedly increases lifespan and healthspan. Temporal scaling of lifespan is not evident when ferroptosis is inhibited, consistent with this cell death process acting at specific life phases to induce organismal frailty, rather than contributing to a constant aging rate. Because excess age-related iron elevation in somatic tissue, particularly in brain, is thought to contribute to degenerative disease, post-developmental interventions to limit ferroptosis may promote healthy aging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>iron</kwd><kwd>ferroptosis</kwd><kwd>frailty</kwd><kwd>lifespan</kwd><kwd>glutathione</kwd><kwd>fitness</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP130100357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bush</surname><given-names>Ashley I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP180101248</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McColl</surname><given-names>Gawain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001782</institution-id><institution>University of Melbourne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McColl</surname><given-names>Gawain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Miller Foundation Ltd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McColl</surname><given-names>Gawain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>As worms age reduced glutathione together with increased ferrous iron increases frailty and leads to ferroptosis, which is amenable to therapeutic intervention.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Life has evolved to exploit the redox chemistry of iron for essential activities. Ferrous iron drives ferroptosis, a regulated cell death program genetically and biochemically distinct from apoptosis, necrosis and autophagic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). Ferroptosis kills malignant cells but may also be inappropriately activated in ischemic injury and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stockwell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tuo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Viswanathan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang and Stockwell, 2016</xref>). This cell death mechanism is executed by (phospho)lipid hydroperoxides induced by either iron-dependent lipoxygenases, or by an iron-catalyzed spontaneous peroxyl radical-mediated chain reaction (autoxidation). Under homeostatic conditions the ferroptotic signal is terminated by glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPx4), a phospholipid hydroperoxidase that needs glutathione as a cofactor. While the signaling that regulates ferroptosis has been studied in depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conrad et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doll et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>), the role of iron load in this death signal is poorly resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doll and Conrad, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Redox cycling between Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> can contribute to cellular stress. This is mitigated by a range of storage and chaperone pathways to ensure that the labile iron pool is kept to a minimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hare et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> the emergence of labile ferrous iron with age correlates with genetic effects that accelerate aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">James et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">James et al., 2015</xref>) and could be a lifespan hazard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). Excess iron supply has been shown to shorten lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gourley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2008</xref>), yet variable results have been reported with iron chelation. The iron chelator deferiprone was reported not to impact <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Valentini et al., 2012</xref>), but this study was limited by indirect measures of iron load, use of only a single dose of deferiprone, and small sample size. In contrast, use of calcium-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (CaEDTA), a non-specific chelator that does not redox-silence iron, caused a minor (undisclosed) increase in lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klang et al., 2014</xref>). Whether selective targeting of ferrous iron burden can impact on aging and lifespan is unknown.</p><p>The developmental dependence on iron for reproduction and cellular biochemistry may represent an ancient and conserved liability in late life. The load of tissue iron increases needlessly in aging nematodes, mammals and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">James et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Massie et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Massie et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ward et al., 2014</xref>). This must tax regulatory systems that prevent abnormal redox cycling of iron, such as the Fe<sup>2+</sup>-glutathione complexes thought to be the dominant form of iron in the cellular labile iron pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berndt and Lillig, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hider and Kong, 2011</xref>). We hypothesized that age-dependent elevation of labile iron, coupled with a reduction of glutathione levels conspire to lower the threshold for ferroptotic signaling, increasing the vulnerability of aged animals and implying that disruption to the iron-glutathione axis is fundamental to natural aging and death. To test this, we investigated the vulnerability to ferroptosis of aging nematodes upon the natural loss of glutathione during lifespan. We examined the effects of inhibiting ferroptosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> using two distinct treatments: a potent quenching agent for lipid peroxidation (autoxidation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zilka et al., 2017</xref>) as well as a small lipophilic iron chelator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kalinowski and Richardson, 2005</xref>) that prevents the initiation and amplification of lipid peroxide signals. Our analysis of these interventions provides mechanistic insight into the influence of the Fe<sup>2+</sup>-glutathione couple on the occurrence of natural ferroptosis across lifespan, at the cellular and organismal level. Because excess age-related iron elevation in somatic tissue, particularly in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Massie et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Massie et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ward et al., 2014</xref>), is thought to contribute to degenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hare et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hare et al., 2015</xref>), our data indicate that post-developmental interventions to limit ferroptosis may promote healthy aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Glutathione depletion vulnerability</title><p>Glutathione is suggested to be the dominant coordinating ligand for cytosolic ferrous iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hider and Kong, 2011</xref>) and is also the substrate used by glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4) to clear the lipid peroxides that induce ferroptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixon and Stockwell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Deletion of four <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologs of GPX4 decreases lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakamoto et al., 2014</xref>), but whether ferroptosis mediates this is unknown. We tested whether acute depletion of glutathione can initiate ferroptosis in adult <italic>C. elegans </italic>using diethyl maleate (DEM), which conjugates glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Urban et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Valmas and Ebert, 2006</xref>). DEM has been reported to produce a non-linear response to glutathione depletion, with a minor glutathione loss induced by DEM at 10–100 µM increasing lifespan via hormesis, but a major glutathione loss induced by DEM ≥1 mM shortening lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Urban et al., 2017</xref>). We found that DEM ≥1 mM induced death in 4 day old adult worms (at the end of their reproductive phase) in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with ≈50% lethality occurring after 24 hr exposure to 10 mM DEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) associated with ≈50% depletion of glutathione (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also found that total glutathione levels steadily decrease with normal aging, approaching ≈50% on Day 10 of the levels on Day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This may contribute to <italic>C. elegans</italic> becoming disproportionately more vulnerable to DEM lethality as they enter the midlife stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Both Lip-1 and SIH protect against toxicity from glutathione depletion.</title><p>Treatment with DEM represents an acute stress that reduces glutathione levels and causes death, with older animals being more susceptible.</p><p>Note, the age of adults is determined by the number of days following the last larval molt and therefore reflects the number of days of adulthood.

We examined the treatment of <italic>C. elegans</italic> with the selective ferroptosis inhibitor, liproxstatin (Lip-1, 200 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). We also targeted the accumulation of late life iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">James et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">James et al., 2015</xref>), that catalyses (phospho)lipid hydroperoxide propagation, using salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (SIH, 250 µM), a lipophilic acylhydrazone that scavenges intracellular iron and mobilizes it for extracellular clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kalinowski and Richardson, 2005</xref>). Importantly, unlike chelators such as CaEDTA, iron bound by SIH does not redox cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). For both interventions, <italic>C. elegans</italic> were treated from early adulthood (late L4) onwards to eliminate any potential developmental effects.</p><p>DEM toxicity in 4-day-old worms was rescued by both Lip-1 and SIH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), with more marked protection by SIH. This is consistent with ferroptosis contributing to the death mechanism. Therefore, the fall in glutathione with aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) would be expected to interact synergistically with the concomitant rise in labile iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">James et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">James et al., 2015</xref>) to increase the risk of ferroptosis. We found that this age-dependent rise in iron itself may contribute to the fall in glutathione, since pretreatment of the worms with SIH from L4 prevented the age-dependent decrease in glutathione when assayed on Day 4 of adult life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Furthermore, SIH mitigated the glutathione depletion induced by DEM in Day four animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), demonstrating that cytosolic iron synergizes the depletion of glutathione initiated by DEM. While Lip-1 alleviated the lethality of DEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), it did not prevent the fall in glutathione that was induced by aging (as assayed on Day 4) or by DEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, Lip-1 inhibition of ferroptosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> occurs downstream of glutathione depletion, consistent with its effect in rescuing ferroptosis in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shah et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Individual cell ferroptosis heralds organismal demise</title><p>A feature of ferroptosis is the propagation of cell death in a paracrine manner mediated by uncertain signals that might include the toxic lipid peroxidation end-products 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng and Stockwell, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Linkermann et al., 2014</xref>). Compared to strong oxidants like the hydroxyl radical, 4-HNE and MDA are relatively stable and able react with macromolecules, such as proteins distal to the site of origin. To determine whether individual cell death precedes organismal death in our model of aging, we used propidium iodide to visualize moribund cells in vivo after DEM treatment and during aging. Propidium iodide (PI) is a fluorescent intercalating agent that binds to DNA, but cannot cross the membrane of live cells, making it possible to identify the nuclei of recently dead or dying cells, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Examination of aged cohorts, or young animals treated with DEM, indicated that cell death (particularly death of intestinal cells) preceded organismal death in both 4-day-old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and 6- and 8-day-old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) adults, and was significantly attenuated by both Lip-1 or SIH. Death of individual cells prior to organismal death is consistent with progressive degeneration contributing to the frailty phenotype.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>|Both Lip-1 and SIH inhibit cell death and protect against lipid peroxidation.</title><p>Measures of lipid peroxidation and cell death show an increase with age and reduction by both Lip-1 and SIH treatment.</p><p>In all panels, vehicle control (0.5% v/v DMSO, Ctl)-treated worms are shown in orange, Lip-1-treated (200 µM Lip-1) are green and SIH-treated (250 µM SIH) are blue.

It is known that as <italic>C. elegans</italic> ages, intestinal nuclei are lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGee et al., 2011</xref>) and the propidium iodide cannot stain nuclei if they are absent. Additionally, we would not expect a linear increase proportional to age in the prevalence of animals with stained cells during longitudinal studies of our cohorts, because dead animals are removed from the population and the rate of death changed over time for the cohorts (Figure 5C; see below). Thus, the prevalence of PI-positive cells per animal would be a complex product of the rate of PI emergence, the rate of PI disappearance, the rate of nuclear disappearance and the rate of organismal death. However, we were able to survey the prevalence of animals with any dead cells on particular days in the adult life span. This determined that cell death begins to be detected after 4 days of age, and that our interventions with SIH and Lip-1 completely suppressed this cell death at 6 and 8 days of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>To estimate changes in lipid peroxidation, we assayed MDA via the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay. As expected, acute glutathione depletion by DEM exposure caused a marked increase in the relative amounts of MDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We also observed an aged-related increase in MDA, consistent with an age-related increase in ferroptotic signalling in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, that was ameliorated by both Lip-1 and SIH treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Consistent with the MDA results, we also found a concomitant qualitative increase in 4-HNE protein adducts with age that was suppressed by both Lip-1 and SIH treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>We considered whether the higher levels of glutathione in animals treated with SIH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>) could reflect a hormetic response to sublethal oxidative stress, which has been described for SIH at low concentrations (10 µM) combining with the cellular labile iron pool within hepatocellular carcinoma cells in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caro et al., 2015</xref>). The decrease we observed in our oxidation markers, MDA and 4-HNE, by SIH treatment at 250 µM in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>) suggests that this higher dose of SIH was sufficient to debulk reservoirs of total iron. To further discount possible off-target stress responses elicited by our interventions, we interrogated DAF-16 localization. Nuclear localization of the DAF-16 transcription factor is an indicator of insulin-like signalling, which occurs under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henderson and Johnson, 2001</xref>). Neither 250 µM SIH nor 200 µM Lip-1 induced DAF-16 nuclear translocation. As a positive control, treatment with 10 mM DEM did induce nuclear localization of DAF-16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with this challenge inducing acute stress.

Treatment with Lip-1 primarily altered late life survival, while SIH extended mid-life with a squaring of the survival curve. Interventions that increase lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are not uncommon, but Stroustrup et al. recently demonstrated the great majority of longevity interventions, for example dietary and temperature alteration, oxidative stress, and genetic disruptions of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway (<italic>e.g. daf-2</italic> and <italic>daf-16</italic>), heat shock factor <italic>hsf-1</italic>, or hypoxia-inducible factor <italic>hif-1</italic>, each alter lifespan by <italic>temporal scaling -</italic> an apparent stretching or shrinking of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stroustrup et al., 2016</xref>). For an intervention to extend lifespan by temporal scaling it must alter, to the same extent throughout adult life, all physiological determinants of the risk of death. In effect temporal scaling arises when the risk of death is modulated by an intervention acting solely on the rate constant associated with a single stochastic process. It is important to note that temporal scaling is determined by statistical analysis rather than subjective assessment, and also that reproducibility of results depends upon adequate sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Petrascheck and Miller, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Combining the replicate data from eight independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), we assessed whether Lip-1 and SIH treatment effects can be explained by the temporal scaling model of accelerated failure time (AFT). We found that the lifespan increases were not consistent with the temporal scaling model (p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), so the interventions may target previously unrecognized aging mechanisms. For SIH treatment, the risk of death (hazard) in early adulthood was greatly reduced compared to control populations but rose precipitously in late life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, Lip-1 markedly reduced the rate of mortality in the post-reproductive period (late-life) with early life mortality closer to that seen in untreated populations. These findings are consistent with ferroptotic cell death limiting lifespan in late life rather than being a global regulator (<italic>e.g.</italic> insulin/IGF-1 pathway) of aging. This raises the possibility of targeted intervention with minimal or no metabolic cost.</p><p>The sample size in our experiment is much smaller than the lifespan machine experiment undertaken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stroustrup et al., 2016</xref> yet the data against temporal rescaling were significant.

We previously determined that as <italic>C. elegans</italic> age, not only does intracellular iron accumulate but the capacity to safely sequester iron in the iron-storage protein ferritin fails. This contributes to the increased cellular fraction of Fe<sup>2+</sup> that we observed here, leading to increased oxidative load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">James et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">James et al., 2015</xref>), and providing the specific substrate for ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaschler et al., 2018</xref>).

We find that SIH and Lip-1 increase lifespan by prohibiting ferroptotic death rather than inhibiting aging rate. We find also that late-life ferroptosis is a prominent contributor to age-related frailty. The healthspan benefits of inhibiting ferroptosis confirm that healthspan improvement need not always require a change in global aging but can result from preventing a cause of frailty, raising an exciting conceptual prospect for therapeutic intervention. Further work is needed to determine the potential windows of action for effective intervention.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic overview.</title><p>During normal aging iron unnecessarily accumulates. The safe storage of surplus iron in ferritin begins to fail in late life, causing a corresponding elevation of reactive, ‘labile’ iron.

A previous study found that iron supplementation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> shortened lifespan but did not measure in vivo iron levels or the fraction of Fe<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Valentini et al., 2012</xref>). Our measures of chronic versus acute changes in the fraction of Fe<sup>2+</sup> help define the organismal limits of buffering capacity at 0.3 (or 30%). Iron deficiency causes deficits in major developmental pathways, but our interventions were delivered in adulthood to avoid any potential interference with development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hare et al., 2015</xref>). This revealed that limiting iron retention post-development was not only tolerable, but improved health and life history traits.</p><p>SIH and Lip-1 alter aging at specific life phases and, unlike most known lifespan interventions, do not slow the rate of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stroustrup et al., 2016</xref>). They act in related but different ways to extend lifespan, with differing impacts on hazard rate and distinct effects on iron levels, life-history traits and acute glutathione depletion. Importantly, both interventions increase both lifespan and healthspan without apparent major fitness trade-offs, in contrast to those previously reported in long-lived mutants that do slow the rate of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jenkins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walker et al., 2000</xref>). Neither SIH nor Lip-1 cause nuclear localization of DAF-16, however, we have previously shown that <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants exhibit markedly attenuated age-related iron accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">James et al., 2015</xref>), so this well-studied lifespan pathway may also impact the rate of ferroptosis. Interestingly, reduction of glutathione via RNAi treatment is reported to decrease <italic>daf-2</italic> lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spanier et al., 2010</xref>), but in wild type animals has been found to cause a minor (4–7%) lifespan increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Urban et al., 2017</xref>). With respect to lifespan intervention, the non-linear responses observed with glutathione reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Urban et al., 2017</xref>) and compensatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferguson and Bridge, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Urban et al., 2017</xref>) suggest that approaches targeting iron and/or lipid peroxidation are likely to be more successful in preventing ferroptosis. The results reported here are consistent with previous orthogonal studies where long-lived genetic mutants of the insulin-like signaling pathway in <italic>C. elegans</italic> express a delay in somatic iron accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">James et al., 2015</xref>).

Reactions were incubated for 1–2 min at room temperature and then absorbance measured at 412 nm for 10 min with 1 min interval using a Powerwave plate spectrophotometer (BioTek). The rate of change in absorbance per minute is linearly proportional to the total concentration of GSH. Total GSH in the samples was interpolated from using linear regression from a standard curve of known GSH concentrations (0 to 1 µM) run in tandem. In parallel, the concentration of total protein per sample was also determined by a Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce) using the manufacturers protocol. Total GSH estimates were then normalized for protein load, thus accounting for any size differences between populations.

The distribution of elements with atomic number &lt; 37 were mapped using an incident beam of 15.6 keV X-rays. This incident energy allowed clear separation of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) peaks from the relatively intense elastic and inelastic scatter. The incident beam (~1.71 109 photons s−1) was focussed to approximately 2 × 2 μm2 (H × V, FWHM) in the sample plane and the specimen was continuously scanned through focus (1 mm sec−1). The resulting XRF was binned in 0.8 μm intervals in both the horizontal and vertical giving virtual pixels spanning 0.64 μm2 of the specimen probed with a dwell time of 8 μsec. XRF intensity was normalized to the incident beam flux monitored with a nitrogen filled ionization chamber with a 27 cm path length placed upstream of the focusing optics. Three single-element thin metal foils of known areal density (Mn 18.9 μg cm−2, Fe 50.1 μg cm−2 and Pt 42.2 μg cm−2, Micromatter, Canada) were used to calibrate the relationship between fluorescence flux at the detector and elemental abundance. Dynamic Analysis, as implemented in GeoPIXE 7.3 (CSIRO), was used to deconvolve the full XRF spectra at each pixel in the scan region to produce quantitative elemental maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ryan, 2000</xref>). This procedure includes a correction for an assumed specimen composition and thickness, in this case 30 μm of cellulose. Though unlikely to exactly match the actual sample characteristics, deviations from these assumptions are not significant for the results presented in this study as the effects of beam attenuation and self-absorption on calcium and iron XRF are negligible for a dried specimen of this type and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davies et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Elemental quantification and image analysis</title><p>Analysis of elemental XRF maps was performed using a combination of tools native to GeoPIXE and ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>).

The function <italic>bj</italic> in R package <italic>rms</italic> was used to fit the replicate-specific model with interventions as categorical independent variables. We used the same approach for testing whether the temperature difference results in simple temporal rescaling, with the only difference being using temperature rather than intervention as categorical independent variable in the AFT model. Full details of these analyses are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17-4"><title>Characterizing departure from temporal rescaling</title><p>Parametric survival models with Weibull baseline hazards and Gamma frailty were fitted to replicate-specific data using the R package <italic>flexsurv</italic>. A likelihood ratio test was used to compare models that assume simple temporal rescaling to models that allow varying degrees of departure from temporal rescaling. The best model for each replicate was selected using a likelihood ratio test and the goodness of fit (GOF) of the best model is evaluated using a chi-square GOF test. To combine data across different replicates, we performed fixed-effect and random-effect meta-analyses for each parameter in the best model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Briefly, the fixed-effect meta-analysis estimates were derived using Inverse Variance Weighting (IVW) in which the estimates from each replicate were weighted by the inverse of their variance estimates. The meta-analysis estimates were then calculated simply as the weighted average of estimates from all replicates. The fixed-effect meta-analysis assumes that there is insignificant variation between the estimates of the same parameter across different replicates. The random-effect meta-analysis also derives the estimates by assigning weights to estimates from each replicate, but in this case the weights take into account the variation of estimates across replicates.</p><p>The fixed-effects and random-effects meta-analysis estimates are quite similar and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> we can see that the meta-analysis estimates provide the best fit to SIH data and worst for Lip-1 data. Since there is significant between-replicate variation for the majority of the parameters, it is not surprising that the when the meta-analysis estimates are applied to the real data, a chi-square goodness of fit reveals significant lack of fit (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(3)</sub>=237.0 for control worms, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(5)</sub>=258.0 for Lip-1 and χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(3)</sub>=49.7 for SIH, all p-values&lt;0.001).</p><p>One notable pattern shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> is that for nearly all replicates, there is more heterogeneity due to unobserved factors among the control worms, as indicated by the negative Δlog(σ<sup>2</sup>) parameter estimates for Lip-1 and SIH data. This heterogeneity is also reflected in a de-acceleration of the hazard function for control worms beyond 7–8 days. This de-acceleration of the hazard function is the main contributor to the crossing behaviour we observe when comparing the survival functions, and it is what causes a violation of the simple temporal rescaling assumption.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Survival during GSH depletion</title><p>For survival with increasing DEM dose response and protection by compounds (Lip-1 and SIH), data were plotted as fraction of animal alive with upper and lower 95% confidence interval, using the Wilson ‘score’ method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wilson, 1927</xref>) using asymptotic variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Newcombe, 1998</xref>) and fitted with a sigmoidal curve (Prism).

In an expansion of their previous work, the authors utilize three compounds (diethyl maleate to modulate in vivo glutathione levels, liproxstatin as an antioxidant &quot;ferroptosis inhibitor&quot;, and salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazine as an iron chelator) as pharmacological modulators in conjunction with advanced synchrotron-based imaging techniques to investigate these links.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscripts describes the use of three compounds to modulate iron-associated redox homeostasis: diethyl maleate to modulate in vivo glutathione levels, liproxstatin as an antioxidant &quot;ferroptosis inhibitor&quot;, and salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazine as an iron chelator. After treating animals with combinations of these compounds, the authors identify changes in cell death, biomarkers of lipid peroxidation, iron levels, biomarkers of &quot;healthspan&quot;, and lifespan. In this, they combine conventional biochemical and behavioral assays with advanced microscopy techniques/synchrotron-based imaging.</p><p>The reviewers judged the experimental results as interesting and agreed that the authors identify a clear link between changes in iron homeostasis and systemic changes in the risk of death. However, the reviewers also pointed out several instances where some of the broader and more general conclusions about aging in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are not strictly supported by the data provided or are at least not the only way to interpret these data.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The authors appear to rely on the assumption that their three drugs act only on their expected targets. No orthogonal experiments were performed that could exclude the possibility that off target effects are responsible for experimental outcomes. It would be much more convincing if the authors could additionally make use of mutations or RNAi constructs that alter iron homeostasis and lipid oxidation, and demonstrate that such alternate means of disrupting iron homeostasis produce the same effects on aging as do the drugs. Failing such experiments, some of the claims should be tempered and potential alternative explanations should be more clearly discussed.</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> aging is also highly sensitive to perturbations of their bacterial food source (Han et al., &quot;Microbial Genetic Composition Tunes Host Longevity&quot; Cell, 2017), and drug / bacteria interactions are a major confounder in all pharmacological work in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, the possibility that the observed effects are mediated partially or fully by such effects are not discussed or excluded. Any experimental evidence in support of a direct effect on <italic>C. elegans</italic>, rather than through effects on OP50 would be useful. Failing such additional data, the possibility of indirect (OP50-mediated) effects should be clearly outlined.The authors further claim that &quot;the animal dies cell by cell, rather in a single event&quot;. While the authors find that some intestinal cells are dead in animals on day 6 and 8 of adulthood, this does not exclude the possibility of a larger (rapid) die off later. Furthermore, ablation of some neurons or of the entire germline actually extends lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, while other cells may be dispensable for normal lifespan. It is true that the authors observe a correlation between decreased cell death and longer life, but this alone is not sufficient evidence that the early cell-death contributes causally to frailty or that decreased cell death results in longer life.</p><p>Another key concern is if the mechanism is truly relevant in normal aging or just in relation to GSH depletion. It is important to establish that this mechanism applies to normal aging. The authors should provide further evidence for this (see below) and discuss this more fully.</p><p>The lifespan of WT worms appears shorter than would have expected (even at 25 °C). From the data that is presented, it seems that the authors also did lifespan / control experiments at 20 °C. However, from these trials (at 20 °C), only relative scaling data instead of a full lifespan data is presented (Tables 7-9 in Supplementary file 5 and Figure 7 in Supplementary file 5). Importantly, it appears that only one of the interventions (SIH) but not the other (Lip-1) extended lifespan at 20 °C. Again, the authors should show the full data (even if negative?) on Lip-1 at 20 °C, clearly state the facts and discuss them relative to the question if the observed mechanism indeed applies to normal aging.</p><p>It would be important to show the actual lifespan data of WT at 20 °C and to show and fully discuss these data (the lifespan observed at 25 °C and at 20 °C, the shape of the hazard functions for the control populations and the relative protective effects under these conditions). How consistent are these data with the notion that the proposed mechanism is relevant during normal aging and that normal aging is modified by treatment?</p><p>The authors state that &quot;Ferroptotic cell death limits lifespan in late life&quot;. The authors show that their drugs indeed extend lifespan, and they observe that a time-invariant dose schedule produces a time-varying effect on the hazard rate. However, as they have not identified the timing of action of their drug, they cannot be certain at what age ferroptosis influences frailty. An alternative hypothesis is that their drugs act early in life to permanently alter animals in a way that suppress some forms of death (that kill chronologically young animals) while introducing novel causes of death (that kill chronologically old animals). Without excluding such alternate hypotheses, the authors do not seem to be on solid ground with their preferred conclusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56580.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The authors appear to rely on the assumption that their three drugs act only on their expected targets. No orthogonal experiments were performed that could exclude the possibility that off target effects are responsible for experimental outcomes. It would be much more convincing if the authors could additionally make use of mutations or RNAi constructs that alter iron homeostasis and lipid oxidation, and demonstrate that such alternate means of disrupting iron homeostasis produce the same effects on aging as do the drugs. Failing such experiments, some of the claims should be tempered and potential alternative explanations should be more clearly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>While we cannot exclude off-target effects, the value of our study is on observing the effect of canonical pharmacological reagents that impact the ferroptosis pathway on longevity and other phenotypes. Ferroptosis is rapidly emerging in the regulated cell death literature as a complex and highly-regulated pathway. This paper provides the first description of ferroptosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Ferroptosis is operationally defined by pharmacological manoeuvres such as the ones we use- induction by glutathione depletion and rescue with iron-chelation or lipid peroxide scavengers. While we are working to find ferroptosis checkpoint homologs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> as an important orthogonal corroboration, this will take time. Nonetheless, we have an important orthogonal corroboration for our intervention – the drop of glutathione that occurs with natural aging, rescued by iron chelation.</p><p>We did refer to the possibility of off-target effects and noted the following in our manuscript:</p><p>‘To further discount possible off-target stress responses elicited by our interventions, we interrogated DAF-16 localization.’</p><p>We have now added additional text in the manuscript to further acknowledge the possibility of off-target effects.</p><p>‘Although we have demonstrated target engagement of both compounds, additional experiments could also explore the possibility of off-target effects of both SIH and Lip-1.’</p><p>With respect to orthogonal experiments and iron homeostasis, the results presented here are consistent with our previously published work on genetic mutants. For example, we have shown that long-lived <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants have reduced age related iron accumulation. In contrast, short lived <italic>daf-16;daf-2</italic> double mutants have increased iron accumulation (James et al., 2015). We have also shown that <italic>ftn-1; ftn-2</italic> double mutant worms that lack the iron storage protein ferritin (and thus altered iron homeostasis), have increased labile iron and reduced lifespan (James et al., 2016).</p><p>We have modified the text in the Discussion section of the manuscript to include reference to these supportive orthogonal results.</p><p>‘The results reported here are consistent with previous orthogonal studies where long-lived genetic mutants of the insulin-like signaling pathway in <italic>C. elegans</italic> express a delay in somatic iron accumulation (James et al., 2015). Conversely, ferritin null <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants, which lack the redox-silent ferritin Fe<sup>3+</sup> storage pool, are short-lived and contain higher levels of pro-ferroptotic Fe<sup>2+</sup> (James et al., 2016).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> aging is also highly sensitive to perturbations of their bacterial food source (Han et al., &quot;Microbial Genetic Composition Tunes Host Longevity&quot; Cell, 2017), and drug / bacteria interactions are a major confounder in all pharmacological work in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, the possibility that the observed effects are mediated partially or fully by such effects are not discussed or excluded. Any experimental evidence in support of a direct effect on <italic>C. elegans</italic>, rather than through effects on OP50 would be useful. Failing such additional data, the possibility of indirect (OP50-mediated) effects should be clearly outlined.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concern and have elaborated on this in the revision. In the Materials and methods section we already point out:</p><p>‘<italic>C. elegans</italic> are bacteriophores and the <italic>E. coli</italic> (OP50) monoxenic diet can colonize the pharynx and intestine, resulting in death. […] Furthermore, an additive effect on median lifespan extension was seen when SIH and the antibiotic ampicillin were co-administered to <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Figure 5—figure supplement 2), consistent with independent effects on lifespan.’</p><p>Nevertheless, we appreciate that this is still a caveat and have introduced the following text into the Discussion to reinforce this consideration:</p><p>‘A caveat for our interpretations is the possibility that the benefits of SIH or Lip-1 were mediated by changes induced in the bacterial food source. […] Further work is needed to determine the influence of host-microbe interactions on iron dyshomeostasis and ferroptosis in this model.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors further claim that &quot;the animal dies cell by cell, rather in a single event&quot;. While the authors find that some intestinal cells are dead in animals on day 6 and 8 of adulthood, this does not exclude the possibility of a larger (rapid) die off later. Furthermore, ablation of some neurons or of the entire germline actually extends lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, while other cells may be dispensable for normal lifespan. It is true that the authors observe a correlation between decreased cell death and longer life, but this alone is not sufficient evidence that the early cell-death contributes causally to frailty or that decreased cell death results in longer life.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the manuscript to remove the phrase ‘the animal dies cell by cell, rather in a single event’.</p><p>‘Death of individual cells prior to organismal death is consistent with progressive degeneration contributing to the frailty phenotype.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another key concern is if the mechanism is truly relevant in normal aging or just in relation to GSH depletion. It is important to establish that this mechanism applies to normal aging. The authors should provide further evidence for this (see below) and discuss this more fully.</p></disp-quote><p>We argue that GSH depletion, which is a feature of normal aging (as shown in Figure 1C), sets up conditions where ferroptosis would also be a feature of normal aging. We also observe cell death prior to organismal death during normal aging (Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 2) as well as with DEM treatment to reduce GSH (Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><p>The text included in the Discussion includes the term ‘normal aging’ to provide additional clarity:</p><p>‘Thus, in normal aging, a decrease in GSH couples with an age-related increase in labile Fe<sup>2+</sup> to multiply the likelihood of ferroptosis, leading to death when combined changes in iron and GSH reach a critical threshold.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The lifespan of WT worms appears shorter than would have expected (even at 25 C).</p></disp-quote><p>Our results are consistent with early work using this strain (TJ1060) without the use of antibiotics e.g. Klass, Aging in the Nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>: Major Biological and Environmental Factors Influencing Life Span Mech Ageing Dev. 1977 Nov-Dec;6(6):413-29. doi: 10.1016/0047-6374(77)90043-4.

Median values tend to be somewhat lower than mean values as they are not skewed by a long tail in the lifespan distribution.</p><p>It is also important to note that this study uses the temperature- sensitive sterile strain, TJ1060, as a proxy for wild type. Lifespan assays were conducted at 25 ± 1 <sup>o</sup>C <italic>without</italic> the use of antibiotics (the addition of which extends lifespan, as seen in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 – where addition of ampicillin increases lifespan from a median of 9 days to a median of 15 days).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From the data that is presented, it seems that the authors also did lifespan / control experiments at 20 °C. However, from these trials (at 20 °C), only relative scaling data instead of a full lifespan data is presented (Tables 7-9 in Supplementary file 5 and Figure 7 in Supplementary file 5). Importantly, it appears that only one of the interventions (SIH) but not the other (Lip-1) extended lifespan at 20 °C. Again, the authors should show the full data (even if negative?) on Lip-1 at 20 °C, clearly state the facts and discuss them relative to the question if the observed mechanism indeed applies to normal aging.</p><p>It would be important to show the actual lifespan data of WT at 20 °C and to show and fully discuss these data (the lifespan observed at 25 °C and at 20 °C, the shape of the hazard functions for the control populations and the relative protective effects under these conditions). How consistent are these data with the notion that the proposed mechanism is relevant during normal aging and that normal aging is modified by treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies for the confusion. We do believe that lifespan experiments conducted at 25 <sup>o</sup>C represent ‘normal aging’. Use of the temperature sensitive sterile strain TJ1060 was done primarily for economic reasons, as experiments conducted at this temperature are both quicker (saving time) and use less resources (cost-effective, as mandated by the Australian Research Council who funded this research).</p><p>Lifespan data at 20 <sup>o</sup>C was not accrued routinely because of the experimental differences with respect to progeny accumulation requiring daily transfer to fresh plates and because of the high cost of Liproxstatin-1.</p><p>Lack of data presented with respect to Lip-1 at 20 °C does not indicate that it has been withheld, rather that it has not been performed with sufficient replication for inclusion in an already data-rich submission. We are happy to provide pilot data (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) to reassure the reviewers that the compound effects are not limited to either TJ1060, or to 25 °C, but are also observed in N2 wild type at 20 °C.</p><p>These results are consistent with the results included in the manuscript, but unfortunately, we do not have sufficient numbers of worms for formal hazard analysis for N2 or Lip-1 at 20 °C.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Wild type survival at 20 °C.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56580-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state that &quot;Ferroptotic cell death limits lifespan in late life&quot;.
