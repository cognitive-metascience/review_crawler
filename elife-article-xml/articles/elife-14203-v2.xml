To understand the interactions between these oscillators, we independently altered their excitability in spontaneously breathing vagotomized urethane-anesthetized adult rats. Hyperpolarizing preBötC neurons decreased inspiratory activity and initiated active expiration, ultimately progressing to apnea, i.e., cessation of both inspiration and active expiration. Depolarizing pF<sub>L</sub> neurons produced active expiration at rest, but not when inspiratory activity was suppressed by hyperpolarizing preBötC neurons. We conclude that in anesthetized adult rats active expiration is driven by the pF<sub>L</sub> but requires an additional form of network excitation, i.e., ongoing rhythmic preBötC activity sufficient to drive inspiratory motor output or increased chemosensory drive. The organization of this coupled oscillator system, which is essential for life, may have implications for other neural networks that contain multiple rhythm/pattern generators.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14203.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14203.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14203.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mammals breathe air into and out of their lungs to absorb oxygen into the body and to remove carbon dioxide. The rhythm of breathing is most likely controlled by two groups of neurons in a part of the brain called the brain stem. One group called the preBötzinger Complex drives breathing in (inspiration), and normally, breathing out (expiration) occurs when the muscles responsible for inspiration relax. The other group of neurons – known as the lateral parafacial region – controls extra muscles that allow us to increase our breathing when we need to, such as during exercise.</p><p>Huckstepp et al. set out to determine how these two groups of neurons interact with one another in anesthetized rats to produce a reliable and efficient pattern of breathing. The experiments provide further evidence that inspiration is mainly driven by the preBötzinger Complex. Whilst activity from the lateral parafacial region is needed to cause the rats to breathe out more forcefully than normal, a second low level of activity from another source is also required. This source could either be the preBötzinger Complex, or some unknown neurons that change their activity in response to the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood or fluid of the brain.</p><p>Further investigation is required to identify how these interactions go awry in diseases that affect breathing, such as sleep apneas.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14203.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14203.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>preBötzinger Complex</kwd><kwd>respiratory oscillators</kwd><kwd>parafacial lateral region</kwd><kwd>neural microcircuits</kwd><kwd>respiration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH HL 70029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feldman</surname><given-names>Jack L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Active expiration in anesthetized rats is driven by the lateral parafacial region, but requires an additional form of excitation from another source.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Coupled oscillator neural networks driving behavior are widespread, e.g., for swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grillner, 2003</xref>), and locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goulding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Talpalar et al., 2013</xref>). Amongst complex and vital behaviors in mammals, breathing, an exceptionally reliable and continuous behavior throughout postnatal life, is one that we may be closest to understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feldman and Kam, 2015</xref>). Not only do we know the location of the neural microcircuits that generate respiratory rhythm, but we also have direct, accurate and reliable behavioral measures of the output, i.e., breathing. We hypothesize that the respiratory rhythm central pattern generator (CPG) in mammals is comprised of two oscillators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>): inspiratory rhythm originates in the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) in the ventrolateral medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smith et al., 1991</xref>) and active expiratory rhythm originates in the rostral medulla ventrolaterally adjacent to the facial nucleus (parafacial lateral region; pF<sub>L</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Two parafacial regions that potentially overlap and whose anatomical descriptions are incomplete and ambiguous, the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) and parafacial respiratory group/embryonic parafacial (pFRG/e-PF), contain overlapping subpopulations neurons that express the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R), the homeobox gene Phox2b, and the glutamate transporter 2 (VGlut2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nattie and Li, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mulkey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Onimaru et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>). Previously, we used unbiased descriptors to partition the ventral and lateral parafacial regions, designating them as parafacial lateral (pF<sub>L</sub>) and parafacial ventral (pF<sub>V</sub>). These parafacial regions are chemosensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mulkey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Onimaru et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Onimaru et al., 2012</xref>), but can be functionally separated by: i) their contribution to active expiration, with the pF<sub>V</sub> providing drive to expiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Silva et al., 2016</xref>) and the pF<sub>L</sub> containing a presumptive expiratory rhythm generator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>), and; ii) the presence of neurons with respiratory rhythmic behavior in pF<sub>L</sub> (or presumptively equivalent areas) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Onimaru and Homma, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In mammals at rest, during wakefulness and sleep, when active breathing movements are primarily inspiratory, generation of the underlying rhythm appears driven by the preBötC. As metabolic demand increases, e.g., during exercise, the pF<sub>L</sub> appears to turn on to produce active expiration. Thus, while breathing is a unified act of inspiratory and expiratory airflow, we postulate this behavior results from the coordinated interaction of two anatomically and functionally distinct oscillators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mellen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janczewski and Feldman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>). To understand the generation and control of respiration we need to determine how these two oscillators interact. For example, in adult rats the preBötC can generate inspiratory rhythm while the pF<sub>L</sub> is quiescent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>). Is the converse true?</p><p>To investigate their independent and interactive functions, we used a pharmacogenetic approach to selectively inhibit the preBötC and/or activate the normally quiescent pF<sub>L</sub>. We bilaterally transfected the preBötC with the G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled allatostatin receptors (AlstR), which when activated by allatostatin (Alst) silences transfected preBötC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tan et al., 2008</xref>). In the same rats, we bilaterally transfected the pF<sub>L</sub> with the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled HM<sub>3</sub>D DREADD receptor (HM<sub>3</sub>DR) that when activated by clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) depolarizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armbruster et al., 2007</xref>) transfected pF<sub>L</sub> neurons. We slowed respiration in a controlled manner by titrating the dose of Alst applied to the AlstR-transfected preBötC, allowing us to examine the dynamics of this presumptive coupled oscillator system as we shifted the balance of activity from the preBötC to the pF<sub>L</sub>. Depressing preBötC activity resulted in quantal slowing of breathing, similar to slowing of breathing following opiate depression of preBötC activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and in juvenile rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mellen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janczewski and Feldman, 2006</xref>). As preBötC activity waned, burstlets appeared on inspiratory muscle electromyograms (EMGs) and in airflow, consistent with our postulate that burstlets, not bursts, in the preBötC are rhythmogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kam et al., 2013</xref>). In complementary experiments, we applied CNO to the HM<sub>3</sub>DR transfected pF<sub>L</sub> to activate this normally quiescent oscillator. We confirmed that pF<sub>L</sub> activation initiates active expiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>). By combining these protocols, i.e., silencing the preBötC while simultaneously driving the pF<sub>L</sub>, we removed some confounding factors from these initial experiments. Importantly, we found that active expiration could not be induced when preBötC inspiratory driven motor activity was suppressed and chemosensory drive was absent, indicating that in adult rats active expiration is driven by the pF<sub>L</sub> but requires an additional source of network excitation such as ongoing preBötC activity or chemosensory drive. The organization of this coupled oscillator system may have implications for other neural networks that contain multiple central pattern generators.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Viral targeting of the preBötC and pF<sub>L</sub></title><p>We made two pairs of viral injections in each adult rat, i.e., bilateral injections into the preBötC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) and into the pF<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). In histological sections the preBötC is defined as the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) dense area ventral to the semi-compact nucleus ambiguous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) and the pF<sub>L</sub> is defined as the area ventral to the lateral edge of the facial nucleus, juxtaposed to the spinal trigeminal tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>).

Transfection sites ranged from ~350–600 µm in diameter. As the responses to Alst and CNO did not differ between the largest and smallest injections sites, the effects of receptor activation were due to silencing or driving of the preBötC and pF<sub>L</sub> respectively and not to spread of virus to neighboring regions. We found no labeling of neurons in regions of the medulla other than within the injection sites (data not shown).

Can the pF<sub>L</sub> generate a respiratory rhythm when the preBötC is quiescent? If active expiration is independent of inspiratory activity, then active expiration driven by activation of HM<sub>3</sub>DRs in pF<sub>L</sub> should persist after cessation of inspiratory activity resulting from injection of Alst in the preBötC. In anesthetized adult rats with an active expiratory breathing pattern induced by CNO, injection of Alst into the preBötC led to a significant decrease in respiratory activity (n=8; p=0.008 for all variables; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), ultimately resulting in apnea, with no rhythmicity in V<sub>T</sub>, ∫Dia<sub>EMG</sub>, ∫GG<sub>EMG</sub>, and ∫Abd<sub>EMG</sub>. After rhythmic inspiratory activity ceased, ∫Abd<sub>EMG</sub> continued tonically for a short duration (15 <sc>iqr</sc> 12 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,Bii</xref>) before disappearing, which was not different from the duration of tonic ∫Abd<sub>EMG</sub> following the onset of apnea in the absence of CNO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Biii</xref>; p=0.7). When inspiratory activity stopped, rats were severely hypercapnic (ETCO<sub>2</sub> 64.6 <sc>iqr</sc> 14.5 mm Hg; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Bii</xref>), this was not different from the hypercapnia at the onset of apnea in the absence of CNO (ETCO<sub>2</sub> 57.8 <sc>iqr</sc> 22.3 mm Hg; p=0.8). Rats were mechanically ventilated to restore CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> levels to within the normal range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). To assess the state of the respiratory CPG the mechanical ventilator was intermittently turned off. Shortly after allatostatin injections into the preBötC, no respiratory activity was seen following cessation of mechanical ventilation, and rats were placed back on the ventilator. As the time from allatostatin injection in the preBötC increased, removal from the ventilator led to brief periods of spontaneous breathing. When spontaneous breathing occurred, the return of inspiratory activity always preceded the return of expiratory abdominal activity; active expiration did not return until V<sub>T</sub> reached 3.2 <sc>iqr</sc> 1.7 mL, ∫Dia<sub>EMG</sub> reached 13.1 <sc>iqr</sc> 8.2 a.u., and ∫GG<sub>EMG</sub> reached 5.2 <sc>iqr</sc> 4.2 a.u. (n=8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). That is, at low levels of reinitiated inspiratory activity there was no active expiration, which appeared only after inspiratory activity reached a higher value. If rats were able to spontaneously breathe without ventilation, they were allowed to do so. However, most early periods of spontaneous breathing deteriorated, and when rats became apneic again they were re-ventilated; in 5 of 6 rats spontaneous breathing occurred during ventilation, and in the remaining rat, spontaneous breathing following removal from the ventilator was sustained. When spontaneous breathing occurred during ventilation the return of inspiratory activity always preceded the return of expiratory abdominal activity. Therefore, following silencing of the preBötC with Alst in the presence of CNO to drive the pF<sub>L</sub>, at no time during the re-initiation of spontaneous breathing, either with or without mechanical ventilation, did active expiration occur in the absence of inspiratory activity and chemosensory drive.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14203.009</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Hyperpolarizing preBötC neurons leads to apnea, and loss of active expiration even with activation of pF<sub>L</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Integrated traces from a single experiment showing effect of Alst injection to left preBötC (unilateral, first red arrow and dashed line) then right preBötC (bilateral, second red arrow and dashed line), in presence of CNO (pink shaded area); gray arrow and dashed line mark onset of mechanical ventilation.

However opsins can rapidly (&gt;seconds) desensitize and their activation requires placement of optic fibers to illuminate each transfected area, a particularly challenging problem for four regions in the brainstem. Therefore, we chose a pharmacogenetic approach to excite the pF<sub>L</sub> by activation of HM<sub>3</sub>DRs and inhibit the preBötC by activation of AlstRs. This way we were able to switch neurons in these regions on or off over a period of minutes by application of CNO to the ventral surface of the medulla, and careful titration of the dose and infusion rate of Alst injected into the preBötC.</p><p>We note AAV2/5 can retrogradely transfect of some types of afferent neurons, e.g., injections of AAV2/5 into the entorhinal cortex retrogradely labels a subset of dentate gyrus neurons, but not the dense afferent projections from other nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aschauer et al., 2013</xref>). We assert that our results are unlikely to be confounded by retrograde transfection of distant neurons: i) Other than the injection site, we found no labeling of medullary neurons following transfection of the pF<sub>L</sub> with AAV2/5 viruses that coexpress mCitrine with a DREADD receptor, in this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>) or our previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>) study; ii) CNO was applied directly to the ventral medullary surface, and the effective concentration for receptor activation would be limited to the first few hundred microns beneath the ventral surface, and; iii) we find essentially the same effects of activation of neurons in the pF<sub>L</sub> as optogenetic photoactivation of the same neurons transfected with lentivirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>), which is not retrogradely transported.</p><p>Here we discuss the output of the preBötC and pF<sub>L</sub>, which ultimately form the final output of the respiratory network. Though we do not refer to other nuclei, we do not rule out their contribution to the control of respiration; for example following silencing of the preBötC, the increase in chemosensory drive to the respiratory oscillators, may come from increased drive from other respiratory-related nuclei, such as the pontine nuclei, i.e., locus coreleus, parabrachial nucleus, and the Kolliker Fuse nucleus, the ventral respiratory group or other medullary nuclei, i.e., RTN/pF<sub>V</sub>, medullary raphe, nucleus tractus solitarii, or even astrocytes. In addition, due to the necessity to perform injections into the medulla, we were unable to record directly from the preBötC or pF<sub>L</sub>. Therefore, the activity of the preBötC and pF<sub>L,</sub> was assessed by motor output recorded from respiratory muscles, which may not always reflect the activity of these oscillators, as they may have subthreshold activity, e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kam et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Many rhythmic behaviors are driven by neural networks that (presumably) contain coupled oscillators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grillner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goulding, 2009</xref>).

The pF<sub>L</sub> is the subsidiary conditional oscillator, quiescent at rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Di</xref>); in the presence of concurrent, or reduced, preBötC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and appropriate inputs, such as an increase in expiratory drive through activation of exogenous receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>) or altered blood gases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>), the pF<sub>L</sub> drives active expiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Dii</xref>). In the absence of preBötC activity, chemosensory drive increases network excitability and drives active expiration, though abdominal activity is tonic due to a lack of phasic inhibition from the preBötC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Diii</xref>). However, the pF<sub>L</sub> appears incapable of independently driving respiratory movements in the adult rat when preBötC activity is silenced by exogenous receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9Div</xref>) or when preBötC activity is low and blood gases are normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9Dv</xref>). As preBötC neurons project to the pF<sub>V</sub> but do not appear to project to the pF<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2010</xref>), excitatory drive from the preBötC to the pF<sub>L</sub> is most likely through an intermediate excitatory relay, such as the pF<sub>V</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Dii</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Silencing the preBötC leads to quantal slowing of breathing and transmission of burstlets to motoneuron pools</title><p>Hyperpolarizing preBötC neurons initially decreased <italic>f</italic>, V<sub>T</sub>, and ∫Dia<sub>EMG</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tan et al., 2008</xref>).

Concurrently, as drive within the preBötC diminished and chemosensory drive increased, presumptive burstlets in the preBötC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kam et al., 2013</xref>) appeared to be transmitted to motor pools, leading to low level inspiratory motor activity, i.e., ∫Dia<sub>EMG</sub> and ∫GG<sub>EMG</sub>, resulting in minimal inspiratory airflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). Here, lowered drive in the preBötC from activation of the allatostatin receptor creates burstlets in the preBötC; under normal conditions these burstlet signals are not strong enough to drive motor activity. However, increased excitability in the premotor and motor network caused by increased chemosensory drive (from decreased ventilation) causes these normally subthreshold events to become suprathreshold, and thus these burstlets are transmitted to the motor output. During quantal slowing of breathing, inspiratory activity on the Dia<sub>EMG</sub> and GG<sub>EMG</sub> was interspersed with Abd<sub>EMG</sub> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A–B</xref>).

These observations are consistent with our hypothesis that burstlets originate in the preBötC and, under atypical conditions can be transmitted to motoneuron pools to be seen as small events in muscle EMGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kam et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Silencing the preBötC leads first to active expiration then to apnea</title><p>Following hyperpolarization of preBötC neurons by activation of AlstRs, active expiration appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9Dii</xref>).

Following apnea during ventilation to maintain blood gases, when pF<sub>L</sub> neurons were excited by activation of HM<sub>3</sub>DRs there were three phases to the re-initiation of breathing. Initially, soon after silencing the preBötC, no inspiratory or expiratory activity was seen, even in the absence of mechanical ventilation. Next, presumably as the effect of Alst on preBötC neurons was waning, no inspiratory or expiratory activity was seen during ventilation, but spontaneous breathing was present upon removal from the ventilator. Here, spontaneous breathing was likely due to increased chemosensory drive to the preBötC overcoming the waning hyperpolarizing effect of the Alst on preBötC neurons. Ultimately, as spontaneous breathing continued and chemosensory drive diminished, rats would once again become apneic and require mechanical ventilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>). During this phase, upon removal from the ventilator, ∫Abd<sub>EMG</sub> did not return until inspiratory motor, and presumably preBötC, activity reached a threshold level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>). Finally, spontaneous breathing occurred during ventilation, once the effect of Alst on preBötC neurons had worn off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). During this phase, inspiratory activity on the GG<sub>EMG</sub> and Dia<sub>EMG</sub> always returned before Abd<sub>EMG</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). At no time during mechanical ventilation, or during the periods where rats were <italic>briefly</italic> removed from the ventilator, did active expiration occur in the absence of inspiration. As blood gases were normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), the loss of expiratory activity is unlikely to be due to excessive hypoxia or hypercapnia. Thus there appears to be a minimum level of respiratory network excitability required for active expiration. In the absence of preBötC activity, this network excitability may be provided by chemosensory drive, accounting for the ∫Abd<sub>EMG</sub> activity seen shortly before the onset of apnea. However following recovery from apnea the increase in network excitability is provided by the preBötC either directly through its extensive excitatory projections throughout the respiratory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2010</xref>), e.g., the pF<sub>V</sub> that can modulate expiratory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>), or indirectly when V<sub>T</sub> became large enough to induce mechanosensory feedback (that can provide expiratory drive, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Remmers, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Davies and Roumy, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janczewski and Feldman, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Summary</title><p>We have developed a new strategy using complementary pharmacogenetics for studying coupled oscillator systems. By independently altering the excitability of two anatomically and functionally separate respiratory oscillators, we have uncovered a fundamental interaction and further delineated their role within the breathing CPG. We conclude that though respiration results from the interaction of two distinct oscillators, the preBötC (inspiration) and the pF<sub>L</sub> (expiration) are not organized as symmetrical half centers. Instead in the adult rat, the preBötC is the dominant oscillator and the pF<sub>L</sub> is the subsidiary conditional oscillator that is normally suppressed at rest; whereas the preBötC can drive breathing alone, the pF<sub>L</sub>﻿ is unable to drive breathing (including active expiration) in the absence of an additional form of network excitation, i.e., ongoing rhythmic preBötC activity sufficient to drive inspiratory motor output or increased chemosensory drive when changes in blood gases are below the threshold where hypoxia is sufficient to inhibit abdominal muscle recruitment. This hierarchy is established by the sensitivity of the system to each oscillator, even when preBötC drive is low, it is able to drive inspiratory bursts and inhibit expiration, whereas even when pF<sub>L</sub> drive is high, it requires a certain amount of network excitability from other sources to drive expiratory activity. This asymmetrical organization may be relevant to other neural networks that contain hierarchically organized coupled oscillators for pattern generation, such as may underlie the asymmetrical acts of flexion and extension in locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grillner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Talpalar et al., 2013</xref>).

Rats were placed supine in a stereotaxic apparatus on a heating pad to maintain body temperature at 37 ± 0.5°C. The trachea was cannulated, and respiratory flow was monitored via a flow head (GM Instruments, UK). A capnograph (Type 340: Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) was connected to the tracheal tube to monitor expired CO<sub>2</sub>, as a proxy of blood gases homeostasis. Paired electromyographic (EMG) wires (Cooner Wire Co, Chatsworth, CA) were inserted into genioglossal (GG), diaphragmatic (Dia), and oblique abdominal muscles (Abd). Anterior neck muscles were removed, a basiooccipital craniotomy exposed the ventral medullary surface, and the dura was resected. A bilateral vagotomy was performed to remove confounding factors such as feedback from lung stretch receptors that can drive abdominal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janczewski and Feldman, 2006</xref>), after which exposed tissue around the neck and mylohyoid muscle were covered with dental putty (Reprosil; Dentsply Caulk, Milford, DE) to prevent drying. As micturition is inhibited under anesthesia, rats bladders were expressed preceding and during the experiment to remove any risk of autonomic dysreflexia from bladder distension; to maintain fluid balance rats were given an IP injection of saline every time the bladder was expressed. Rats were left for 30 min for breathing to stabilize. At rest, spontaneous breathing consisted of alternating active inspiration and passive expiration. From a ventral approach allatostatin (Alst; 10 μM; ~100-200 nL; Antagene Inc, Sunnyvale, CA) in sterile saline was injected bilaterally into the preBötC to hyperpolarize neurons transfected by AlstRs. Coordinates were (lateral from the basilar artery, caudal from the rostral hypoglossal nerve rootlet, dorsal from the ventral surface in mm): preBötC; (2.0, 0.6, 0.7). Small adjustments were made to avoid puncturing blood vessels. Rats were ventilated for the duration of ensuing apnea. After breathing stabilized, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 90 µM; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) in sterile saline was applied to the ventral medullary surface to depolarize pF<sub>L</sub> neurons transfected with HM<sub>3</sub>DRs. Once breathing stabilized, rats received a second set of bilateral injections of Alst. Though rats were ventilated with room air for the duration of ensuing apnea, they were intermittently removed from the ventilator to assess spontaneous breathing, and drives to inspiration and expiration. Ventilation depths and speed were chosen to match end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> to that when the rat was spontaneously breathing room air. Once rats were spontaneously breathing and no longer required ventilation, CNO was removed from the ventral surface of the medulla and the medulla was washed in PBS. All 8 rats underwent the entire procedure, i.e., there were 8 biological replicates, and were only exposed to each condition once, i.e., there were no technical replicates. In age-matched rats not transfected with AlstR- or HM<sub>3</sub>DR-expressing AAVs, we injected Alst into the preBötC or applied CNO to the medullary surface to see if these protocols produced non-specific effects All 8 rats underwent the entire procedure, i.e., there were 8 biological replicates, and were only exposed to each condition once, i.e., there were no technical replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Localization of transfected neurons</title><p>Rats were sacrificed by overdose of urethane and transcardially perfused with saline followed by cold (4°C) paraformaldehyde (PFA; 4%).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Interactions between respiratory oscillators in adult rats&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We recognize that this study describes the novel observation that active expiration turns tonic if the preBötzinger complex is experimentally silenced. The reviewers congratulate you and your co-authors for the cutting-edge approaches that allowed you to independently lesion the preBötzinger complex and pFRG region. Based on these manipulations, you and your co- authors conclude that active expiration (and the oscillator in the pFRG) requires rhythmic inhibition from the preBötC to generate expiration in the adult. Since this is not the case in juvenile animals, you proposed that there must be a developmental change in the role of the pFRG in breathing.</p><p>The decision to reject is based on the reviewers' major concern that these experiments do not suffice to justify your major conclusion. In all cases silencing the preBötzinger complex is associated with an apnea while the animal is not ventilated. Under these conditions it cannot be avoided that the animal will become hypoxic. Thus, it is not clear whether the cessation of inspiration and expiration is due to the cessation of the preBötzinger complex or the hypoxic conditions associated with the apnea. It is well-known that hypoxic conditions will lead to the cessation of inspiration and expiration. It is also well known that adults are more sensitive to hypoxia than juveniles/neonates.</p><p>Thus, the reviewers demand an additional set of new experiments. To justify your conclusion it is critical to silence the preBötC while ventilating the animal, show stable oxygenation in the absence of preBötC activity, and then demonstrate whether under these physiologically stable conditions active expiration can be induced, persists or disappears when inspiration ceases neuronally. These experiments will not be feasible within the allowed two months, hence we will not be able to consider your paper. For further details, please see the individual reviews.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This study is an extension of a discovery that was made ten years ago (J.Physiol. 2006) indicating that two rhythm generators underlie the control of breathing: the preBötC for Inspiration, and the pFRG (first discovered by Onimaru) responsible for expiration (&quot;active expiration&quot;). The study does not contribute any new insights to this well-known concept, since this concept has been demonstrated not only in juveniles (the original 2006 study), but also in adults (J. Neuroscience, same lead author).</p><p>The only new discovery is based on the observation that active expiration turns tonic if the preBötzinger complex is lesioned/silenced. This observation leads the authors to conclude that active expiration (and the oscillator in the pFRG) requires rhythmic inhibition from the preBötC to generate expiration in the adult. The authors conclude, that there must be a developmental change in the role of the pFRG in breathing.</p><p>However, based on the experiments submitted here, this conclusion is not justified.</p><p>In all cases when apnea is induced by lesioning/silencing the preBötzinger complex the animal is not ventilated. This means, the animal will be exposed to severe hypoxia, which could (and will) indirectly induce the apnea and cessation of inspiration and expiration. This is a well-known phenomenon, and not at all surprising.</p><p>Thus, in order to arrive at the conclusion that the authors propose in this study, they need to add new experiments i.e. block or silence the preBötC while ventilating the animal show stable oxygenation and induce active expiration and then see whether under these physiologically stable conditions active expiration persists or disappears when inspiration ceases. Given that this is the major conclusion on which this paper rests, this experiment is absolutely essential.</p><p>Another major issue is the interpretation of the quantal slowing. First, it would be interesting to relate this to expiration, as has been done in prior studies. Secondly, the interpretation/speculation that the quantal slowing is explained by the presence of burstlets is not based on any experiment. These burstlets as far as I understand the original publication are &quot;subthreshold&quot; oscillations within the respiratory rhythm generator – without burst generation. If this is the case, how would the authors explain the transmission of these subthreshold oscillations to the motor output?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>I congratulate the investigators on a well-conducted study and a well-written manuscript that provides a significant advancement in understanding of mechanisms of respiratory rhythm generation. I am not requesting any specific changes in the manuscript prior to publication. However, I have a few suggestions for the authors to consider for additions to the discussion.</p><p>First, rostral pontine nuclei provide an important contribution to the control of breathing. What are the authors' speculations regarding this contribution to the two oscillators shown herein?</p><p>Second, what are the authors' thoughts on interactions between these two respiratory oscillators during normal physiological conditions particularly under conditions of NREM and REM sleep?</p><p>Third, this study shows the effects of acute, brief alterations in activity of the two oscillators. What happens when either one of the oscillators is altered on a long term or chronic basis? Studies by J. Wenninger et al., K. Krause et al., and S. Neumueller et al. seem to indicate that there is plasticity within the respiratory rhythm generation system.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Authors investigated the interaction between two coupled oscillators in the lower brainstem of anesthetized adult rats. This is an important issue in neuroscience. The experimental design is straightforward and results are clear. However, I found some problems in the interpretation of results.</p><p>General comments:</p><p>The most important findings seemed to be that active expiration could not be induced when preBötC inspiratory driven activity was suppressed, based on results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>. Indeed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (and also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) shows that cessation of rhythmic inspiratory activity after Alst injection in preBötC was followed by disappearance of Abd activity. Consequently, authors concluded that in adult rats active expiration is driven by the pF<sub>L</sub> but requires ongoing preBötC activity. My concern is that these results may be due to transient unphysiological condition like extremely high CO<sub>2</sub> (and low O<sub>2</sub>) of blood gases. To avoid such unphysiological situation, therefore, experiments should be done under following conditions to verify their hypothesis; using ventilator, CO<sub>2</sub> level should be kept in suitable values to induce Abd activity in the presence (or absence) of CNO, then injection of Alst to preBötC should be performed to stop Dia activity and to examine Abd activity.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, they showed quantal inhibition of Dia activity. This result is very important, although they did not discuss much about this result. If possible, authors should also show Abd activity (or GG activity) together with Dia activity during quantal slowing. Analysis of such data may be useful to discuss interaction of two oscillators. The quantal inhibition of respiratory rhythm is known in newborn (and maybe juvenile) animal. Can this phenomenon in the present study be explained in similar mechanisms of interaction between two coupled oscillators like newborn rodent? It would be also helpful for further understanding of coupled oscillator to discuss whether there are any other examples of such quantal inhibition in adult animal.</p><p>Related to above questions, activity of two oscillators was assessed by motor neuron outputs in the present study. Central activity of oscillators may not always appear in motor output; i.e. motor output may be not equivalent to central activity to determine CPG property.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Discussion section, &quot;Shortly after birth (&gt;1 day), the breathing central pattern generator (CPG) is driven by the preBötC (Oku et al., 2007) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Biv</xref>), and…”: This part is questionable. This optical recording paper seemed to show no direct evidence for postnatal change of the CPG and there is no electrophysiological study to support this idea. More accurate explanation is needed.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Interactions between respiratory oscillators in adult rats&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a revision of a previously submitted manuscript. The authors have done a great job in addressing the reviewers’ comments. I have no further comments. But I think it is a solid contribution to the field, and the findings are novel and of general interest. The finding that the pFRG oscillator requires input from the preBötC is surprising which makes this paper very interesting.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I know there were concerns previously that the absence of expiratory activity during prolonged silencing of the preBötC could be due to the effect of hypoxia on expiratory muscle activity. However the discussion in subsection “Respiratory network activity is a requirement for active expiration” seems to counter this concern. That is as the effect of hyperpolarizing effect of Alst on preBötC neurons progressively diminished, the rats were ventilated but upon removal from the ventilator, Abd activity did not return until presumably preBötC activity reached a threshold level. Dia and GG activity always returned before Abd activity. When the rats were ventilated to maintain normal blood gases, there was no Abd activity when the rats were briefly removed from the ventilator; thus, it does not seem that hypoxia could be causing the depressed Abd activity. Accordingly, I accept their point that a minimal amount of preBötC activity seems to be necessary drive the expiratory oscillator.</p><p>On the other hand, I am concerned by the conclusion as stated in the Abstract that &quot;in anesthetized adult rats, active expiration is driven by the pF<sub>L</sub> but requires an additional form of network excitation, i.e., ongoing rhythmic preBötC activity sufficient to drive inspiratory motor output or increased chemosensory drive&quot;. If increased chemosensory drive can drive the pF<sub>L</sub> oscillator, then why doesn't the eventual severe hypercapnia during apnea produced by silencing the preBötC activate expiratory muscle activity? Am I missing something?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14203.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>We recognize that this study describes the novel observation that active expiration turns tonic if the preBötzinger complex is experimentally silenced.

In light of the reviewers comments we have performed additional analysis of the data to support our findings.</p><p>We have provided an addition panel to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> from rats we ventilated in the presence of CNO (Pink shading) where end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> was maintained at normal resting levels (~45 mmHg). This panel shows that active expiration could occur during ventilation, and that no expiratory activity was seen until inspiratory activity returned during ventilation.</p><p>Furthermore, upon revising the manuscript we realized that certain statements made within the text could have been made clearer; for example that in the absence of preBӧtC activity, active expiration can occur in the presence of increased chemosensory drive.

We are unaware of any paper (ours or anyone else’s) that looks at active expiration after silencing the preBötC, or how inspiratory and expiratory oscillators interact to pattern breathing in the adult rat. Thus this study does indeed contribute several key new insights to this “well-known” concept.</p><p><italic>The only new discovery is based on the observation that active expiration turns tonic if the preBötzinger complex is lesioned/silenced. This observation leads the authors to conclude that active expiration (and the oscillator in the pFRG) requires rhythmic inhibition from the preBötC to generate expiration in the adult. The authors conclude, that there must be a developmental change in the role of the pFRG in breathing.</italic></p><p>This reviewer’s surmise of our conclusion is not what we intended to convey; our fault for not making our conclusion sufficiently transparent. We did not say that active expiration requires inhibitory input; rather we said that the phasic pattern of expiration requires inhibition from the preBötC. This is based on the observation that when the preBötC stops firing (including preBötC inhibitory neurons) then the expiratory rhythm transforms from phasic to tonic; this is an idea first proposed by Sears and colleagues. We stated in the Discussion section “We suggest, like Sears et al., that near the transition from eupnea to apnea, expiratory activity is phasic due to periodic inhibition of tonic activity during inspiration, and becomes tonic once the phasic inspiratory inhibition is lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2Bii-iii</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7Bii</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9Diii</xref>). We suggest the loss of phasic inhibition is the result of silencing of inhibitory preBötC inspiratory neurons by Alst (Kuwana et al., 2006; Morgado-Valle et al., 2010), implying a significant role for inhibitory preBötC neurons in shaping expiratory output.”</p><p>Moreover, we actually postulated that silencing of inhibitory neurons in the preBӧtC may actually increase expiratory activity, through disinhibition of the pF<sub>L</sub>. As we stated “Alternatively, active expiration could be due to disinhibition of a conditional expiratory oscillator resulting from a loss of (presumptive) inhibitory preBötC drive (Kuwana et al., 2006; Morgado-Valle et al., 2010) to the pF<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Dii</xref>).”</p><p><italic>However, based on the experiments submitted here, this conclusion is not justified.</italic></p><p><italic>In all cases when apnea is induced by lesioning/silencing the preBötzinger complex the animal is not ventilated. This means, the animal will be exposed to severe hypoxia, which could (and will) indirectly induce the apnea and cessation of inspiration and expiration. This is a well-known phenomenon, and not at all surprising.</italic></p><p>We explicitly acknowledged the inhibitory effect of hypoxia, and its role in the cessation of on expiratory activity. As we stated in the Discussion section “when inspiratory motor outflow disappeared and hypercapnia and hypoxia inexorably increased, active expiration ceased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9Div</xref>, see also Tan et al., 2008), perhaps due to the inhibitory effect of severe hypoxia on expiratory motor output (Sears et al., 1982; Fregosi et al., 1987)”.</p><p>In fact, it is most likely the hypercapnia and hypoxia during hypopnea that allows tonic activity of abdominal muscles to continue after inspiratory activity ceases. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, where there is expiratory activity without activation of HM<sub>3</sub>DRs in the pF<sub>L</sub>, and stated in the Discussion section “In either case, active expiration could have been due to increased hypoxic and/or hypercapnic drive to the pF<sub>L</sub> as inspiratory movements waned”</p><p><italic>Thus, in order to arrive at the conclusion that the authors propose in this study, they need to add new experiments. I.e. block or silence the preBötC while ventilating the animal show stable oxygenation and induce active expiration and then see whether under these physiologically stable conditions active expiration persists or disappears when inspiration ceases. Given that this is the major conclusion on which this paper rests, this experiment is absolutely essential.</italic></p><p>Even though we acknowledge the role of hypoxia on the cessation of expiratory activity, a careful examination of the data and a conservative interpretation leads to the parsimonious conclusion that hypoxia per se could NOT have participated in the absence of expiration activity during ventilation, or the delay in expiratory activity following removal from the ventilator. Rats were ventilated on average for ~18 min following the onset apnea after which removal from the ventilator led to the onset of inspiratory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>). Thus, rats were normoxic for ~18 min during which time the pF<sub>L</sub> was being excited by the activation of HM<sub>3</sub>DRs and the preBötC was inhibited by activation of AlstRs and presumably silent; during this time, no abdominal activity was seen. That expiratory activity returned within 30 secs of being removed from the ventilator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, B</xref>) means that the HM<sub>3</sub>DRs were still driving the pF<sub>L</sub>, and the pF<sub>L</sub> was still capable of driving abdominal activity. The lack of abdominal activity during ventilation was not the result of mechanical actions of the ventilator, as expiratory activity was apparent during ventilation towards the end of the experiment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Therefore, the most parsimonious explanation for the lack of abdominal activity during ventilation when inspiratory motor activity is absent is that expiratory drive from the pF<sub>L</sub> alone is insufficient to drive expiration and requires an additional source of network excitation, such as inspiratory activity or chemosensory drive.</p><p>We have added a new panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, panel D, to show that expiration returns after inspiratory activity, and that abdominal activity can still occur during ventilation. We have also expanded the Results, Discussion and Summary to make this clearer.</p><p>Results section”: “Rats were mechanically ventilated to restore CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> levels to within the normal range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). […] Therefore, following silencing of the preBötC with Alst in the presence of CNO to drive the pF<sub>L</sub> at no time during the re-initiation of spontaneous breathing, either with or without mechanical ventilation, did active expiration occur in the absence of inspiratory activity and chemosensory drive.”</p><p>Discussion section: “Following apnea during ventilation to maintain blood gases, when pF<sub>L</sub>neurons were excited by activation of HM<sub>3</sub>DRs there were three phases to the re-initiation of breathing. […] As blood gases were normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), the loss of expiratory activity is unlikely to be due to excessive hypoxia or hypercapnia.”</p><p>Summary: “the pF<sub>L</sub> is unable to drive breathing (including active expiration) in the absence of an additional form of network excitation, i.e., preBötC activity or chemosensory drive. This hierarchy is established by the sensitivity of the system to each oscillator, even when preBӧtC drive is low, it is able to drive inspiratory bursts and inhibit expiration, whereas even when pF<sub>L</sub> drive is high, it requires a certain amount of network excitability from other sources to drive expiratory activity.”</p><p>It was in fact essential to the conclusions of this paper that rats were allowed to become moderately hypercapnic and moderately hypoxic during the hypopnea leading up to the apnea, as this allowed us to see that in the absence of inspiratory activity, abdominal activity could persist if network excitability was increased by chemosensory drive, if only for a short period until it was inhibited by severe hypoxia. Furthermore, following apnea rats were immediately placed on the ventilator to remove hypoxic inhibition of expiratory activity, which showed that in conditions with no preBötC activity and no hypercapnic drive in normoxic conditions there was no expiratory activity. The experimental design allowed us to assess expiratory activity under the following conditions.</p><p><table-wrap id="tblu1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p>pF<sub>L</sub> activity</p></td><td valign="top"><p>preBӧtC activity</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Hypercapnia</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Hypoxia</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Abdominal activity</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>No</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Yes</p></td><td valign="top"><p>No</p></td><td valign="top"><p>No</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Absent</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>Yes (driven by CO<sub>2</sub>)</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Low</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Moderate</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Moderate</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Phasic</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>Yes (driven by CO<sub>2</sub>)</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Absent</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Moderate</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Moderate</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Tonic</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>No (inhibited by hypoxia)</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Absent</p></td><td valign="top"><p>High</p></td><td valign="top"><p>High</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Absent</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>No</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Absent</p></td><td valign="top"><p>No</p></td><td valign="top"><p>No</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Absent</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>Yes (driven by HM<sub>3</sub>DR)</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Yes</p></td><td valign="top"><p>No</p></td><td valign="top"><p>No</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Phasic</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>Yes (driven by HM<sub>3</sub>DR and CO<sub>2</sub>)</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Low</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Moderate</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Moderate</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Phasic</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>Yes (driven by HM<sub>3</sub>DR and CO<sub>2</sub>)</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Absent</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Moderate</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Moderate</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Tonic</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>Yes (driven by HM<sub>3</sub>DR, but inhibited by hypoxia)</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Absent</p></td><td valign="top"><p>High</p></td><td valign="top"><p>High</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Absent</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>Yes (driven by HM<sub>3</sub>DR)</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Absent</p></td><td valign="top"><p>No</p></td><td valign="top"><p>No</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Absent</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>We have also expanded the Methods section to make our protocol clearer. “Though rats were ventilated with room air for the duration of ensuing apnea, they were intermittently removed from the ventilator to assess spontaneous breathing, and drives to inspiration and expiration. […] Once rats were spontaneously breathing and no longer required ventilation, CNO was removed from the ventral surface of the medulla and the medulla was washed in PBS.”</p><p><italic>Another major issue is the interpretation of the quantal slowing. First, it would be interesting to relate this to expiration, as has been done in prior studies. Secondly, the interpretation/speculation that the quantal slowing is explained by the presence of burstlets is not based on any experiment. These burstlets as far as I understand the original publication are &quot;subthreshold&quot; oscillations within the respiratory rhythm generator – without burst generation. If this is the case, how would the authors explain the transmission of these subthreshold oscillations to the motor output?</italic></p><p>In our original burstlet paper (Kam et al. 2013), burstlets are by definition subthreshold events. However, as made clear in Kam et al. 2013 paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and the associated text), burstlets can be transmitted to motor output if specific conditions are met; namely lowered excitability in preBötC with increased drive to respiratory motor pools. We believe that these conditions are met in our experiments: lowered drive in the preBötC resulting from activation of the allatostatin receptor depresses bursting while burstlets may continue in the preBötC. Under normal conditions burstlets are not strong enough to drive activity in motor pools. However, increased excitability in the motor pools caused by increased chemosensory drive (from decreased ventilation) causes these normally subthreshold events to become suprathreshold and thus these burstlets are transmitted to the motor pool. As we stated in the Results section, <underline>“</underline>This low amplitude Dia<sub>EMG</sub> and airflow activity are postulated to represent the inspiratory motor outflow, i.e., EMG, manifestation of preBötC burstlets (Kam et al., 2013), i.e., low levels of rhythmogenic neural population activity in the preBötC that under normal conditions occur in the absence of motor output, being transmitted to motoneuron pools (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> in Kam et al., 2013).”</p><p>We have also expanded the Discussion to make this clearer. “Here, lowered drive in the preBötC from activation of the allatostatin receptor creates burstlets in the preBötC; under normal conditions these burstlet signals are not strong enough to drive motor activity. […] Interestingly, even when expiratory activity was at its highest, low level preBötC activity, as seen as burstlets on the Dia<sub>EMG</sub> and GG<sub>EMG</sub> was still able to inhibit Abd<sub>EMG</sub> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Bii</xref>).”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>I congratulate the investigators on a well-conducted study and a well-written manuscript that provides a significant advancement in understanding of mechanisms of respiratory rhythm generation. I am not requesting any specific changes in the manuscript prior to publication. However, I have a few suggestions for the authors to consider for additions to the discussion.</italic></p><p><italic>First, rostral pontine nuclei provide an important contribution to the control of breathing. What are the authors' speculations regarding this contribution to the two oscillators shown herein?</italic></p><p><italic>Second, what are the authors' thoughts on interactions between these two respiratory oscillators during normal physiological conditions particularly under conditions of NREM and REM sleep?</italic></p><p><italic>Third, this study shows the effects of acute, brief alterations in activity of the two oscillators. What happens when either one of the oscillators is altered on a long term or chronic basis? Studies by J. Wenninger et al., K. Krause et al., and S. Neumueller et al. seem to indicate that there is plasticity within the respiratory rhythm generation system.</italic></p><p>We are delighted that this reviewer enjoyed our manuscript. Although no specific changes were requested, we did consider the reviewer’s suggestions in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Though the contribution of respiratory-related areas to network output is beyond the remits of this study, we do not in any way rule it out. In fact some of the chemosensory drive seen during moderate hypercapnia and hypoxia likely comes from sources outside of the preBötC and pF<sub>L</sub>. So as not to break up the flow of the discussion we have added a section to the technical considerations section to discuss this possibility. Results section “Here we discuss the output of the preBötC and pF<sub>L</sub>, which ultimately form the final output of the respiratory network. […]Therefore, the activity of the preBötC and pF<sub>L,</sub> was assessed by motor output recorded from respiratory muscles, which may not always reflect the activity of these oscillators, as they may have subthreshold activity, e.g., Kam et al., 2013.”</p><p>In adult rats, there is no expiratory activity seen during sleep under normal physiological conditions, so we expect the interaction between the oscillators to be the same during sleep as they are during quiet wakefulness. To make this clear we have slightly expanded the line in the Introduction section to read: “In mammals at rest, during wakefulness and sleep, when active breathing movements are primarily inspiratory, generation of the underlying rhythm appears driven by the preBötC”.</p><p>The effect of chronic lesioning of the respiratory oscillators and network compensation for these changes is complicated. The Neumueller et al. 2011 paper, shows that destruction of the preBӧtC can be compensated for if the lesion occurs incrementally over time, however the Tupal et al. 2014 paper shows that loss of DBX1 neurons from birth cannot be compensated for. To properly address this subject would take considerable discussion in the manuscript, thus to keep our discussion concise we have not covered this subject in this paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>Authors investigated the interaction between two coupled oscillators in the lower brainstem of anesthetized adult rats. This is an important issue in neuroscience. The experimental design is straightforward and results are clear. However, I found some problems in the interpretation of results.</italic></p><p><italic>General comments:</italic></p><p><italic>The most important findings seemed to be that active expiration could not be induced when preBötC inspiratory driven activity was suppressed, based on results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>. Indeed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (and also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) shows that cessation of rhythmic inspiratory activity after Alst injection in preBötC was followed by disappearance of Abd activity. Consequently, authors concluded that in adult rats active expiration is driven by the pF<sub>L</sub> but requires ongoing preBötC activity.</italic></p><p>This is partly correct, we do conclude that preBӧtC is a requirement for rats who are normoxic and normocapnic, hence the return of inspiratory activity always precedes the return of expiratory activity following apnea and ventilation. However, we conclude that expiratory activity can occur in the absence of inspiration if chemosensory drive is high, hence the appearance of tonic abdominal activity following the cessation of inspiratory activity. We concluded that expiratory activity requires a certain level of network activity from another source, either inspiratory activity or chemosensory drive. As we stated “Thus there appears to be a minimum level of respiratory network excitability required for active expiration. […] However following recovery from apnea the increase in network excitability is provided by the preBötC either directly through its extensive excitatory projections throughout the respiratory network (Tan et al., 2010), e.g., the pF<sub>V</sub> that can modulate to expiratory activity (Marina et al., 2010; Huckstepp et al., 2015), or indirectly when V<sub>T</sub> became large enough to induce mechanosensory feedback (that can provide expiratory drive (Remmers, 1973; Davies and Roumy, 1986; Janczewski and Feldman, 2006))”</p><p>We have also expanded the Abstract, Introduction, Discussion and Summary to make this clearer.</p><p>Introduction: “We conclude that in anesthetized adult rats active expiration is driven by the pF<sub>L</sub> but requires an additional form of network excitation, i.e., ongoing rhythmic preBötC activity sufficient to drive inspiratory motor output or increased chemosensory drive.”</p><p>Introduction: “Importantly, we found that active expiration could not be induced when preBötC inspiratory driven motor activity was suppressed and chemosensory drive was absent, indicating that in adult rats active expiration is driven by the pF<sub>L</sub> but requires an additional source of network excitation such as ongoing preBötC activity or chemosensory drive.”</p><p>Discussion section: “The pF<sub>L</sub> is the subsidiary conditional oscillator, quiescent at rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Di</xref>); in the presence of concurrent, or reduced, preBötC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and appropriate inputs, such as an increase in expiratory drive through activation of exogenous receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, see also Pagliardini et al., 2011) or altered blood gases (Huckstepp et al., 2015), the pF<sub>L</sub> drives active expiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Dii</xref>). In the absence of preBötC activity, chemosensory drive increases network excitability and drives active expiration, though abdominal activity is tonic due to a lack of phasic inhibition from the preBötC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Diii</xref>).”</p><p>Summary: “the pF<sub>L</sub> is unable to drive breathing (including active expiration) in the absence of an additional form of network excitation, i.e., preBötC activity or chemosensory drive.

To avoid such unphysiological situation, therefore, experiments should be done under following conditions to verify their hypothesis; using ventilator, CO<sub>2</sub> level should be kept in suitable values to induce Abd activity in the presence (or absence) of CNO, then injection of Alst to preBötC should be performed to stop Dia activity and to examine Abd activity.</italic></p><p>For CO<sub>2</sub> levels to be kept in suitable values to induce Abd activity in the absence of CNO, the rat would have to be chronically hypercapnic. In that situation, we would expect abdominal activity to continue, as chemosensory drive can drive abdominal activity in the absence of inspiratory activity, see previous answer. As discussed above, our experimental design allowed us to test the interactions of the preBötC and pF<sub>L</sub> under an array of conditions. See table above.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, they showed quantal inhibition of Dia activity. This result is very important, although they did not discuss much about this result. If possible, authors should also show Abd activity (or GG activity) together with Dia activity during quantal slowing. Analysis of such data may be useful to discuss interaction of two oscillators. The quantal inhibition of respiratory rhythm is known in newborn (and maybe juvenile) animal. Can this phenomenon in the present study be explained in similar mechanisms of interaction between two coupled oscillators like newborn rodent? It would be also helpful for further understanding of coupled oscillator to discuss whether there are any other examples of such quantal inhibition in adult animal?</italic></p><p>The effect of quantal slowing on ABD and GG in conjunction with Dia can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7Bii</xref>, and so was not included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, which shows burstlet activity and how quantal slowing was calculated. We have added the following sentence to expand on this in the Discussion, “During quantal slowing of breathing, inspiratory activity on the Dia<sub>EMG</sub> and GG<sub>EMG</sub> was interspersed with Abd<sub>EMG</sub> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A-B</xref>). Interestingly, even when expiratory activity was at its highest, low level preBötC activity, as seen as burstlets on the Dia<sub>EMG</sub> and GG<sub>EMG</sub> was still able to inhibit Abd<sub>EMG</sub> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Bii</xref>).”</p><p><italic>Related to above questions, activity of two oscillators was assessed by motor neuron outputs in the present study. Central activity of oscillators may not always appear in motor output; i.e. motor output may be not equivalent to central activity to determine CPG property.</italic></p><p>We agree that motor output may not always reflect oscillator activity, as described in our burstlet paper (Kam et al., 2013). We added the following statement to the technical considerations section to make this clear. “In addition, due to the necessity to perform injections into the medulla, we were unable to record directly from the preBötC or pF<sub>L</sub>. Therefore, the activity of the preBötC and pF<sub>L,</sub> was assessed by motor output recorded from respiratory muscles, which may not always reflect the activity of these oscillators, as they may have subthreshold activity, e.g., Kam et al., 2013.”</p><p><italic>Specific comments:</italic></p><p><italic>Discussion section, &quot;Shortly after birth (&gt;1 day), the breathing central pattern generator (CPG) is driven by the preBötC (Oku et al., 2007) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Biv</xref>), and…”: This part is questionable.

However the discussion in subsection “Respiratory network activity is a requirement for active expiration” seems to counter this concern. That is as the effect of hyperpolarizing effect of Alst on preBötC neurons progressively diminished, the rats were ventilated but upon removal from the ventilator, Abd activity did not return until presumably preBötC activity reached a threshold level. Dia and GG activity always returned before Abd activity. When the rats were ventilated to maintain normal blood gases, there was no Abd activity when the rats were briefly removed from the ventilator; thus, it does not seem that hypoxia could be causing the depressed Abd activity. Accordingly, I accept their point that a minimal amount of preBötC activity seems to be necessary drive the expiratory oscillator.</italic></p><p>We are pleased that our revisions to the manuscript have made this point clearer.</p><p><italic>On the other hand, I am concerned by the conclusion as stated in the Abstract that &quot;in anesthetized adult rats, active expiration is driven by the pF<sub>L</sub> but requires an additional form of network excitation, i.e., ongoing rhythmic preBötC activity sufficient to drive inspiratory motor output or increased chemosensory drive&quot;. If increased chemosensory drive can drive the pF<sub>L</sub> oscillator, then why doesn't the eventual severe hypercapnia during apnea produced by silencing the preBötC activate expiratory muscle activity? Am I missing something?</italic></p><p>We previously showed that both hypercapnia and hypoxia, when moderate and brief, lead to expiratory-related abdominal activity (Huckstepp et al., J Neurosci, 2016). In the paper under review, we conclude that the moderate hypercapnia and hypoxia following cessation of inspiratory activity is responsible for the tonic abdominal muscle activity at the beginning of apnea. As stated in the Discussion section “In either case, active expiration could have been due to increased hypoxic and/or hypercapnic drive to the pF<sub>L</sub> as inspiratory movements waned”. This underlies our statement in the Summary that additional network excitation from increased chemosensory drive can lead to abdominal activity in the absence of preBötC activity.</p><p>We acknowledge that severe hypoxia profoundly inhibits abdominal muscle recruitment (Fregosi et al., J Appl Physiol, 1987), suggesting that the cessation of abdominal activity during apnea is due to severe hypoxia resulting from the prolongation of the apnea. We state: “when inspiratory motor outflow disappeared and hypercapnia and hypoxia inexorably increased, active expiration ceased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9Div</xref>, see also Tan et al., 2008), perhaps due to the inhibitory effect of severe hypoxia on expiratory motor output (Sears et al., 1982; Fregosi et al., 1987)”.</p><p>Nonetheless, we maintain that a detailed examination of the data leads to the parsimonious conclusion that hypoxia does NOT underlie the absence of expiratory activity during ventilation (that assures proper gas exchange and avoids hypoxia and hypercapnia), or the delay in the onset of expiratory activity following removal from the ventilator (see the reviewer’s previous comment and section “Respiratory network activity is a requirement for active expiration for discussion”).</p><p>In our Summary and Abstract we state that an additional form of network excitation is required for active expiration in anesthetized adult rats, as even when driving the pF<sub>L</sub> by activation of the HM<sub>3</sub>D receptor, abdominal activity does not occur in the absence of another source of network excitation. We conclude that the additional network excitation necessary for recruitment of abdominal muscles can come from: 1) ongoing rhythmic preBötC activity sufficient to drive inspiratory motor output, as abdominal activity is not seen in the absence of inspiratory motor output when chemosensory drive is low or absent, or 2) increased chemosensory drive, as tonic abdominal activity is seen immediately after the cessation of inspiratory activity, when drive from the preBötC is low or absent but chemosensory drive is moderate.</p><p>We have redacted the Summary to make this point clearer: “the pF<sub>L</sub>is unable to drive breathing (including active expiration) in the absence of additional network excitation, i.e., ongoing rhythmic preBötC activity sufficient to drive inspiratory motor output or increased chemosensory drive when changes in blood gases are below the threshold where hypoxia is sufficient to inhibit abdominal muscle recruitment.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
