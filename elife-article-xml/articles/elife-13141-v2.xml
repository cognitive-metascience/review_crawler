Here we show that somatosensory feedback is transmitted to many sensory and motor cortical regions within 25 ms of a mechanical disturbance applied to the monkey’s arm. When limb feedback was salient to an ongoing motor action (task engagement), neurons in parietal area 5 immediately (~25 ms) increased their response to limb disturbances, whereas neurons in other regions did not alter their response until 15 to 40 ms later. In contrast, initiation of a motor action elicited by a limb disturbance (target selection) altered neural responses in primary motor cortex ~65 ms after the limb disturbance, and then in dorsal premotor cortex, with no effect in parietal regions until 150 ms post-perturbation. Our findings highlight broad parietofrontal circuits that provide the neural substrate for goal-directed corrections, an essential aspect of highly skilled motor behaviors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13141.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13141.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13141.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Humans and other animals can change a movement they are making in a split second, such as when a basketball player has to move around an unexpected opponent to shoot a ball through the hoop. These on-the-fly corrections rely on information about the movement that comes in from the senses. However, it was unclear how the brain and spinal cord process this sensory information to guide movement.</p><p>Omrani et al. have now recorded electrical activity from the brains of monkeys while the animals tried to keep their hand at a target. Each monkey wore a robotic exoskeleton that would occasionally move the monkey’s arm. Even if the monkey was not engaged in a motor task, a small nudge of the limb by the robot caused neural activity to spread rapidly throughout the sensory and motor regions of the cerebral cortex (the outer layer of the brain).</p><p>In some trials, when the monkey was actively trying to keep its hand at a target, the robot would again nudge the monkey’s arm slightly. Omrani et al. observed that within 25 milliseconds of this nudge, the activity in an area of the cortex called parietal area 5 responded even more, suggesting that this area was using information from the senses to actively deal with the change in arm position. This change in activity then spread to other parts of the brain.</p><p>In another set of trials, the monkey was trained to move to a second target if the robot nudged its arm. In this case, the activity in an area called the primary motor cortex increased even more, likely supporting the monkey’s ability to rapidly move to this second target. Overall, the study by Omrani et al. highlights the complex way that sensory feedback is processed in the cerebral cortex, supporting our ability to perform highly skilled motor actions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13141.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13141.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>non-human primates</kwd><kwd>sensory feedback</kwd><kwd>motor control</kwd><kwd>task dependency</kwd><kwd>mechanical perturbation</kwd><kwd>cortical response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Omrani</surname><given-names>Mohsen</given-names></name><name><surname>Murnaghan</surname><given-names>Chantelle D</given-names></name><name><surname>Pruszynski</surname><given-names>J Andrew</given-names></name><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>Stephen H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Somatosensory feedback is transmitted to many sensory and motor cortical regions within 25 milliseconds and ongoing behavioural tasks alter the spatiotemporal pattern of this perturbation-related activity, supporting rapid motor responses to attain behavioural goals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The motor system is capable of performing a wide range of skilled motor behaviors, from pouring tea in a cup to catching a ball while running. Optimal feedback control (OFC) has become an influential theory for interpreting voluntary motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2012</xref>). OFC includes state estimation (i.e. position and velocity of the body segments) based on sensory and internally generated feedback. It also includes a control policy that uses these state estimates to generate motor commands to muscles that generate movement to attain a behavioral goal. Importantly, feedback gains within the control policy are selected based on the behavioral goal.</p><p>As feedback is an essential component of OFC, an important approach to probe the properties of the motor system is to use small mechanical loads applied to the limb to disturb the motor system and observe how it responds to attain different behavioral goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott, 2004</xref>). This approach has been used to show how muscle responses are modified in under 100ms due to behavioral factors such as task instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hammond et al., 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rothwell et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pruszynski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shemmell et al., 2009</xref>), the properties of the spatial target and selection of alternate goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nashed et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Selen et al., 2012</xref>), location of obstacles in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nashed et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2014</xref>), mechanical properties of the limb and environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kurtzer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shemmell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cluff and Scott, 2013;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weiler et al., 2015</xref>), and timing constraints or task urgency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crevecoeur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Omrani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cluff and Scott, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The neural basis of this task-dependent feedback processing is, however, largely unexplored. Frontoparietal circuits are known to play an important role in voluntary control, but the focus for the last 30 years has been on motor planning and the initiation of motor actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalaska et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen and Cui, 2009</xref>). While the mathematical details of OFC are not implemented at the neural level, the OFC framework creates an important dichotomy between state estimation and the control policy. From this perspective, perturbation-related activity in a brain region that is not influenced by the behavioral goal would be associated with the former, whereas perturbation-related activity that is modified by the behavioral goal, would be associated with the latter.</p><p>There are sporadic observations that several sensory and motor cortical areas respond to mechanical loads applied to the limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tanji et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chapman et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crammond et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boudreau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weber and He, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">London and Miller, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spieser et al., 2013</xref>). However, task-dependent changes in neural activity have only been examined in primary sensory (S1) and motor cortices (M1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evarts and Tanji, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wolpaw, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Omrani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pruszynski et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the extent to which other cortical regions are involved in generating these task-dependent feedback responses (i.e. part of the control policy) remains largely unexplored. Here we use mechanical disturbances applied to the arm of non-human primates (NHPs) under multiple behavioral conditions to reveal task-dependent feedback processing across frontoparietal circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rapid transmission of limb feedback across sensory and motor cortex</title><p>Our first experiment examined the timing and magnitude of neural responses in a number of frontal and parietal cortical regions elicited by mechanical loads applied to the forelimb as monkeys maintained their hands at a central target (Posture Task, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Herter et al., 2007</xref>).

Neural activity (50 to 100 ms post-perturbation) for each trial in the neuron’s preferred torque direction was compared to the time of joint reversal (max distance from start position in joint space before returning to central target). We found the activity of 22/213 M1 neurons correlated with kinematic changes in the postural perturbation task (p&lt;0.05 threshold). This low number partially reflects our study design in which only a small number of trials were collected per load condition (n=10). Across the M1 population, the median correlation was -0.11 (p=0.002 in comparison with 0 using a Wilcoxon signed rank test). This low, although significant correlation is not surprising given that correlations between proximal arm muscle activity and motor corrections during similar time epochs are in the -0.2 or -0.3 range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crevecoeur et al., 2013</xref>). Perturbation-related activity in the other cortical regions was not significantly correlated with motor corrections although the data samples were smaller than that for M1 (median correlation coefficient, A5: -0.014, A2: -0.001, S1: -0.11, PMd: 0.03, p&gt;0.35 in all areas in comparison with 0 using a Wilcoxon signed rank test).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> displays population signals of the cells with a significant perturbation response for each cortical region. Perturbation onset time for each cortical area was calculated based on the time point when the population signal crossed 3SD above baseline activity (and remained above for at least 20 ms), highlighting that perturbation-related activity arrived quickly in all cortical regions (onset time, A5:21 ms, A2:18 ms, S1:17 ms, M1:22 ms, PMd:25 ms).</p><p>Comparisons of perturbation-related activity to baseline activity for calculating the onset time is not sensitive to sample size, but assumes variance remains constant throughout time (see Materials and methods). As an alternate method, we used a one-sample running t-test to compare when the population signal was different from baseline activity (1 ms steps). We identified the first point in time that the evoked population activity became significantly different from 0, and remained significant for at least 20 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, the first point in time the lower edge of the shaded area depicting 2SE rises above the baseline level). Response onset times, using this technique were generally similar to those observed using the 3SD technique (A5:25 ms, A2:25 ms, S1:19 ms, M1:24 ms, PMd:34 ms). Thus, sensory feedback from the limb is rapidly transmitted throughout sensory and motor cortical regions.</p><p>We used a bootstrap technique to identify the likely order of onset times for perturbation responses and task-dependency across cortical areas. To do so, we resampled (with replacement) cells in each population and then calculated the response onset and rank-order of each cortical area. We performed this procedure 10,000 times, and calculated the proportion of times each cortical area assumed a rank across the resampled data.

To rule this out, we reversed the differential sign for cells that significantly decreased their activity in the OUT versus IN target when calculating the difference in the population signals (this means we used IN-OUT in these cells rather than OUT-IN).

In this case, limb feedback is rapidly transmitted across the cortex with the greatest and earliest activity in S1 quickly followed by responses in adjacent cortical regions. The middle panel displays how the perturbation response changes between the Movie and Posture Tasks, termed 'task engagement'. In this case, the perturbation response increases immediately in A5 and then in motor cortical regions with minimal effect in primary somatosensory cortex. Finally, the bottom panel displays how perturbation responses are altered when they cue the generation of a goal-directed movement, termed 'target selection'.

At that time, the prevailing view was that task-dependent changes in long-latency motor responses, that occur 50 to 100 ms after a mechanical disturbance, were provided by a transcortical feedback pathway from primary somatosensory to primary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Desmedt, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brooks, 1986</xref>). The timing of mechanical responses in M1 are sufficiently fast to generate these long-latency responses. Classic work by Evarts and Tanji illustrated that perturbation responses in M1 could be modulated when the disturbance was the cue for the monkey to push or pull a lever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evarts and Tanji, 1974</xref>). Further studies implicated the dentate nucleus in this task-dependent feedback processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meyer-Lohmann et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vilis et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Strick, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hore and Vilis, 1984</xref>), likely through its connections to M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Orioli and Strick, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dum and Strick, 2003</xref>). Based on this evidence, it has been generally assumed that there was minimal overlap in cortical circuits involved in online feedback processing from the limb (S1 and M1), and the broad parietal and frontal cortical circuits involved in motor planning and initiation.</p><p>The present study provides the first examination of the relative timing and magnitude of perturbation-related activity across sensory and motor cortices in non-human primates. Here we show that even when the animal is not engaged in a limb motor task, limb afferent feedback is still rapidly transmitted to many sensory and motor cortical regions, beginning in S1 and then spreading to adjacent cortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The magnitude of the perturbation response is also greatest in S1 and diminishes spatially across the cortex. This gradient in the timing and magnitude of perturbation-related activity across the cortical surface may be generated by intra-cortical communication, although subcortical sensory feedback pathways may also be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cappe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Padberg et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>While muscle spindle afferents are assumed to play a dominant role for eliciting the perturbation-related activity observed in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lucier et al., 1975</xref>), cutaneous afferents likely also contribute, particularly in S1, signaling skin stretch caused by the perturbation. However, the very fastest responses are likely due to muscle afferents even in area 3b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heath et al., 1976</xref>). Neurons in S1 with cutaneous receptive fields are broadly tuned to the direction of movement during reaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prud’homme et al., 1994</xref>), much like neurons in M1 with receptive fields from shoulder and elbow muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Scott and Kalaska, 1997</xref>). Correspondingly, we expect both muscle and cutaneous afferents will be broadly tuned to loads applied to the shoulder and elbow, and contribute to feedback responses observed in the present study. Yet the differential physiological contributions of each of these feedback sources to control are an interesting question, warranting further investigation.</p><p>M1 was the first cortical region to display changes in perturbation-related activity when the applied load was used to initiate movements to the OUT versus the IN target, and occurred prior to changes in proximal limb muscle activity. This suggests M1 is the primary cortical source for implementing this aspect of control (along with dentate). While changes in perturbation-related activity was only observed in PMd at the same time or later than that observed in limb muscles, this cortical area did show changes in baseline activity for the IN and OUT targets before perturbation onset. One can also see a small (non-significant) dip in the differential signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> at about 40 ms post-perturbation. Thus, PMd may play some role in this process of using sensory feedback for action selection. In contrast, all parietal regions examined in the present study displayed no change in perturbation-related activity until ~150 ms when differences in limb motion begin to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pruszynski et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting none of these regions were involved in this aspect of control. However, a more thorough examination of area 3a, that has direct projections onto motoneurons of limb muscles, is warranted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rathelot and Strick, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Of particular note is that engagement of the limb in a motor task increases the perturbation response immediately in A5 (~25 ms). In contrast, the initial response was unaltered in other cortical regions, but they then increased 15 ms later or more, potentially driven by A5. Parietal area 5 has been implicated in somatomotor and visuomotor processing for limb motor actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mountcastle et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chapman et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalaska, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Debowy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reichenbach et al., 2014</xref>). Preparatory activity in this cortical region reflects the selective use of the limb for a subsequent motor action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cui and Andersen, 2011</xref>). Our data suggests a potential role of A5 in online control, consistent with recent studies demonstrating TMS over medial intraparietal sulcus in humans (approximate analog to A5 in NHPs) prolongs corrective responses to mechanical disturbances during reaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reichenbach et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, posterior parietal cortex is not only important for online control of visual feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Desmurget and Grafton, 2000</xref>), but also somatosensory feedback. The fact that perturbation-related activity was altered between the movie and postural tasks initially suggests a role in the control policy rather than state estimation. However, changes in perturbation-related activity in A5 were related to whether the animal was engaged or not in a behavioral task. There was no change in its response when using sensory feedback to select a new goal, as the animal remained engaged in a task before and after this selection. Thus, it may instead play a role in linking state estimation to the control policy for online control.</p><p>The present study explored how task engagement and target selection alters the spatiotemporal pattern of perturbation-related activity across sensory and motor cortices. Our results suggest that multiple areas are activated in response to sensory feedback, and activity in each area reflects processing of different aspects of the task. This concurrent processing of information across different areas could cumulatively shape the observed output generated in each task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ledberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Siegel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Task-dependent changes in perturbation-related activity in cortex preceded corresponding changes in muscle responses, and thus, these cortical circuits are the likely source for these task-dependent changes in motor output. However, long-latency motor responses are extremely complex (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shemmell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pruszynski and Scott, 2012</xref> for reviews) and consider many factors such as limb mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kurtzer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2009</xref>), goal-directed corrections associated with the shape of spatial goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nashed et al., 2012</xref>), presence of obstacles in the environment, and selection of alternate goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nashed et al., 2014</xref>). We predict that distributed frontoparietal circuits (and cerebellum) also provide the neural substrate to generate these other complex corrective responses, a hallmark of highly skilled motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scott, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects and apparatus</title><p>Three male non-human primates (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>, 10–17 kg) were trained to perform whole limb visuomotor tasks while attached to an exoskeleton robot (KINARM, BKIN Technologies, Kingston, Ontario, Canada). The robot permitted combined flexion and extension movements of the shoulder and elbow in the horizontal plane and applied loads to the shoulder and/or the elbow independently. Two monkeys (Monkey X &amp; A) used a right-arm robot and one monkey (Monkey P) used a left-arm robot. Targets and hand visual feedback were presented to the monkeys, in the horizontal plane, using an overhead monitor and a semitransparent mirror. Hand position was represented by a white circle (5 mm diameter) positioned at the tip of the index finger. The Queen’s University Animal Care Committee approved all experimental procedures (Protocol 1348).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioral tasks</title><p>Throughout the experiment different combinations of shoulder and/or elbow torques were applied to the monkey’s arm. Three tasks were performed and varied in how the monkeys were required to respond to the perturbations. In the Posture Task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Herter et al., 2007</xref>), the monkey was instructed to maintain its hand at a central target (visual: 12 mm diameter, acceptable window: 16 mm diameter). At a random time (1000–1500 ms), the limb was perturbed with one of nine combinations of loads applied to the shoulder and/or elbow (flexor, extensor or null), and the monkey had to return its hand to the target within 750 ms of the perturbation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each perturbation lasted 300ms and the size of the load varied with the size of the monkey (Monkey P &amp; X, 0.24 Nm and monkey A, 0.32 Nm). Load magnitudes were adjusted in the bi-articular load directions to compensate for larger hand motions induced in these directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Herter et al., 2007</xref>). Each load combination was presented randomly in a block of trials and the monkey was required to complete 10 blocks in a set.</p><p>In the Movie Task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Omrani et al., 2014</xref>), monkeys were not required to do anything in response to the perturbation. Task-related visual feedback (i.e. target position and hand position) was replaced by a movie and the monkeys were trained to quietly watch the movie. The robot moved the hand to the central target at the beginning of each trial. The hand was then perturbed using the same 9 load combinations as in the Posture Task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The monkey was rewarded irrespective of its response to the perturbation.</p><p>In the IN/OUT task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pruszynski et al., 2014</xref>), the monkey started each trial by maintaining its hand at a central target (12 mm diameter), and moved its hand to a second target (2.5 cm radius) following a perturbation (the load remained on for 1500 ms). The perturbation was the load combination from the Posture Task that elicited the largest response in the neuron/muscle presently being recorded. The location of the second target was strategically chosen such that the load either pushed the hand in (IN), or away (OUT) from it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; location of the second target could also remain aligned with the initial central target, but data not analyzed in this study). The monkey had to move to the second target within 750 ms and remain there for an additional 1 s. IN and OUT target trials were randomly interleaved and 20 repeat trials were recorded for each target.</p><p>Normally an experimental session was composed of a fixed order of tasks: first the Posture Task, then the Movie Task, followed by another repeat of the Posture Task and finally the IN/OUT task. A reduced version of the experiment was performed near the end of the recording session; in which one set of the Posture and the Movie Tasks were randomly presented followed by one set of the IN/OUT task. In recording sessions from S1, receptive field properties of the neurons were investigated following the last experimental block.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data collection</title><p>Neural data was recorded from shoulder/elbow regions of the primary somatosensory areas 1&amp;3 (S1), primary somatosensory area 2 (A2), parietal area 5 (A5), primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), using standard extracellular recording techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Herter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Omrani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pruszynski et al., 2014</xref>). The neural data was initially sorted online for single units (Plexon Inc., Dallas), then confirmed and examined further offline using the Plexon offline sorter.</p><p>Recording chamber and penetration sites were chosen using monkey atlas coordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paxinos et al., 2008</xref>) and also MRI imaging (for Monkeys X &amp; A). Single tungsten microelectrodes (FHC, Bowdoin) were advanced in the cortex until neural activity was recorded. We verified the location of shoulder and elbow areas of M1 by eliciting muscle twitches using microstimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stoney et al., 1968</xref>) and the response of neurons to passive movement of the joints. The shoulder/elbow regions in other cortical areas were generally at the same laterality as that in M1. We tested sensory receptive fields of neurons particularly in the first few sessions of recording in a new cortical area to make sure we were in the shoulder/elbow representation. While recording in the sensory cortices, we also tried to differentiate the best modality of stimulus for each neuron (e.g. cutaneous, soft touch, deep touch or joint movement). However, the robotic device attached to the arm made it difficult to dissociate whether sensory responses during manual examination were related to muscle or cutaneous afferents. The majority (~85%) of our recordings from A5 were performed over the convexity of the cortex (area 5d). Neural recordings in S1 were equally on the surface (putative Area 1), bank of post-central sulcus (putative area 3b) and deep in post-central sulcus (putative area 3a).</p><p>In one monkey (P), we verified our recording areas post-mortem. We used Paraformaldehyde to perfuse the monkey and its brain. Right before removing the chamber from the skull, we inserted several pins to known coordinates within the chamber. We then photographed the brain and sketched the location of the sulci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Post mortem penetration locations have yet to be performed in the other monkeys.</p><p>We also recorded electromyographic (EMG) activity of proximal arm muscles during the tasks. The EMG recordings were scored from 1 to 5 (based on recording quality, gain of the signal, signal-to-noise ratio, and whether the muscle looked active in the task). Muscles that scored 3 and higher were included in our analysis. EMG signals were band-pass filtered (10–150 Hz, two-pass, third-order Butterworth) and full-wave rectified. Each trial was aligned based on the perturbation onset. The EMG data related to posture and movie tasks were presented previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Omrani et al., 2014</xref>). For the IN/OUT task, we recorded EMG from 3 to 6 proximal limb muscles in 9 sessions in one monkey (Monkey P). Nineteen samples (representing all the major muscles involved in flexion and extension of the shoulder and elbow joints) were identified as good quality (score 3 or higher on subjective rating scale out of 5) and had significant perturbation responses (p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Spike times were extracted from the Plexon files into Matlab (Mathworks, Natick). Spike-density functions were generated by convolving spike time-stamps with asymmetric double-exponential kernels (1 ms rise- and 20 ms fall-time, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thompson et al., 1996</xref>]). We consider cell activity 50–100 ms post-perturbation corresponding roughly to the long-latency epoch for muscle activity. The load combination with the largest response (50 to 100 ms post-perturbation) was then selected as the neuron’s preferred-torque direction (PTD). The neuron’s activity in its PTD was then compared to its activity in the null load condition (catch trial) using a two-sample t-test. If the comparison was significant, the activity of the cell in its PTD was used for further analyses (SPSS, IBM, New York).</p><p>Single cell activities in each area were averaged to calculate the perturbation population response for each area. We determined the first point in time that the activity of a cell/muscle/population passed a defined threshold (baseline + 3 SD of baseline activity) and remained above this threshold for at least 20ms (to avoid capturing random transient responses). The baseline period consisted of cell/population activity 100 ms prior to the perturbation (average population baseline for each area is represented as insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). A similar approach was used to identify when population signals associated with different conditions (Posture versus Movie Tasks, or IN and OUT targets) were significantly different (differential signals). We compared the onset times of perturbation responses and differential signals across cortical areas using a bootstrap technique, resampling (with replacement) cells in each population 10000 times, and then calculating the response onset for each iteration. We also rank ordered the onset across different areas in each iteration and calculated the percentage of times activity in one area preceded that of others. In calculating the percentages, we also included iterations where the population or difference signal did not pass 3SD.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).

We have re-written the Introduction to provide:</p><p>1) A more theory driven approach based on Optimal control and highlight the dichotomy of state estimation and control policy;</p><p>2) The value of using mechanical disturbances to probe voluntary control, and;</p><p>3) The use of multiple behaviors to identify if and how a brain region reflects different aspects of control.</p><p>We think this provides a more transparent presentation of our approach. We have also modified the Discussion a bit to align with the changes in the Introduction. While the Introduction now uses optimal control principles to introduce the motivation for the study, we believe the results are not necessarily bound within this framework.</p><p><italic>The authors should also address the following points:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Trial-by-trial analysis correlation between the timing of the corrective responses and the timing of neuronal activity.</italic></p><p>This is an interesting analysis. Unfortunately, we did not consider this type of analysis when designing our experiment as we only have 10 trials per load condition making it difficult for individual neurons to reach statistical significance. At the single cell level, there are some neurons that had significant correlations with joint reversal times (10% in M1). At the population level, M1 was the only cortical region that displayed a significant correlation. The low correlation level for the M1 population (r= -0.11) is not surprising as even arm muscle activity has rather low correlations (Crevecoeur et al., 2013). We have added this analysis to the Results section.</p><p><italic>2) Determination if the cells had receptive fields on the shoulder/elbow.</italic></p><p>We specifically targeted our recordings in areas of the cortex that correspond with shoulder/elbow movement or have sensory responses to shoulder/elbow manipulations (i.e. cutaneous or proprioceptive response). These areas were recognized in mapping sessions, which were performed following the recording chamber implantation and before behavioral recording sessions were performed. In these sessions, as a general rule, we first identified M1 and then explored other rostral-caudal areas at this same lateral distance from the midline. If the cells had responses to hand and wrist movement, we then moved our penetrations to more lateral sites to find shoulder/elbow cells. We also tested cell receptive fields more closely in the first few sessions of recording in a new area to make sure we were in the shoulder/elbow region for a given cortical area. We now explain this process in more detail in the Methods section. We have also included the penetration map for the monkey that was euthanized and in which we can relate cortical surface maps to the penetration sites (refer to supplemental material).</p><p><italic>3) Discussion of how the activation of different receptor types would influence the responses evoked in different areas.</italic></p><p>It is very difficult to differentiate the potential contribution of different receptor types. Reaching studies highlight that neurons with cutaneous receptive fields in area 3b are broadly tuned to the direction of hand motion like all other cortical areas, probably reflecting skin stretch in response to the perturbation (Cohen et al., 1994). Both cutaneous and muscle afferents will likely generate similar patterns of broad tuning to loads applied to the shoulder and elbow. Further, area 3b that is commonly assumed to be receive purely cutaneous information actually receives substantive input from muscle afferents (Heath et al., 1976). Muscle afferents tend to be a bit faster than cutaneous although the difference can be small (Heath et al., 1976). We have added a paragraph in the Discussion to raise the point that while muscle afferents likely play a dominant role providing feedback of limb motion from the applied loads, cutaneous afferents also likely contribute. We have also tried to explain why differentiating these modalities is not easy while the animal is in the robot. We have also tried to clarify in more detail the penetration sites within S1 in the Methods section.</p><p><italic>4) Influence of early- versus long-latency responses in the conclusions of the study.</italic></p><p>R1 (short) and R2 (long) muscle responses have clear differences, which we have articulated many times (and many others have as well). Notably, R1 responses are generated at the spinal level and are fairly fixed responses that do not reflect task-level corrective responses. In contrast, R2 responses are influenced by many different behavioral level factors and occur at a time point when cortical activity can contribute. These observations lay the groundwork for the present work to begin to unravel how cortex may be involved in these goal-directed motor corrections that begin in the R2 epoch. The comparisons across tasks allow us to identify when perturbation-related activity is task-independent (like R1) and task-dependent (like R2). We assume the issue is that we don’t link our task-dependent effects in cortex to the motor periphery. Thus, we have added some statements in the Discussion to more explicitly state that task-dependent changes observed in M1 for the IN/OUT task are appropriate for driving the subsequent R2 muscle responses.</p></body></sub-article></article>
