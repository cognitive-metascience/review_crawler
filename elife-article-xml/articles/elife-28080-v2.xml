central nervous system. Oligodendrocyte precursors (OPs) receive glutamatergic synaptic input from axons but how this affects their development is unclear. Murine OPs in white matter express AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunits GluA2, GluA3 and GluA4. We generated mice in which OPs lack both GluA2 and GluA3, or all three subunits GluA2/3/4, which respectively reduced or abolished AMPAR-mediated input to OPs. In both double- and triple-knockouts OP proliferation and number were unchanged but ~25% fewer oligodendrocytes survived in the subcortical white matter during development. In triple knockouts, this shortfall persisted into adulthood. The oligodendrocyte deficit resulted in ~20% fewer myelin sheaths but the average length, number and thickness of myelin internodes made by individual oligodendrocytes appeared normal. Thus, AMPAR-mediated signalling from active axons stimulates myelin production in developing white matter by enhancing oligodendrocyte survival, without influencing myelin synthesis per se.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28080.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28080.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

develop postnatally from proliferating oligodendrocyte precursors (OPs), enables fast and energy-efficient propagation of electrical signals in the central nervous system (CNS). By decreasing the capacitance of axons, myelin dramatically increases the speed of action potentials and reduces the energy demands of the axons. Moreover, the ensheathing OLs can transfer energy substrates into axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fünfschilling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saab et al., 2016</xref>) possibly supporting them during periods of high metabolic demand. Synthesis of myelin requires a large investment of energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris and Attwell, 2012</xref>), so it seems likely that myelination evolved to focus on active axons, rather than axons that are electrically silent because, for example, they are still elongating, or they are excess to requirements and destined for developmental pruning. This would require that developing OLs can sense the electrical activity of axons.</p><p>OLs that differentiate in culture from purified OPs can myelinate fixed axons and synthetic nanofibres in vitro, so electrically active axons are not essential for myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rosenberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bechler et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, many in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that electrical activity can modulate myelination by influencing the proliferation and/or differentiation of OPs, thus determining the number of OLs that are available to myelinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barres and Raff, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demerens et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fannon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Etxeberria et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, electrical activity can influence the process of myelination by OLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hines et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mensch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wake et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lundgaard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wake et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Etxeberria et al., 2016</xref>). OL production and myelination in juvenile or adult mice are also influenced by experience, presumably via altered neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Simon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Makinodan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mangin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sampaio-Baptista et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McKenzie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>How might electrical activity be signalled to OL lineage cells? A likely mechanism is that neurotransmitters released from active axons modulate OL formation or myelination. OL lineage cells can sense the release of neurotransmitter directly, because they express ligand-gated channels (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Larson et al., 2016</xref>), including AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors for the excitatory transmitter glutamate. OPs receive direct AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic input from unmyelinated or partially myelinated axons in all brains regions examined so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergles et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chittajallu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin and Bergles, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kukley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ziskin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Káradóttir et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Müller et al., 2009</xref>). Synaptic input is maintained during OP division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kukley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ge et al., 2009</xref>) but is down-regulated as OPs differentiate into OLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cahoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Biase et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kukley et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that it might be important in the control of OL development.</p><p>In support of the idea that neurotransmitters regulate myelination, blocking vesicular release from neurons in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wake et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">2015</xref>) or in genetically manipulated zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hines et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mensch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koudelka et al., 2016</xref>) reduced myelination without much affecting OL numbers. Conversely, blocking glutamate uptake into secretory vesicles in retinal ganglion cells in early postnatal mice increased the number of OLs that developed in the optic tract, suggesting that glutamate signalling negatively regulates OL development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Etxeberria et al., 2016</xref>). Glutamate-evoked NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated signalling in OL lineage cells has been suggested to accelerate the myelination of active axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lundgaard et al., 2013</xref>), which might occur by NMDAR activation up-regulating glucose transport into developing OLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saab et al., 2016</xref>). The role of synaptic AMPAR signalling is more enigmatic; pharmacological block of AMPAR-mediated signalling in OPs in vitro promotes proliferation and differentiation of OPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yuan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fannon et al., 2015</xref>) but decreases myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fannon et al., 2015</xref>). These data are hard to interpret, because pharmacological manipulations of AMPARs in vitro affect not only OPs but also neurons, which might release substances other than glutamate to regulate myelination. Hence, we still do not have direct in vivo evidence for a role of AMPAR signalling in regulating OL lineage development.</p><p>To identify effects on myelination of AMPAR signalling in OL lineage cells, it is necessary to manipulate AMPARs in those cells without affecting neuronal AMPARs. We have therefore used <italic>Sox10-Cre</italic> to inactivate the <italic>Gria2</italic> gene (encoding AMPAR subunit GluA2), or both <italic>Gria2</italic> and <italic>Gria4</italic>, specifically in OL lineage cells on a <italic>Gria3</italic> germline knockout background. Examination of these <italic>Gria2/3</italic> and <italic>Gria2/3/4</italic> compound mutant mice revealed that AMPAR signalling in OPs promotes the development of OLs and myelin sheaths by stimulating survival of newly-differentiating OLs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>OPs in subcortical white matter express AMPAR subunits GluA2-4 but not GluA1</title><p>To determine which AMPAR subunits are expressed by OPs in vivo, we examined sections of postnatal mouse forebrain by in situ hybridization (ISH) for <italic>Gria1-4,</italic> which encode receptor subunits GluA1-4 (also known as GluR1-4 or GluRA-D). We focused on subcortical white matter (SCWM), which contains axons, glial cells and blood vessels but very few neuronal cell bodies. We found that <italic>Gria2, Gria3</italic> and <italic>Gria4</italic> are expressed by many small cells in the postnatal day 1 (P1) and P14 SCWM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Gria1</italic> was expressed by very few cells in the SCWM, which NeuN labelling showed were neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref> and not shown). As expected, <italic>Gria1-4</italic> were all expressed highly by many neurons throughout the forebrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Fluorescence ISH for individual <italic>Gria</italic> family members followed by immunolabelling for the transcription factor Olig2 confirmed that <italic>Gria2-4</italic> were expressed by OL lineage cells in white matter; Olig2 was expressed in 88 ± 3% of <italic>Gria2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells (817 cells counted in four mice), 94 ± 4% of <italic>Gria3<sup>+</sup></italic> cells (506 cells from three mice) and 90 ± 0.3% of <italic>Gria4<sup>+</sup></italic> cells (560 cells from three mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Double ISH for <italic>Pdgfra</italic> and <italic>Gria2</italic> followed by immunolabelling for Olig2 indicated that GluA2 is expressed by the majority of OPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), consistent with previous electrophysiological findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kukley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ziskin et al., 2007</xref>). Occasional large cells with strong <italic>Gria</italic> expression but no Olig2 co-labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) were shown to be white matter neurons (NeuN<sup>+</sup>, not shown). Together, these data indicate that GluA2-4 are the main AMPAR subunits expressed by OL lineage cells in the developing mouse SCWM.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28080.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>GluA2–4, but not GluA1 are expressed by presumptive OL lineage cells in the corpus callosum.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Low-magnification images of <italic>Gria1</italic> and <italic>Gria2</italic> ISH at P14.

When a fast application system is used it is possible to distinguish the activation of each receptor type based on the kinetics of the response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Patneau et al., 1994</xref>); kainate receptors desensitize quickly to kainate while AMPARs desensitize slowly or not at all. With the slow application method that we employed, most of the kainate-evoked current should therefore be AMPAR-mediated. To confirm this, we examined the responses to kainate in the presence of 50 μM GYKI-52466 (GYKI), a selective AMPAR antagonist. In both <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> and <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> OPs, kainate-evoked currents were blocked by ~80% in the presence of GYKI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>), confirming that most of the kainate-evoked current is AMPAR-mediated under our experimental conditions. Thus, in <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice, activation of AMPARs in OPs generates less membrane current (and hence less depolarization) than in <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> controls.</p><p>The fact that a significant fraction (~53%) of the normal kainate current is still observed in the <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> OPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) indicates that AMPARs are still formed and trafficked to the surface membrane. It is possible either that the remaining GluA4 subunits form functional homo-tetrameric receptors, as they can do when expressed on their own in cultured mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keinänen et al., 1990</xref>), or that GluA1 is up-regulated in response to loss of GluA2 and GluA3 and forms GluA1/GluA4 heteromeric or GluA1 homomeric channels. However, by ISH we found no evidence for up-regulation of <italic>Gria1</italic> mRNA in <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> SCWM relative to <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, the majority of AMPAR formed in <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> OPs are probably homo-tetramers of GluA4.</p><p>To determine whether deletion of GluA2/3 from OL lineage cells altered their general membrane properties, the electrophysiological properties of YFP<sup>+</sup> OPs from SCWM of P14 <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> and <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–G</xref>).

In addition, when 20 mV voltage steps were applied from a holding potential of –63 mV, membrane depolarization evoked a transient inward Na<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>Na</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Subtraction of the linearly scaled capacitive transient and ohmic leak current evoked by a 20 mV hyperpolarizing step allowed us to estimate the amplitude of I<sub>Na</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). There was no significant difference in the I<sub>Na</sub> density between <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> and <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> controls (p=0.72, Mann-Whitney test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), suggesting that altering AMPAR signalling does not regulate the expression of voltage-gated sodium channels.

This suggests that reduced accumulation of OLs in the SCWM of <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice is not caused by a reduction in the rate of differentiation of OPs. However, the reduction in OL density might have resulted from a reduced proliferation rate of OPs – that is, more slowly dividing OPs produce fewer OLs. To assess OP division rates we administered EdU to mice at P3, P7, P14 and P70 (see Materials and methods). The fraction of Pdgfra<sup>+</sup> OPs that incorporated EdU (‘labelling index’) was not detectably different in <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> versus <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> SCWM at any age examined (p=0.69 at P3; p=0.69 at P7; p=0.7 at P14; p=0.34 at P70, Mann-Whitney tests; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), nor was there any difference in the fraction of Pdgfra<sup>+</sup> OPs in the P14 SCWM that immunolabelled for Ki67, a marker of actively dividing cells (p=0.78, Student’s t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).

We have now provided the first direct evidence that synaptic signalling through AMPARs in OPs and/or early OLs modulates OL development in vivo. Knock-out of <italic>Gria2</italic> or <italic>Gria3</italic> alone had no discernible effect on OL development but double-KO of <italic>Gria2/3</italic> in the OL lineage reduced, and triple-KO of <italic>Gria2/3/4</italic> abolished, AMPAR-mediated signalling in OPs and led to reduced accumulation of mature OLs and myelin without affecting the proliferation or number of OPs. The presence of GluA2 subunits (encoded by <italic>Gria2</italic>) is known to suppress the Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability of AMPARs (provided GluA2 is the Q –&gt; R edited isoform). The fact that knockout of <italic>Gria2</italic> alone did not affect OL development implies that the reduction in OL number observed in the <italic>Gria2/3</italic> and <italic>Gria2/3/4</italic> mutants results from an aspect of AMPAR signalling other than Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability, for example the induced depolarization or the Na<sup>+</sup> influx that it produces. Thus, AMPAR signalling in OPs and/or early-differentiating OLs is a positive regulator of OL development; we speculate that this favours myelination of active axons that are releasing glutamate, thus accelerating development of a functioning CNS.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Effect of AMPAR subunit knockouts on synaptic input to OPs</title><p>OPs in developing white matter receive glutamatergic synaptic input from unmyelinated axons in white matter. Most glutamatergic synaptic current in OPs is via AMPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin and Bergles, 2004</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergles and Richardson, 2015</xref>). We have shown that OL lineage cells in the SCWM express mRNA encoding AMPAR subunits GluA2, GluA3 and GluA4 but not GluA1 - the same spectrum of AMPAR subunits reported for rat and mouse OPs in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Patneau et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Knocking out GluA2 and GluA3 in OPs reduced the AMPAR-mediated current to ~53% of normal, while knocking out all three subunits GluA2/3/4 reduced it to ~13% of normal. Surprisingly, we found that in OPs lacking GluA2 and GluA3 the amplitude of RR-induced synaptic events was unchanged while their frequency was reduced to &lt;30% of normal, while in OPs lacking all AMPAR subunits their frequency was reduced to only ~1% of control. The simplest interpretation is that there are fewer AMPAR-containing synapses in double-KO OPs (and almost none in triple-KOs), but that those synapses that survive contain a normal number of AMPARs. In support of this it has been shown in neurons that, when the number of post-synaptic AMPARs is increased experimentally, an increase in frequency of EPSPs with no change in their amplitude is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sinnen et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that the number of functioning synaptic connections is determined, at least in part, by the number of postsynaptic AMPARs available, and that quantal amplitude is regulated independently of the number of synaptic connections. In the GluA2/3 double-KO the surviving synapses must contain exclusively or predominantly GluA4 subunits, which are known to form functional homo-tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keinänen et al., 1990</xref>). We cannot tell whether separate ‘GluA4-only’ and ‘GluA4-lacking’ synapses are normally present on OPs, although distinct sets of GluA2/GluA3-containing and GluA2/GluA3-lacking synapses have been described for neurons in the carp retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schultz et al., 2001</xref>).

On the other hand, sensory deprivation of mouse barrel cortex by whisker removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mangin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hill et al., 2014</xref>), which presumably restricts glutamate release in the cortex, increased OP proliferation in the barrels, in keeping with the data from brain slice cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yuan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fannon et al., 2015</xref>). Against all of the above, a recent in vivo study, in which glutamate release from the axons of mouse RGCs was genetically attenuated, found no effect on OP proliferation in the optic tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Etxeberria et al., 2016</xref>). Genetic block of vesicular release from longitudinally-projecting axons in the zebrafish spinal cord also had no effect on OP proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hines el al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mensch et al., 2015</xref>), although numbers of OL lineage cells were reduced by ~10%, apparently because of reduced specification of OPs from their stem cell precursors in the embryonic ventricular zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mensch et al., 2015</xref>). It is unlikely that we would have detected an effect of this size, even assuming it would not have been overridden by homeostatic controls on cell number in the perinatal mouse brain.</p><p>The data cited above are contradictory and confusing. However, the experiments are not directly comparable to each other. For example, pharmacological manipulation of slice cultures is not targeted to specific cells and opens the possibility that there might be indirect effects mediated via neurons, some of which also express AMPA/ kainate receptors. The same reservation might apply to some of the in vivo experiments cited above – on top of which, stimulating or inhibiting electrical activity or vesicular release in vivo is likely to affect more than just AMPAR-mediated signalling. For example, electrically active neurons release Neuroligin-3 (NLGN3), a mitogen for malignant glioma cells, which are believed to be derived from and closely related to OPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Venkatesh et al., 2015</xref>). Our conditional knockout approach is tightly focused on AMPAR-mediated effects in OL lineage cells and avoids confounding influences by other signalling pathways, direct or indirect. We conclude, as discussed below, that signalling through AMPAR in OL lineage cells promotes survival of newly-differentiating OLs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>AMPAR signalling promotes the survival of differentiating OLs</title><p>Reduced AMPAR signalling in the SCWM of our <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice resulted in a modest (~27%) reduction in OL accumulation in the early postnatal period (around P14), but OL numbers recovered to normal levels in adult mice. Additional deletion of <italic>Gria4</italic> did not reduce the number of OLs further, but the reduction now persisted into adulthood. We assume that these changes reflect the loss of synaptic currents that we have documented above. The relatively modest effect on OL dynamics of ablating AMPAR might reflect the fact that glutamate can signal to OPs through receptors other than AMPAR (including NMDAR, KAR or mGluR), and that glutamate is only one of a number of signalling molecules that communicate axonal activity to OPs.</p><p>Previous studies into the effects of glutamatergic signalling on OL differentiation have been conflicting. Experiments in dissociated cell cultures and slice cultures from rat or mouse indicated that blocking AMPA/ kainate receptors promoted OL differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yuan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fannon et al., 2015</xref>) while preventing their further maturation and expression of myelin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fannon et al., 2015</xref>).

However, inhibiting vesicular release from axons in the developing zebrafish spinal cord by pan-neuronal expression of tetanus toxin had no effect on OL differentiation, but reduced the number and length of myelin sheaths synthesized by individual OLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hines et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mensch et al., 2015</xref>). This effect was observed for OLs that myelinated some but not all classes of axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koudelka et al., 2016</xref>) – consistent with the idea that there are both activity-dependent and –independent mechanisms of myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lundgaard et al., 2013</xref>). However, tetanus toxin inhibits all SNARE-dependent vesicular release, including release of neurotransmitters other than glutamate (e.g. ATP and GABA) that have also been implicated in the control of myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stevens et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishibashi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zonouzi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamilton et al., 2017</xref>). Further complicating the picture, inhibition of glutamate release from the axons of RGCs increased OL number in the mouse optic tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Etxeberria et al., 2016</xref>). Although the latter study preferentially affected glutamate signalling it did not separate AMPAR-mediated effects from those mediated by e.g. NMDAR or mGluR.</p><p>We found that the reduced number of differentiated OLs in the double- and triple-KOs was a result of increased death of OL lineage cells – most likely newly-formed, pre-myelinating OLs. In keeping with this, we found that <italic>Gria2-4</italic> continue to be expressed in <italic>Enpp6<sup>+</sup></italic> early-differentiating OLs, suggesting that some AMPAR-mediated signalling can still occur during the early stages of OL differentiation, even though AMPAR-mediated EPSCs are down-regulated in maturing OLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kukley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Biase et al., 2010</xref>).

Thus, AMPAR signalling in OL lineage cells could be one of the mechanisms ensuring that only pre-myelinating OLs that make contact with active axons survive to myelinate in the longer term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barres et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Trapp et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Electrical activity is also known to affect the terminal stages of OL differentiation, that is, myelin synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demerens et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wake et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lundgaard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wake et al., 2015</xref>). Glutamate receptors other than AMPAR, that is, NMDAR and mGluR, have been suggested to regulate this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wake et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lundgaard et al., 2013</xref>), possibly by regulating the energy supply to developing OLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saab et al., 2016</xref>) – although a major effect of NMDARs in vivo has been disputed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Biase et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2012</xref>). In our present study we found that the amount of myelin in the SCWM of <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice was reduced in proportion to the reduced number of OLs. The g-ratio, as well as the internode number and length, were unchanged, suggesting that once a pre-myelinating OL makes a commitment to myelinate an axon, the process continues until a normal internode number and length, and a normal number of myelin wraps are achieved. Therefore, the activity-dependent regulation of internode length that has been observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wake et al., 2015</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koudelka et al., 2016</xref>) is presumably mediated by glutamate receptors other than AMPAR, or by signals other than glutamate. In short, we have shown that AMPAR signalling stimulates myelin formation in mice by increasing the number of myelinating OLs that develop from OPs, not by regulating myelin synthesis per se.</p><p>In summary, our study demonstrates that AMPAR signalling in OL lineage cells promotes OL development and myelination during postnatal development. Elucidating further mechanisms of signalling from neurons to OL lineage cells will be crucial for understanding developmental myelination and for devising therapies to promote remyelination in diseases of the white matter.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Transgenic mice</title><p>AMPAR subunits GluA1-4 are encoded by separate genes <italic>Gria1-4</italic>.

When indicated, spermine (Sigma) was added to the intracellular solution at a final concentration of 100 μM. For both solutions the junction potential of –3 mV has been corrected for.</p><p>YFP-expressing OPs in the corpus callosum were selected for whole-cell patch-clamping based on their size and shape in the fluorescence microscope, and their membrane properties. Cells with voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> currents, ≥1 GΩ membrane resistance and ≤35 pF capacitance were considered to be OPs. Due to the high membrane resistance of OPs, recordings were made without series resistance compensation. In some experiments the following drugs were applied by adding to the superfusing extracellular solution: kainic acid monohydrate (100 µM; Sigma) to activate AMPAR and kainate receptors, GYKI52466 (GYKI; 50 µM; Sigma) to block AMPARs, or RR (100 µM; Sigma) to evoke transmitter release. To record the OP’s voltage-gated currents and the I–V relationship of drug-evoked currents, 20 mV voltage steps of 200 ms duration were applied from a holding potential of –63 mV (voltage range from –103 mV to +17 mV). For RR-evoked EPSCs the holding potential was –83 mV to increase the driving force for excitatory synaptic events and thus increase the chance of detecting the events.</p><p>For evoked synaptic responses cells were clamped at –63 mV and the responses were elicited by stimulation (Digitimer Limited) of callosal axons using a glass micropipette filled with external solution (resistance 1–2 MΩ) placed ~150–200 μm away from the recorded cell in the corpus callosum. For minimal stimulation, activating only one axon with input to the recorded cell, the stimulus strength was gradually reduced until no post-synaptic current was detected in the patch-clamped OP. Then the stimulus was gradually increased until a post-synaptic response was detected. In each cell 50–80 trials under these conditions were recorded and analyzed. The amplitude of the unitary EPSC was obtained by averaging those events where an EPSC was observed. For estimation of paired-pulse ratio (PPR), two strong (90 V, 800 µs) stimulation pulses, 25 ms apart, were delivered ten times, responses were averaged and the PPR was calculated by dividing the peak current generated by the second pulse by the peak current generated by the first pulse.</p><p>Responses were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier with pClamp 9 (Axon Instruments) and Axoscope 9 (Axon Instruments) software. The majority of membrane currents were filtered at 5–10 kHz, except for spontaneous synaptic currents, which were filtered at 1 kHz. The sampling rate was always at least three times the filtering frequency.</p><p>Data were analyzed off-line using Clampfit 9 (Axon Instruments). Membrane resistance and capacitance were estimated by fitting the transient current elicited by a 5 mV voltage step to a single exponential. Series resistance was monitored and was typically 10–20 MΩ. Cells were excluded from the analysis when the resistance changed by &gt;50% during the recording and/or was &gt;30 MΩ (unless otherwise stated). The amplitude of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> currents was calculated by subtracting the passive components of current responses evoked by voltage steps. In particular, the current response to a 20 mV hyperpolarizing voltage step with no active components, comprising the capacitive current and an ohmic leak conductance (which are proportional to the size of the voltage step) was linearly scaled according to the size of the voltage step applied. This linearly scaled passive component was then subtracted from all of the voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> current responses evoked by depolarizing voltage steps.</p><p>For detection of RR-evoked EPSCs, traces were high pass filtered at 2 Hz to eliminate drift in the baseline over time. The events were automatically detected using a threshold search with the following criteria: amplitude threshold set at three times the s.d. of the noise in regions of the trace lacking obvious EPSCs, minimum event duration set to 1 ms and rising phase faster than the decay. The detected events were then either accepted or rejected by the experimenter. The frequency was calculated for each minute of drug application. For the majority of cells, the maximum frequency was reached after 3 min of RR application. Therefore, the frequency of the events recorded between 3 and 6 min after application of the drug was used for comparison between <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> and control mice. Event frequency during GYKI application was estimated over the last 3 min of drug application.</p><p>To quantify kainate-evoked currents, the peak kainate-evoked current was measured at a nominal holding potential of –63 mV. Kainate-evoked current magnitudes were then corrected after the experiment for voltage errors generated by series resistance, using the value of Rs, a reversal potential of 0 mV and the current flowing before and after applying kainate. All cells, irrespective of their series resistance, were included in this analysis.</p><p>Numbers of cells analyzed are indicated in the main text.

To estimate g-ratios, the circumference of the axon as well as the external circumference of the myelin sheath were measured using ImageJ, avoiding paranodal areas. The diameters of axon and myelin sheath were calculated from these circumferential measurements, assuming a circular profile, and the g-ratio was calculated. 50–100 axons were counted in each of 4 mice per genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>Prism 6.0 (GraphPad) was used for statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normality of data distribution and p-values were determined using a two-tailed Student’s t-test (when the distribution was consistent with normality) or non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test or Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn post hoc test were used for comparing multiple groups, as appropriate. When multiple t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests were performed, p-values were corrected for multiple comparison using a procedure equivalent to the Holm–Bonferroni method (for <italic>N</italic> comparisons, the most significant <italic>P</italic> value is multiplied by <italic>N</italic>, the second most significant by (<italic>N</italic> − 1), the third most significant by (<italic>N</italic> − 2), etc.; corrected p-values&lt;0.05 are considered significant). Numbers of animals and cells studied are stated for each experiment in the text.</p><p>We analyzed the Caspase-3 immunolabelling data as follows. First, we calculated for control conditions the average fraction of Olig2<sup>+</sup> cells that also expressed cleaved Caspase-3 (and hence were undergoing apoptosis), by averaging across control litters (these numbers are stated in the main text). Second, within each litter we normalized the data from experimental mice (double- or triple-knockouts) and their <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup></italic> controls to the average of the controls in that same litter, setting the latter to 1. Then we averaged these normalized data across all litters to obtain the mean percentage increase in the fraction of Olig2<sup>+</sup> cells that were apoptotic in experimental mice compared to control mice.</p><p>We did not perform a priori power analyses to calculate the sample size for the experiments, because the size of the effects expected was unknown before doing the experiments. We did however perform sample size calculation post hoc for experiments where group differences were close to significant, using the observed mean ± s.d. of the control group, an effect size of 20–25%, a power of 80% and p-value&lt;0.05. With n = 3 for both groups, we should be able to detect a difference of ~23% in CC1<sup>+</sup> OLs in <italic>Gria2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). With n = 9 for control and n = 7 for the knockout group we should be able to detect a ~20% reduction in CC1<sup>+</sup> OLs in P21 <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). With n = 14 for both groups, we should be able to detect a difference of ~20% in P14 Pdgfra<sup>+</sup> OPs in <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Matthew Grist and Ulla Dennehy for expert technical help, and Nathan Skene, Marcio Oliveira and Sarah Jolly for advice and support.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers appreciated that your exploration of the issue of how neuronal activity and glutamate signaling regulate development of the oligodendrocyte lineage is timely and important. Unfortunately, however, they found the interpretation of the effects of inactivation of AMPA receptors gluR2/3 on oligodendrocyte maturation, myelin/myelinated axons, and AMPA currents somewhat preliminary. The reviews are summed below, but the main, shared concerns include:</p><p>1) Whether the transient decrease in CC1+ oligodendrocytes arises due to a delay in differentiation or a decrease in survival.</p><p>2) Whether myelination is truly decreased/delayed; suggestions for further analyses are to examine parameters of myelin internodes and to better quantify the EM data.</p><p>3) Whether in the absence of GluA2, alterations in AMPA current are due to AMPAR inhibition or to altered AMPAR signaling. In line with this, reviewer 2 had concerns that AMPAR-mediated current still remains in the double knockouts, potentially obscuring some effects of AMPAR inhibition, and thus producing only a modest change.</p><p>Because your study requires additional amendments that would likely take longer than a few months, we will have to reject the manuscript at this time.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript by Kougioumtzidou et al., the authors set out to investigate whether AMPAR signaling has a role in regulating oligodendrocyte development in vivo (first demonstration). They show that oligodendrocyte precursor cells express 3 of 4 known AMPAR subunits (Gria2-4). They then proceed to analyze oligodendrocyte development in Gria3 KOs, SOX10-conditional Gria2 KOs and Gria2/3 double KOs. They show that there are no effects on oligodendrocyte development in the individual KOs, even though AMPAR signaling is affected. However, the double KOs show an early, but transient decrease/delay in differentiated oligodendrocyte density during development (P14), which returns to normal by P21, and they conclude that AMPAR signaling regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation. The mice display a similar decrease in the number of myelinated axons in the double KOs and conclude that AMPAR signaling also regulates myelination. Since glutamatergic signaling through AMPAR is thought to be a major form of communication between neurons and oligodendrocyte precursors, and the resulting effects of this communication on oligodendrocyte development are still largely unknown, the topic of this manuscript is timely and highly important to the field. However, the work presented falls far short of accomplishing its aim and does little to move the field forward. Major concerns are outlined below.</p><p>1) The authors illustrate that a good deal of AMPAR-mediated current (~50%) still remains in the double KOs, which may obscure some effects of AMPAR inhibition. Perhaps because of this the effects demonstrated in this manuscript as a result of the double KOs are modest and do not add any mechanistic insight to what is already known.</p><p>2) As the authors state, the fact that there is no change in OP densities/proliferation in Gria2/3 KOs argues against the decrease in CC1+ OLs being due to a delay in developmental OL differentiation, but more for a decrease in OL survival, which the authors were unable to quantify. Not only does this leave the work incomplete, but it also makes it improper to conclude that AMPARs &quot;modulate the development of OLs&quot; when the effects seen could be a survival issue.</p><p>3) The authors show a reduction in myelinated neurons and suggest that OL differentiation and therefore myelination is delayed. However, they also present g-ratios that are unaffected. If developmental myelination is indeed delayed the KOs would show increased g-ratios since the myelin would begin to form later than controls. No change in g-ratios suggests other possibilities such as a survival issue of the OLs (see #2), or even the possibility that myelin internode lengths are shorter. Other studies have shown that OLs make shorter myelin sheaths upon inhibition of neuronal activity and decreased glutamate signaling (Hines et al. 2015. Nat Neurosci. 18:683-689; Mensch et al. 2015. Nat Neurosci. 18:628-630., Etxeberria et al. 2016. J Neurosci. 36:6037-6948.), therefore, it is a likely possibility that the decrease in myelinated axons observed by the authors is due to a similar change in myelin dynamics. An in-depth analysis of the myelin internodes (length and number/OL) is required to ascertain the full effect of AMPR function. Further investigation is necessary.</p><p>4) It is known that the GluA2 subunit makes AMPARs impermeable to Ca+2, therefore knocking out Gria2 will lead to increased Ca+2 signaling and changes the whole nature of AMPAR signaling. Moreover, the authors suspect that the remaining AMPAR-mediated currents are due to homotetramers of GluA4, but these are likely never normally produced in OPCs and may not reveal any meaningful signaling effects. Ultimately it is not clear whether the effects the authors are studying are due to AMPAR inhibition or to altered AMPAR signaling.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Oligodendrocyte lineage cells express glutamate receptors. Nevertheless, the functional significance of the expression of the distinct types of glutamate receptors by these cells has not been completely characterized. In the current study Kougioumtzidou and colleagues sought to identify the role that AMPA receptors play in oligodendrocyte lineage cells. They found that kainate-induced current is mediated by the expression of the AMPA receptors GluA2, GluA3 and GluA4 in oligodendrocyte lineage cells. In addition, these investigators genetically inactivated GluA2 and GluA3, individually and together, to determine the functional significance of this expression. The investigators took advantage of pre-existing GluA3 null mutant mice, as well as a GluA2 conditional mutant mouse line that they combined with a Sox10-Cre driver to promote recombination in oligodendrocyte lineage cells. This resulted in mice in which GluA3 expression was omitted from all cells, whereas GluA2 was specifically eliminated from oligodendrocyte lineage cells, and the expression of GluA4 remained intact. Although the individual mutants were unaffected in a detectable way, the double mutant mice exhibited partial blockage of kainate-induced current in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. In agreement with previous studies, the authors found that the partial blockage of the kainate- induced current in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells did not affect these cells in any identifiable manner. Interestingly, however, the authors demonstrate that the combined ablation of GluA2 and GluA3 resulted in an approximate twenty percent reduction in the number of mature oligodendrocytes at early postnatal ages that correlates with mild hypomyelination. Overall, this is an interesting and well-done study that adds to our growing understanding of the role that glutamate signaling plays in oligodendrocyte lineage cells.</p><p>1) Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells are highly proliferative. Since the authors use a conditional approach to the inactivation of GluA2, it is likely that not all OPCs have both alleles of GluA2 inactivated. It is possible that over time OPCs with the conditional inactivation of GluA2 are selected against, which might explain the observed recovery in older animals. A more detailed examination of this would be very informative: is there a higher percentage of WT GluA2 OPCs in older double-mutant animals?</p><p>2) A very interesting finding of this report is that AMPA receptors are important for differentiated, myelinating oligodendrocytes. Nevertheless, in my view this finding is not highlighted sufficiently. A proposed role for GluA2 and GluA3 in myelinating oligodendrocytes should be discussed.</p><p>3) Does the percent of myelinated axons recover to normal levels in adult animals? This data should be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Kougioumtzidou et al., submit &quot;AMPA-type glutamate receptors on oligodendrocyte precursors modulate development of oligodendrocytes and myelin&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. This work centres on to topic of how neuronal activity regulates development of the oligodendrocyte lineage. This general area will be of broad interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic> in large part because changes to oligodendrocyte development and myelination help regulate or fine tune neural circuit function and behaviour – the latter shown in a very elegant study by the Richardson lab. In this study, the authors address how glutamate signalling directly impacts oligodendrocyte development in vivo (a long-standing question), with a focus on AMPAR mediated function. Although one might argue that the authors did not address how AMPAR function in its entirety affects oligodendrocyte development (disrupting gluR2 and gluR3, but not gluR4, which is also expressed in the OL lineage), they do see a clear phenotype in vivo, and this is of interest in and of itself. However, at the moment I think that the manuscript would benefit greatly from some additional work to allay a few concerns, and to strengthen some of the conclusions drawn.</p><p>Validation of gria3 global mutant as reasonable &quot;control&quot; background. The authors go to some lengths to highlight the importance of a conditional targeting approach, whereby AMPRA mediated signalling/ function is disrupted specifically in oligodendrocytes. They achieve this is by targeting gluR2 function using floxed alleles of gria2 and a sox10-cre, which seems sufficiently faithful to the oligodendrocyte lineage in the CNS. However, all experiments are done on a background of lack of GluR3 function, i.e. a germline gria3 mutant mouse. Indeed all &quot;controls&quot; are gria3 mutant. The authors do show that gria3 mutants exhibit no change in PDGFRa expressing oligodendrocyte precursors (or their proliferation) or CC1 expressing mature oligodendrocytes, but only one stage is examined, and no further tests are carried out. In addition to the possibility of gria3 mutant oligodendrocytes having defects at other stages or at other times, these mutants will surely have compensation for glur3 loss by expression/ regulation of other GluR subunit isoforms and disruption to neural circuit function that could potentially confound analysis of myelination.

They show that oligodendrocyte precursor cells express 3 of 4 known AMPAR subunits (Gria2-4). They then proceed to analyze oligodendrocyte development in Gria3 KOs, SOX10-conditional Gria2 KOs and Gria2/3 double KOs. They show that there are no effects on oligodendrocyte development in the individual KOs, even though AMPAR signaling is affected. However, the double KOs show an early, but transient decrease/delay in differentiated oligodendrocyte density during development (P14), which returns to normal by P21, and they conclude that AMPAR signaling regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation. The mice display a similar decrease in the number of myelinated axons in the double KOs and conclude that AMPAR signaling also regulates myelination. Since glutamatergic signaling through AMPAR is thought to be a major form of communication between neurons and oligodendrocyte precursors, and the resulting effects of this communication on oligodendrocyte development are still largely unknown, the topic of this manuscript is timely and highly important to the field. However, the work presented falls far short of accomplishing its aim and does little to move the field forward.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the topic is important and timely and we trust that the large amount of extra work we have done on the project since its first submission, including the addition of <italic>Gria2/3/4</italic> triple-‐ knockouts, will convince this reviewer that our study is now a convincing and useful contribution to the field. Major additions to the manuscript since the first submission are listed above and include experiments demonstrating that:</p><p>i) AMPAR-‐mediated currents and EPSCs are almost abolished when <italic>Gria2/3/4</italic> are knocked out;</p><p>ii) by increasing OL death, this reduces the number of OLs by ~25%.</p><p>Thus, the effect of AMPAR activation in OL lineage cells is precisely the opposite of what was expected from cell culture work by the Gallo group 2 decades ago, which showed that AMPAR/KAR activation stopped OP proliferation. Therefore our paper significantly alters our understanding of how the development of the OL lineage is regulated by glutamatergic signalling.</p><p><italic>Major concerns are outlined below.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors illustrate that a good deal of AMPAR-mediated current (~50%) still remains in the double KOs, which may obscure some effects of AMPAR inhibition. Perhaps because of this the effects demonstrated in this manuscript as a result of the double KOs are modest and do not add any mechanistic insight to what is already known.</italic> </p><p>We have now knocked out <italic>Gria4</italic> conditionally in the OL lineage in addition to <italic>Gria2</italic> and <italic>Gria3</italic>, reducing the AMPAR-mediated current to ~10% of control and the frequency of EPSCs to practically zero. This produces a ~25-30% reduction in the number of OLs and this reduction is no longer transient as in the double-KO but persists into young adulthood (at least P53). These new data are shown in two new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>, and described in the subsection “Triple knockout of GluA2/ GluA3/ GluA4 in the OL lineage”. In addition we now show (by Caspase-3 immunolabelling) that this phenotype is caused by an increase in the death of newly-forming OLs (see our response to this reviewer’s point 2, below). Thus, our study advances the field considerably by providing the first convincing demonstration of the role of AMPARs in regulating OL number in vivo.</p><p><italic>2) As the authors state, the fact that there is no change in OP densities/proliferation in Gria2/3 KOs argues against the decrease in CC1+ OLs being due to a delay in developmental OL differentiation, but more for a decrease in OL survival, which the authors were unable to quantify. Not only does this leave the work incomplete, but it also makes it improper to conclude that AMPARs &quot;modulate the development of OLs&quot; when the effects seen could be a survival issue.</italic> </p><p>We have now used Caspase-3 immunolabelling to demonstrate an increase in the rate of developmental death among newly-forming OLs in the AMPAR knockouts. These new data are depicted for the <italic>Gria2/3</italic> double-KO in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G-H</xref> and described in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “OL survival is reduced, and OL accumulation delayed, in <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> white matter”. For the <italic>Gria2/3/4</italic> triple‐KO the data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E-F</xref> and described in the last paragraph of the subsection “Triple knockout of GluA2/ GluA3/ GluA4 in the OL lineage”.</p><p><italic>3) The authors show a reduction in myelinated neurons and suggest that OL differentiation and therefore myelination is delayed. However, they also present g-ratios that are unaffected. If developmental myelination is indeed delayed the KOs would show increased g-ratios since the myelin would begin to form later than controls. No change in g-ratios suggests other possibilities such as a survival issue of the OLs (see #2), or even the possibility that myelin internode lengths are shorter. Other studies have shown that OLs make shorter myelin sheaths upon inhibition of neuronal activity and decreased glutamate signaling (Hines et al. 2015. Nat Neurosci. 18:683-689; Mensch et al. 2015. Nat Neurosci. 18:628-630., Etxeberria et al. 2016. J Neurosci. 36:6037-6948.), therefore, it is a likely possibility that the decrease in myelinated axons observed by the authors is due to a similar change in myelin dynamics. An in-depth analysis of the myelin internodes (length and number/OL) is required to ascertain the full effect of AMPR function. Further investigation is necessary.</italic> </p><p>We took the reviewer’s comments to heart and analyzed the morphology of individual OLs by dyefilling cells in brain slices. We found that there is no detectable difference in either internode number per OL or internode length in our KO mice. These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C-D</xref> for the double-KO and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G-H</xref> for the triple-KO, and described in the first paragraph of the subsection “Reduced total myelin in <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> white matter” for the double‐KO and in the last paragraph of the subsection “Triple knockout of GluA2/ GluA3/ GluA4 in the OL lineage” for the triple-KO. It is therefore likely that, once a commitment is made to myelinate an axon, the process continues until a normal g ratio is attained. This has now been stated in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “AMPAR signalling promotes the survival of differentiating OLs”.</p><p><italic>4) It is known that the GluA2 subunit makes AMPARs impermeable to Ca+2, therefore knocking out Gria2 will lead to increased Ca+2 signaling and changes the whole nature of AMPAR signaling. Moreover, the authors suspect that the remaining AMPAR-mediated currents are due to homotetramers of GluA4, but these are likely never normally produced in OPCs and may not reveal any meaningful signaling effects. Ultimately it is not clear whether the effects the authors are studying are due to AMPAR inhibition or to altered AMPAR signaling.</italic> </p><p>We understand how the Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability of AMPARs is altered in the absence of GluA2, and indeed used this property as part of our electrophysiological characterization of the <italic>Gria2</italic> knockout.</p><p>However, the fact that we did not observe any phenotype of <italic>Gria2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> OPs relative to <italic>Gria2<sup>+/–</sup></italic> or <italic>Gria2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F-I</xref>) rules out a specific role for AMPAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling. Rather, the reduction in OL number observed in <italic>Gria2/3</italic> and <italic>Gria2/3/4</italic> mutants would appear to result from another aspect of AMPAR signaling, for example the depolarization or Na<sup>+</sup> influx that it produces. This is now discussed in the first paragraph of the Discussion. We agree with the reviewer that GluA4 homo‐tetramers might not normally form in wild type OPs, but they do appear to form in our <italic>Gria2/3</italic> double‐KOs, as shown by the fact that the residual kainate‐induced AMPAR current in the double-KO is obliterated when GluA4 is also removed. The more severe phenotype of the triple-KO compared to the double-KO (i.e. persistence of the phenotype into adulthood) and, by extension, the phenotype of the <italic>Gria2/3</italic> KOs themselves, thus appears to be caused by an inhibition of AMPAR signaling other than an alteration in Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>[…] 1) Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells are highly proliferative. Since the authors use a conditional approach to the inactivation of GluA2, it is likely that not all OPCs have both alleles of GluA2 inactivated. It is possible that over time OPCs with the conditional inactivation of GluA2 are selected against, which might explain the observed recovery in older animals. A more detailed examination of this would be very informative: is there a higher percentage of WT GluA2 OPCs in older double-mutant animals?</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting point. We have not managed to identify anti-GluA2 antibodies that would allow us to quantify the fraction of Pdgfra<sup>+</sup> OPCs that are GluA2<sup>+</sup> as a function of age in the double‐KOs. However, we think this question has been overtaken by our generating the <italic>Gria2/3/4</italic> triple-KO, the phenotype of which extends at least into early adulthood (P53<sup>+</sup>). This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A-B</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) A very interesting finding of this report is that AMPA receptors are important for differentiated, myelinating oligodendrocytes. Nevertheless, in my view this finding is not highlighted sufficiently. A proposed role for GluA2 and GluA3 in myelinating oligodendrocytes should be discussed.</italic> </p><p>We have shown that the number of differentiated OLs that survive and form myelin is reduced in the <italic>Gria2/3</italic> double-KO and <italic>Gria2/3/4</italic> triple‐KO. As Dr Popko points out, this suggests that AMPAR signalling is important in early‐differentiating OLs, implying that GluA subunits should be expressed in pre‐myelinating OLs (<italic>Enpp6<sup>+</sup></italic>) as well as in their precursors. We therefore performed double-fluorescence ISH for <italic>Gria24</italic> and <italic>Enpp6</italic> and found that there was substantial overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>, described in the last paragraph of the subsection “OL survival is reduced, and OL accumulation delayed, in <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> white matter”). As requested, we have now discussed the role of AMPARs in early myelinating OLs in the third paragraph of the subsection “AMPAR signalling promotes the survival of differentiating OLs”.</p><p><italic>3) Does the percent of myelinated axons recover to normal levels in adult animals? This data should be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We have extended our EM analysis, including an investigation of this point, and now show that the density of myelin figures does recover to normal levels by P70 in <italic>Gria2/3</italic> double-KOs. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> and described in the last paragraph of the subsection “Reduced total myelin in <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> white matter”.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>Kougioumtzidou et al., submit &quot;AMPA-type glutamate receptors on oligodendrocyte precursors modulate development of oligodendrocytes and myelin&quot; for consideration at eLife. This work centres on to topic of how neuronal activity regulates development of the oligodendrocyte lineage. This general area will be of broad interest to the readership of eLife in large part because changes to oligodendrocyte development and myelination help regulate or fine tune neural circuit function and behaviour – the latter shown in a very elegant study by the Richardson lab. In this study, the authors address how glutamate signalling directly impacts oligodendrocyte development in vivo (a long-standing question), with a focus on AMPAR mediated function. Although one might argue that the authors did not address how AMPAR function in its entirety affects oligodendrocyte development (disrupting gluR2 and gluR3, but not gluR4, which is also expressed in the OL lineage), they do see a clear phenotype in vivo, and this is of interest in and of itself. However, at the moment I think that the manuscript would benefit greatly from some additional work to allay a few concerns, and to strengthen some of the conclusions drawn.</italic> </p><p>In retrospect, we accept the reviewer’s sense that the initial submission was a little preliminary and we have worked hard in the meantime to address his/her concerns and those of the other reviewers and to strengthen our conclusions.</p><p><italic>Validation of gria3 global mutant as reasonable &quot;control&quot; background. The authors go to some lengths to highlight the importance of a conditional targeting approach, whereby AMPRA mediated signalling/ function is disrupted specifically in oligodendrocytes. They achieve this is by targeting gluR2 function using floxed alleles of gria2 and a sox10-cre, which seems sufficiently faithful to the oligodendrocyte lineage in the CNS. However, all experiments are done on a background of lack of GluR3 function, i.e. a germline gria3 mutant mouse. Indeed all &quot;controls&quot; are gria3 mutant. The authors do show that gria3 mutants exhibit no change in PDGFRa expressing oligodendrocyte precursors (or their proliferation) or CC1 expressing mature oligodendrocytes, but only one stage is examined, and no further tests are carried out. In addition to the possibility of gria3 mutant oligodendrocytes having defects at other stages or at other times, these mutants will surely have compensation for glur3 loss by expression/ regulation of other GluR subunit isoforms and disruption to neural circuit function that could potentially confound analysis of myelination. It would be reassuring to see further analyses of gria3 mutants compared to controls, e.g. additional stages, electron microscopy (see last point below), to allay concerns that its use as a control is not confounding.</italic> </p><p>We have done a more searching analysis of the <italic>Gria3</italic> null mice, comparing an additional stage (P21) of <italic>Gria3</italic> null mice to WT controls and performing EM analysis of these mice at P14. We found no difference between <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup></italic> and wild type mice in these regards, reinforcing our conclusion that <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup></italic> mice are suitable controls. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and described in the first paragraph of the subsection “GluA2 and GluA3 are individually dispensable for OL production”.</p><p><italic>Mechanism by which reduction in oligodendrocyte number is manifest</italic> </p><p><italic>It is certainly interesting that there is a reduction (albeit transient) in mature oligodendrocyte number and enpp6 expressing cell number, but the follow-up analyses as to how this comes to be come across as being a little preliminary. The authors report no significant change in PDGFRa density, but there is a stage at which there is a trend reduction in double mutants with a p value of 0.06. Could an increase in &quot;n&quot; unmask a phenotype? The analyses of cell death are also unsatisfying, given the importance of clarifying the role for AMPAR in the cell lineage. The use of additional marker(s) for cell death would be important. Is there no constitutive oligodendrocyte lineage cell death in actual wildtype animals at any of the stages examined?</italic> </p><p>We have addressed these points in two ways. First, we have added 3 more animals to each group at the P14 stage and the Pdgfra<sup>+</sup> precursor cell density still did not show a significant difference (p=0.07, described in the third paragraph of the subsection “OL survival is reduced, and OL accumulation delayed, in <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>–/–</sup></italic>white matter” and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Second, we have now generated <italic>Gria2/3/4</italic> triple‐KOs and found no detectable effect on Pdgfra<sup>+</sup> precursor cell number at P14 or P53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C, D</xref>), but a significant reduction in the number of mature (CC1+) OLs both at P14 and P53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A, B</xref>), and described in the last paragraph. Thus, the lack of an effect on OP number is reproduced in the triple‐KO, but the OL phenotype of the triple-KO is more severe than the double-KO; it is no longer transient but extends into (at least) young adulthood. To get at the underlying mechanism we have analyzed apoptotic cell death in the OL lineage by Caspase-3/ Olig2 immunolabeling and found a significant increase in double- and triple-KOs relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10F</xref>). Therefore we can now say that the decreased OL cell number in the KOs is due to increased death of newly-forming OLs. In answer to the reviewer’s question about cell death in wild type animals – yes there is significant death in the controls as expected but this is increased by ~20% in the KOs, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10H</xref>.</p><p><italic>Fewer synapses exist in double mutants. The conclusion that oligodendrocyte precursors have fewer synapses per cell is an inference based on the physiological analyses. Although a reasonable inference, to provide independent evidence in support of this conclusion would be good. Could the authors try to visualise synapse number in OPs, e.g. with a presynaptic marker at least, or ideally with a pre and post-synaptic marker together with NG2, enpp6 etc.?</italic> </p><p>We absolutely agree that it is important to strive to visualize axon-OP synapses in vivo. We had previously (before the original submission) tried hard to visualize synapses in the subcortical white matter by immunolabelling for PSD95 and VGlut1, but without success immunolabelling in white matter is difficult at the best of times and often the individual requirements of different antibodies cannot be reconciled. Furthermore, we cannot be sure whether the removal of synaptic input seen in the KOs is due to a physical loss of the synapse, or a simple absence of postsynaptic AMPARs so that the synapse becomes “silent”. Thus, we feel strongly that our electrophysiology data provide sufficient information for the present purpose and that anything further is beyond the scope of this study. In the triple-KOs we find that the frequency of Ruthenium Red‐stimulated EPSCs is reduced to zero, along with a ~90% reduction in total kainate-induced current, implying that there are no longer any functional AMPAR-containing synapses in OPs, as expected. It seems very likely that the OL phenotypes we describe result from reduction and loss of these synapses in the double- and triple-KOs, respectively. This has now been stated in the first paragraph of the subsection “AMPAR signalling promotes the survival of differentiating OLs”</p><p><italic>Electron microscopy analyses could be better quantified. It is important that the electron microscopy data support the observations of a decrease in oligodendrocyte number, whereby the authors observe a corresponding decrease in relative number of axons that are myelinated. It would be helpful to assess axonal sizes and distributions in the mutants as well, and ideally compare with controls that were not gria3 null. Comparison of gria3 mutants to control littermates would suffice.</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have now measured the diameters of myelinated and unmyelinated axons in the corpus callosum of <italic>Gria3</italic> null mice versus wild type controls. We found no differences in the range or frequency distribution of axon diameters, or in the g-ratio shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>‐J and described in the first paragraph of the subsection “GluA2 and GluA3 are individually dispensable for OL production”. Together with the analyses of the <italic>Gria3</italic> OLs described above in our response to this reviewer’s first major point, these data now provide strong evidence that loss of GluA3 in neurons and OPs does not affect development of the OL lineage. We also compared axon diameters and g-ratios in <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>Gria2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> corpus callosum versus <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>Gria2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> littermate controls, and again found no differences shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E-H</xref> and described in the first paragraph of the subsection “Reduced total myelin in <italic>Gria3<sup>null</sup>2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> white matter”.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>There are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, mostly textual, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Title: From your data, it seems as though the role of AMPAR signaling in OPCs/ immature ENPP6 expressing OLs is to control the number of oligodendrocytes that can be maintained and employed for myelination or discarded, if unnecessary.

This fraction was ~23% and was increased by a factor of ~1.19 (i.e. increased by ~19%) in the double-KO and by a factor of ~1.24 (increased by ~24%) in the triple KO.
