pheromones elicit mating resulting in an infective filament able to infect corn plants. Along this process a G2 cell cycle arrest is mandatory. Such as cell cycle arrest is initiated upon the pheromone recognition in each mating partner, and sustained once cell fusion occurred until the fungus enter the plant tissue. We describe that the initial cell cycle arrest resulted from inhibition of the nuclear transport of the mitotic inducer Cdc25 by targeting its importin, Kap123. Near cell fusion to take place, the increase on pheromone signaling promotes Cdc25 degradation, which seems to be important to ensure the maintenance of the G2 cell cycle arrest to lead the formation of the infective filament. This way, premating cell cycle arrest is linked to the subsequent steps required for establishment of the infection. Disabling this connection resulted in the inability of fungal cells to infect plants.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48943.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many fungi that cause diseases in plants need specialized structures to penetrate the plant’s tissues. To form these structures, the fungus must carefully control when and where its cells divide. As in other organisms, the sequence of events that lead to a fungal cell dividing in two are known as the cell cycle. Progress through the distinct steps in the cell cycle is regulated by enzymes including many that add or remove phosphate groups on other proteins. It remains unclear which regulatory enzymes allow any plant-infecting fungus to control its cell cycle when it forms an infection structure, but one fungus that could help answer this question is <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>, the cause of a disease known as corn smut.</p><p>The corn smut fungus forms infection structures after two different mating strains meet on the surface of the plant, stop dividing and then fuse. This implies that the cell cycles of both strains need to be coordinated to allow the fungus to infect the plant. The two strains recognize each other via chemical signals known as pheromones, and Bardetti et al. now show that pheromone recognition in the corn smut fungus results in an enzyme called Cdc25 being disabled, which in turn causes cell division to stop. Cdc25 is a phosphatase, meaning it removes phosphate groups from cell cycle regulators that are found in the nucleus of the cell. Specifically, Cdc25 targets phosphate groups that would otherwise inhibit the activity of these proteins. Further experiments showed that, following pheromone recognition, Cdc25 is disabled via a two-step process: first it is prevented from entering the nucleus which keeps it away from its targets, and then it is degraded. Bardetti et al. went on to show that this last step was required for the fungus to infect corn plants, since interfering with the breakdown of Cdc25 impairs its ability to stop the cell cycle and form an infection structure.</p><p>Entry into plant tissue is a critical step for any parasites looking to invade a plant. Since it is difficult to reach the interior of plants with pesticides, most antimicrobial treatments in plants aim at prevention rather than cure. This means that increasing the delay between a fungus recognizing the surface of a plant and penetrating its tissues could give more time to prevent infections. These new findings represent a step towards achieving that goal, though more research is needed to better understand the molecular mechanisms required for the formation of infection structures in plant-infecting fungi.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pheromone signalling</kwd><kwd><italic>Ustilago maydis</italic></kwd><kwd>cell cycle arrest</kwd><kwd>virulence</kwd><kwd>fungal development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Curie ITN Grant (FUNGIBRAIN FP7-PEOPLE-2013-ITN-607963)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bardetti</surname><given-names>Paola</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Curie ITN Grant (ARIADNE PITN-GA-2009-237936)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castanheira</surname><given-names>Sónia Marisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Braus</surname><given-names>Gerhard H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Spanish Government</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BIO2014-55398-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pérez-Martín</surname><given-names>José</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Spanish Government</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BIO2017-88938-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pérez-Martín</surname><given-names>José</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Degradation of a mitotic inducer coordinates the transition of two successive cell cycle arrests during the infective process of a plant pathogenic fungus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sexual reproduction is widely conserved within the eukaryotic life tree. The final outcome of this process is the fusion of two distinct haploid nuclei into a single diploid nucleus. To avoid an imbalance in the nuclear genetic information provided by each mating partner, the cell cycle status of both nuclei should be the same before karyogamy. In metazoans, this synchronization often occurs once the two partner nuclei are in the same zygotic cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Austin, 1978</xref>). However, in simple eukaryotes such as fungi or unicellular algae, cell cycle synchronization occurs before cell fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hartwell, 1973</xref>). In these organisms, cell cycle synchronization is mediated by the recognition of signals, often pheromones secreted by distinct mating partners. The paradigmatic and best studied case is the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. In this fungus, pheromone recognition is mediated by plasma membrane-located receptors, which transmit the signal toward the cell cycle machinery using a widely conserved MAP kinase cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bardwell, 2005</xref>). Pheromone recognition in budding yeast results in G1 cell cycle arrest, which is maintained throughout all cell fusion process, resulting in a diploid zygote that is able to resume the cell cycle or enter into meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elion, 2000</xref>). Premating cell cycle synchronization at G1 phase seems to be the rule, as other fungi such as <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davey, 1998</xref>), diatoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moeys et al., 2016</xref>), and -most likely- algae such as <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joo et al., 2017</xref>) and the slime mold <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ishida et al., 2005</xref>) apply the same principle. However, there is one exception in the fungal maize smut pathogen <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>, where premating cell cycle synchronization in response to secreted sexual pheromones occurs at G2 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">García-Muse et al., 2003</xref>). Paradoxically, in spite of the distinct cell cycle stage for arrest, the elements involved in the transmission process (pheromone and receptors, MAPK cascade and transcription factors) are similar to those described in fungi that undergo arrest at G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Müller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vollmeister et al., 2012</xref>). This result strongly suggested that the differences were linked to alternative wiring of the <italic>U. maydis</italic> pheromone MAPK cascade with cell cycle regulators, although these connections were largely unknown.</p><p>The reasons for the distinct cell cycle response to pheromone in <italic>U. maydis</italic> are likely related to the unusual developmental steps that mating triggers in this fungal system. In <italic>U. maydis</italic>, virulence and sexual development are intricately interconnected because the mating of two compatible budding haploid cells is the prerequisite to induce the infectious stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vollmeister et al., 2012</xref>). Pathogenic development is mediated by two independent loci: the <italic>a</italic>-locus, which encodes a pheromone-receptor system, and the <italic>b</italic>-locus, which encodes a pair of homeoproteins (bW and bE). On the plant surface, infection is initiated upon the recognition of mating pheromone secreted by haploid cells of the opposite mating type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bölker et al., 1992</xref>). This recognition induces G2 cell cycle arrest as well as the formation of long conjugation tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">García-Muse et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spellig et al., 1994</xref>), which grow toward each other and fuse at their tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Snetselaar et al., 1996</xref>). Cytoplasmic fusion is not followed by karyogamy, resulting in a dikaryotic cell. After cell fusion on the plant surface, the G2 cell cycle arrest is sustained, and the single dikaryotic cell grows in a polar manner, producing the infective filament. This hypha expands, accumulating the cytoplasm at the tip of the filament, whereas the distal parts of the hypha become vacuolated and are sealed off by the insertion of regularly spaced septa, resulting in the formation of characteristic empty sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Steinberg et al., 1998</xref>). This growth mode enables the fungus to progress along the plant surface, most likely to find an appropriate point of entry. Eventually, the hyphae stop polar growth in response to an as yet unidentified signal, and their tips swell to form appressoria and penetrate the cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Snetselaar and Mims, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Snetselaar and Mims, 1993</xref>). Once the filament enters the plant, the cell cycle is reactivated, and the fungus proliferates inside the plant.</p><p>During the differentiation process resulting in plant penetration, the presence of a sustained G2 cell cycle arrest is mandatory and the impairment of this cell cycle arrest resulted in the inability of the fungus to infect plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castanheira and Pérez-Martín, 2015</xref>). This cell cycle arrest is imposed first by the activation of the pheromone cascade and then maintained during the growth of the infective filament by a transcriptional regulator called b-factor, which is encoded in the <italic>b</italic>-locus and composed of two subunits (bW and bE), provided by each mating partner. The mechanisms involved in this sustained cell cycle arrest have been described only partially. While the manner by which the presence of b-factor arrests the cell cycle is comprehended in detail, the molecular intricacies associated with the cell cycle arrest induced in response to pheromone are still unknown.</p><p>G2/M transition in <italic>U. maydis</italic> is regulated by the presence of two distinct cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes: Cdk1-Clb1 and Cdk1-Clb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia-Muse, 2004</xref>). Of these, the limiting step is provided by the activity of the Cdk1-Clb2 complex, which is controlled by the inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1. The level of this phosphorylation depends on the relative activity of the Wee1 kinase (which inhibits Cdk1) and the Cdc25 phosphatase (which activates Cdk1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sgarlata and Pérez-Martín, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sgarlata and Pérez-Martín, 2005b</xref>). Not surprisingly, the mechanism by which the b-factor arrests the cell cycle at G2 during the growth of the dikaryotic infective filament relies on the increase of Cdk1 inhibitory phosphorylation: The b-factor activates the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Sena-Tomás et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mielnichuk et al., 2009</xref>) in the absence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tenorio-Gómez et al., 2015</xref>), resulting in the phosphorylation of Cdc25, promoting thereby its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, which in turn inactivates the phosphatase by its retention in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mielnichuk and Pérez-Martín, 2008</xref>); at the same time, the b-factor represses the transcription of <italic>hsl1</italic>, which encodes a kinase that downregulates Wee1 kinase, increasing as a consequence the level of inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castanheira et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, a second cell cycle brake is added during the formation of the infective filament since the b-factor also activates the transcription of <italic>biz1</italic>, a transcriptional regulator that represses the transcription of <italic>clb1</italic>, encoding the b cyclin required for the second Cdk1-cyclin complex involved in G2/M transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flor-Parra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia-Muse, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Here we tried to uncover the elements required for the pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest. Although it was possible that the pheromone response shared the same regulatory scheme as the b-induced cell cycle arrest, we show that this is not entirely the case and that some of the elements involved are different. We report that the pheromone response MAPK cascade is distinctly wired to cell cycle regulation, resulting first in the inhibition of the nuclear localization of Cdc25, via importin phosphorylation, and second, once the MAPK signaling reaches a threshold, in the degradation of the accumulated Cdc25. These steps were found to be required to ensure the maintenance of cell cycle arrest during the infection process. Inability to do so resulted in a strong defect in virulence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activation of the pheromone cascade promotes G2 cell cycle arrest via inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1</title><p>We sought to address the molecular mechanisms behind the G2 cell cycle arrest observed upon pheromone response in <italic>U. maydis</italic>. This response requires, in each mating partner, the recognition of the compatible pheromone by its cognate receptor and the transmission of the signal through a conserved MAPK cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Müller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vollmeister et al., 2012</xref>). However, the expression of pheromone and pheromone receptor genes requires poor nutritional conditions, which enables the activity of the transcriptional regulator Prf1 that activates the promoters from the <italic>a</italic>-locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hartmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaffarnik et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Since changes in nutritional conditions could alter the cell cycle pattern in this fungus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pérez-Martín et al., 2006</xref>), we took advantage of the previous description of an activated allele of the pheromone cascade MAPKK Fuz7 (<italic>fuz7<sup>DD</sup></italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), whose expression faithfully recapitulates the pheromone response in <italic>U. maydis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Müller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zarnack et al., 2008</xref>).

To add further support to this idea, we analyzed the involvement in the <italic>fuz7<sup>DD</sup></italic>-dependent cell cycle arrest of other elements required for b-dependent cell cycle arrest, like the Chk1 kinase. However, our results indicated that Chk1 was not involved in <italic>fuz7<sup>DD</sup></italic>-dependent cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

This result not only strongly suggested that the decrease of Cdc25 levels was not the cause of the cell cycle arrest, but it also supported our view of distinct molecular mechanisms between pheromone- and b-factor-induced cell cycle arrest: While high levels of Cdc25 do not affect the ability to arrest the cell cycle by the pheromone cascade activation, in the b-dependent cell cycle arrest, Cdc25 is retained at the cytoplasm by Bmh1 (14-3-3 protein), and this repression can be overwhelmed by high levels of Cdc25 (i. e. overexpressing Cdc25) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mielnichuk et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In summary, these previous results indicated that some elements, like the downregulation of <italic>hsl1</italic> (and thereby the upregulation of Wee1) seemed to be shared by b- and pheromone cascade-induced cell cycle arrest.

In support of a functional role of the observed Pcl12 and Crk1 physical interaction, we found that loss of function of Crk1 abrogated <italic>fuz7<sup>DD</sup></italic>-dependent cell cycle arrest as well as the decrease in Cdc25 levels in a similar manner as the <italic>pcl12</italic> mutant did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Furthermore, we also observed that Crk1 was also required for cell cycle arrest upon ectopic expression of <italic>pcl12</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>). These results sustained the idea that Crk1 and Pcl12 were working together during the pheromone cascade-induced cell cycle arrest, most likely as a complex.</p><p>Interestingly, Crk1 activation was previously described to be linked to the pheromone cascade: In order to promote hyperpolarized growth, Crk1 must be activated via phosphorylation of its T-loop by the MAPKK Fuz7, as well as by phosphorylation of the C-terminal end by the MAPK Kpp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garrido et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we wondered whether these described connections between Crk1 and the pheromone cascade during the promotion of filamentous growth were also required for <italic>fuz7<sup>DD</sup></italic>-induced cell cycle arrest. To address this question, we took advantage of previously described mutant alleles of <italic>crk1</italic> refractory to phosphorylation by Fuz7 (<italic>crk1<sup>AEF</sup></italic>) or by Kpp2 (<italic>crk1<sup>AAA</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garrido et al., 2004</xref>). Much to our surprise, we found that cells carrying <italic>crk1<sup>AEF</sup></italic> or <italic>crk1<sup>AAA</sup></italic> mutant alleles were able to arrest the cell cycle upon the expression of the <italic>fuz7<sup>DD</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Moreover, we also found that the ectopic expression of <italic>pcl12</italic> was still able to arrest the cell cycle in cells carrying different mutations affecting the phosphorylation of Crk1 by the MAPK cascade, such as the loss-of-function in <italic>fuz7</italic> or <italic>kpp2</italic>, or <italic>crk1</italic> alleles refractory to phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>These results indicated that the described activation of Crk1 via the pheromone cascade during filamentation played no role in the cell cycle arrest induced by the same MAPK cascade. To explain this apparent paradox, we propose that Crk1, which is a kinase that have features of both CDK-like and MAPK-like kinases (see discussion section for a detailed description of this hypothesis), can be activated by two distinct manners: either as a MAPK, by T-loop phosphorylation through the pheromone MAPK cascade, to support polar growth; or as a CDK, by interaction with Pcl12 cyclin, to support cell cycle arrest. Distinct activation mechanisms probably also involve distinct targets explaining the distinct outcomes.</p><p>Both Crk1 and Pcl12 were previously described as regulators involved in morphogenesis of the conjugative tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flor-Parra et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garrido et al., 2004</xref>), although the relationships between these factors at this level were not studied. We observed that, in contrast to the cell cycle arrest, which is abrogated by a single mutation in either <italic>pcl12</italic> or <italic>crk1</italic>, the effects of each gene mutation on the morphology of the resulting filament upon expression of <italic>fuz7<sup>DD</sup></italic> allele were distinct, and the double mutant was more affected than single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). On the basis of these genetic interactions, we propose that Pcl12 and Crk1 work together, most likely forming a complex, and acting on the pheromone cascade-induced cell cycle arrest. However, it seems that these proteins also work in parallel pathways during the control of conjugation tube morphogenesis, most likely through the Pcl12-Cdk5 complex in one pathway, and through Crk1 receiving MAPK cascade signals in the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Kap123, the importin for Cdc25, seems to be phosphorylated upon activation of the pheromone cascade</title><p>The results shown above can be included in a working model in which the pheromone cascade-dependent induction of the expression of <italic>pcl12</italic> enables the formation of a Crk1-Pcl12 complex, which is responsible for the cell cycle arrest at G2.

Since the phosphatase Cdc25 must be transported to the nucleus to activate mitosis entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mielnichuk and Pérez-Martín, 2008</xref>), we hypothesized that retaining Cdc25 in the cytoplasm could explain the observed G2 cell cycle arrest upon ectopic <italic>pcl12</italic> expression and, most likely, also upon <italic>fuz7<sup>DD</sup></italic> expression. This hypothesis was reminiscent of the b-induced retention of Cdc25 at the cytoplasm via interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, we considered unlikely to be the same mechanism, because for b-dependent cell cycle arrest such cytoplasmic retention can be saturated by overexpression of Cdc25, and we observed that it was not the case for the pheromone cascade-induced cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48943.017</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Kap123 seems to be phosphorylated upon activation of the pheromone cascade.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of an ectopic copy of <italic>pcl12</italic> resulted in exclusion of Cdc25 from nucleus.

We wondered about the outcome from crosses of <italic>kap123<sup>T867A</sup></italic> mutant strains. Mating in <italic>U. maydis</italic> is easily scored by the formation of dikaryotic filaments on charcoal plates, which can be observed as a white-appearing mycelial growth (fuzzy phenotype) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banuett and Herskowitz, 1989</xref>). We observed that although slightly impaired, the mutant crosses showed a positive fuzzy phenotype (i.e., they were able to mate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Therefore, we were curious about the nuclear content of the filaments resulting from these crosses. To address this question, we crossed haploid strains expressing a GFP fusion to a nuclear localization signal under control of the <italic>b</italic>-dependent <italic>dik6</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mielnichuk et al., 2009</xref>). In this way, only cells resulting from mating and therefore activating the transcriptional program dependent on b-factor (which subunits are provided by each mating partner) produced a fluorescent nuclear signal, so the mating-derived filaments can be distinguished from the cell population background (frequently enriched in aberrant elongated cells). We found that the majority of b-dependent filaments from wild-type crosses carried two nuclei, whereas filaments obtained from mutant crosses frequently carried two (62% of filaments), three (35%) and less frequently four (3%) nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). We did not find filaments carrying more than four nuclei (from a total of 100 filaments counted).</p><p>To understand these results, it is worth remembering that once the cytoplasms of the compatible mating partners fuse, the formation of the heterodimeric b-factor activates the molecular mechanisms to induce a G2 cell cycle arrest. Indeed, we observed that the presence of the <italic>kap123<sup>T867A</sup></italic> allele did not affect the ability of b-factor to arrest the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The inability of cells carrying the <italic>kap123<sup>T867A</sup></italic> allele to arrest the cell cycle in response to pheromone (this is, to synchronize their cell cycles before cytogamy) will result, most likely, in the fusion of mating partners at different stages of the cell cycle. However, once the two cytoplasms fuse, the establishment of a barrier at G2 by the b-factor would resynchronize the respective nuclear content in the resulting filament. In the case of mating partners fusing their cytoplasms during G1 to G2 phases (i. e. providing a single nucleus each), the result will be a dikaryotic filament with nuclei arrested at G2. Only for those partners that fuse during or immediately after mitosis (and before cytokinesis), the result will be a filament carrying three nuclei (only one partner carried two nuclei before fusion) or four nuclei (the two partners carried two nuclei each), with these nuclei arrested at G2. In any case, the final result will be a cell cycle arrested filament (by virtue of b-factor) and therefore it will be proficient for infection, explaining the ability of mutant cells to infect corn plants. Interestingly, this ability to synchronize the cell cycle status of distinct nuclei in a common cytoplasm by homeodomain proteins of the b-factor family is the basis for accurate cell division in other basidiomycete dikaryotic fungi such as <italic>Coprinopsis cinerea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Sena-Tomás et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The MAPK Kpp2 directs Cdc25 downregulation</title><p>We were curious about the observed dramatic decrease in Cdc25 levels upon expression of the <italic>fuz7<sup>DD</sup></italic> allele and whether this observation bears any functional relevance.

In support of this explanation we observed that the downregulation of Cdc25 levels requires the retention of Cdc25 in the cytoplasm, since expression of the <italic>fuz7<sup>DD</sup></italic> allele in a <italic>kap123<sup>T867A</sup></italic> mutant strain does not result in a decrease in Cdc25 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). However, we also observed that <italic>pcl12</italic> ectopic expression, despite being able to arrest the cell cycle and retain Cdc25 in the cytoplasm, was unable to induce a decrease in the Cdc25 level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, from the above described experiments using different pheromone doses, it was clear that the lowest pheromone concentration (0.25 μg/ml), was able to induce the phosphorylation of Kap123 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) as well as the retention of Cdc25 at cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>), but not its downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). These observations suggested that although cytoplasmic retention was required, it was not sufficient to induce the downregulation of Cdc25.</p><p>We hypothesized that Cdc25 could be a target (direct or indirect) of the pheromone MAPK cascade, which induces its degradation only when Cdc25 is retained at the cytoplasm and the activation of the pheromone cascade reaches some threshold level (as expected in the presence of high amounts of synthetic pheromone or expression of the activated <italic>fuz7<sup>DD</sup></italic> allele). To uncover the involvement of the MAPK cascade in the downregulation of Cdc25, we constructed a strain simultaneously expressing the <italic>fuz7<sup>DD</sup></italic> allele and <italic>pcl12</italic> under the <italic>crg1</italic> promoter. In this way, we can induce cell cycle arrest, as well as the retention of Cdc25 in the cytoplasm (as a consequence of the ectopic expression of <italic>pcl12</italic>), even in conditions that potentially disable the MAPK cascade, such as the disruption of the <italic>kpp2</italic> gene. In agreement with our hypothesis, we found that under conditions of cell cycle arrest and the retention of Cdc25 in the cytoplasm, Kpp2 was required for the decrease in Cdc25 levels upon <italic>fuz7<sup>DD</sup></italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>Since we considered the possibility that Cdc25 was a direct target of Kpp2, we tried to detect physical interactions between Kpp2 and Cdc25. We used a strain that expressed both the <italic>fuz7<sup>DD</sup></italic> allele and <italic>pcl12</italic> and carried a kinase-dead allele of Kpp2 fused to GFP (Kpp2<sup>K50R</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Müller et al., 2003</xref>), as well as an HA-tagged Cdc25 allele. Using GFP-trap beads, we were able to detect interactions between Kpp2 and Cdc25, which were dependent on the expression of the <italic>fuz7<sup>DD</sup></italic> allele (i.e., high levels of MAPK signaling) and the presence of a wild-type Kap123 allele (i.e., retainment of Cdc25 in the cytoplasm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our results were consistent with the idea that activation of the pheromone cascade resulted in the negative regulation of Cdc25 levels by a two-step mechanism: First, Cdc25 is retained in the cytoplasm as a result of the formation of the Pcl12-Crk1 complex, and then Cdc25 is potentially phosphorylated by the Kpp2 MAPK, which probably promoted its degradation.</p><p>Compared to other fungal Cdc25-like phosphatases, <italic>U. maydis</italic> Cdc25 carries an unusually long N-terminal extension of approximately 270 amino acids with no similarity to orthologues in the database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Previous attempts to ascribe a role to this domain were elusive because its deletion did not appear to affect the Cdc25 function in <italic>U. maydis</italic> growing under axenic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sgarlata and Pérez-Martín, 2005a</xref>), although it affected the sensitivity of <italic>U. maydis</italic> cells to cell wall stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carbó and Pérez-Martín, 2010</xref>). We found that the removal of this N-terminal extension resulted in the stabilization of Cdc25 upon expression of the <italic>fuz7<sup>DD</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Based on sequence, this region contains at least three putative MAPK phosphorylation sites (Ser<sup>7</sup>, Ser<sup>23</sup> and Ser<sup>239</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). With support from the observed physical interactions, we considered the possibility that Kpp2 phosphorylates Cdc25 in this region, promoting its degradation as described in mammalian Cdc25 in response to activation of the p38 MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Uchida et al., 2009</xref>). To investigate this possibility, the three candidate Ser residues were mutated to Ala (<italic>cdc25<sup>AAA</sup></italic> allele). Encouragingly, we found that the triple mutant was resistant to the downregulation observed in the wild-type allele upon expression of the <italic>fuz7<sup>DD</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Moreover, in accordance with our model explaining how the cell cycle is arrested in response to pheromone, neither the deletion of the N-terminal extension nor the alanine mutations affected the ability of cells undergo cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>) as well as the retention of Cdc25 at cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>).</p><p>In summary, these data strongly suggested that the MAPK Kpp2 targets and downregulates the phosphatase Cdc25, most likely promoting its degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>The pheromone-dependent decrease of Cdc25 levels is required for virulence</title><p>We analyzed the capacity of sexually compatible strains (<italic>a1 b1</italic> and <italic>a2 b2</italic> mating type) carrying the <italic>cdc25<sup>AAA</sup></italic> allele to infect plants.

The defect in virulence could be attributed to problems related to the mating process itself or it might be related to subsequent steps, such as the ability of the fungus to proliferate within the plant, for example. To address this issue, we took advantage of the solopathogenic strain SG200, which is a haploid strain that carries the genetic information from the two different mating types and, as a consequence, does not require cell fusion to produce the infective hypha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bölker et al., 1995</xref>).

Since cells carrying the <italic>cdc25<sup>AAA</sup></italic> allele were able to be arrested in response to activation of the pheromone cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>), these observations prompted us to think that the presence of the <italic>cdc25<sup>AAA</sup></italic> allele could affect the G2 cell cycle arrest activated in the presence of a functional b-factor. However, we observed that the presence of the <italic>cdc25<sup>AAA</sup></italic> allele did not affect the ability of AB33 cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> for a description of this strain) to undergo cell cycle arrest upon the expression of compatible b proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we observed that the absence of downregulation of Cdc25 levels in response to pheromone does not affect neither pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest nor de novo (independent of previous pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest) b-induced cell cycle arrest. However, the absence of downregulation of Cdc25 levels seems to affect the cell cycle arrest in b-dependent filaments originating from crosses (i.e., resulting from a mating process). These unexpected results can be explained keeping in mind that, in <italic>U. maydis,</italic> during a regular cell cycle Cdc25 accumulates at G2 phase; and, that in contrast to pheromone-dependent cell cycle arrest, the b-dependent cell cycle arrest can be bypassed by high levels of Cdc25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mielnichuk et al., 2009</xref>). We believe that during the pheromone-dependent G2 cell cycle arrest, Cdc25 is accumulating in the cytoplasm of conjugation tubes, but that as the compatible conjugation tubes are getting close (and therefore encountering higher pheromone concentrations) the subsequent increase in the pheromone-cascade signaling, promotes a decrease in the Cdc25 levels that allows a proper b-dependent cell cycle arrest in the filament once the cells were fused. Inability to achieve this decrease (as the case of stable Cdc25 alleles) could result in impaired b-dependent cell cycle arrest and thereby defects in pathogenicity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Smut fungi are a widespread group of plant pathogens whose sexual development is coupled with virulence. All smut species investigated so far have in common the need to undergo a successful mating reaction to form an infective dikaryotic filament before being able to infect their host plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakkeren et al., 2008</xref>). In the most studied member of this group, <italic>U. maydis</italic>, it has been described strong connections between the regulation of the cell cycle and the ability to infect plants: During the steps previous to plant infection, it is required a sustained G2 cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perez-Martin, 2012</xref>). The cell cycle arrest of the infective filament on plant surface observed in <italic>U. maydis</italic> seems to be more general, and it is also present in rust fungi like <italic>Uromyces phaseoli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heath and Heath, 1978</xref>).</p><p>The connections between cell cycle regulation and the virulence in plant fungal pathogens have been studied in detail in other systems, in addition to <italic>U. maydis</italic>, such as <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> and <italic>Colletotrichum orbiculare</italic>. In these systems, the infection depends on the formation of appressorium, a structure required for plant penetration. The appressoria from these fungi use a turgor-driven mechanical process to breach the plant cuticle. The functionality of this class of appressorium implies the increase of internal turgor pressure, which is linked to an elaborated program that includes from metabolic reprograming to morphological changes to produce a clearly defined structure with a thick, multilayered and highly melanized cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ryder and Talbot, 2015</xref>). The various steps required for the formation of appressorium in these phytopathogenic fungi are linked to the different cell cycle phases. There is a G1/S control to induce the formation of appressorium, first described in <italic>C. orbiculare</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fukada and Kubo, 2015</xref>), but also operating in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fukada et al., 2019</xref>); and there is a S-phase checkpoint required for appressorium differentiation in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Osés-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Osés-Ruiz and Talbot, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to appressoria from these phytopathogenic fungi, appressoria of <italic>U. maydis</italic> is not dependent on turgor pressure to penetrate the plant tissue. The appressorium directs the localized secretion of enzymes that weakens the plant cuticle, allowing the plant tissue penetration. For that reason, the morphogenesis process is less complex and appressoria are unmelanized, rather small swellings of the hyphal tip that form penetration structures that are less constricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Snetselaar and Mims, 1993</xref>). However, in spite of this apparent lack of complexity, there is also a clear connection with cell cycle regulation. G2 cell cycle arrest is mandatory to promote the differentiation of the appressorium, and the impairment in cell cycle arrest resulted in a lack of virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castanheira et al., 2014</xref>). This obligation for cell cycle arrest at G2 phase is most likely related to the fact that mitosis and the morphogenetic program responsible for appressorium formation compete for the same cytoskeletal components. Because of this competition, it makes sense that cellular controls exist to force these two processes to be incompatible and therefore to prevent infective filaments from entering mitosis (i.e., to arrest the progression of the cell cycle at G2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pérez-Martín et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>G2 cell cycle arrest is established before mating and is maintained once the dikaryotic infective filament is formed, until the fungus enters the plant. During this period, cell cycle arrest is sustained by two distinct regulatory networks: First, by the pheromone-recognition cascade in each mating partner and second, once cytoplasmic fusion occurs, by the presence of a homeodomain transcriptional regulator called b-factor (which, among other targets, represses the <italic>a</italic>-locus, encoding the pheromone and receptors; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Urban et al., 1996</xref>). Our results showed that the two regulatory networks recruit both shared and specific elements to induce and sustain cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The G2/M transition in <italic>U. maydis</italic> is controlled by the level of inhibitory phosphorylation of the Cdk1-Clb2 complex, and both regulatory networks rely on an increase in Cdk1 inhibitory phosphorylation to arrest the cell cycle. To achieve this increase, both regulatory networks upregulate the kinase responsible for this inhibitory phosphorylation, the Wee1 kinase. This upregulation is indirect and is mediated by the transcriptional repression of <italic>hsl1</italic>, which encodes a kinase that represses Wee1 activity. However, the repression of <italic>hsl1</italic> is not enough to arrest the cell cycle at G2: loss-of-function mutants in Hsl1 are able to progress through the cell cycle, although they have an extended G2 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castanheira et al., 2014</xref>). To arrest the cell cycle, a second element is required, namely the downregulation of Cdc25, the phosphatase that removes the Cdk1 inhibitory phosphorylation. Is at this step where the two regulatory networks differ. The pheromone cascade promotes the formation of a kinase-cyclin complex, Crk1-Pcl12, which phosphorylates and inhibits the β-importin Kap123, which is required for the nuclear translocation of Cdc25. The b-factor, however, activates the cascade responsible for the DNA damage response (DDR, composed of Atr1 and Chk1 kinases), resulting in phosphorylation of Cdc25, which promotes its cytoplasmic retention via 14-3-3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Sena-Tomás et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mielnichuk and Pérez-Martín, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mielnichuk et al., 2009</xref>). This downregulation of Cdc25 also provides a time window to load a third element (not present in pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest) consisting of the transcriptional repression (via an intermediate regulator called Biz1) of <italic>clb1</italic>, which encodes a second b-type cyclin that is also required for G2/M transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flor-Parra et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48943.038</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Two regulatory networks recruit both shared and specific elements to induce and sustain a G2 cell cycle arrest during the production of the infective structures in <italic>U.</italic></title><p><italic>maydis</italic>.

The pheromone recognition by each mating partner has to culminate with the fusion of the respective conjugation tubes. If for some reason this step does not occur, the unmated cells must be able to return to the previous vegetative status. In other words, the pheromone cell cycle arrest should be reversible if the stimulus (pheromone) disappears and mating was not successful. A control mediated by the phosphorylation of importin could probably be easily reversed by some phosphatase (specific or not) once the signaling through the pheromone cascade is abrogated. The formation of the dikaryotic filament, however, is a more terminal decision in the sense that once the mating partners fuse their respective cytoplasms, if they are compatible at the <italic>b</italic>-locus, the infective filament is committed to infecting the plant. The presence of two independent cell cycle brakes, provided by the retention of Cdc25 at cytoplasm by 14-3-3 proteins and by the transcriptional repression of <italic>clb1</italic> could make this step less reversible.</p><p>Our results also reveal the importance of the transition from pheromone-dependent to b-dependent cell cycle arrest once the respective partners fuse. Although the downregulation of Cdc25 activity consists of the retention of Cdc25 in the cytoplasm in both regulatory networks, there is one relevant difference: while the inhibition of nuclear translocation (pheromone-dependent) cannot be bypassed by high concentrations of Cdc25, the retention of Cdc25 by 14-3-3 (b-dependent) is sensitive to the amount of Cdc25 (probably because of saturation of the available retention proteins). This difference gains importance because Cdc25 most likely accumulates in the cytoplasm of conjugation tubes during G2 cell cycle arrest. Once the respective cytoplasms fuse, if the amount of Cdc25 has not been previously tuned, the 14-3-3 retention system will probably be overwhelmed, and the time window required for the establishment of permanent G2 cell cycle arrest will not be provided. For that reason, it seems logical that once the pheromone cascade reaches some signaling threshold (probably reflecting a close encounter between compatible conjugation tubes), it triggers the downregulation of Cdc25 to levels that are most likely easily assimilable by the 14-3-3 proteins. The importance of adjusting the levels of Cdc25 is reflected by the impaired ability of cells carrying the <italic>cdc25<sup>AAA</sup></italic> allele to infect plants.</p><p>Central to the pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest in <italic>U. maydis</italic> was the complex formed by the kinase Crk1 and the cyclin Pcl12. Both proteins were previously reported to be required for the proper morphogenesis of the infective filament in this fungus. Interestingly, in this function, they were part of distinct complexes or regulatory networks: Pcl12 complexed with the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flor-Parra et al., 2007</xref>), while Crk1 was activated in a similar way to MAPK via T-loop phosphorylation by the upstream MAPK kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garrido et al., 2004</xref>). In this work, we showed that Pcl12 and Crk1 seem to form a complex with specific roles in cell cycle arrest upon pheromone recognition and that neither Cdk5 nor MAPK cascade phosphorylation are involved. How Pcl12 controls the activity of Crk1 in this process is beyond the scope of this work. However, we can anticipate some possibilities. Crk1 belongs to the family of RD kinases, which have a conserved arginine residue preceding an aspartate residue in the catalytic loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnson et al., 1996</xref>). For this reason, the members of this family require an activation segment (T-loop) that undergoes a conformational change to fold into an active catalytic site. This conformational change can be achieved either by the phosphorylation of specific residues (such as TxY in MAP kinases) or by interaction with other proteins (such as cyclins in cyclin-dependent kinases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nolen et al., 2004</xref>). Crk1 carries a TEY signature at its T-loop, similar to a MAP kinase, but it is worth mentioning that it was cloned from a genetic screening devoted to uncovering CDK-like proteins in <italic>U. maydis</italic> and that the predicted three-dimensional folding of the catalytic domain of Crk1 fits the structure of Cdk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garrido and Pérez-Martín, 2003</xref>). We propose that Crk1 can be activated either by T-loop phosphorylation (through the pheromone MAPK cascade) or by interaction with Pcl12 cyclin. The activation of Crk1 in the absence of Pcl12, which is dependent on T-loop phosphorylation, resulted in the promotion of polar growth without affecting cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garrido et al., 2004</xref>). However, cell cycle arrest by Crk1 was dependent on Pcl12 cyclin but independent of T-loop phosphorylation. The use of proteins unrelated to cyclins to activate CDKs is well described, including the so-called K-cyclins from viruses, p35 as a coactivator of mammalian Cdk5 and the family of RINGO/Speedy proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nebreda, 2006</xref>). However, the use of a cyclin to activate a noncanonical cyclin-dependent kinase has not, to the best of our knowledge, been previously described. The importance of this alternative activation mechanism can be appreciated by considering that Crk1 belongs to a widely conserved family of fungal kinases, the founding member of which is Ime2, a central regulator of meiosis in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. The Ime2-related kinases exhibit amazing variety in controlling sexual developmental programs in fungi, although the targets and physiological inputs seem to be very species-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Irniger, 2011</xref>). Alternative mechanisms of activation could help to explain this plethora of roles.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Their main findings are (1) that activation of the pheromone-MAPK cascade leads to retention of the Cdc25 phosphatase in the cytosol due to phosphorylation of the Cdc25 importin likely by a complex formed between the cyclin Pcl12 and the CDK-like kinase Crk1, and (2) high-level activation of the pheromone-MAPK kinase leads to downregulation of Cdc25 protein levels due to phosphorylation of the N-terminal tail of Cdc25 likely by the MAPK Kpp2. Interestingly, preventing the cell cycle block by blocking importin phosphorylation does not prevent mating, nor plant pathogenesis. By contrast, preventing Cdc25 downregulation has no effect on pre-fusion cell cycle arrest, but impairs post-fusion cell cycle block and pathogenesis. The data is interpreted in terms of importance of this dual regulation during a cell fate change.</p><p>This is an interesting story, for which a lot of the data is solid, with genetics and biochemistry supporting the claims. There are, however, a few areas that need to be looked at to make it a strong paper for publication.</p><p>Experiments/data analysis:</p><p>The figures showing the localization of GFP-Cdc25 are not convincing (except Figure S10C). Providing both single channels and merge would help, maybe of single examples at higher magnification. This should be coupled with quantification of nuclear and cytosolic levels.</p><p>One important message from the paper is that Cdc25 is regulated by two distinct mechanisms: a cytosolic retention mechanism keeping pre-mating cells in G2, and a degradation mechanism important to keep post-mating cell in G2. From the data using mating cells, I am not fully convinced that this distinction in temporality can be made. First, the authors claim that mating appears to proceed normally in the kap123-T867A mutant, which fails to block the cell cycle in G2 when fuz7-DD or pcl12 are overexpressed. However, Figure 4A, showing Kap123 migration pattern in response to pheromone stimulation, is not convincingly showing the claimed mobility shift. The gel appears to be slightly smiley, but I don't see bands migrating slower. This lowers the confidence that Kap123 is in fact phosphorylated in these conditions. In addition, though kap123-T867A mutants form filaments that often have &gt;2 nuclei in mating conditions (Figure 4D), it is not clear whether this results from a pre-mating failure in G2 block as claimed by the authors, or a post-mating block failure. In fact, when assessing the cdc25-AAA mutant, the authors perform exactly the same experiment (Figure 6C) and interpret the multi-nucleated defect as a post-fusion cycling issue. Imaging the filaments pre- and post-fusion in these conditions would address the issue.</p><p>Similarly, because Cdc25 levels decrease with increasing dosage of pheromone, the authors hypothesize that Cdc25 is a low-affinity substrate for the MAPK (subsection “The MAPK Kpp2 directs Cdc25 downregulation”), which is phosphorylated and destabilized only upon high pheromone signal. However, the authors do not test whether the cytosolic retention of Cdc25 is also pheromone-level dependent. It could equally be that Kap123 importin phosphorylation scales with pheromone concentration and that Cdc25 is retained more in the cytosol in high pheromone levels, which will lead to more Cdc25 phosphorylation and degradation given this only happens in this compartment. These issues need to be clarified.</p><p>It is unfortunate that the paper just falls short of demonstrating a direct substrate-kinase relationship between the importin and Crk1 and between Cdc25 and Kpp2, though it shows existence of complexes between the importin and Ltc12, and between Cdc25 and Kpp2.</p><p>Text changes:</p><p>The writing needs to be looked at. From the abstract it is not clear whether there are two distinct cell cycle arrests during distinct cycles, or two distinct mechanisms of arrest during the same cell cycle. It is only after reading the paper that I understood that the two arrests refer to two distinct mechanisms that occur during mating of haploid cells pre-fusion and in dikaryotic cells post-fusion, which together maintain the cell in the same G2 phase. The same goes in other parts of the manuscript. For instance, &quot;the mutant filaments&quot; (subsection “The pheromone-dependent decrease in the Cdc25 level enables b dependent cell cycle arrest.”) could be more clearly spelled out as dikaryotic post-fusion cells. There are also a number of grammatical mistakes.</p><p>In the Discussion section, I do not understand in what way repression of clb1 transcription by Biz1 would be irreversible. The discussion spends much time discussing these regulatory mechanisms, which are not the object of this paper, but does not discuss some pertinent questions raised by the data, for instance why Cdc25 levels do not drop upon Pcl12 over-expression but Pcl12 is required for the Cdc25 levels drop upon fuz7-DD expression. My guess is that Cdc25 downregulation can only happen in the cytosol and that Pcl12 is required for Cdc25 cytosolic retention, but this is not explicitly formulated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Cytoplasmic Retention and degradation of a mitotic inducer enable the steps for plant infection by a pathogenic fungus. Bardetti et al.</p><p>This study seeks to determine the mechanism of cell cycle control that leads to plant infection by the corn smut fungus Ustilago maydis. During infection, the fungus forms a dikaryon, which is the infective state. This requires synchrony between the cell cycles of the fusing haploid sporidia, so that subsequent development is co-ordinated. There are two discrete cell cycle arrests. The first is initiated upon pheromone recognition by each mating partner, while a second cell cycle arrest occurs after cell fusion leading to establishment of the infective dikaryotic filament. The significance of this study is that the authors propose that the cell cycle arrests occur by two distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, the first pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest results from inhibition of the nuclear import of the mitotic inducer Cdc25, based on inhibiting the function of the importin, Kap123. This is a novel mechanism, distinct from what is known in the model yeasts. Interestingly, the absence of the first G2 cell cycle arrest is dispensable for virulence, while the second cell cycle control point is essential. Linking the two control mechanisms is therefore necessary.</p><p>The paper is interesting because it reveals a new mechanistic insight into the control of virulence by a dikaryotic basidiomycete pathogen. This builds upon the pioneering work of the Kahmann lab, in particular (plus Kronstad, Banuett and others) in working out how pheromone signalling and self/non-self recognition via bE/bW mating type locus functions. The link to cell cycle control is, however, vital, but often overlooked, so this paper is potentially significant, building on some excellent previous work by lead author Perez-Martin. Furthermore, the work is carefully executed in the main. What really lets it down (but which I hope can be remedied) is the way the paper is written. The manuscript is quite impenetrable in parts and needs to be re-drafted to include a set of intermediate conclusions at each stage in which the work is presented. This is absolutely vital, because currently I think the number of people who will understand this work, let alone appreciate its significance, is currently very small.</p><p>The Abstract and Introduction section describe the conclusions in a relatively straightforward way, including the key finding that the pheromone-induced G2 arrest is a consequence of inhibition of nuclear transport of Cdc25 via Kap123. I think the key point that is missed in the Results section is the comparison with established mechanism by which b-factor induces G2 cell cycle arrest. I think the opening of the Results section should be re-written in a way that structures more tightly to the three effects by which b-factor mediates the sustained cell cycle arrest? This will help to explain the rationale for the study and the way in which the experiments were carried out. It will, for example, help to point out the differences in relation to the results of cdc25 transcriptional levels found in Figure 1—figure supplement 3B with protein levels reported in Figure 1E and Figure 1F, that are important to understand if the rest of the paper is to be understood.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In each section, the authors need to make a firm conclusion to help orient the reader. This is almost entirely missing, which makes the manuscript really difficult to follow. In the subsection” Activation of the pheromone cascade promotes G2 cell cycle arrest via inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1”, the rationale for using the fuz7DD mutant, for instance, is not fully explained and there is no conclusion provided to subsection “Activation of the pheromone cascade promotes G2 cell cycle arrest via inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1” at all.</p><p>2) The introduction of the subsection “Pheromone cascade-induced cell cycle arrest depends on an alternative cyclin interacting with a Cdk-like kinase” has no introduction and does not follow logically from the previous section. The rationale for this part of the paper is not introduced until later in this subsection. This needs to come sooner, and with a better explanation.</p><p>3) In Figure 1, I would prefer to see discrete data points rather than the bar charts shown in 1C and D.</p><p>4) The Cdc25 overexpression experiment (subsection “Activation of the pheromone cascade promotes G2 cell cycle arrest via inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1”) needs more emphasis, as it is critical for understanding why the nuclear localisation idea was followed. I think some of this data should be in Figure 1 and not in Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</p><p>5) Figure 2A- please add a micrograph of pcl12.</p><p>6) Figure 2B showing Cdk1 phosphorylation in FuzDD Δpcl12. The blot in 2B seems to show less total Cdk1 and Cdk5. Instead of having Figure 3—figure supplement 1, it might be better to more clearly to show CDK1 phosphorylation in Figure 2B. Could maybe authors clarify why they show Figure 3—figure supplement 1 vs. a blot of CDK1P?</p><p>7) Please clarify sentences subsection “Pheromone cascade-induced cell cycle arrest depends on an alternative cyclin interacting with a Cdk-like kinase” on the role of CDK and link with MAPK and Prf1 signaling. It is not clear what authors are trying to point out here and it is not clear that this work is already published.</p><p>8) In subsection “Pheromone cascade-induced cell cycle arrest depends on an alternative cyclin interacting with a Cdk-like kinase”, the authors suggest that Pcl12 and Crk1 interact to cause the cell cycle arrest. Can a physical interaction be demonstrated either by co-localization of these proteins in arrested vs. non-arrested cells or in vitro by Y2H to show if this is direct or indirect interaction. This statement really needs much better support as no evidence is provided.</p><p>9) In Figure 2E, a GFP-cdc25 control is needed to show difference between arrested vs. non-arrested cells.</p><p>10) Figure 2 we understand that Cdc25 degradation depends on Pcl12 and independent on crk1. But this conclusion reads diluted within the text. For example, the conclusion comes in the end of subsection “Pheromone cascade-induced cell cycle arrest is mediated by the phosphorylation of Cdc25 importin, Kap123” all together but maybe authors could slowly build up during the progression of the text this conclusion.</p><p>11) Subsection “Pheromone cascade-induced cell cycle arrest depends on an alternative cyclin interacting with a Cdk-like kinase”. Again, there is no conclusion made to this section at all, which means that the next (really important) part of the paper on the Kap123 protein is introduced without any real reasoning.</p><p>12) What happen to nuclear localization of Cdc25AAA? Has this been checked?</p><p>13) Have the authors expressed Cdc25 with an NLS to force Cdc25 into the nucleus? This would be valuable to test the model presented.</p><p>14) It would be valuable to carry out Y2H to define the physical interaction of Kpp2 with Cdc25 and also between Pcl12, CRK1, Kap123 and Cdc25. Have these experiments been carried out?</p><p>15) Subsection “Pheromone cascade-induced cell cycle arrest is mediated by the phosphorylation of Cdc25 importin, Kap123” is the first time a definitive conclusion is made in the manuscript. This is problematic for me. The paper needs to be more simply presented and broken into conclusions that build the story logically. I am not convinced by the way, or order in which the paper is currently presented. The nuclear localisation status of cdc25 needs to be introduced as a concept much earlier, following what is already known about the b-factor cell cycle arrest mechanism. This would make much more sense than how the paper is currently written.</p><p>16) Subsection “The absence of G2 cell cycle arrest during pheromone response has little impact on the ability of <italic>U. maydis</italic> to infect plants”. This section doesn't logically follow the one that precedes it.</p><p>17) In Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, why do the authors not include a loading control to show that amounts of protein loaded are the same for every lane? Differences in loading of samples are corrected by dividing each phosphopeptide-specific antibody signal by the Cdk1 (anti-PSTAIRE) antibody signal. However, this only gives a relative abundance of P/Cdk1. I would prefer to see loading controls too.</p><p>In summary, I think the paper has definite merit and potential significance in explaining the link between the two distinct cell cycle arrests and the onset of virulence by U. maydis. However, it is illogically presented in my view and often the detail obscures the truly significant findings. For me, a key finding is that the pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest is on its own dispensable for virulence. However, it enables the b-dependent cell cycle arrest, which is absolutely essential. Secondly, although mechanistically the b-dependent G2 arrest and pheromone arrest differ, they actually have a conserved underlying mechanism which requires retaining Cdc25 in the cytoplasm. This needs much greater emphasis too. Finally, the paper is also very narrowly framed. Only studies in Ustilago maydis are described (or if compared, only to Sch. pombe and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> models). What about cell cycle-dependent infection by other pathogenic fungi? What happens in other smuts? Are they also G2 arrested for infection? What about Colletotrichum and Magnaporthe, where cell cycle controls have been implicated in appressorium development? Are there parallels or not? Are the mechanisms distinct in basidiomycete pathogens? Some wider context is important too. Otherwise the paper's potential main conclusions are lost in impenetrable detail.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cytoplasmic retention and degradation of a mitotic inducer enable plant infection by a pathogenic fungus&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

There are, however, a few areas that need to be looked at to make it a strong paper for publication.</p><p>Experiments/data analysis:</p><p>The figures showing the localization of GFP-Cdc25 are not convincing (except Figure S10C). Providing both single channels and merge would help, maybe of single examples at higher magnification. This should be coupled with quantification of nuclear and cytosolic levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included single channels in each figure (Figure 3A, Figure 4F, Figure 5C) as well as quantification of filaments showing nuclear GFP signal. Also, as reviewer suggested, we included, in some of the images, higher magnification of selected merged nuclei (Figure 3A). We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One important message from the paper is that Cdc25 is regulated by two distinct mechanisms: a cytosolic retention mechanism keeping pre-mating cells in G2, and a degradation mechanism important to keep post-mating cell in G2. From the data using mating cells, I am not fully convinced that this distinction in temporality can be made. First, the authors claim that mating appears to proceed normally in the kap123-T867A mutant, which fails to block the cell cycle in G2 when fuz7-DD or pcl12 are overexpressed. However, Figure 4A, showing Kap123 migration pattern in response to pheromone stimulation, is not convincingly showing the claimed mobility shift. The gel appears to be slightly smiley, but I don't see bands migrating slower. This lowers the confidence that Kap123 is in fact phosphorylated in these conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the reviewer that the shift on electrophoretic mobility is not impressive.</p><p>The electrophoretic shift is not present in regular SDS gels (we use BioRad TGX 4-20%). When we initiated this study, we tried PhosTag gels, but after a considerable effort with no success, we tried empirical manipulation of the ratio of acrylamide to bisacrylamide, which has been reported by different groups to improve resolution of differently phosphorylated forms of a protein. The best condition we found was 8% acrylamide/0.1% bisacrylamide. Regarding the claimed gel in old Figure 4A, we repeated this gel but alternating the lanes for control and mutant samples, conditions that help to detect more clearly the mobility shift. This new gel is now in Figure 5B. We hope this new gel helps to convince the reviewer about this mobility shift.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, though kap123-T867A mutants form filaments that often have &gt;2 nuclei in mating conditions (Figure 4D), it is not clear whether this results from a pre-mating failure in G2 block as claimed by the authors, or a post-mating block failure. In fact, when assessing the cdc25-AAA mutant, the authors perform exactly the same experiment (Figure 6C) and interpret the multi-nucleated defect as a post-fusion cycling issue. Imaging the filaments pre- and post-fusion in these conditions would address the issue.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right in the sense that in both experiments the result seems to be the same (multinucleated filaments), but we consider the defect that cause this phenotype to be different in each case. We base our conclusion in two main differences between these two results. The first one is that while the cdc25AAA mutant does not affected the cell cycle arrest induced by the activation of pheromone MAPK cascade (Figure 7H), the kap123-T867A mutant disables the pheromone-dependent cell cycle arrest, so we believe that in this last case the observed defects most-likely are pre-fusion. The second difference is the total number of nuclei that we found in the respective mutant filaments. While in kap123-T867A mutant crosses we never found filaments with more than 4 nuclei each (which can be explained by the establishment of a G2 barrier by the b factor once the fusion takes place, -in the text we described in a detailed way how this barrier could explain these results-), in the case of cdc25AAA crosses, we found filaments with more than 4 nuclei, suggesting that the b-dependent cell cycle arrest was not functional. We detailed the number of nuclei per filaments in both cases to made more evident these differences (new Figures6D and Figure 8D). In addition, we tried to clarify these differences along the text in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, because Cdc25 levels decrease with increasing dosage of pheromone, the authors hypothesize that Cdc25 is a low-affinity substrate for the MAPK (subsection “The MAPK Kpp2 directs Cdc25 downregulation”), which is phosphorylated and destabilized only upon high pheromone signal. However, the authors do not test whether the cytosolic retention of Cdc25 is also pheromone-level dependent.</p></disp-quote><p>We found that the lowest pheromone concentration was still able to arrest the cell cycle (Figure 5A), to induce retarded electrophoretic mobility of Kap123 (Figure 5B) and to avoid the nuclear localization of Cdc25 (Figure 5D). However, since the same amount of pheromone did not result into decrease of Cdc25 levels (Figure 7A) we believe that retention of Cdc25 (and thereby cell cycle arrest) occurs even a low pheromone concentration but that the proposed degradation of Cdc25 needs higher signaling through the MAPK cascade. The reviewer is right in the sense that these results does not directly implies Cdc25 to be a low-affinity substrate and therefore we removed this sentence. At least, these results suggest that some threshold of MAPK signaling is required to induce the decrease of Cdc25 levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It could equally be that Kap123 importin phosphorylation scales with pheromone concentration and that Cdc25 is retained more in the cytosol in high pheromone levels, which will lead to more Cdc25 phosphorylation and degradation given this only happens in this compartment. These issues need to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right and it seems that the proposed degradation of Cdc25 needs the protein to be retained at the cytoplasm (Figure 7B), but this is not the only requisite, since it also needs signaling through the MAPK cascade (Figure 7C). In the revised version, we explained this in a clearer way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unfortunate that the paper just falls short of demonstrating a direct substrate-kinase relationship between the importin and Crk1 and between Cdc25 and Kpp2, though it shows existence of complexes between the importin and Ltc12, and between Cdc25 and Kpp2.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that physical interactions are supported by the genetics results, but reviewer is correct, and we are aware of this weakness. Therefore, we are cautious with our conclusions about the complex. We tried along the time invested in this study other approaches to show direct substrate-kinase relationships, such as 2-yeast hybrid or in vitro assays, but they were not successful, mainly because technical problems (see answers to reviewer 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Text changes:</p><p>The writing needs to be looked at. From the abstract it is not clear whether there are two distinct cell cycle arrests during distinct cycles, or two distinct mechanisms of arrest during the same cell cycle. It is only after reading the paper that I understood that the two arrests refer to two distinct mechanisms that occur during mating of haploid cells pre-fusion and in dikaryotic cells post-fusion, which together maintain the cell in the same G2 phase. The same goes in other parts of the manuscript. For instance, &quot;the mutant filaments&quot; (subsection “The pheromone-dependent decrease in the Cdc25 level enables b dependent cell cycle arrest.”) could be more clearly spelled out as dikaryotic post-fusion cells. There are also a number of grammatical mistakes.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, and we changed substantially the text to be more clear.</p><p>We also asked a professional editing system to edit the text for English.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Discussion section, I do not understand in what way repression of clb1 transcription by Biz1 would be irreversible. The discussion spends much time discussing these regulatory mechanisms, which are not the object of this paper, but does not discuss some pertinent questions raised by the data, for instance why Cdc25 levels do not drop upon Pcl12 over-expression but Pcl12 is required for the Cdc25 levels drop upon fuz7-DD expression. My guess is that Cdc25 downregulation can only happen in the cytosol and that Pcl12 is required for Cdc25 cytosolic retention, but this is not explicitly formulated.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is again correct and in this new version we followed her/his advice.</p><p>Thanks for it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Cytoplasmic Retention and degradation of a mitotic inducer enable the steps for plant infection by a pathogenic fungus. Bardetti et al.</p><p>This study seeks to determine the mechanism of cell cycle control that leads to plant infection by the corn smut fungus Ustilago maydis. During infection, the fungus forms a dikaryon, which is the infective state. This requires synchrony between the cell cycles of the fusing haploid sporidia, so that subsequent development is co-ordinated. There are two discrete cell cycle arrests. The first is initiated upon pheromone recognition by each mating partner, while a second cell cycle arrest occurs after cell fusion leading to establishment of the infective dikaryotic filament. The significance of this study is that the authors propose that the cell cycle arrests occur by two distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, the first pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest results from inhibition of the nuclear import of the mitotic inducer Cdc25, based on inhibiting the function of the importin, Kap123. This is a novel mechanism, distinct from what is known in the model yeasts. Interestingly, the absence of the first G2 cell cycle arrest is dispensable for virulence, while the second cell cycle control point is essential. Linking the two control mechanisms is therefore necessary.</p><p>The paper is interesting because it reveals a new mechanistic insight into the control of virulence by a dikaryotic basidiomycete pathogen. This builds upon the pioneering work of the Kahmann lab, in particular (plus Kronstad, Banuett and others) in working out how pheromone signalling and self/non-self recognition via bE/bW mating type locus functions. The link to cell cycle control is, however, vital, but often overlooked, so this paper is potentially significant, building on some excellent previous work by lead author Perez-Martin. Furthermore, the work is carefully executed in the main. What really lets it down (but which I hope can be remedied) is the way the paper is written. The manuscript is quite impenetrable in parts and needs to be re-drafted to include a set of intermediate conclusions at each stage in which the work is presented. This is absolutely vital, because currently I think the number of people who will understand this work, let alone appreciate its significance, is currently very small.</p><p>The Abstract and Introduction section describe the conclusions in a relatively straightforward way, including the key finding that the pheromone-induced G2 arrest is a consequence of inhibition of nuclear transport of Cdc25 via Kap123. I think the key point that is missed in the Results section is the comparison with established mechanism by which b-factor induces G2 cell cycle arrest. I think the opening of the Results section should be re-written in a way that structures more tightly to the three effects by which b-factor mediates the sustained cell cycle arrest? This will help to explain the rationale for the study and the way in which the experiments were carried out. It will, for example, help to point out the differences in relation to the results of cdc25 transcriptional levels found in Figure S3B with protein levels reported in Figure 1E and Figure 1F, that are important to understand if the rest of the paper is to be understood.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right, and we followed her/his advices and tried to make the manuscript more readable. We thank the reviewer for thoughtful comments on the manuscript and supportive remarks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p></disp-quote><p> <italic>1) In each section, the authors need to make a firm conclusion to help orient the reader.

This needs to come sooner, and with a better explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to explain the reason for study the Pcl12 protein in this context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 1, I would prefer to see discrete data points rather than the bar charts shown in 1C and D.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the source data for all the graphs in Figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Cdc25 overexpression experiment (subsection “Activation of the pheromone cascade promotes G2 cell cycle arrest via inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1”) needs more emphasis, as it is critical for understanding why the nuclear localisation idea was followed.

Please clarify sentences subsection “Pheromone cascade-induced cell cycle arrest depends on an alternative cyclin interacting with a Cdk-like kinase” on the role of CDK and link with MAPK and Prf1 signaling.

During the course of this work we tried to express these proteins in bacteria to analyze the ability of these proteins to make a complex as well as to study the kinase activity. Unfortunately, in spite of a considerable effort we were not successful obtaining soluble protein in both cases.</p><p>We also tried Y2H. Actually, before to try the Mass Spec approach, we tried a Y2H search expressing Pcl12 as a bait and a 2H library from U.maydis (a gift from Prof. W. K.

The problem was that expression of pcl12 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was toxic and cells were not able to grow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In Figure 2E, a GFP-cdc25 control is needed to show difference between arrested vs. non-arrested cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not included images of non-induced cells, but an image of GFP-Cdc25 in control cells growing in non-inducing conditions can be observed in Figure 3—figure supplement 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 2 we understand that Cdc25 degradation depends on Pcl12 and independent on crk1. But this conclusion reads diluted within the text.

Again, there is no conclusion made to this section at all, which means that the next (really important) part of the paper on the Kap123 protein is introduced without any real reasoning.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right, and we changed substantially the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) What happen to nuclear localization of Cdc25AAA? Has this been checked?</p></disp-quote><p>The retention of Cdc25 in response to pcl12 expression is not affected in the cdc25AAA allele. We added these data in Figure 7I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Have the authors expressed Cdc25 with an NLS to force Cdc25 into the nucleus? This would be valuable to test the model presented.</p></disp-quote><p>It is a great idea. Unfortunately, from previous studies done in the laboratory many years ago (when we were studying the role of 14-3-3 in the regulation of Cdc25, see Mielnichuk and Pérez-Martin, 2008) we know that adding a canonical NLS to Cdc25 is lethal in U. maydis. We believe that the reason for that is the loss of the subcellular regulation, which seems to be really important to control premature entry into mitosis in this fungus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) It would be valuable to carry out Y2H to define the physical interaction of Kpp2 with Cdc25 and also between Pcl12, CRK1, Kap123 and Cdc25. Have these experiments been carried out?</p></disp-quote><p>For some reason, several of the proteins we were working with were toxicor produced undesirable effects when expressed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. As explained above, expression of pcl12 was toxic in S. cerevisae. crk1 (which is the homologue to Ime2) can be expressed only using the kinase dead version and kap123 expression resulted in cell cycle arrest in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (probably because interferes with appropriated nuclear transport).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Subsection “Pheromone cascade-induced cell cycle arrest is mediated by the phosphorylation of Cdc25 importin, Kap123” is the first time a definitive conclusion is made in the manuscript. This is problematic for me. The paper needs to be more simply presented and broken into conclusions that build the story logically. I am not convinced by the way, or order in which the paper is currently presented. The nuclear localisation status of cdc25 needs to be introduced as a concept much earlier, following what is already known about the b-factor cell cycle arrest mechanism. This would make much more sense than how the paper is currently written.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the reviewer advice and tried to present the results in a clearer way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Subsection “The absence of G2 cell cycle arrest during pheromone response has little impact on the ability of U. maydis to infect plants”. This section doesn't logically follow the one that precedes it.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to explain the reasoning for these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) In Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, why do the authors not include a loading control to show that amounts of protein loaded are the same for every lane? Differences in loading of samples are corrected by dividing each phosphopeptide-specific antibody signal by the Cdk1 (anti-PSTAIRE) antibody signal. However, this only gives a relative abundance of P/Cdk1. I would prefer to see loading controls too.</p></disp-quote><p>In this experiment, what we are actually trying to determine is the level of inhibitory phosphorylation in each lane (corresponding to each specific condition and time). We are not comparing the signal from one to the other lane. For that, we have to divide each phosphopeptide-specific antibody signal by the corresponding Cdk1 (anti-PSTAIRE) antibody signal for each lane. Immunoblots were incubated successively first with anti-Cdc2-Y15P and after quantification and stripping with anti-PSTAIRE.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, I think the paper has definite merit and potential significance in explaining the link between the two distinct cell cycle arrests and the onset of virulence by U. maydis. However, it is illogically presented in my view and often the detail obscures the truly significant findings. For me, a key finding is that the pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest is on its own dispensable for virulence. However, it enables the b-dependent cell cycle arrest, which is absolutely essential. Secondly, although mechanistically the b-dependent G2 arrest and pheromone arrest differ, they actually have a conserved underlying mechanism which requires retaining Cdc25 in the cytoplasm. This needs much greater emphasis too. Finally, the paper is also very narrowly framed. Only studies in Ustilago maydis are described (or if compared, only to Sch. pombe and S. cerevisiae models). What about cell cycle-dependent infection by other pathogenic fungi? What happens in other smuts? Are they also G2 arrested for infection? What about Colletotrichum and Magnaporthe, where cell cycle controls have been implicated in appressorium development? Are there parallels or not? Are the mechanisms distinct in basidiomycete pathogens? Some wider context is important too. Otherwise the paper's potential main conclusions are lost in impenetrable detail.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version we tried to broad our discussion to other pathogenic fungi as the reviewer suggested. Thanks so much for all suggestions and comments.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Before we can accept the manuscript, please detail how the nuclear GFP-Cdc25 was quantified, as requested by reviewer 1.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This revised version of the manuscript is much improved: the authors have performed some of the suggested experiments and addressed most of my experimental concerns, or provided convincing arguments. The only small experimental point I would like to raise concerns the quantification of nuclear GFP-Cdc25. The images provided a more convincing, and there is some quantification given, though the quantification is not described in the methods and appears rather subjective: the authors appear to visually classify cells to have nuclear GFP-Cdc25 or not. What's the cut-off used to decide for or against nuclear localization? An objective quantification requires to measure the fluorescence intensity in nuclear and cytosolic compartments in individual cells, for instance derive a ratio, and then present the mean and deviation on a graph.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right in the sense that quantification should derive a ratio between the fluorescent signal at nuclear and cytosolic compartments and then present that numbers in a graph. In fact, we did that approach using Image J. However, we found that in some filaments the signal in cytoplasm was as strong as the signal at nucleus, and then just looking at the ratio between both signals, they were sorted as no nuclear GFP, when actually they were positive for GFP at nucleus. For that reason, we decided to plot fluorescent profile for each channel and in each nucleus and to decide as positive or not for GFP at the nucleus just looking that profile. We are aware that it could be more subjective that numbers, but the true is that this way it was more accurate that just looking at the ratio of fluorescence.
