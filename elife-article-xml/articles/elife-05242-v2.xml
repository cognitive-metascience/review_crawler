little about the motors or membrane events that regulate ciliary membrane protein trafficking in existing organelles. Recently, we showed that cilium-generated signaling in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> induced rapid, anterograde IFT-independent, cytoplasmic microtubule-dependent redistribution of the membrane polypeptide, SAG1-C65, from the plasma membrane to the periciliary region and the ciliary membrane. Here, we report that the retrograde IFT motor, cytoplasmic dynein 1b, is required in the cytoplasm for this rapid redistribution. Furthermore, signaling-induced trafficking of SAG1-C65 into cilia is unidirectional and the entire complement of cellular SAG1-C65 is shed during signaling and can be recovered in the form of ciliary ectosomes that retain signal-inducing activity. Thus, during signaling, cells regulate ciliary membrane protein composition through cytoplasmic action of the retrograde IFT motor and shedding of ciliary ectosomes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05242.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05242.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05242.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nearly every cell in the human body has slender, hair-like structures known as cilia that project outwards from its surface. These structures can sense and respond to light, chemicals and touch, and they are required for normal development. Failure of cilia to form or function in the correct manner can lead to severe diseases—such as kidney disorders, deafness and loss of vision. A major puzzle for researchers who study cilia has been to understand how cells change the composition of these structures as part of their response to a sensory input.</p><p>Cilia are ancient structures that were present in early single-celled organisms and researchers interested in cilia have often used a single-celled green alga called <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> as a model system for their studies. When these algae reproduce sexually, the two types of sex cells sense the presence of each other when their cilia touch and then stick together. This ciliary touching activates signals that are sent into the cells to get them ready to fuse together, much like sperm and egg cells do in animals.</p><p>Both ciliary touching and signaling depend on a protein called SAG1, a part of which (known as SAG1-C65) is normally found mostly over the surface membrane of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>. Only very small amounts of SAG1-C65 are normally found on cilia; but, when the sex cells' cilia touch, this protein rapidly moves to the end of the cell nearest the cilia via a previously unknown mechanism. SAG1-C65 then becomes much more enriched in the cilia.</p><p>Cao, Ning, Hernandez-Lara et al. investigated this process and found that SAG1-C65 movement requires a molecular motor called ‘cytoplasmic dynein’. This motor protein typically walks along the inside of cilia to transport other molecules away from the tip and towards the cell membrane. However, Cao, Ning, Hernandez-Lara et al. found that this dynein also carries SAG1-C65 from the membrane of the cells towards the base of the cilia in preparation for it to enter into these structures.</p><p>As part of an effort to understand the fate of the protein after it entered cilia, Cao, Ning, Hernandez-Lara et al. discovered that the SAG1-C65 disappeared from the structures without returning to the cell membrane. Instead, SAG1-C65 was packaged within tiny bubble-like structures near the tips of cilia and these packages were then shed from cilia into the external environment. This discovery challenges a widely held view that proteins are only removed from cilia by returning to the cell. Future work will be required to understand more of the molecular details of these processes, which are likely to be present in most cells with cilia.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05242.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05242.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Chlamydomonas</italic></kwd><kwd>ciliary signaling</kwd><kwd>ciliary ectosome</kwd><kwd>intraflagellar transport</kwd><kwd>cytoplasmic dynein</kwd><kwd>membrane protein trafficking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM25661</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Snell</surname><given-names>William J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM32843</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dutcher</surname><given-names>Susan K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM56778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Snell</surname><given-names>William J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During cilium-generated signaling, ciliary membrane protein trafficking is unidirectional and ciliary membrane protein composition is regulated through action in the cytoplasm of the retrograde intraflagelllar transport (IFT) motor and shedding of ciliary ectosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The primary cilium provides a unique cellular compartment for interaction with the extracellular milieu. Initiated by discoveries in chemosensation in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, of ciliary defects in polycystic kidney disease, and of the central role of cilia in the vertebrate hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, we now know that the organelle is a signaling node for multiple pathways in development, disease, and homeostasis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerdes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lancaster and Gleeson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>). Although the signaling functions of the ciliary membrane are crucial for development and homeostasis, we are just beginning to learn the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the dynamic regulation of ciliary membrane protein composition in existing cilia during cilium-generated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pazour and Bloodgood, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nachury et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu and Nelson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malicki and Avidor-Reiss, 2014</xref>).</p><p>During ciliogenesis, soluble proteins are delivered into the organelle by intraflagellar transport (IFT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pedersen and Rosenbaum, 2008</xref>). The working model for delivery of ciliary membrane proteins during ciliogenesis is that vesicles derived from the Golgi and containing newly synthesized membrane proteins destined for the cilium traffic via as yet poorly characterized motors to specialized regions of the plasma membrane near the base of the organelle, including the ciliary pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Molla-Herman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rohatgi and Snell, 2010</xref>), and enter the cilium as the organelle elongates. IFT proteins are required for the presence of some membrane proteins in the cilium, but it remains unknown whether IFT is required for their entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wood and Rosenbaum, 2014</xref>). Several proteins and protein complexes are involved in trafficking of membrane proteins to the organelle during its formation as well as in establishing the barrier, and their mutational disruption leads to aberrant regulation of constitutively localized ciliary membrane proteins, or to complete absence of cilia and to the ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia-Gonzalo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hildebrandt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chih et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>After the cilium is fully formed, however, the protein composition of the ciliary membrane does not remain fixed, but is dynamically regulated during cilium-generated signaling. In the well-studied cilium-based Hedgehog (Hh) signaling system in vertebrates, the pathway suppressors Ptch and GPR161 are present in the ciliary membrane in the absence of the Hh ligand, and the effector Smoothened (Smo) is mostly excluded from the cilium and present on the cell plasma membrane and in internal vesicles. When Hh binds to it receptor Ptch, Smo becomes enriched in the ciliary membrane where it regulates downstream events in the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rohatgi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Milenkovic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dorn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013</xref>). Concomitantly, both Ptch and GPR161 are depleted from the organelle. Although several models have been proposed to account for the fascinating, dynamic, regulated enrichment and loss of Hh effectors in the ciliary membrane, we still know few mechanistic details.</p><p>The use of cilia as sensory/signaling organelles is an ancient invention. Interactions between receptors (agglutinin polypeptides) on the cilia of <italic>plus</italic> and <italic>minus</italic> gametes during fertilization in the green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> trigger an anterograde IFT-dependent signaling pathway within the organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang and Snell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2006</xref>) that activates the gametes for cell–cell fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Snell and Goodenough, 2009</xref>). The <italic>plus</italic> agglutinin polypeptide receptor expressed on <italic>plus</italic> gametes is encoded by the SAG1 gene and the <italic>minus</italic> agglutinin polypeptide receptor on <italic>minus</italic> gametes is encoded by the SAD1 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferris et al., 2005</xref>). In addition to activating the signaling pathway within each type of gamete, interactions between the SAG1 <italic>plus</italic> agglutinin and the SAD1 <italic>minus</italic> agglutinin cause the cilia of the gametes to adhere to each other, thereby bringing the gametes into the close contact required for gamete fusion.</p><p>Recently, using <italic>plus</italic> gametes expressing a <italic>SAG1-HA</italic> transgene, we showed that soon after synthesis of the full-length protein encoded by <italic>SAG1</italic>, it is cleaved to yield the N-terminal <italic>plus</italic> agglutinin polypeptide and a C-terminal, integral membrane polypeptide, SAG1-C65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belzile et al., 2013</xref>). We found that although small amounts of SAG1-C65 were on the cilia of resting <italic>plus</italic> gametes, most was excluded from the organelles and present at the plasma membrane. When the cilium-generated signaling pathway was activated, however, the C-terminal SAG1-C65 polypeptide was rapidly recruited to the ciliary membrane through a mechanism that did not require the anterograde IFT motor kinesin 2/FLA10. Moreover, before entering the cilium during signaling, SAG1-C65 became highly polarized, accumulating in the periciliary region as part of a ciliary entry pathway that required cytoplasmic microtubules. Here, we report that during cilium-generated signaling, cells regulate ciliary membrane SAG1-C65 levels by action of the retrograde IFT motor in the cytoplasm and by regulated shedding of SAG1-C65-containing ciliary ectosomes that retain signaling competency and comprise a distinct membrane compartment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The retrograde IFT motor is required for apical polarization and ciliary enrichment of SAG1-C65 during cilium-generated signaling</title><p>The presence in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> of only a single cytoplasmic dynein, cytoplasmic dynein 1b, and our previous results that cytoplasmic microtubules participated in periciliary accumulation and ciliary entry of SAG1-C65 during signaling raised the possibility that this microtubule minus end-directed IFT motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pazour et al., 1999</xref>) might participate in SAG1-C65 redistribution. The benzoyl dihydroquinazolinone, ciliobrevin D, has been shown in metazoans to block cytoplasmic dyneins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hyman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Firestone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ye et al., 2013</xref>). And, recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shih et al. (2013)</xref> showed that ciliobrevin D inhibition of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cytoplasmic dynein 1b (DHC1b) strongly reduced retrograde IFT. We tested for a role of the retrograde IFT motor in SAG1-C65 redistribution during signaling using ciliobrevin D. Early during ciliary adhesion and cilium-generated signaling, activation of a ciliary adenylyl cyclase leads to an ∼15-fold increase in cellular cAMP that activates gametes to prepare for fusion. Thus, it is possible to study cellular events activated by the signaling pathway, such as redistribution of the agglutinin polypeptide, release of cell walls, and upregulation of transcripts for gamete-specific proteins, in gametes of a single mating type by incubating them in the cell-permeable analogue, db-cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pijst et al., 1984b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pasquale and Goodenough, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodenough, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hunnicutt et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belzile et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ning et al., 2013</xref>). We incubated <italic>SAG1-HA</italic>/<italic>sag1-5</italic> gametes (which express a tagged SAG1-C65 polypeptide, SAG1-C65-HA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belzile et al., 2013</xref>) with and without ciliobrevin D for 20 min, activated them by addition of db-cAMP for 5 min in the continued presence of the inhibitor, and then assessed SAG1-C65-HA localization.</p><p>As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belzile et al., 2013</xref>), whereas SAG1-C65-HA showed apical localization in only a small portion of resting gametes, the protein became apically localized after gametes were activated by incubation in db-cAMP for 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Incubation of resting cells in ciliobrevin D reduced the already low percentage of cells with apically localized SAG1-C65-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and inhibited SAG1-C65-HA redistribution to the apical ends in cells incubated for 5 min in db-cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Consistent with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shih et al. (2013)</xref> that ciliobrevin did not completely inhibit the motor activity of cytoplasmic dynein-1b, after longer incubation in db-cAMP, SAG1-C65-HA redistribution returned (not shown). These results indicated that the retrograde IFT motor was essential for the rapid redistribution of SAG1-C65-HA to the peri-ciliary region at the cell apex.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05242.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cytoplasmic dynein 1b is required for the rapid, signaling-induced apical localization and ciliary enrichment of SAG1-C65-HA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images of resting gametes in the presence and absence of Cilio-D for 20 min and gametes activated for 5 min in the presence and absence of Cilio-D.

Cilia of resting gametes contained little SAG1-C65-HA as assessed by both IF and immunoblotting of isolated cilia, but upon 5-min incubation in db-cAMP, SAG1-C65-HA in the organelles increased in control, but not in the ciliobrevin samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>, upper panels). The effects of ciliobrevin D were transient, and cells washed out of the inhibitor rapidly regained the ability to respond to db-cAMP by accumulating SAG1-C65-HA in their cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). IF analysis showed that the array of cytoplasmic microtubules was unaffected by ciliobrevin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). And, the inhibitor had no effect on total cellular SAG1-C65-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lower panels). Interestingly, and consistent with the IF results that ciliobrevin D treatment of resting cells reduced the percent with apical localization of SAG1-C65-HA, the basal level of SAG1-C65-HA in cilia isolated from ciliobrevin D-treated resting gametes was lower than in the control, resting gametes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also examined whether the inhibitor blocked signaling per se, by testing its affects on signaling-induced phosphorylation of the homeodomain protein, GSP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilson et al., 1999</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, gametes in ciliobrevin D remained capable of responding to db-cAMP as assessed by the phosphorylation-related change in migration of GSP1 in immunoblots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilson et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, apical localization and ciliary enrichment of SAG1-C65 during signaling were both inhibited by the cytoplasmic dynein inhibitor, ciliobrevin D, indicating that the retrograde IFT motor acts in the cytoplasm to enrich SAG1-C65 in the peri-ciliary region concomitant with entry of the protein into the ciliary membrane.</p><p>As a further test for a role of the retrograde IFT motor in SAG1-C65 trafficking, we introduced the SAG1-HA transgene into the cytoplasmic dynein mutant strain <italic>fla24</italic>, which has an L3242P mutation in dynein heavy chain 1b (DHC1b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>fla24</italic> exhibits a temperature-sensitive ciliary phenotype, being ciliated at 21°C, and without cilia after 4–6 hr at 32°C. Even at 21°C, however, DHC1b and its associated light chain protein D1bLIC are reduced dramatically and the level of D1bLIC in <italic>fla24</italic> cells is less than 7% of wild type at 21°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we tested the effects of reduced retrograde IFT motor function on SAG1-C65-HA apical localization and ciliary entry by using <italic>SAG1-HA/fla24</italic> gametes at 21°C. Consistent with the results with ciliobrevin D, at 21°C, SAG1-C65-HA failed to undergo rapid apical redistribution in the DHC1b-depleted <italic>fla24</italic> gametes incubated in db-cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and the amount of SAG1-C65-HA in cilia did not increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

Thus, the retrograde IFT motor is required for trafficking of SAG1-C65-HA during ciliogenesis of gametes, and it is required for redistribution of SAG1-C65-HA to the peri-ciliary region and into the cilium during cilium-generated signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SAG1-C65-HA is depleted from cells during sustained ciliary adhesion and signaling</title><p>We also followed the fate of SAG1-C65-HA when SAG1-C65-HA <italic>plus</italic> gametes were mixed with fusion-defective <italic>hap2 minus</italic> gametes and allowed to undergo sustained ciliary receptor-induced signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2008</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> (upper panels), cells indeed released SAG1-C65-HA into the medium during receptor-activated signaling. Moreover, the amount recovered in the medium after 3 hr was three times as much as present in the starting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), indicating that the relatively constant levels of cell body and ciliary SAG1-C65-HA during sustained agglutinin receptor interactions and signaling reflected a dynamic balance between synthesis, ciliary delivery, and release from the cilia. Moreover, when the cells were mixed together in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, nearly 75% of the SAG1-HA in the cells at T = 0 was recovered in the medium after 3 hr of receptor-activated signaling, demonstrating that release was the major fate of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lower panels and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Consistent with the results above, SAG1-C65-HA was absent from the medium of adhering gametes in which signaling and ciliary recruitment of SAG1-C65-HA were blocked by the addition of staurosporine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Use of both a retrograde IFT motor mutant, <italic>fla24</italic> and the cytoplasmic dynein 1b inhibitor, ciliobrevin D, showed that the signaling-triggered rapid polarization of SAG1-C65-HA and its entry into the ciliary membrane were inhibited when motor function was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, the retrograde IFT motor transports SAG1-C65-HA from distal cellular membrane sites to the periciliary region, either within the plasma membrane or as vesicles within the cytoplasm. The increased amounts of SAG1-C65-HA in the cilia of resting <italic>fla24</italic> gametes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>) also indicated that the retrograde motor is important for membrane protein trafficking during the ciliogenesis that accompanies gamete formation. In their studies of a conditional DHC1b mutant, <italic>dhc1b-3</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engel et al.

Although several membrane-associated proteins and protein complexes are strongly implicated in targeting ciliary membrane proteins to the periciliary region in many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nachury et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wood and Rosenbaum, 2014</xref>), the motors that carry ciliary-destined membrane proteins to the base of the organelle have been largely unidentified. One notable exception is photoreceptor cells in which cytoplasmic dynein 1 (not the retrograde IFT motor) is involved in trafficking of rod outer segment membrane proteins from the golgi to the base of the connecting cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kong et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al.

On the other hand, the parent compound of ciliobrevin D, HPI-4, inhibited Hh-induced ciliary accumulation of Smoothened by 60–70% 12 hr after addition of the Hh ligand, raising the possibility that a cytoplasmic dynein is involved in trafficking of Smoothened to the cilium in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hyman et al., 2009</xref>). And <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ye et al.

Given that growth of new cilia is dependent on anterograde IFT, whereas signaling-induced movement of pre-existing SAG1-C65-HA into existing cilia is independent of anterograde IFT, it may be that cells use one membrane protein trafficking modality for ciliary assembly and a different one for regulated ciliary enrichment of pre-existing membrane proteins.</p><p>Studies many years ago showed that cilia of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> vegetative cells and gametes undergo constitutive membrane shedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wiese, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergman et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Snell, 1976</xref>) of vesicles similar in protein composition to the ciliary membrane.

In our current studies, however, resting gametes did not shed SAG1-C65-containing ciliary ectosomes, but shedding of such ectosomes required receptor interactions and signaling. It is likely that the vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodenough and Heuser (1999)</xref> observed 25 years ago on adhering cilia corresponded to those we isolated from the medium. Notably, the shed vesicles we isolated were enriched in SAG1-C65-HA and de-enriched in the 350 kDa major membrane protein compared to cilia. And, nearly the entire cellular complement of pre-existing SAG1-C65-HA was shed in ∼3 hr. Thus, receptor signaling-induced shedding of SAG1-C65-containing ciliary ectosomes was much more rapid and selective than the previously reported, constitutive shedding of ciliary membrane vesicles, and likely depends on a mechanism distinct from that used for constitutive shedding.</p><p>Our discovery that the isolated ciliary ectosomes possessed the ability to bind to the cilia of <italic>minus</italic> gametes and activate cilium-generated signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) indicated that the ectosomes also contained the <italic>plus</italic> receptor agglutinin polypeptide, which likely is an N-terminal fragment of the 340 kDa full length protein encoded by the <italic>SAG1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belzile et al., 2013</xref>). Several workers have reported that the agglutinin activity is lost during adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weise and Wiese, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Snell and Moore, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adair et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pijst et al., 1984a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hunnicutt et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hunnicutt and Snell, 1991</xref>), and, using a semi-quantitiative bioassay, we reported that over 60% of it could be recovered in an uncharacterized form in the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hunnicutt et al., 1990</xref>). In future studies, it will be interesting to determine if the integral membrane polypeptide SAG1-C65 is the membrane anchor for the agglutinin polypeptide, which lacks predicted transmembrane domains. These considerations lead to the model that release of ciliary ectosomes during ciliary adhesion and signaling underlies the dynamic nature of ciliary adhesion evidenced by constant cilia adhesion and de-adhesion within mixtures of <italic>plus</italic> and <italic>minus</italic> gametes. From another perspective, because the released ectosomes retain biological activity, their formation might help to maximize the probability of zygote formation.</p><p>As indicated above, recent studies showed that regulated formation of ciliary ectosomes is not unique to the cilia of gametes or possibly not even to <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wood et al. (2013)</xref> reported that <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> vegetative cells release ciliary ectosomes that contain an enzyme required for release of the extracellular matrix during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kubo et al., 2009</xref>). And, several groups have identified biologically active microvesicles from metazoans that contain ciliary proteins and are capable of binding to cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18a">Hogan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakeberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chacon-Heszele et al., 2014</xref>). Regulating the membrane protein composition of the cilium is a central feature of cilium-dependent signaling. Current models posit that regulation of ciliary membrane protein composition is controlled by bidirectional flow of membrane proteins from the cell body to the cilium and back. Direct evidence has been lacking, however, that ciliary membrane proteins lost from the cilium during signaling actually return to the cell, because of the difficulty in determining the fate of ciliary proteins in most systems. Our results demonstrate that cells can maintain a steady-state level of a ciliary membrane protein by unidirectional flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) in which proteins move from the cell body to the cilium and then into the extracellular milieu.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and special chemicals</title><p><italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> strains <italic>21gr</italic> (mating type <italic>plus</italic>; CC-1690), <italic>6145C</italic> (mating type <italic>minus</italic>; CC-1691), and the fusion-defective <italic>minus</italic> strain <italic>hap2</italic> are available from the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> Genetics Center, University of Minnesota, St. Paul.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and 2 reviewers, including Maxence Nachury who is serving as a Guest Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Both reviewers felt that the manuscript is an important contribution to ciliary signaling and trafficking, with very high disease significance given the established link between ciliary signaling and ciliopathies. Mechanistically, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> are remarkable as they show that ectosomes contain a very specific set of proteins that is different from the protein complement of the cilium. This strongly suggests that specific proteins such as SAG are selected by a specialized machinery to become incorporated into forming ectosomes.</p><p>The logical progression of the experiments provides clarity and impact to the paper and the reviewers found little to fault in your submission. The major points that need to be addressed are as follow:</p><p>1) The conclusion that the IFT Dynein is active in the cytoplasm of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> is entirely reliant on the drug Ciliobrevin D. As this drug is a relatively newly developed reagent, further work may uncover caveats with its use such as off-target effects. The use of a temperature-sensitive mutant of IFT Dynein (described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engel, JCB, 2012</xref>; doi:10.1083/jcb.201206068) to repeat the major findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 A and B</xref>) would greatly strengthen this part of the paper.</p><p>2) Several experiments need to be quantified to strengthen the main conclusions.</p><p>In particular, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> needs to be quantified to answer the question: “Does all of ciliary SAG1-C65-HA end up in the supernatant?”</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figure 4C and 5A</xref>: How many vesicles are found per cilium?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>: What is the enrichment factor of SAG, FMG1 and PKG in ectosomes?

Last summer we had initiated a collaboration with Dr. Susan Dutcher to introduce SAG1-HA into her dynein heavy chain 1b (DHC1b) temperature sensitive mutant, <italic>fla24</italic> (Lin et al., Cilia, 2:14, 2013), but we did not have the results until recently. Because we had those strains in hand, we have used them for the experiments in the revised manuscript instead of the <italic>dhc1b-3</italic> ts mutant described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engel, JCB, 2012</xref>, that was suggested in your letter. The phenotype of <italic>fla24</italic> is quite similar to that of <italic>dhc1b-3</italic>. The levels of DHC1b and the light intermediate chain of cytoplasmic dynein 1b, D1bLIC, are substantively depleted in both <italic>fla24</italic> and <italic>dhc1b-3</italic>, even at the permissive temperature. The extent of depletion was not quantified by Engels et al., but the amount of depletion shown in their blots appeared to be similar to that of Lin et al., who reported a 16-fold reduction compared to wild type of both proteins at the permissive temperature. Thus, both “ts” mutations in DHC1b lead to significant instability and degradation of the protein at the “permissive temperature”, and we carried out our experiments at the permissive temperature. As we indicate in the manuscript, the resting <italic>SAG1-HAfla24</italic> gametes have relatively large amounts of SAG1-C65-HA in their cilia at the permissive temperature compared to wild type, indicating that the retrograde IFT motor functions in membrane protein trafficking during the cilia formation that accompanies gametogenesis and possibly during ciliary maintenance in resting gametes. Importantly, though, SAG1-C65-HA apical redistribution and ciliary entry upon db-cAMP activation were blocked in the DHC1b-depleted <italic>fla24</italic> gametes.</p><p><italic>2) Several experiments need to be quantified to strengthen the main conclusions</italic>.</p><p><italic>In particular,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3A</italic></xref> <italic>needs to be quantified to answer the question</italic>: <italic>“Does all of ciliary SAG1-C65-HA end up in the supernatant?”</italic></p><p><italic>In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5"><italic>Figure 4C and 5A</italic></xref>: <italic>How many vesicles are found per cilium?</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4F</italic></xref><italic>: What is the enrichment factor of SAG, FMG1 and PKG in ectosomes? The abundance of each protein could be expressed as a relative western blot intensity (using infrared laser-based scanning of fluorescent secondary antibodies in the linear range of measurement) per mg of proteins in the sample</italic>.</p><p>The revised manuscript now includes quantification of recovery of SAG1-C65-HA in the supernatant (75% recovered) and protein enrichment/de-enrichment in ciiary ectosomes (nearly 6-fold enrichment of SAG1-C65-HA and 0.1-fold of FMG1 in ciliary ectosomes compared to cilia). We used conventional blotting methods and ImageJ for our analysis under conditions in which the amount of protein loaded was proportional to the band intensities. We have omitted the PKG results because of a higher molecular mass, cross-reactive band of unknown origin that interfered with our analysis. We feel it would take a substantial amount of time to determine whether the higher mw band is a multimer of PKG or an artifact. Since the blots show that several ciliary proteins are substantially decreased and we quantify FMG1 de-enrichment, we do not feel that omission of PKG changes the interpretation or conclusions. We agree that it might be interesting to use TEM to quantify amounts of vesicles associated with cilia during release and when we add them back to cells. These are highly dynamic processes, and to avoid variation, we took samples at consistent times. Of course, there was some variability from experiment to experiment, but the TEM experiments were carried out multiple times by two of us, and the electron micrographs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref> are representative of typical amounts of vesicles we observed. To obtain full information about vesicles per cilium would require an extensive analysis at many time points, and, with the variability’s inherent in using unfixed samples and negative staining, we are just not sure that such an analysis would add important new information not already provided by the existing TEM and by our biochemical analysis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
