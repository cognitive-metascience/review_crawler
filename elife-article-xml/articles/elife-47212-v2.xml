The pressure results from tight confinement of the negatively charged double-stranded (ds) viral DNA or dsRNA inside the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tzlil et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kindt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Purohit et al., 2005</xref>). Our recent measurement of 20 atmospheres of DNA pressure in a Herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2013</xref>) was the first demonstration of a pressurized genome state in a eukaryotic virus. This high internal capsid pressure is generated by an ATP-driven packaging motor located at a unique capsid vertex, shown to be the strongest molecular motor known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McElwee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith et al., 2001</xref>). Structural features of packaging motor components are shared by bacterial and archaeal dsDNA viruses and eukaryotic herpesviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krupovic and Bamford, 2011</xref>). This strongly suggests that once DNA is packaged with high force into a capsid, the reverse process of pressure-driven genome release is one of the central mechanisms of viral replication. A previous attempt to demonstrate this mechanism analyzed the velocity of DNA ejection from phage λ into an <italic>E. coli</italic> cell to determine whether ejection dynamics correlates with a decrease in intracapsid DNA pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Van Valen et al., 2012</xref>). However, due to large cell-to-cell variability in the ejection rates, the results were difficult to interpret. [We recently found, using isothermal titration calorimetry, similar timescale variability in phage λ ejection dynamics, ranging from a few seconds to minutes; this variability is caused by the metastable state of the tightly packaged genome resulting from DNA-DNA electrostatic sliding friction, which can delay or stall the ejection process despite high pressure in the capsid. However, this interstrand friction was significantly reduced by a transition in intracapsid DNA structure induced by optimum environmental conditions favorable for infection, leading to essentially instant DNA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evilevitch, 2018</xref>).] Thus, the role that high DNA pressure in phage capsids might play in viral genome delivery into a bacterial cell remained unclear. Furthermore, the experimental evidence placing the discovery of intracapsid genome pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2013</xref>) in the context of eukaryotic viral infection was lacking. Here, we conducted a stringent test, showing that DNA pressure in HSV-1 capsids powers ejection of the viral genome into a cell nucleus. This provides, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of a pressure-dependent mechanism leading to infection of eukaryotic cells (where the term ‘infection’ denotes the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a host cell by a virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flint, 2004</xref>]).</p><p><italic>Herpesviridae</italic> are a leading cause of human viral disease, second only to influenza and cold viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pellett and Roizmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roizmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sandri-Goldin, 2006</xref>). The herpesviridae family includes a diverse set of viruses, nine of which are human pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davison et al., 2009</xref>). Herpesvirus infections are life-long with latency periods between recurrent reactivations, making treatment difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pai and Weinberger, 2017</xref>). Herpesvirus infections frequently reactivate to result in recurrent acute oral and genital lesions, encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roizmann et al., 2007</xref>), shingles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coen, 2006</xref>), birth defects and transplant failures, as well as oncogenic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rickinson and Kieff, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ganem, 2007</xref>). Herpesviruses consist of a double-stranded (ds) DNA genome packaged within an icosahedral capsid that is surrounded by an unstructured protein layer, the tegument, and a lipid envelope. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the HSV-1 infection process as observed by ultrathin-sectioning transmission electron microscopy (TEM). After binding at the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), viruses enter the cell cytoplasm and are transported toward the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The viral capsid ejects its genome upon docking to a nuclear pore complex (NPC), which forms a passageway for molecular traffic into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sodeik et al., 1997</xref>). To investigate the specific event of herpes DNA injection into a cell nucleus, we designed an assay built on previous experiments showing that purified HSV-1 capsids bind to NPCs on isolated nuclei and eject their DNA into nuclei in the presence of cytosol supplemented with an ATP-regeneration system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ojala et al., 2000</xref>). This reconstituted nuclei system allows us to determine if viral DNA is ejected into the nucleus when the capsid pressure is ‘turned off’ by addition of an external osmolyte. We had shown previously that DNA ejection from isolated HSV-1 capsids into solution can be suppressed by creating an osmotic pressure in the host solution, which matches the pressure of the packaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2013</xref>). This effectively eliminates genome pressure in the capsid (the mechanism of osmotic suppression is explained below). In this work we show that viral genome ejection through the NPCs into a cell nucleus can be completely suppressed in the presence of the biologically inert osmolyte polyethylene glycol (PEG). The reconstituted nuclei system accurately reproduces capsids-nuclei binding and nuclear transport of the herpes genome into living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ojala et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Au et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cassany and Gerace, 2008</xref>). It provides the benefit of isolating the effect of eliminated capsid pressure on the single step of viral DNA ejection, while avoiding interference from hyperosmotic conditions on other processes occurring within the cell during viral replication.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47212.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ultrathin-sectioning EM visualization of the HSV-1 infection process showing viral DNA ejection from HSV-1 capsid into a host nucleus.</title><p>Ultrathin Epon sections of Vero cells infected with HSV-1 at an MOI of 300 PFU/cell.

While the term ‘infection’ usually refers to both viral genome transport into the cell and subsequent replication of the virus, the primary infection by several types of herpesviruses (including HSV-1) is latent (i.e. the herpes genome is translocated into the host nucleus, without subsequent genome replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steiner, 1996</xref>]).

We used HSV-1, which is a prototypical, experimental model system to study herpesvirus replication due to the ease of growing and purifying large quantities of viral C-capsids (DNA-filled capsids without a lipid envelope and tegument proteins)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Méndez-Álvarez, 2000</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>‘Turning off’ DNA pressure inside a viral capsid with external osmotic pressure</title><p>Below we provide a description of the mechanism through which DNA pressure inside the capsid is ‘turned off’ with osmolyte addition. Viral capsids are permeable to water and small ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trus et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heymann et al., 2003</xref>). In an aqueous buffer solution (without osmolyte addition), due to the high DNA concentration inside the capsid, water is drawn into the ﬁxed volume through the capsid pores, as a result of the entropic drive to maximize mixing, and a large osmotic pressure is developed inside the capsid to equalize the chemical potential of water inside and outside of the capsid. This pressure, due to the compressed water inside the rigid capsid volume can also be described as a DNA repulsion and bending pressure withstood by the capsid walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evilevitch et al., 2008</xref>). Addition of an osmolyte to the solution surrounding the capsid, where osmolyte is larger than the capsid pores, creates an osmotic gradient. Water will be drawn out of the DNA volume to dilute the osmolyte molecules outside the capsid. This reduces the water density and the osmotic pressure inside the capsid. Once the osmolyte concentration reaches <italic>c*</italic>, the pressure inside the capsid is brought down to one atm (atmospheric pressure). For this special value of <italic>c*</italic>, the water-exchange equilibrium corresponds to zero osmotic pressure difference inside and outside the capsid and a net force of zero on the interior of the capsid’s rigid walls conﬁning the DNA. Thus, the osmotic pressure associated with the osmolyte concentration, <italic>c*</italic>, is equal to the osmotic pressure exerted by the conﬁned DNA. As a consequence, even if the DNA was allowed the opportunity to ‘‘escape’’ from its conﬁnement (when the virus capsid is opened), it would not, because there is no driving force for this process. For any lesser value of external osmotic pressure than that provided by <italic>c*</italic>, there is a pressure difference and hence a net force (outward) on the conﬁning capsid walls because an insufﬁcient amount of water has been drawn out of the DNA solution to lower its osmotic pressure to one atm. This explains our previously designed experiment of osmotic suppression of viral DNA ejection where we measured the pressure in HSV-1 capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>First, without nuclei present and using our osmotic suppression assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Evilevitch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2013</xref>), we used solutions containing PEG to determine the critical concentration, <italic>c*<sub>PEG</sub></italic>, that matches the DNA pressure in an HSV-1 capsid and thus turns it off. To create an osmotic pressure gradient between the interior and exterior of the capsid, we used PEG with molecular weight MW ≈ 8 kDa, which does not permeate the capsid since the HSV-1 capsid pore diameter is ~20 Å, corresponding to ~4 kDa MW cutoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trus et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heymann et al., 2003</xref>). DNA ejection from the capsid was triggered by mild trypsin treatment. Trypsin cleaves the portal ‘plug’ proteins UL6 and UL25 while the rest of the HSV-1 capsid remains intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Newcomb et al., 2007</xref>). The length of DNA remaining in the capsid as a function of increasing PEG 8 kDa concentration was determined with pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) combined with a DNase protection assay, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al. (2013)</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that a progressively smaller fraction of DNA was ejected from HSV-1 capsids with increasing external osmotic pressure, where the DNA ejection was completely suppressed at <italic>c*<sub>PEG</sub></italic>PEG30% w/w (PFGE data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This corresponds to ~18 atm of external osmotic pressure equal to the DNA pressure in the capsid, at buffer conditions required for capsid binding to isolated nuclei, set by capsid binding buffer CBB (see Materials and methods Section). It should be noted that ionic conditions in the surrounding buffer also affect DNA pressure in the capsid through cations permeating the capsid and screening the repulsive DNA-DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evilevitch et al., 2008</xref>). We used this critical PEG concentration (<italic>c*<sub>PEG</sub></italic>) to turn off the capsid pressure when HSV-1 C-capsids were incubated with reconstituted nuclei. In the next Section, we demonstrate specific capsid binding to NPCs at the nuclear membrane and confirm that the nuclear integrity as well as capsid-nuclei binding are not affected by the addition of 30% w/w PEG 8 kDa.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47212.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Percentage of viral genome ejected from HSV-1 capsids as a function of the external osmotic pressure.</title><p>DNA ejection from the capsids in vitro is triggered by mild trypsin treatment, which cleaves the portal protein (UL6) without degrading the major capsid protein (VP5) or causing morphological damage to capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2013</xref>).

Since herpes DNA does not interact with import protein factors, these protein factors are likely involved in the binding and opening of the capsid portal vertex, which triggers genome ejection, but they do not provide the driving force for the actual translocation of the viral DNA across the NPC channel (which is driven by DNA capsid pressure, as we demonstrate below).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows individual GFP-labeled HSV-1 C-capsids (green, strain K26GFP, HSV-1 strain expressing GFP-tagged VP26 protein) bound to NPCs on isolated DAPI-stained cell nuclei (blue), imaged with Super-Resolution Structured Illumination Microscopy (SR-SIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sekine et al., 2017</xref>).

Specifically, the authors reported that, under hyperosmotic stress, the nuclear size decreased while nuclear lacunarity increased, indicating expansion in the pores and channels interdigitating the chromatin. As a result, the rate of nucleocytoplasmic transport increased but only due to the change in nucleus geometry, providing a shorter effective diffusion distance. This sensitivity to hyperosmotic conditions concerned both passive and active transport across the NPCs. At the same time, the authors found that diffusivity within the nucleus was insensitive to the osmotic environment. In agreement with these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finan et al., 2011</xref>), we observed that, under hyperosmotic conditions (~18 atm at 30% w/w PEG 8 kDa), the nuclei slightly shrunk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The supernatant with extranuclear solution contains unbound capsids and free viral DNA from broken capsids. The pellet of nuclei with bound capsids was then resuspended in a surfactant-containing buffer to break the nuclear membranes and release into solution the bound capsids and the nucleoplasm contents with injected viral DNA. In the pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we used anti-HSV-1/2 ICP5/UL19 antibody attached to Protein A beads to immunoprecipitate capsids present in the resuspended nuclear pellet. Analogously, immunoprecipitation was used to separate the unbound viral capsids from the extranuclear solution (the supernatant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

The positions of DNA primers were selected to cover most of the HSV-1 genome length and included both S and L regions corresponding to one copy of VP16 (103,163–104,635 bp) and the two copies of ICP0 [copy 1: (2,113 bp-5,388 bp) and copy 2: (120,207 bp-123,482 bp)]. DNA ejection from HSV-1 capsid follows directionality starting at the 151 kb S-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Newcomb et al., 2009</xref>). This primer selection ensured that both complete and partial ejection of the HSV-1 genome (151 kb total length) into the nucleus could be detected.</p><p>As a control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> shows that the total DNA copy number added from all four fractions (<italic>a,b,c,d</italic>) separated with the pull-down assay remains the same with and without 30% w/w PEG added to the capsid-nuclei sample. This confirms that no DNA is lost during the DNA fractionation steps due to PEG addition, and therefore the observed reduction in DNA amount in <italic>fraction d</italic> (ejected intranuclear DNA) is entirely attributed to the suppression of DNA ejection from nuclei-bound capsids. As described above, fluorescent microscopy imaging in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> showed that the addition of 30% PEG 8 kDa does not interfere with capsid binding to nuclei. By determining the amounts of DNA injected into nuclei (<italic>fraction d</italic>) and retained in the capsids bound to nuclei (<italic>fraction c</italic>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows that the number of capsids bound to nuclei is in fact slightly increased (<italic>fractions c</italic> and <italic>d</italic> combined) with 30% PEG addition (the number of unbound capsids in <italic>fraction b</italic> have correspondingly decreased). Enhanced capsid binding to NPCs at nuclei can be explained by the crowding effect induced by PEG molecules, which has been observed to enhance macromolecular binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Minton, 2006</xref>). <italic>Fraction a</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, corresponding to free viral DNA in the extranuclear solution from broken capsids, is also reduced by PEG addition.

However, it should also be noted that even without PEG, <italic>fraction a</italic> only constitutes &lt;0.2% of the total viral DNA amount and is at the level of qPCR background noise.</p><p>For a final visual demonstration of the osmotic suppression of DNA ejection from HSV-1 capsids into reconstituted cell nuclei, we used ultrathin-sectioning EM. As a negative control, capsids were first incubated with isolated nuclei with added cytosol at 4°C for 40 min without ATP regeneration system. As was previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ojala et al., 2000</xref>), these conditions prevented DNA ejection from viral capsids with ~95% of HSV-1 capsids retaining their genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Next, reproducing the optimized capsid-nuclei binding conditions from the pull-down assay above, purified DNA-filled C-capsids were incubated with isolated rat liver nuclei in the presence of cell cytosol supplemented with ATP regeneration system for 40 min at 37°C. After this incubation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows EM micrographs of capsids attached to nuclei, where ~ 62% of capsids are empty with fully ejected DNA when no PEG is present (at least 100 nuclei bound capsids were counted for each sample analysis). The failure to eject DNA from the remaining ~38% of capsids can be attributed to the capsid damage and failure to attach to the NPCs. Indeed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows capsids that bind to the nuclear membrane in multilayer clusters, where only the first layer, closest to the nuclear membrane, can dock to the NPCs and eject the DNA. Capsids in the outer layers therefore retain their genomes. By contrast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows that when capsids were incubated with reconstituted nuclei (in cytosol supplemented with ATP-regeneration system) for 40 min at 37°C with 30% w/w PEG 8 kDa present, the majority of capsids (~81%) did not eject their genome and retained DNA in the capsid. [In the pull-down assay, the estimated fractions of capsids that ejected DNA without PEG or retained DNA with PEG present, were even higher. This can be attributed to the fact that in the pull-down assay, only capsids that were directly bound to nuclear NPCs were accounted for (<italic>fractions c</italic> and <italic>d</italic>), separated with several centrifugation steps and multiple washes of nuclei with bound capsids, unlike in the EM analysis where unbound capsids are also present.

Here, we further demonstrate that the observed suppression of DNA ejection from capsids into nuclei is caused by the osmotic pressure gradient across the capsid wall, which turns the capsid pressure off, as opposed to PEG itself and/or its osmotic pressure effect blocking the NPC channel and interfering with the transport functionality. To show this, we repeated the capsid-nuclei binding experiment above but this time PEG 8 kDa was replaced with PEG 400 Da. At 17% w/w, PEG 400 generates 18 atm of osmotic pressure (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://brocku.ca/researchers/peter_rand/">https://brocku.ca/researchers/peter_rand/</ext-link>). This osmotic pressure was required for complete suppression of DNA ejection with PEG 8 kDa. However, as mentioned above, HSV-1 capsid pore size has a MW cutoff of ~4000 Da (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trus et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heymann et al., 2003</xref>); therefore, PEG 400 Da permeates the capsid (unlike PEG 8 kDa). Accordingly, even when capsids bound to reconstituted nuclei are incubated at 18 atm osmotic pressure with PEG 400 Da, there will be no osmotic pressure gradient (between inside and outside the capsid) needed to cancel the DNA pressure in the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evilevitch et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, when isolated nuclei reconstituted with cytosol and an ATP-regeneration system were incubated with C-capsids for 40 min at 37°C with 17% w/w PEG 400 Da added to the solution, ultrathin-sectioning EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) showed that, despite18 atm osmotic pressure surrounding the capsids,~60% of capsids were empty (ejected their DNA). This is equivalent to the fraction of empty capsids that ejected DNA after incubation of capsids with reconstituted nuclei for 40 min at 37°C without PEG addition (~62% empty capsids). This observation further validates the assumption that it is the osmotic pressure gradient that suppresses DNA ejection through the NPCs by ‘turning off’ the capsid pressure and not the interference with NPC transport functionality.</p><p>Combined, the pull-down assay and the EM data clearly demonstrate that viral DNA ejection into host nuclei from HSV-1 capsids bound to NPCs is completely blocked when the intracapsid genome pressure is turned off through an osmolyte addition.

The reconstituted capsid-nuclei experiments above provide a demonstration of a nuclear entry mechanism of DNA from HSV-1, driven by high mechanical pressure of the encapsidated viral genome. Despite previous measurements of intracapsid DNA pressure in several types of viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Evilevitch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2013</xref>), the role that capsid pressure plays for intranuclear viral genome delivery has not been demonstrated until now.</p><p>The aim of this work was to demonstrate that capsid pressure is critical for initiation of DNA ejection from a herpesvirus capsid into a host nucleus. However, other factors may contribute to complete internalization of the viral genome into the nucleus once the first portion of herpes DNA is released through the NPC channel by the capsid pressure. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, capsid pressure is rapidly reduced with the increasing fraction of ejected DNA. At osmotic pressures of 3–4 atm, equivalent to that of the cellular cytoplasm surrounding the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeembaeva et al., 2008</xref>), only ~50% of DNA is ejected. This leaves the question as to how the rest of the genome is released. [However, not all macromolecules generating the osmotic pressure in the cell are large enough not to penetrate the capsid, which, as discussed above, is required for osmotic suppression of DNA ejection. Thus, we anticipate that a DNA fraction larger than 50% is ejected by DNA pressure into the crowded cellular environment]. We had previously found that the crowded cellular environment (which contributes to the osmotic pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parsegian et al., 2000</xref>]), combined with the presence of DNA-binding proteins in the cell, lead to instant condensation of the incoming viral DNA. This DNA condensation exerts a significant pulling force on the rest of the DNA, facilitating its complete internalization in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeembaeva et al., 2008</xref>). Further, a recent theoretical study proposed that DNA ejection could be described by a two-step process, where the first portion of DNA is ejected by DNA-DNA repulsive pressure, followed by a slower process of anomalous diffusion of condensed viral genome in the crowded cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). These effects can be investigated in the future using the reconstituted nucleus system.</p><p>High intracapsid DNA packing density resulting in tens of atmospheres of pressure is a distinctive trait of all nine human herpesviruses. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, we calculated capsid DNA pressures in several types of herpesviruses using analytical expressions in refs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tzlil et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Purohit et al., 2003</xref>) and EM measured values for inner capsid diameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Booy et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Germi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yi et al., 2017</xref>) to compute DNA-DNA electrostatic repulsive force and bending stress. As a reference pressure, the calculated HSV-1 DNA pressure is in agreement with our measured value of 19 atm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2013</xref>). The differences in computed pressures (ranging from ~14 atm for VZV to ~90 atm for EBV) are related to the variation in DNA packing density of these viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Booy et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Germi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yi et al., 2017</xref>). This strongly suggests that pressure-driven entry of viral DNA into the host nucleus during infection is universal to all herpesviruses.</p><p>Other types of viruses also involve replication steps dependent on the pressurized state of the intracapsid genome. For instance, during genome packaging, reoviruses replicate ssRNA to dsRNA inside the capsid, which results in genome packaging densities similar to that of herpesviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prasad et al., 1996</xref>). Such intracapsid replication could be regulated, at least in part, by generation of internal pressure resulting from the increasing genome packaging density as newly synthesized dsRNA continues to fill the internal capsid volume. Another example is HIV, where similar to herpesviruses, HIV capsids dock to NPCs at the nucleus and release transcribed dsDNA through the NPC channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rankovic et al., 2017</xref>). It was recently shown that the reverse transcription process from ssRNA to dsDNA inside the HIV capsid is associated with increasing internal DNA pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rankovic et al., 2017</xref>). By demonstrating the central function of herpes capsid pressure for intranuclear viral DNA entry, combined with assays developed in this work, we provide a platform for analysis of pressure-regulated replication in many viruses that afflict humans and animals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>African green monkey kidney cells (Vero; ATCC CCL-81 from American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) and BHK-21 cells (ATCC CCL-10; from American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies), and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin; Life Technologies).

Your article has been reviewed by Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers are in agreement that the experiments reported here have been well-designed and carried out, and that they shed light on the important process of pressure-driven viral genome delivery. In particular they demonstrate genome translocation from envelope-free HSV1 capsids through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) into nuclei isolated from rat liver cells supplemented with importin-β and ATP regeneration components necessary for NPC binding and opening. After establishing delivery of genomic DNA to the nuclei, this delivery is suppressed by adding a critical PEG concentration (established in separate in vitro work with purified capsids and trypsin for triggering genome release).</p><p>The reviewers recommend publication subject to the authors responding to the several following concerns and suggestions:</p><p>1) The authors should drop all mention of &quot;infection&quot; in the account of their work, because of their system being restricted – by design, as appropriate – to an in vitro reconstitution of DNA delivery to isolated nuclei.</p><p>2) Similarly, their claims that the work is relevant to new anti-viral therapies involving polyvalent ions (or by any other means, for that matter) should be dropped.</p><p>3) The Van Valen at al.

Ojala et al. (2000) finds good agreement in experimental comparison between the reconstituted nuclei system (which includes all cellular components required to facilitate HSV-1 capsids’ specific binding to NPCs, opening of the capsid portal, and translocation of viral DNA through the NPC pore) and HSV-1 binding to NPCs followed by DNA release in living cells. Therefore, our study of the DNA ejection step from HSV-1 into reconstituted cell nuclei reproduces the herpes DNA ejection step in living cells.</p><p>Indeed, we show here that the DNA pressure in HSV-1 capsids powers ejection of the viral genome into a reconstituted cell nucleus. Thus, we have only isolated one central step of the herpes infectious cycle – viral DNA translocation. However, the term “infection” denotes introduction of nucleic acid into a host cell by a virus (not necessarily with genome replication). In fact, primary infection by several types of herpesviruses (including HSV-1) is latent, i.e. the herpes genome is translocated into the host nucleus without subsequent genome replication (Adam, Marr and Gerace, 1990). Therefore, the osmotic suppression assay combined with the reconstituted nucleus system present a platform for the analysis of a pressure-dependent mechanism of herpesvirus’ infectious cycle focused on the DNA translocation step into the host. This has now also been explained in the text.</p><p>Following the editors’ recommendations, we have removed the word “infection” at several places in the text and have replaced it with “leading to infection”. We have also clarified in the text what denotes the term “infection”, specifically with regard to latent infection in herpesviruses. We hope that this revised presentation is acceptable and provides an accurate description of our system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similarly, their claims that the work is relevant to new anti-viral therapies involving polyvalent ions (or by any other means, for that matter) should be dropped.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now removed all mention of this throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Van Valen at al. (2012) and Chen et al. (2018) papers should be cited and their relevance to the present work described briefly, particularly with regard to their discussion of pressure-driven genome delivery in a full biological context and their calling attention to other physical mechanisms – in addition to pressure driving the initial stages – for DNA translocation.</p></disp-quote><p>The findings in their Van Valen et al. (2012) and Chen et al. (2018) papers have now been described and cited in both the Introduction and Conclusions sections in the manuscript.</p><p>However, the focus of this manuscript is to demonstrate that capsid pressure is critical for viral DNA delivery into a cell nucleus, which has not been shown experimentally before. We show this by “turning off” the pressure in the capsid and observing that no intranuclear DNA ejection occurs. Indeed, as discussed in Chen et al. (2018), capsid pressure might only be responsible for initial stages of DNA delivery, where the rest of the viral genome is internalized in the nucleus by other processes, such as anomalous diffusion of the condensed phage genome into the crowded bacterial cytoplasm. As mentioned above, the focus of our manuscript was not to explain the mechanism of translocation of the entire viral genome but only to show the role of capsid pressure. This has now been further clarified in the Conclusions section of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In this context, what do the present experiments tell us about the length of genome delivered?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified in the text that:</p><p>“The positions of DNA primers were selected to cover most of the HSV-1 genome length and included both S and L regions corresponding to one copy of VP16 (103,163-104,635 bp) and the two copies of ICP0 [copy 1: (2,113 bp-5,388 bp) and copy 2: (120,207 bp-123,482 bp)]. DNA ejection from HSV-1 capsid follows directionality starting at the 151 kb S-end (Newcomb et al., 2009). This primer selection ensured that both complete and partial ejection of the HSV-1 genome (151 kb total length) into the nucleus could be detected.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should discuss alternative explanations of the effect of PEG in their experiments, such as osmotic stress of the nuclei themselves, or interfering with the mechanism of NPC activity in translocating DNA.</p></disp-quote><p>We have further clarified this in subsection “Reconstituted capsid-nuclei system” by adding the explanation below along with one new experiment:</p><p>Finan, Leddy and Guilak (2011) demonstrates that nuclear transport through the NPCs is not negatively affected by hyper-osmotic conditions corresponding to those used in our study (~20 atm). Specifically, the authors reported that, under hyper-osmotic stress, the nuclear size decreased while nuclear lacunarity increased, indicating expansion in the pores and channels interdigitating the chromatin. As a result, the rate of nucleocytoplasmic transport increased but only due to the change in the nucleus geometry, providing a shorter effective diffusion distance. This sensitivity to hyperosmotic conditions concerned both passive and active transport across the NPCs. At the same time, the authors found that diffusivity within the nucleus was insensitive to the osmotic environment. In agreement with these studies (Finan, Leddy and Guilak, 2011), we observed that, under hyperosmotic conditions (~18 atm at 30% w/w PEG 8 kDa), the nuclei slightly shrunk (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). However, the sub-nuclear structure of heterochromatin DNA was essentially unchanged upon addition of PEG, as visualized by a DAPI stain of nuclear DNA (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, second row). We also confirmed that the integrity of the nuclei was not affected by the addition of 30% w/w PEG 8kDa by showing that fluorescently labeled 70 kDa dextran is excluded from the nuclei interior with nuclei remaining intact and structured, see Figure 3—figure supplement 1B. Finally, we showed that the full transport functionality of NPCs is maintained in the reconstituted nuclei system at an osmotic pressure of ~18 atm generated by PEG. This was verified with a fluorescently labeled nuclear localization signal (NLS) (data not shown) (Sekine et al., 2017). Purified GST-NLS-EGFP recombinant protein, which contains the NLS of the simian virus 40 T antigen fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and EGFP fluorescent protein, was used. Purified rat liver nuclei were incubated with cytosolic extracts (as a source of soluble import factors) supplemented with an ATP-regeneration system and a purified GST-NLS-EGFP recombinant protein at ~18 atm external osmotic pressure generated by PEG. This protein was used as a positive import substrate. It was fully transported into the nucleus through the NPC by an active mechanism, which was detected by fluorescence microscopy (Finlay et al., 1987; Finan, Leddy and Guilak, 2011; Miyamoto et al., 2002) (see details in the Materials and methods section).</p><p>The NLS transport experiment (subsection “Reconstituted capsid-nuclei system”) and the nucleocytoplasmic transport measurements under hyperosmotic stress reported in Finan, Leddy and Guilak (2011) showed that NPCs’ transport functionality is not disrupted by 18 atm PEG-generated osmotic pressure. Here, we further demonstrate that the observed suppression of DNA ejection from capsids into nuclei is caused by the osmotic pressure gradient across the capsid wall, which turns the capsid pressure off, as opposed to PEG itself and/or its osmotic pressure effect blocking the NPC channel and interfering with the transport functionality. To show this, we repeated the capsid-nuclei binding experiment but this time PEG 8 kDa was replaced with PEG 400 Da. At 17% w/w, PEG 400 generates 18 atm of osmotic pressure (see https://brocku.ca/researchers/peter_rand/). This osmotic pressure was required for complete suppression of DNA ejection with PEG 8 kDa. However, as mentioned above, HSV-1 capsid pore size has a MW cutoff of ~4000 Da (Trus et al., 1996; Heymann et al., 2003); therefore, PEG 400 Da permeates the capsid (unlike PEG 8 kDa). Thus, even when capsids bound to reconstituted nuclei are incubated at 18 atm osmotic pressure with PEG 400 Da, there is no osmotic pressure gradient between the interior and the exterior of the capsid, which needed to generate the osmotic gradient required to cancel the DNA pressure in the capsid (Evilevitch et al., 2008). Thus, isolated nuclei reconstituted with cytosol and an ATP-regeneration system were incubated with C-capsids for 40 min at 37°C with 17% w/w PEG 400 Da added to solution. Ultrathin-sectioning EM in Figure 6 shows that, despite 18 atm osmotic pressure surrounding the capsids, ~60% of capsids were empty (ejected their DNA), equivalent to the fraction of empty capsids that ejected DNA after incubation of capsids with reconstituted nuclei for 40 min at 37°C without PEG addition (~62% empty capsids). This observation further validates the assumption that it is the osmotic pressure gradient that suppresses DNA ejection through the NPCs by “turning off” the capsid pressure and not the interference with NPC transport functionality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) What is the effect of osmotic pressure in the nuclei themselves, on the quantitation of suppression reported in the present work and on the length of genome delivered?</p></disp-quote><p>The effect of osmotic pressure on nuclei has been further clarified in the manuscript.</p><p>We have also provided clarification in the Conclusions section, addressing the question of the effect of osmotic pressure on the ejected DNA length:</p><p>“The aim of this work was to demonstrate that capsid pressure is critical for initiation of DNA ejection from a herpesvirus capsid into a host nucleus.
