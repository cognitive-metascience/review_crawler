Despite the importance of MeCP2 levels to brain function, little is known about its regulation. In this study, we report eleven individuals with neuropsychiatric disease and copy-number variations spanning <italic>NUDT21</italic>, which encodes a subunit of pre-mRNA cleavage factor Im. Investigations of <italic>MECP2</italic> mRNA and protein abundance in patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells from one <italic>NUDT21</italic> deletion and three duplication cases show that <italic>NUDT21</italic> regulates MeCP2 protein quantity. Elevated <italic>NUDT21</italic> increases usage of the distal polyadenylation site in the <italic>MECP2</italic> 3′ UTR, resulting in an enrichment of inefficiently translated long mRNA isoforms. Furthermore, normalization of <italic>NUDT21</italic> via siRNA-mediated knockdown in duplication patient lymphoblasts restores MeCP2 to normal levels. Ultimately, we identify <italic>NUDT21</italic> as a novel candidate for intellectual disability and neuropsychiatric disease, and elucidate a mechanism of pathogenesis by MeCP2 dysregulation via altered alternative polyadenylation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10782.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10782.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10782.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The X-chromosome carries a number of genes that are involved in a child's intellectual development. One of these genes encodes a protein called MeCP2, which is important for brain function after birth. Mutations in the <italic>MECP2</italic> gene cause a disorder known as Rett syndrome. At around 18 months of age, affected children begin to lose the cognitive and motor skills that they had previously acquired. Individuals with extra copies of this gene also show cognitive impairments. For both diseases, individuals with levels of the MeCP2 protein that are the most different from those found in healthy individuals also show the most severe symptoms.</p><p>To produce the protein that is encoded by a particular gene, enzymes inside the cell must first make a copy of that gene using a molecule called messenger ribonucleic acid (or mRNA). This mRNA is then used as a template to assemble the protein itself. In the case of <italic>MECP2</italic>, two different mRNA templates are produced: a long version and a short version. A gene called <italic>NUDT21</italic> makes a protein that regulates whether the long or short version of <italic>MECP2</italic> mRNA is made.</p><p>Gennarino, Alcott et al. have now discovered that people with too many, or too few, copies of the <italic>NUDT21</italic> gene have intellectual disabilities and altered levels of MeCP2 protein. Specifically, individuals with extra copies of <italic>NUDT21</italic>—and thus higher levels of the corresponding protein—produce more of the long <italic>MECP2</italic> mRNA. The production of proteins from this long mRNA is less efficient than from the short mRNA; therefore, these individuals have lower levels of MeCP2 protein. The opposite is true for individuals who lack a copy of the <italic>NUDT21</italic> gene.</p><p>To confirm these data, Gennarino, Alcott et al. grew cells in the laboratory from patients with extra copies of the <italic>NUDT21</italic> gene and found that reducing the production of its protein returned the levels of the MeCP2 protein back to normal. These findings show that alterations in the <italic>NUDT21</italic> gene cause changes in the level of MeCP2 protein in cells and leads to neuropsychiatric diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10782.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10782.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>alternative polyadenylation</kwd><kwd>neuropsychiatric disease</kwd><kwd>NUDT21</kwd><kwd>MeCP2</kwd><kwd>intellectual disability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01NS057819</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Baylor College of Medicine IDDRC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1 U54 HD083092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rett Syndrome Research Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Alcott</surname><given-names>Callison E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Joan and Stanford Alexander Family</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schaaf</surname><given-names>Christian P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Individuals with deletions or duplications of the <italic>NUDT21</italic> gene have altered levels of MeCP2 protein and intellectual disabilities.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Main text</title><p>Methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) binds methylated cytosines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lewis et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Guo et al., 2014</xref>) and affects the expression of thousands of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Chahrour et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>MECP2</italic> loss-of-function is the predominant cause of Rett syndrome, a postnatal neurological disorder that typically manifests around 18 months of age with developmental regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amir et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ravn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pan et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>MECP2</italic> mutations additionally cause other neurological disorders, such as non-specific autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carney et al., 2003</xref>), Angelman-like syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imessaoudene et al., 2001</xref>), and intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Orrico et al., 2000</xref>).

Mouse studies have established that <italic>MECP2</italic> alone within the duplicated and triplicated region is sufficient to cause all the neurological phenotypes of the duplication and triplication syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Samaco et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, even small changes in MeCP2 protein level lead to neurocognitive deficits and behavioral abnormalities, and the severity of the phenotype correlates with the level of MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao and Zoghbi, 2012</xref>).</p><p><italic>MECP2</italic> is distinctive for its long 3′ UTR of about 8.5 kb that contains two predominant poly-adenylation (p(A)) sites: a proximal p(A) site located just after the last exon, and a distal p(A) site approximately 8 kb from the final exon, which result in short and long messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) isoforms, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shahbazian et al., 2002</xref>). 3′ UTRs are important for fine-tuning transcript and protein levels because they contain binding sites for regulatory molecules such as RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Bartel, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Gennarino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Gennarino et al., 2015</xref>) which induce degradation of the mRNA or inhibit its translation. Thus, long isoforms allow for greater regulation due to an increased number of regulatory elements. The long 3′ UTR of <italic>MECP2</italic> harbors more than 50 putative miRNA-binding sites, including the miRNAs known to bind <italic>MECP2</italic>—miR-483-5p, miR-132 and miR-155—and reduce MeCP2 protein abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuhn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2013</xref>). The proximal p(A) site of <italic>MECP2</italic> is increasingly used throughout postnatal development, resulting in more short mRNA isoforms and a concomitant increase in protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balmer et al., 2003</xref>), which may be driven by the loss of regulatory binding sites in its 3′ UTR. These observations highlight the complex and precise regulation of MeCP2 in the human brain.</p><p>Pre-messenger RNA cleavage factor Im (CFIm) regulates 3′ UTR length by mediating alternative poly-adenylation (APA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Millevoi and Vagner, 2010</xref>). It binds pre-messenger mRNA as a heterotetramer that consists of a <italic>NUDT21</italic>-encoded CFIm25 dimer and any two of the paralogs CFIm59 or CFIm68 (or its splice variant, CFIm72) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). In vitro, CFIm25 or CFIm68 knockdown leads to a transcriptome-wide increase in proximal APA site usage, whereas knockdown of other p(A) proteins, such as CFIm59, CPSF, CSTF, or CFIIm, has minimal effects on APA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gruber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Masamha et al., 2014</xref>). Several models have been proposed to explain the role of CFIm25 in APA, but the exact mechanism remains unknown. A total of 59 genes have increased proximal p(A) site usage when comparing low- to high-<italic>NUDT21</italic> expressing glioblastoma tumors, and of these, 24 show the same effect as that following CFIm25 knockdown in HeLa cells. <italic>MECP2</italic> is the most affected, and its protein levels increase accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Masamha et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, Clip-seq data show enriched CFIm25 binding of the <italic>MECP2</italic> 3′ UTR near its p(A) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gruber et al., 2012</xref>). Based on this, we hypothesized that CFIm25 regulates MeCP2 in humans by changing the ratio of short to long mRNA isoforms and that <italic>NUDT21</italic> gain- or loss-of-function will be correlated with neuropsychiatric disease.</p><p>To support our hypothesis, we sought patients with copy-number variation (CNV) of <italic>NUDT21</italic>.

We, therefore, established immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines of the four individuals and tested them for relative changes in MeCP2 protein and mRNA levels, and APA site usage. As hypothesized, in the duplication patients, we found ∼60% more CFIm25 and ∼50% less MeCP2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), while in the deletion patient, we found ∼50% less CFIm25 and ∼50% more MeCP2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), when compared to 13 age-matched control subjects. In order to prove that <italic>NUDT21</italic> alone can regulate MeCP2 levels, we performed an siRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>NUDT21</italic> and assessed for changes in MeCP2 protein abundance.

The digital data were processed using the Peak Chart Data Acquisition Software and UV absorption at 254 nm was plotted vs time (from top to bottom or fraction number of sucrose gradients) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). TRIzol LS reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, United States) was used to extract RNA from the various polysome fraction and total lysate aliquots as per the manufacturer's recommendations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Primers</title><p>In order to unambiguously distinguish spliced cDNA from genomic DNA contamination, specific exon primers were designed to amplify across introns of the genes tested.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Stylianos Antonarakis (Senior Editor) and three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. One of the three reviewers, Stephen Warren, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>Based on our discussions, the individual reviews below and policy regarding submissions to <italic>eLife</italic> where additional significant experimentation is required, we regret to inform you that this submission of your work will not be considered further for publication. However, we would be willing to consider a substantially revised manuscript that includes additional experimentation to address all major concerns detailed below.</p><p>While all reviewers found the association between <italic>NUDT21</italic> CNVs and neuropsychiatric illness interesting and potentially important, enthusiasm was reduced based upon the small number of cases that were considered in detail, prior knowledge regarding the relationship between <italic>NUDT21</italic> dosage and expression of long and short forms of <italic>MECP2</italic> mRNA with specific implication of alternative polyA site utilization (Masamha et al., 2014). There were also specific experimental concerns about certain aspects of the functional studies in your manuscript. Foremost among these were the discordant performance of controls in the mRNA studies shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> which substantially influences data interpretation, and the lack of studies to specifically assess for a contribution of altered mRNA stability. Given that the CNVs under consideration span many genes, both Reviewers 1 and 2 suggested targeted complementation experiments in the deletion and/or duplication cells via recombinant expression and/or siRNA-based methods, respectively. Also both reviewers asked for more clinical information about the additional CNV patients where cell lines were not available to try to increase knowledge and confidence regarding the phenotypic spectrum associated with <italic>NUDT21</italic> CNVs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This interesting manuscript describes and characterizes the functional consequence of CNVs spanning <italic>NUDT21</italic> in patients with forms of intellectual disability (ID; 3 duplications and 1 deletion). <italic>NUDT21</italic> encodes CFIm25, a component of the heterotetrameric pre-messenger RNA cleavage factor I (CFIm) that is known to influence alternative polyadenylation (APA) site usage. Prior work suggests that increased CFIm25 dosage favors distal APA site usage for many transcripts, prominently including those for <italic>MECP2</italic>. This often (generally ?) associates with decreased protein expression, presumably due to the inclusion of additional negative regulatory 3'UTR elements such as those that encode binding sites for miRNAs that can function to decrease mRNA stability or (more commonly) translational efficiency. The reverse is true for reduced CFIm25 dosage. Importantly, either decreased or increased MeCP2 expression is known to cause ID with or without autistic features of variable severity.</p><p>Using patient lymphoblast lines, the authors show that <italic>NUDT21</italic> duplication or deletion CNVs associate with decreased or increased expression of MeCP2, respectively. Curiously, both types of CNVs correlate with increased <italic>MECP2</italic> mRNA expression. The authors describe apparent differences in APA site bias that might reconcile these findings and support their hypothesis that <italic>NUDT21</italic> CNVs represent a previously unrecognized etiology of ID.</p><p>In general, this is a quality study with very interesting and provocative findings. I do, however, have a number of questions and concerns that limit my enthusiasm for this manuscript in its present form. These are detailed below.</p><p>1) My major concern with this manuscript relates to the mRNA data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. While the protein data nicely document increased CFIm25 and decreased MeCP2 protein expression in duplication patients, with the reverse in the deleted patient (n=1 concerns noted), the mRNA data are more ambiguous. Specifically, the northern blot data shown in 2D appear to show an increase in the short (proximal APA site usage) isoform in both the duplicated and deletion patient(s), although this is not specifically quantified. The duplication and deletion patient(s) appear to show increased or decreased distal APA site usage respectively, in keeping with hypothesis, but this is only true when each CNV type is correlated with their respective controls. The difference in the performance of the controls in each arm of this experiment is striking and without apparent basis, with essentially no usage of the distal APA site in the duplication blot and substantial (essentially that of the duplication patients) in the deletion blot. Perusal of the Methods suggests that this does not relate to exposure time or any other definable experimental parameter. If the deletion lane were compared to the controls for the duplication blot, then no apparent difference between deletion and duplication patients would be observed, leaving in question the molecular basis for the striking difference in protein expression between the groups. Even at face value, the (somewhat) higher total mRNA expression and the equivalent long/short isoform ratio shown for the deletion patient (when compared to controls) fails to fully explain the striking increase in MeCP2 protein expression that is evident from the blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> (and inadequately captured in the quantitative data shown below). It would be valuable to show a single northern blot with controls, the duplication patients and the deletion patient, with independent quantification of each parameter (long, short, total, ratio) to facilitate direct comparisons.</p><p>2) Given the authors’ original hypothesis that the long isoform would show lower stability, I am not sure that a simple measurement of steady state mRNA abundance adequately captures the potential complexity of the situation. It seems possible, even likely, that an attempt at transcriptional compensation is confounding the situation. In this light, it would be useful to measure mRNA half-life, given the authors’ stated goal to understand the mechanism of altered regulation of gene expression. This could be accomplished by measuring steady-state abundance of the various mRNA isoforms in close temporal sequence with administration of a transcriptional inhibitor such as actinomycin D or DRB. It seems possible that a higher than normal level of transcription might contribute to altered APA site usage in a manner at least partially independent from the absolute level of CFIm25, due to saturation of other trans factors.</p><p>3) The authors assume that observations made using lymphoblasts are representative of those in “all cells”. Is this necessarily the case? Could additional evidence be provided?</p><p>4) It is quite obvious that there are many genes in the described CNVs that might, in theory, contribute to MeCP2 and/or phenotypic expression. This might be addressed by attempts at compensatory overexpression of CFIm25 in cells from the deleted patient and/or siRNA-mediated knockdown in cells from the duplicated patients.</p><p>5) While it is stated that there is redundancy between CFIm59, CFIm68 and CFIm72, it is also stated that isolated deficiency of CFIm68 increases proximal APA site usage. In this light, it seems possible that CNVs that alter CFIm68 expression would also lead to relevant phenotypes. Has this been assessed?</p><p>6) The authors vaguely describe additional patients with CNVs encompassing <italic>NUDT21</italic>, but provide no additional details regarding phenotype, the nature of the CNVs (deletions or duplications), or their range.

The authors cleverly propose that human mutations modulating the abundance of CFIm25 could alter <italic>MECP2</italic> levels leading to an abnormal phenotype as it is well established that <italic>MECP2</italic> levels are tightly controlled in humans. Accordingly, the authors searched clinical aCGH databases of ∼94,000 samples and identified 11 CNVs involving <italic>NUDT21</italic> which codes for CFIm25. Of the 11, 4 families were ascertained for follow-up studies. Using lymphoblastoid cells of three duplications and one deletion, the authors convincingly show an inverse correlation between <italic>NUDT21</italic> copy number and <italic>MECP2</italic> levels by altering p(A) usage sites, with the long 3'UTR showing low <italic>MECP2</italic> levels compared to the short 3-UTR. The authors make a reasonable hypothesis that the long 3'UTR has many more regulatory sites influencing translation than the short isoform.</p><p>This is a very well written paper with convincing data that represent one of the first post-transcriptional regulators of <italic>MECP2</italic>, which is notable for its need to be rigorously controlled. Moreover, it points to <italic>NUDT21</italic> mutations as potentially important causes of neuropsychiatric disease. It is therefore an important contribution.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10782.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>We are happy to report that we have been able to address the reviewers’ concerns and suggestions, which were quite useful in helping substantiate our hypothesis and strengthen the narrative. Briefly, we report more cases and provide a more detailed description of the phenotypic spectrum of patients with <italic>NUDT21</italic> CNVs. Notably, we now demonstrate that normalizing <italic>NUDT21</italic> in lymphoblastoid cells from <italic>NUDT21</italic> duplication patients restores MeCP2 levels to normal range. We also present a clearer molecular mechanism for how <italic>NUDT21</italic> regulates MeCP2 in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Performing a polyribosome fractionation assay on lymphoblastoid cells derived from <italic>NUDT21</italic> duplication patients, we discovered that the increased long isoform of <italic>MECP2</italic> is highly enriched in the untranslated fraction of lymphoblastoid cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) My major concern with this manuscript relates to the mRNA data presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>. While the protein data nicely document increased CFIm25 and decreased MeCP2 protein expression in duplication patients, with the reverse in the deleted patient (n=1 concerns noted), the mRNA data are more ambiguous. Specifically, the northern blot data shown in 2D appear to show an increase in the short (proximal APA site usage) isoform in both the duplicated and deletion patient(s), although this is not specifically quantified. The duplication and deletion patient(s) appear to show increased or decreased distal APA site usage respectively, in keeping with hypothesis, but this is only true when each CNV type is correlated with their respective controls. The difference in the performance of the controls in each arm of this experiment is striking and without apparent basis, with essentially no usage of the distal APA site in the duplication blot and substantial (essentially that of the duplication patients) in the deletion blot. Perusal of the Methods suggests that this does not relate to exposure time or any other definable experimental parameter. If the deletion lane were compared to the controls for the duplication blot, then no apparent difference between deletion and duplication patients would be observed, leaving in question the molecular basis for the striking difference in protein expression between the groups. Even at face value, the (somewhat) higher total mRNA expression and the equivalent long/short isoform ratio shown for the deletion patient (when compared to controls) fails to fully explain the striking increase in MeCP2 protein expression that is evident from the blot in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B</italic></xref> <italic>(and inadequately captured in the quantitative data shown below). It would be valuable to show a single northern blot with controls, the duplication patients and the deletion patient, with independent quantification of each parameter (long, short, total, ratio) to facilitate direct comparisons</italic>.</p><p>This point is well taken. We agree with the reviewer that it would be better to show a single northern blot image with controls, duplications, and deletions all together. We did the experiment and have included that image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Author response image 1</xref>), which replicates our previous findings. However, we want to emphasize that the quantification presented in the first manuscript was not exclusively of the image shown, but from all three experiments performed. Importantly, we did not compare the CNV data with the controls on the blot alone, but with all the controls in every experiment, as indicated in the figure legend. We presented the northern blot quantification as a ratio of the long and short <italic>MECP2</italic> isoforms in the original text because the isoform switching was most pertinent to our narrative. However, we have included the independent quantification of each isoform in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Author response image 1</xref>. It has proven challenging to capture both the short and long isoforms on the same blot due to differing transfer efficiencies and required exposure times. We therefore decided to move the northern blot to the supplemental materials. We believe that the qPCR data are more compelling, and the new insight gained from the polyribosome assay nicely explains the fate of the RNA<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10782.012</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Northern blot assay from patient-derived lymphoblast cells.</title><p>Northern blot assay showing that duplication and deletion patients respectively have more long or short <italic>MECP2</italic> isoforms (left panel).

It seems possible, even likely, that an attempt at transcriptional compensation is confounding the situation. In this light, it would be useful to measure mRNA half-life, given the authors’ stated goal to understand the mechanism of altered regulation of gene expression. This could be accomplished by measuring steady-state abundance of the various mRNA isoforms in close temporal sequence with administration of a transcriptional inhibitor such as actinomycin D or DRB. It seems possible that a higher than normal level of transcription might contribute to altered APA site usage in a manner at least partially independent from the absolute level of CFIm25, due to saturation of other trans factors</italic>.</p><p>As recommended, we performed an RNA stability assay and found that the long <italic>MECP2</italic> isoform has a slightly longer half-life (5.8 hours) compared to total <italic>MECP2</italic> (5.1 hours) in patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells. This could partially account for the elevated <italic>MECP2</italic> in the duplication patients due to their elevated levels of long <italic>MECP2</italic>, but we cannot exclude other possibilities such as a feedback mechanism. Given the small difference in the half-life, and that it does not change any of the paper’s conclusions, we have decided not to include it in the revised text. As mentioned above, we believe the ribosomal data are more critical to the conclusions of the paper.</p><p><italic>3) The authors assume that observations made using lymphoblasts are representative of those in “all cells”. Is this necessarily the case? Could additional evidence be provided</italic>?</p><p>Patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells are often used for patient-specific molecular and functional studies. Gene expression in lymphoblastoid cells covers a wide range of metabolic pathways in common with neurons. While they may not be representative of “all cells”, they represent an important model system, due to the minimal invasiveness of obtaining them, and the ease of cell maintenance. See Sie L. et al., J Neurosci Res., 2009 (PMID:19224581) for a review.</p><p><italic>4) It is quite obvious that there are many genes in the described CNVs that might, in theory, contribute to MeCP2 and/or phenotypic expression. This might be addressed by attempts at compensatory overexpression of CFIm25 in cells from the deleted patient and/or siRNA-mediated knockdown in cells from the duplicated patients</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We first looked for patients with point mutations in <italic>NUDT21</italic> or smaller CNVs and were able to identify one with a duplication of only 700 kb, reducing our minimal region to just five genes. Additionally, while it is not standard to transfect patient-derived lymphoblastoid due to low efficiency and cell survival following transfection, we tried a novel approach using nucleofection, and were successful. We adapted a T-cell protocol from Lonza, and as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, nucleofection of anti-<italic>NUDT21</italic> siRNA in control lymphoblastoid cells decreases NUDT21 while increasing MeCP2 as in the deletion patient. More importantly, normalizing NUDT21 levels in the <italic>NUDT21</italic> duplication patient lymphoblastoid cells restores MeCP2 levels to the normal range. These compelling data prove that NUDT21 regulates MeCP2 in our patients.</p><p><italic>5) While it is stated that there is redundancy between CFIm59, CFIm68 and CFIm72, it is also stated that isolated deficiency of CFIm68 increases proximal APA site usage. In this light, it seems possible that CNVs that alter CFIm68 expression would also lead to relevant phenotypes</italic>. <italic>Has this been assessed</italic>?</p><p>We have found patients with CNVs spanning <italic>CPSF7</italic> (which encodes CFIm59) and <italic>CPSF6</italic> (which encodes CFIm68) with phenotypes similar to those of the <italic>NUDT21</italic> CNV patients, and we have contacted their physicians for clinical data and blood samples. However, it took 15-18 months to receive the samples for the <italic>NUDT21</italic> CNV patients, and will take a comparable amount of time to receive those. Thus, we will happily follow up with a Research Advance when that study is complete.</p><p><italic>6) The authors vaguely describe additional patients with CNVs encompassing</italic> NUDT21<italic>, but provide no additional details regarding phenotype, the nature of the CNVs (deletions or duplications), or their range. Despite the fact that cell lines were only available for the 4 described patients, this additional information could prove very relevant and informative.

We also described the remaining CNVs by type, as the reviewer suggested, in the revised manuscript. However, we were unable to obtain clinical information beyond the indication for aCGH testing available in the databases because the primary physician did not respond to our queries. As we now mention in the revised text, none of the other genes in the minimal region of overlap are associated with neurological disease when heterozygous. Additionally, there are no individuals in the patient databases with CNVs of adjacent genes that do not also span <italic>NUDT21</italic>. All this together, along with the rescue experiment in the duplication lines, supports our conclusion that <italic>NUDT21</italic> alters MeCP2 levels, and, hence, is the driver of pathogenicity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p><italic>[…] The number of ID and DD patients is rather limited (3 duplication and 1 deletion); one of the subjects is mosaic (45%) drawing correlations is limited with such a low sample size.

As mentioned above in response to Reviewer 1, it is not common to transfect lymphoblastoid cells to target a putative causal gene in CNV patients due to low transfection efficiency and survival of lymphoblastoid cells upon transfection. However, we attempted the experiment by optimizing a Lonza nucleofection protocol originally designed for T-cells. We are happy to report, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, that we succeeded in this experiment. We nucleofected lymphoblastoid cells from control and <italic>NUDT21</italic> duplication patients with small interfering RNA against <italic>NUDT21</italic> and found that decreasing the <italic>NUDT21</italic> levels in control patients increases MeCP2 like in the deletion patient, while normalizing its level in duplication patients completely restores MeCP2 protein levels.

Additionally, since Signature Genomics is no longer in business, we cannot sort their database to get precise numbers for their total duplication and deletion cases. We also reduced the number of patients in our denominator by 6,300 by excluding prenatal cases for whom we could not know if they would have had neuropsychiatric disease.</p></body></sub-article></article>
