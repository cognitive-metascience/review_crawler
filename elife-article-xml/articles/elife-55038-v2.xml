plasma membrane (PM) that undergo scission and fusion at the cell surface and are enriched in specific lipids. However, the influence of lipid composition on caveolae surface stability is not well described or understood. Accordingly, we inserted specific lipids into the cell PM via membrane fusion and studied their acute effects on caveolae dynamics. We demonstrate that sphingomyelin stabilizes caveolae to the cell surface, whereas cholesterol and glycosphingolipids drive caveolae scission from the PM. Although all three lipids accumulated specifically in caveolae, cholesterol and sphingomyelin were actively sequestered, whereas glycosphingolipids diffused freely. The ATPase EHD2 restricts lipid diffusion and counteracts lipid-induced scission. We propose that specific lipid accumulation in caveolae generates an intrinsically unstable domain prone to scission if not restrained by EHD2 at the caveolae neck. This work provides a mechanistic link between caveolae and their ability to sense the PM lipid composition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>caveolae</kwd><kwd>EHD2</kwd><kwd>Lipids</kwd><kwd>cell surface stability</kwd><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>fusogenic liposomes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>dnr 2017-04028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lundmark</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name><name><surname>Larsson</surname><given-names>Elin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAN 2017/735</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lundmark</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name><name><surname>Hubert</surname><given-names>Madlen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAN2014/746</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hubert</surname><given-names>Madlen</given-names></name><name><surname>Lundmark</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hagberg Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hubert</surname><given-names>Madlen</given-names></name><name><surname>Lundmark</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007067</institution-id><institution>Kempe Foundations</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moodie</surname><given-names>Lindon WK</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Caveolae sense the membrane lipid composition, which influences their dynamic behavior at the cell surface.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Caveolae are bulb-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane (PM), enriched in cholesterol (Chol), sphingolipids, and the integral membrane protein caveolin1 (Cav1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</xref>). Caveolae are present in most cell types, with a particularly high density in endothelial cells, adipocytes, and smooth muscle cells. Absence or malfunction of caveolae is associated with a number of conditions such as lipodystrophy, muscular dystrophy, and cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pilch and Liu, 2011</xref>). Although the mechanism of how caveolae dysregulation drives the phenotype of disease is not well understood, they have been proposed to serve as signaling platforms, endocytic carriers, and PM reservoirs involved in mechanoprotective processes or lipid buffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</xref>). In adipocytes, which are key lipid homeostasis regulators, caveolae are estimated to account for more than 50% of the cell surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thorn et al., 2003</xref>). The clinical manifestation of caveolae loss in both patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayashi et al., 2009</xref>) and mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Razani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2008</xref>) reveals severe malfunction of adipocytes, in addition to other cell types involved in lipid turnover and storage.</p><p>Caveolae biogenesis is tightly coupled to the PM lipid composition and is thought to be driven by Chol-sensitive oligomerization of Cav1 and subsequent association with the cavin coat proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</xref>). Cav1 is embedded into the lipid bilayer via its intramembrane and scaffolding domains, which interact with Chol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</xref>). Chol depletion from the PM causes caveolae disassembly, leading to the disassociation of cavins from Cav1, which then disseminates throughout the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rothberg et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morén et al., 2012</xref>). Relative to the bulk PM, phosphatidylserine, glycosphingolipid (GSL), and sphingomyelin (SM) have also been proposed to be enriched in caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ortegren et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Singh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hirama et al., 2017</xref>). However, it has not been determined whether specific lipids are enriched in caveolae in living cells and, furthermore, how exactly they influence biogenesis, that is through a general physical effect on the membrane bilayer or via direct interactions with the caveolae coat proteins. Additionally, it is not known whether these lipids can diffuse freely in and out of the caveolae bulb or if they are sequestered by interactions with the caveolae coat and membrane curvature restraints.</p><p>Although caveolae are typically associated with the PM as bulb-shaped invaginations, they also exhibit dynamic behaviour including flattening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nassoy and Lamaze, 2012</xref>), short-range cycles of fission and fusion with the PM, and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pelkmans and Zerial, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boucrot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morén et al., 2012</xref>). Caveolae are stabilized at the cell surface by the ATPase Eps–15 homology domain-containing protein 2 (EHD2), which oligomerizes around the neck of caveolae in an ATP-dependent mechanistic cycle, restraining caveolae scission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morén et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stoeber et al., 2012</xref>). EHD2 extensively colocalizes with Cav1 and most of the membrane-associated EHD2 is found in caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morén et al., 2012</xref>). Although not considered part of the caveolae coat, EHD2 appears to be a critical component for maintaining caveolae integrity in terms of surface attachment. All the aforementioned proposed functions of caveolae depend greatly on whether they are surface associated or released, but it is not clear how the balance between these states is controlled physiologically. Furthermore, the biological function of their atypical dynamics remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hubert et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Lipids are also thought to influence caveolae dynamics, for example addition of bovine serum albumin-complexed lactosyl ceramide (LacCer) to human skin fibroblasts and elevated levels of Chol in adipocytes have been proposed to reduce the number of surface-connected caveolae and increase their mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Lay et al., 2006</xref>). However, despite their essential structural role in caveolae, little is known about how they influence caveolae biogenesis and dynamics. This knowledge gap can be partly attributed to limitations associated with the current methods employed to study such phenomena. Drugs such as statins, that inhibit Chol synthesis, require multi-day treatments, and, in addition to altering transcriptional regulation, may also elicit major secondary effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crescencio et al., 2009</xref>). This results in downregulated expression of Cav1, making it difficult to decipher between the effects of Chol levels on caveolae biogenesis and caveolae dynamics. In addition, drugs such as myriocin, which inhibit sphingosine synthesis, will also affect the levels of all sphingolipid species, thus hampering direct conclusions. BSA-coupled Bodipy-LacCer has been used as a fluorescent marker of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Puri et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singh et al., 2006</xref>), but this procedure involved PM loading at 4°C followed by a temperature shift to 37°C, known to heavily influence membrane fluidity and exacerbate endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kleusch et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies have indicated that lipids might influence both caveolae numbers and their dynamics, but have been unable to address whether caveolae dynamics respond directly to alterations in PM lipid composition and if the proposed effects are dependent on concentration or species of different lipids present. In general, our understanding of the levels of quantitative changes in PM lipid composition that can be sensed and controlled is relatively sparse, not to mention the alteration in lipid composition required to influence caveolae. It is also not known if lipids could affect caveolae dynamics by changing the composition of the caveolae bulb or the surrounding membrane and whether the proposed effects on caveolae mobility are caused by direct effects on caveolae scission from the cell surface.</p><p>To address this, we aimed to rapidly and selectively manipulate cellular membrane lipid composition in a system where both the lipids and caveolae could be tracked. Here, we have applied fusogenic liposomes that allowed us to directly insert specific unlabeled or fluorescently labeled lipids into the PM of living cells and study their effect on caveolae dynamics. Our data show that a relatively small increase in glycosphingolipids and Chol results in their accumulation in caveolae, reducing the caveolae neck diameter, and driving caveolae scission from the PM. EHD2 was found to counterbalance the stability of caveolae in response to lipid composition and, in accordance with recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morén et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matthaeus et al., 2020</xref>), we describe a key regulatory role of EHD2 in lipid homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lipids rapidly insert into the PM of living cells via liposome-mediated membrane fusion</title><p>As a tool to study the effects of altered lipid composition on caveolae dynamics, we employed fusogenic liposomes. This allowed rapid insertion of lipids into the PM of HeLa cells via membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To assess the effect of specific lipids, Bodipy-labeled analogues of sphingolipids (Cer, SM C<sub>5</sub> and SM C<sub>12</sub>), GSLs [ganglioside GM1 and lactosyl ceramide (LacCer)], Chol and phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) were incorporated into liposomes [DOPE/Dotap/Bodipy-tagged lipid (47.5/47.5/5)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Csiszár et al., 2010</xref>). Liposomes had diameters between 160 and 300 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and an average fluorescence per liposome of 600 a.u (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The Bodipy fluorophore allowed us to track and quantify lipid incorporation in the PM and study their colocalization with caveolae components. To ensure the observed effects were not significantly influenced by the fluorophore motif, the results were verified with unlabeled lipids. Liposome fusion with the PM of HeLa cells occurred immediately upon contact and the lipids were rapidly distributed throughout the basal membrane, as observed using live cell total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>, exemplified by LacCer). The total fluorescence attributed to the Bodipy motif increased uniformly in various regions of interest (ROIs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, line graph). Lipid incorporation was similar for all cells in the population and the even distribution of lipids in the PM was observed for all lipid species (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref> and 4A–D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). Occasionally, bright stable spots and some enrichment of lipids in cellular protrusions were observed independent of lipid species.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rapid insertion of Bodipy-labeled lipids into the PM of living cells using fusogenic liposomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fusogenic liposomes are used to insert Bodipy-labeled lipids into the PM.

The method was verified by altering the lipid composition using myriocin (24 h treatment) or sphingomyelinase (SMase, 2 h treatment), which are known to lower the levels of sphingomyelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gulshan et al., 2013</xref>). Analysis showed that these treatments drastically decreased SM(d18:1/16:0) levels, the major endogenous species of SM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Next, we incubated cells with fusogenic liposomes containing Bodipy-labeled LacCer or SM C<sub>12</sub>, and analyzed the lipid composition by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). The detected levels of endogenous LacCer(d18:1/16:0) and SM(d18:1/16:0) in untreated control samples were in agreement with previously reported levels in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kjellberg et al., 2014</xref>). In samples treated with fusogenic liposomes, the incorporated Bodipy-lipids could be specifically detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). The incorporated levels of Bodipy-LacCer and Bodipy-SM C<sub>12</sub> per 400 000 cells were measured to be 4.2 pmol and 2.7 pmol, respectively, (i.e., 6.3 × 10<sup>6</sup> and 4.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> lipids/cell) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To assess the incorporation efficiency of Chol, deuterium-labeled Chol, d7-Chol, was included in fusogenic liposomes. GC-MS/MS analysis revealed that d7-Chol was incorporated to similar levels as Bodipy-labeled LacCer and SM C<sub>12</sub>. Given that the PM of these HeLa cells harbor around 7 × 10<sup>9</sup> lipids/cell (see Materials and methods section for details), the levels of Bodipy- and d7-labeled lipids detected by mass spectrometry led to a 0.02–0.09% increase in specific labeled lipids and a 0.4–1.6% of total lipids.</p><p>To determine the rate of incorporation of the different Bodipy-labeled lipid species, we used spinning disk microscopy in a central confocal plane of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Quantitative analysis of lipid incorporation into the PM over time revealed similar levels for most lipids ranging from 1900 to 4800 arbitrary units at 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The variation in incorporation rates between the different lipids may result from differences in the fusogenicity of the liposomes or differences in the PM-turnover of each particular lipid. To monitor the lateral diffusion of the Bodipy-lipids within the PM, cells were incubated with fusogenic liposomes, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in a defined ROI was monitored. All lipids showed similar smooth and rapid recovery after bleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Although, as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kang et al., 2019</xref>), the diffusion rate and mobile fraction of specific lipids displayed slight variations when measured by FRAP in living cells.</p><p>To conclude, the use of fusogenic liposomes enabled rapid incorporation of approximately 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> specific lipids into the PM per living cell over 10 min. To put this into context, we estimated that each cell contains around 300 caveolae, based on our staining and tracking data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>), comprising around 0.1% of the surface area. Caveolae are approximately 60 nm in diameter, and each lipid occupies 0.62 Å. Therefore <italic>ca.</italic> 10 × 10<sup>6</sup> lipids are contained within the caveolae, of which 50% is Chol. This means that the amount of specific incorporated lipids in our system is about half of the total amount of lipids contained within caveolae. The immediate addition of extra lipids to the PM did not result in a detectable effect on the cell volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Single particle tracking reveals caveolae dynamics in living cells</title><p>We next aimed to elucidate whether lipids are involved in controlling the balance between stable and dynamic caveolae at the PM, and if effects could be attributed to individual lipid species. To visualize caveolae, we generated a stable mammalian Flp-In T-Rex HeLa cell line expressing Cav1-mCherry, hereafter named Cav1-mCh HeLa cells. Expression of Cav1-mCherry was induced by doxycycline (Dox) at endogenous Cav1 levels, resulting in similar caveolae numbers to those without induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A–C</xref>). Using TIRF microscopy and single-particle tracking, we determined the time each Cav1-mCh positive punctuate structure spent at the PM (track duration) and the speed of an object (track mean speed) in, or close to, the PM (see Materials and method section for detailed tracking parameters and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Given the previously reported surface dynamics of caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pelkmans and Zerial, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boucrot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mohan et al., 2015</xref>), we postulated that stable caveolae will have a long duration and low speed, limited by their lateral diffusion in the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, ‘Stable’). Caveolae that scission off or re-fuse with the PM during the recording period will give rise to shorter mean duration and increased mean speed. Caveolae that remain close to the surface and undergo rounds of scission and fusion, will result in an overall increase in tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Caveolae disassembly will give rise to shorter tracks but no increase in mean speed and importantly a major loss of tracks. We did indeed observe a clear correlation between the track duration and track mean speed where, in general, short tracks exhibited higher speeds, whereas long tracks displayed lower speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Although the numbers of caveolae in each cell were similar at the beginning and end of the recording, we found that the number of tracks far exceeded the caveolae numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This was expected as surface adjacent caveolae would give rise to several tracks. However, a drop in the fluorescent signal just below the set threshold value, would also contribute to a divided track, resulting in an overestimation of short tracks versus long tracks. Therefore, we did not consider the average duration and speed as absolute, but rather used them to compare between experimental runs with differing conditions. To verify that the tracking was sensitive to differences in caveolae dynamics, we depleted cells of EHD2, which has been shown to stabilize caveolae to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morén et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stoeber et al., 2012</xref>). Particle tracking analysis showed that the pool of tracks with high speed increased, while the pool with low speed decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B’</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). When the average track duration was considered, this translated into a 0.65 fold decrease compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), proving that the particle tracking was indeed sensitive enough to register caveolae scission induced by removal of EHD2.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Chol and GSLs induce surface release of caveolae via an EHD2-dependent mechanism.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of maximum projected confocal z-stacks of Cav1-mCh HeLa cells.

Following incorporation of PE, caveolae dynamics remained unchanged, showing that the fusion of liposomes did not obstruct caveolae dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In comparison to controls, Bodipy-labeled GSLs (GM1 and LacCer) and Chol significantly reduced the lifetime of caveolae at the cell surface as indicated by decreased track duration and increased mean speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video3">3</xref>). For example, LacCer treatment increased the number of fast moving and short-lived caveolae versus slow moving and long-lived species, which was comparable to the EHD2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>A direct comparison between LacCer and Cer revealed that Cer did not enhance caveolae dynamics in a similar fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). No difference was observed in the number of caveolae present in the PM before and after the addition of liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>), showing that caveolae were not disassembled and indicating that most of the scissioned caveolae remained surface adjacent. To verify that the effect was not an artifact of the Bodipy label, we treated cells with liposomes containing either unlabeled LacCer [(LacCer(d18:1/16:0)], unlabeled Chol or unlabeled SM [(SM(d18:1/16:0)] and quantified the track duration. This showed that the unlabeled lipids had the same effect on the caveolae dynamics as the corresponding Bodipy-labeled analogues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Interestingly, when cells were treated with unlabeled SM or Bodipy-SM C<sub>12</sub>, most of the caveolae were stable at the PM. This was characterized by a dramatic increase in track duration, and a reduction of the track mean speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). However, incorporation of SM C<sub>5</sub> did not significantly alter caveolae dynamics, suggesting that the fatty acid chain length was important for this effect. Even at three times the amount (3x SM C<sub>5</sub>) to control for incorporation rate, no effect was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). To further investigate the role of SM, we analyzed caveolae duration following SMase treatment, and found that this resulted in a decreased track duration, in agreement with a surface-stabilizing role for this lipid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Chol and GSLs induce scission of caveolae via mechanisms that are counteracted by EHD2</title><p>EHD2 normally localizes with the majority of surface associated caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morén et al., 2012</xref>). We aimed to address whether the increased caveolae dynamics induced by either Chol or GSLs were caused by their PM release, as characterized by loss of the stabilizing protein EHD2. Therefore, we treated Cav1-mCh HeLa cells with the fusogenic liposomes and visualized endogenous EHD2 using indirect immunofluorescent labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These experiments revealed that incorporation of GM1, LacCer, or Chol into the PM led to a significantly lower amount of EHD2 that colocalized with Cav1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, scatter plot). These data suggest that the caveolae release induced by increased PM levels of LacCer and Chol is results from loss of EHD2-mediated stabilization. Conversely, Cer and SM C<sub>12</sub>, as well as its short chain analogue SM C<sub>5</sub>, did not appear to have any significant effect on the association of EHD2 with Cav1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, scatter plot). Furthermore, following lipid treatment, the majority of caveolae remained associated with cavin1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To verify that caveolae at the cell surface were not disassembled via detachment of cavin1, we compared the colocalization of Cav1-mCh with cavin1-GFP before and after lipid treatment using TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). These data showed that there was no significant change in the number of cavin-decorated caveolae following incorporation of any of the specific lipids, revealing that no disruption of the caveolae coat, and subsequent release of cavin1 occurred.</p><p>As increased scission of caveolae from the cell surface results in more mobile intracellular caveolar vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stoeber et al., 2012</xref>), we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments to investigate the recovery rate of caveolae. Addition of LacCer resulted in more mobile caveolae inside the cells in comparison with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). The recovery rate after LacCer addition was similar to the rate in EHD2-depleted cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref> for protein levels). This further supported the hypothesis that lipid incorporation drives caveolae scission. When LacCer or Chol were added to EHD2-depleted cells we found that the caveolae track duration was not further reduced in comparison with EHD2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref> for control siRNA). These results supported our hypothesis that the lipid-induced effect on caveolae dynamics resulted from loss of surface stability mediated by EHD2, and implied that EHD2 controls the stability of caveolae in response to lipid composition.</p><p>To test whether increased levels of EHD2 could restore caveolae stability after lipid treatment, we transiently expressed blue fluorescent protein (BFP)-tagged EHD2 in Cav1-mCh HeLa cells. Analysis of TIRF live cell movies showed that EHD2-BFP positive caveolae were highly stable compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In the presence of EHD2-BFP, the destabilizing effect seen for GM1, LacCer, and Chol was abolished, as demonstrated by negligible changes in track duration compared to control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This suggested that excess levels of EHD2 were capable of restricting the effect of excess Chol and GSLs. In addition, tracking of caveolae in cells stably expressing Cav1-mCh and EHD2-BFP showed that most caveolae were positive for EHD-BFP (96%) and that this population was more stable than the population lacking EHD2-BFP (4%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). Surprisingly, SM C<sub>12</sub> had an additive effect and led to predominantly stable caveolae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), suggesting that here the stabilizing effect of SM is increased in the presence of excess levels of EHD2. Furthermore, EHD2 could partly restrict the increase in caveolae dynamics observed in response to SMase treatment and decreased SM levels in the PM. These data suggested that SM and EHD2 both stabilize caveolae, but perhaps via alternate mechanistic pathways.</p><p>To test whether EHD2-mediated suppression of the lipid effect relied on multiple rounds of EHD2 assembly and disassembly at caveolae, we overexpressed a BFP-tagged ATP-cycle mutant, EHD2-I157Q. The increased ATP hydrolysis rate of this mutant leads to stable association of EHD2-I157Q to caveolae and a slower exchange rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daumke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stoeber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoernke et al., 2017</xref>). We observed that, when co-expressed in Cav1-mCh cells, both EHD2-I157Q and EHD2 stabilized caveolae at the PM to similar extents, independent of treatment with either LacCer or Chol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E</xref>). This verified that stable assembly, but not disassembly of EHD2, is necessary to stabilize caveolae.</p><p>To clarify whether, in order to have a stabilizing role, EHD2 had to be caveolae-associated prior to lipid addition, fluorescently labeled, purified EHD2 (EHD2-647) was microinjected into Cav1-mCh HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Within 20 min, EHD2-647 colocalized with Cav1, confirming that the microinjected protein was indeed recruited to caveolae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>). Next, we tested whether an acute injection of EHD2-647 could rescue the effect on caveolae dynamics caused by LacCer. Strikingly, we found that exogenously added EHD2 stabilized the caveolae to the same extent as the overexpressed EHD2, demonstrating that increased levels of EHD2 can acutely reverse the increased mobility of caveolae induced by lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Chol and SM are sequestered within caveolae</title><p>As SM C<sub>12</sub> increased the surface stability of caveolae, while GSLs and Chol promoted scission, we investigated whether there was a differential accumulation of these lipids within caveolae at the PM. We treated Cav1-mCh HeLa cells with fusogenic liposomes and followed the distribution of Bodipy-labeled lipids using live cell TIRF microscopy. After 15 min, LacCer, Chol , and SM C<sub>12</sub> lipids were found to colocalize with Cav1-mCh positive structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">2</xref>). Data analysis was hindered by high caveolae mobility following addition of LacCer and Chol, and the extent of colocalization could not be quantified. To circumvent this, we overexpressed EHD2-BFP to stabilize caveolae at the PM. Interestingly, nearly 80% of caveolae positive for EHD2 were also positive for LacCer, Chol, and SM C<sub>12</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3">Figure 4—videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video4">4</xref>).

The Bodipy-LacCer signal reappeared rapidly at precisely the bleached spot positive for Cav1-mCh, with a close to quantitative fluorescence recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>). This indicated that the lipid diffused freely throughout the PM and, following photobleaching, re-accumulated quickly within caveolae. In comparison, Bodipy-Chol recovered much slower with 60% of the initial signal being restored after 5 min acquisition time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This showed that there is a large immobile pool of Chol in caveolae that is sequestered from the rest of the PM.

However, the recovery rate of the SM C<sub>12</sub> within caveolae was very low, showing that SM C<sub>12</sub> is also sequestered in caveolae in the presence of EHD2. Our data suggest that LacCer, Chol, and SM C<sub>12</sub> are highly enriched in caveolae and, while the lateral diffusion of LacCer in and out of caveolae is high, Chol and SM C<sub>12</sub> are restrained to this invagination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Chol accumulation reduces the caveolae diameter in 3T3-L1 adipocytes</title><p>To elucidate whether lipid accumulation affected the overall morphology of surface connected caveolae in Cav1-mCh HeLa cells, we analyzed their ultrastructure in cells overexpressing EHD2.

Furthermore, the bulb width was also significantly smaller resulting in more drop-shaped caveolae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>´). Quantitative analysis of the caveolae population where a clear surface connected neck could not be detected allowed measurement of the surface area of caveolae. Comparison to control cells showed that area, as well as bulb width, decreased following Chol addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–E</xref>´). Furthermore, Chol incorporation resulted in a more homogeneous caveolae population in terms of size and dimensions. These data suggested that an acute increase in Chol levels in the PM of 3T3-adipocytes induced alterations in the caveolae coat architecture, resulting in reduced neck diameter and a smaller more uniform bulb diameter.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>GSLs are internalized to the endosomal system independently of Cav1, while Chol is predominantly trafficked to lipid droplets</title><p>Next, we aimed to address whether caveolae scission significantly contributed to internalization and trafficking of lipids in our system as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Puri et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Lay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shvets et al., 2015</xref>). We used fusogenic liposomes to investigate whether Bodipy-labeled LacCer or Chol were internalized and trafficked through the endosomal pathway following incorporation into the PM. To mark early endosomes (EE), Rab5-BFP was transiently expressed in Cav1-mCh HeLa cells. Cells were incubated with fusogenic liposomes for either 15 min or 3 h, followed by fixation and EE localization was quantified. We observed localization of LacCer to the EE but not to the Golgi, contrasting previous studies using BSA-Bodipy-LacCer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Puri et al., 2001</xref>). After 15 min, more than half of the EE were positive for LacCer (55%) compared to only 6% for Chol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). After 3 h, the number of LacCer-positive EE remained constant, whereas the EE positive for Chol had increased to 18% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The amount of caveolae that colocalized with EE was very low, both before and after treatment with lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To test if caveolae were involved in lipid trafficking to the EE, the experiments were repeated in cells depleted of Cav1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>). After 15 min incubation time, 55% and 10% of EE were positive for LacCer and Chol, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>). This suggested that while caveolae did not seem to influence the efficiency of LacCer or Chol trafficking to endosomes, loss of Cav1 resulted in an increased amount of Chol accumulating in this compartment. Our data indicate that caveolae serve as buffers or sensors of GSL and Chol concentrations rather than endocytic vesicles.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>GSLs are internalized to the endosomal system independent of Cav1, while Chol is predominantly trafficked to lipid droplets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cav1-mCh HeLa cells expressing Rab5-BFP were incubated with Bodipy-labeled LacCer or Chol for 15 min.

To determine whether Chol localized to lipid droplets (LD) as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Lay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shvets et al., 2015</xref>), we incubated HeLa cells with fusogenic liposomes and visualized LD using LipidTOX-DR. On average, 85% of LDs were positive for Chol after both 15 min and 3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–H</xref>), and similar levels of Chol-positive LD were detected in cells lacking Cav1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). While Chol extensively localized to LD, we did not observe LacCer associated with LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–I</xref>). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that excess Chol in the PM is trafficked directly to LD in a process that does not require caveolae per se, and that the levels of Chol taking an alternative route to EE increase in the absence of caveolae.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>While PM turnover is typically regulated in a tightly controlled manner, marginal changes in its composition are associated with severe diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harayama and Riezman, 2018</xref>). It has been proposed that caveolae play a major role in preserving lipid homeostasis via sensing and buffering PM properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pilch and Liu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</xref>). However, studies detailing how lipid composition influences cellular phenotypes have been hindered by a lack of methods to selectively manipulate the PM lipid composition; especially with regard to introducing specific lipids. To address this, we applied an approach for studying these systems in living cells that employs DOPE/DOTAP-based liposomes capable of mediating highly effective fusion processes with cell membranes to deliver their lipid cargoes. Such liposomes have previously been used as nanocarriers to deliver intracellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kube et al., 2017</xref>). Our methodology successfully delivered specific lipids into the PM bilayer of living cells with high efficiency. These rapid fusion events have allowed us to report the first studies observing caveolae response to acute changes in PM lipid composition, as well as lipid exchange itself in the caveolae bulb. Furthermore, the use of labelled lipids allowed us to measure their incorporation relative to endogenous levels. Our results demonstrate the power of this approach for studying caveolae dynamics and we foresee that our methodology will also be a useful tool outside of this framework.</p><p>Our work shows that the surface association of caveolae is highly sensitive to changes in the PM lipid composition. An acute increase in the levels of Chol and GSLs, which were found to specifically accumulate in caveolae, dramatically increased caveolae mobility. These caveolae traveled at higher speeds, their PM duration was shorter and they also displayed reduced levels of EHD2, a protein indicative of PM-associated caveolae. Therefore, we conclude that accumulation of Chol and GSLs in caveolae triggers surface release of caveolae. In agreement with this, EM analysis revealed that the caveolae neck diameter was reduced in cells with elevated Chol levels. Our findings are consistent with previous reports suggesting that BSA-LacCer and Chol decrease the number of caveolae associated to the PM and enhance their mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Lay et al., 2006</xref>). Based on the present study, increased caveolae mobility is a direct result of accumulation of these lipids in caveolae. As our methodology allowed us to determine the levels of specifically incorporated lipids, we found that rapid, yet relatively small increases in specific lipids can affect caveolae dynamics. Because caveolae immediately responded to these changes in bilayer composition, we propose that they serve as PM sensors, not only for membrane tension, but also for lipid composition.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that a threshold concentration of Chol is required to maintain caveolae integrity and proposed that assembly and disassembly is in a dynamic equilibrium dependent on Chol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hailstones et al., 1998</xref>). This is also in line with our experiments showing that excess Chol drives caveolae assembly towards scission and that Chol was indeed found to accumulate in caveolae when these structures were restrained to the surface by EHD2 overexpression. Furthermore, our methodology enabled, for the first time, measurement of lipid lateral flow in and out of the caveolae bulb using FRAP. Comparing the FRAP recovery of Bodipy-LacCer and Bodipy-Chol, which were both enriched in caveolae, showed that while photobleached Bodipy-LacCer was almost fully exchanged via lateral diffusion after 2 min, photobleached Bodipy-Chol was only exchanged by 50%. This showed that Chol was sequestered in caveolae, potentially through its interaction to Cav1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</xref>). In contrast, Bodipy-Cer, which lacks the disaccharide structural motif of LacCer, did not accumulate in caveolae and had no effect on their dynamics, which is in agreement with earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharma et al., 2004</xref>). Precisely how the lactosyl group mediates the caveolae-enrichment of LacCer and how this in turn drives caveolae scission is not clear.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that SM and Bodipy-SM C<sub>12</sub>, but not Bodipy-SM C<sub>5</sub>, dramatically increased caveolae stability, in terms of both speed and duration. This suggests that the chain length is important and might influence their interactions with for example Chol. SM has been shown to sequester a pool of Chol in the PM, which, together with an accessible and inaccessible pool, aid in the sensing of the Chol levels in the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Das et al., 2014</xref>). The elevated levels of SM may alter the levels of SM-sequestered Chol, thereby affecting caveolae stability. In agreement with this, we found that a dramatic reduction of SM using SMase increased caveolae dynamics. SM was highly enriched in caveolae, especially in cells with elevated EHD2 levels. This shows that this lipid has a direct role in caveolae, but the mechanism by which SM stabilizes caveolae requires more detailed investigation.</p><p>Although an area of extensive research, a consensus on the exact mechanism of caveolae scission has not yet been reached. Our observations suggest a model, where the accumulation of lipids in caveolae reduces the neck diameter, leading to scission. We speculate that this could be caused by increased access of scission-mediating molecules like dynamin to the neck, or that that these lipids promote assembly of Cav1 and cavins, which drive curvature towards scission. The lipid-driven assembly of Cav1 may be an intrinsically unstable system, eventually resulting in scission if no restraining forces are applied. This indicates that scission is tightly coupled to, and a continuum of, caveolae biogenesis. In line with this, expression of caveolin in bacterial systems induced the formation of internal caveolae-like vesicles containing caveolin so-called heterologous caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Walser et al., 2012</xref>). The scission step could also involve lipid phase separation. A similar mechanism has previously been proposed but not experimentally validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lenz et al., 2009</xref>), and our new data show that a locally increased concentration of GSLs and Chol in caveolae may induce phase separation and therefore facilitate budding and scission of caveolae. Consistent with this, model membrane studies have shown that sterol-induced phase separation can promote membrane scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roux et al., 2005</xref>). Of interest, in other systems GSLs and Chol have been suggested to play a crucial role in membrane nanodomain budding to generate intracellular transport carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schuck and Simons, 2004</xref>).</p><p>EHD2 has been shown to confine caveolae to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morén et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stoeber et al., 2012</xref>). In the current study, we acutely altered the lipid composition to induce caveolae scission and analyzed the immediate role of EHD2. We found that removal of EHD2, while at the same time changing the lipid composition, did not have an additive effect on caveolae dynamics. However, excess levels of EHD2 from overexpression or direct microinjection, could suppress the effect of the altered lipid composition. This suggests that an increased assembly rate of EHD2 at the caveolae neck is necessary and sufficient to drive the equilibrium towards stable surface association of caveolae. We conclude that oligomers of EHD2 might provide a restraining force that prevents reduction of the neck diameter and thereby inhibits phase separation or assembly of scission-mediating proteins. Similarly, EHD2 would prevent flattening of caveolae and thus, act to stabilize the typical bulb-shape of caveolae. Our data also indicate that EHD2 could limit lipid diffusion of Chol and SM over the caveolae neck thereby influencing caveolae stability. Therefore, EHD2 would act as a key regulator of caveolae dynamics in response to changes in both PM lipid composition and membrane tension.</p><p>Caveolae have been proposed to play an integral role in intracellular lipid trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Puri et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Lay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shvets et al., 2015</xref>). This prompted us to examine the cellular fate of our labelled lipids. We found that while Bodipy-LacCer was internalized via the endosomal system, Chol predominately localized to LD. Importantly, and in contrast to previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shvets et al., 2015</xref>), we found that loss of caveolae did not majorly influence the trafficking of these lipids in HeLa cells. Based on this, we propose that caveolae should not be considered as vehicles for internalization of lipids, but rather that lipid composition influences caveolae biogenesis and dynamics. Together with the caveolae coat components, it is feasible that sequestered lipids may control formation and define the size and curvature of these PM invaginations. This, together with our data showing that Chol is enriched and sequestered in caveolae, implies that caveolae could serve as reservoirs of Chol in the PM, thereby buffering the surface levels of this lipid.</p><p>Together, our findings indicate that the dynamic behavior of caveolae is highly sensitive to changes in PM lipid composition. We demonstrate that, following incorporation into the lipid bilayer, GSLs and Chol accumulate in caveolae, which promotes scission of these membrane invaginations from the cell surface. The current study redefines the fundamental understanding of how caveolae dynamics are governed by biologically relevant lipids and will be of future relevance linking caveolae malfunction with lipid disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

After 16 h, 10 μl of MSTFA was added, the sample was shaken and left to react for 1 h at room temperature. A volume of 10 μl of methyl stearate (15 ng/μl in heptane) was added before analysis. For d7-cholesterol quantification, 1 μl of the derivatized sample was injected by an Agilent 7693 autosampler, in splitless mode into an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph equipped with a multimode inlet (MMI) and 10 m x 0.18 mm fused silica capillary column with a chemically bonded 0.18 μm DB 5 MS UI stationary phase (J and W Scientific). The injector temperature was 250°C. The carrier gas flow rate through the column was 1 ml min<sup>−1</sup>, the column temperature was held at 60°C for 1 min, then increased by 60°C min<sup>-1</sup> to 300°C and held there for 2 min. The column effluent is introduced into the electron impact (EI) ion source of an Agilent 7000C QQQ mass spectrometer. The thermal AUX 2 (transfer line) and the ion source temperatures were 250°C and 230°C, respectively. Ions were generated by a 70 eV electron beam at an emission current of 35 μA and analyzed in dMRM-mode. The solvent delay was set to 3 min.

The applied algorithm was based on Brownian motion with max distance travelled of 0.8 μm and a max gap size of 4. Experiments where cavin1-GFP or EHD2 (wt and mutant) was either transiently expressed or depleted were performed and analyzed the same way. Colocalization of cavin1-GFP or EHD2 (wt and mutant) to Cav1-mCh was quantified with Imaris software. Within a ROI, spots were created in one channel (e.g., red channel) and the second channel (e.g., blue channel) was masked. The masked spots show only colocalized red and blue spots and the percentage was correlated to the original channel. Analysis of the dynamic behavior of caveolae positive for or lacking EHD2-BFP was performed using double Flp-In EHD2-BFP Cav1-mCh HeLa cells.

Your article has been reviewed Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.

It has been technically challenging to study in detail the effect of PM lipids on caveolar structures. Here, Hubert et al. present the original use of fusogenic liposomes to perturb the lipid composition of PMs and monitor changes in caveolae structures. All three reviewers were supportive and agreed that this work was an interesting contribution to this field. However, as listed below, they did raise several concerns that will require additional experiments and/or explanations in the text.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the Abstract, the authors say that &quot;cholesterol and glycosphingolipids specifically accumulate in caveolae, which decreases their neck diameter and drives their scission from the cell surface.&quot; The data supporting the scission seems to be the reduced track duration. However, the end of tracking does not necessarily mean the scission from cell surface and could be explained by disassembly into a flat membrane. Either rephrase or provide data that distinguishes between these possibilities.</p><p>2) In the Abstract, the authors say that &quot;lipid-induced scission was counteracted by the ATPase EHD2. We propose that lipid accumulation in caveolae generates an intrinsically unstable domain prone to scission if not balanced by the restraining force of EHD2 at the neck.&quot; This requires further clarification. How does the EHD2 counteracted with the imbalance of lipid? The importance of the ATPase activity of EHD2 might also be better analyzed with the ATPase deficient mutant in addition to I157Q mutant.</p><p>3) The addition of lipids via fusogenic liposomes is the fundamental basis of the study and needs to be thoroughly characterized. Why is the lipid distribution by TIRF in Figure 1B homogenous but not in Figure 1F? How does this non-homogeneous distribution overlap with Cav1 spots? Does homogeneity of insertion vary for different lipids? Are lipid expression levels the same for different cells in the same population?</p><p>4) Caveolae dynamics are inferred from TIRF imaging of Cav1-mCherry. A key aspect of this approach is how caveolae are defined from Cav1 fluorescent spots, which needs to be more clearly defined in the text. The text states a set threshold was applied to define caveolae Cav1 spots but the Materials and methods section indicates that spots larger than 0.4 µm diameter were selected. Why was this size limit selected (caveolae are &lt;100 nm and diffraction limit is ~200-250nm)? Was no intensity threshold applied? What is the intensity distribution of large vs small spots? To what extent is Cav1-mCherry expression similar between cells and how robust is the application of &quot;caveolae&quot; selection criteria between cells? From the movies, the number of bright large spots clearly varies between cells. If these are the ones the authors are considering to be caveolae then how to explain that some cells have so few caveolae? And how to exclude that these structures are rosettes, associated with EHD2 expression? How can the authors exclude the possibility that the changes in mobility they are seeing relate not to caveolae scission but to rosette fragmentation? Please include figures and videos showing the spots selected for study, along with superimposed tracks. A clear discussion of criteria used to assign Cav1 spots as individual caveolae should be included.</p><p>5) The fusogenic liposomes allow for the incorporation of lipid species specifically enriched in caveolae such as cholesterol, sphingomyelin, ceramides and glycosphingolipids. To prove that the regulation of caveolae stability is specific for caveolar lipids, it would be nice if the authors could show that caveolae dynamics are not perturbed after the addition of other phospholipids, found outside caveolae, such as PC, PA, PG. In parallel, the tracking experiments only focus on Cav1 dynamics upon liposome fusion (Figure 2 and Figure 3E-H). But it is not clear whether other non-caveolar PM protein (clathrin HC for instance) dynamics would be changed after addition of the selected lipids? These data would strongly support the specificity of the described phenomenon.</p><p>6) Figure 2A presents a schematic of how track durations are interpreted to reflect caveolae dynamics. The basis for these classifications is not clearly presented nor is it clear why they are required. Indeed, why even introduce the surface adjacent class which according to the quantification in Figure 2B is very much a minority of the tracks detected. The data in Figure 2B clearly shows that EDH2 siRNA reduces the number of tracks with slow track speed for essentially all track durations, clearly reflecting the increased scission of caveolae upon EDH2 knockdown. In light of authors concerns with respect to reliability of track duration, why not just use the simple classification of track speed used in 2B to analyze the effects of lipids on caveolae dynamics.</p><p>7) The effect of SM-C12 addition to EDH2 overexpressing cells is interesting. What is the effect of sphingomyelinase treatment on EDH2 OE cells?</p><p>8) Please include the data for control siRNA in Figure 3C and Figure 3F.</p><p>9) Some of the lipids exhibit less efficient incorporation (SM C5 and C12 and to a lesser extent Cer). Since all experiments are done with the same amount of liposomes, this could explain why tracking parameters (Figure 3D, F) are not different from control condition. Will adding 3 times more SM C5 perturb caveolae dynamics?</p><p>10) Is the lipid-induced caveolae scission purely driven by lipids through membrane curvature perturbations or is it mediated by membrane pinching proteins? The authors should test the involvement of dynamin2, which is known to associate with the neck of caveolae and favor their internalization. Less EHD2 is colocalized with Cav1-mCherry 1h after the fusion of liposomes containing GM1, LacCer or Chol but is Dynamin2 found more often with Cav1 positive structures under these conditions?</p><p>11) The diffusion of lipids on caveolae is an important part of this manuscript. Please include this point in the Abstract. Please highlight a comparison of FRAP at caveolae to that of the bulk PM is necessary for discussing the diffusion of lipids in caveolae and in bulk PM. In Figure 4D, the FRAP curves are of ROIs, but these ROIs are not specified.</p><p>12) In Figure 4C, it is not clear what the bleach zone is and in Figure 4D why is this analysis not extended to other lipids? Similar for the EM studies in Figure 5, why are these not performed for other lipids, in particular SM-C12?</p><p>13) Please clarify the difference between the upper and lower panels in Figure 5B and 5C. Also, clarify why is meant by different appearance between the upper and lower panels. The shape measurements were done only for the cholesterol-supplemented cells, this analysis should also be carried out for the LacCer-supplemented cells.</p><p>14) In Figure 5, if caveolae scission was enhanced, then some of them would go to endosomes. Is this the case? Some control experiments using, for instance, Bodipy-PE would be informative.</p><p>15) The results of Figure 6 show no obvious effect of Cav1 depletion on endosomal localization of Bodipy-lipids. So, after scission what is the fate of lipid filled internalized caveolae? Do they stay in the vicinity of PM and fuse back? What is the amount/fraction of lipids (LacCer) found in Rab5 positive structures after 15 minutes and 3 hours? Also, the possibility of caveolae flattening induced by lipid loading of the PM should be assayed. Figure 3B shows colocalization of Cav1-mCh with endogenous Cavin1 in maximum z-projection of confocal images. The authors should also monitor Cav1-Cavin colocalization by TIRF and compare the number of Cav1 positive structure/dot colocalizing with Cavin1, before and after addition of fusogenic liposomes, and see if this condition triggers caveolae disappearance/disassembly (not internalization).</p><p>16) Experiments where lipid composition is changed in the opposite direction would enhance the arguments of this paper. It would be useful to compare the effects of cholesterol depletion, by methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment for example.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55038.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the Abstract, the authors say that &quot;cholesterol and glycosphingolipids specifically accumulate in caveolae, which decreases their neck diameter and drives their scission from the cell surface.&quot; The data supporting the scission seems to be the reduced track duration.

We have now added more experiments and further improved the schematic Figure 2A and clarified the text regarding how the different states of caveolae and how they would be reflected in our data. We have also improved the description of how caveolae were assigned and tracked (see also point 4). The data that support our conclusion on scission is presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3 together with supplemental figures and text. In brief, we have analyzed the number of tracks before and after treatment and saw no significant difference (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C), which would be expected if caveolae were disassembled. We have now also clarified the text regarding this. We have analyzed the duration and speed of caveolae and find that the duration is decreased while speed is increased following incorporation of glycosphingolipids and Chol. This is consistent with scission of caveolae and we also control for this by the analysis of EHD2 KO cells in which scission of caveolae is increased (Moren et al., 2012, Stoeber et al., 2012, Matthaeus et al., 2020). The increased speed would however not be consistent with disassembled caveolae.</p><p>We go on to test our hypothesis in Figure 3. In Figure 3A, we analyze if the treatment results in altered colocalization with EHD2 (would indicate surface release) and cavin1 (would indicate disassembly). We find that colocalization with EHD2, but not cavin1 is affected by glycosphingolipids and Chol supporting scission. We have now complemented the experiments with new data as suggested under point 15. To further assess this, we have now performed new experiments where we have analyzed the colocalization of cavin1 and Cav1 in live cells using TIRF before and after treatment. These data show that the colocalization between cavin1 and Cav1 is not altered following lipid incorporation again supporting that the detected effect is due to scission (See also response to comment 15).</p><p>Furthermore, as stated in the manuscript, caveolae scission would result in more mobile caveolae inside cells as previously shown. In Figure 3C we show that indeed lipid addition induces more mobile caveolae as does EHD2 depletion. Disassembly or flattening of caveolae would not result in this. We can also suppress the lipid-induced effect by overexpressing EHD2, which again indicates that the lipid-effect induces scission. To control for that the EHD2 expression is not due to secondary effect due to long term expression of EHD2, we microinject EHD2 and observe the same effect. In addition, in Figure 3E, if lipid addition and EHD2 depletion both induce caveolae scission then there should not be an additive effect of these treatments and indeed this is what we detect in Figure 3E.</p><p>In summary, given these experiments and results, we conclude that the increased dynamics of caveolae following increased levels of glycosphingolipids and Chol are most likely via scission of caveolae and therefore we have kept this statement in the Abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the Abstract, the authors say that &quot;lipid-induced scission was counteracted by the ATPase EHD2. We propose that lipid accumulation in caveolae generates an intrinsically unstable domain prone to scission if not balanced by the restraining force of EHD2 at the neck.&quot; This requires further clarification. How does the EHD2 counteracted with the imbalance of lipid? The importance of the ATPase activity of EHD2 might also be better analyzed with the ATPase deficient mutant in addition to I157Q mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have now more clearly presented the previously described mechanistic cycle for how EHD2 assemble and stabilize the caveolae neck to prevent scission and restrain caveolae to the cell surface via assembly into ring-like oligomeres (Daumke et al., 2007, Hoernke et al., 2017). Here, we go on to show that the accumulation of specific lipids in caveolae promote scission and destabilize their surface association but that this can be restrained by EHD2 (overexpression or microinjection). Therefore, we propose that the components (both proteins and lipids) building up the caveolae bulb creates a highly curved intrinsically unstable domain prone to scission, but that EHD2 provides a restraining force at the caveolae neck preventing scission.</p><p>Regarding the role of ATP-hydrolysis, we have previously generated and characterized different mutants of EHD2 and their effects on binding and hydrolysis of ATP as well as caveolae (Daumke et al., 2007, Moren et al., 2012). The ATPase impaired mutant T94A cause overassembly of EHD2 and membrane tubulation (since the regulatory ATPase activity is impaired). This mutant tubulates the caveolae neck, and it is therefore difficult to draw direct conclusions for how ATP-hydrolysis in itself influence the ability of EHD2 to stabilize lipid-induced scission of caveolae based on this mutant. In this work, we aimed to use the I157Q mutant, where ATP-hydrolysis is uncoupled to ATP-hydrolysis, which therefore form oligomeres with a slow dissociation time but without overassembly. This allows us to study if oligomerization of EHD2 at the caveolae neck is sufficient to prevent lipid induce scission or weather the stabilization requires constant adaptation of EHD2 assembly/dissassembly via rounds of ATP-hydrolysis. We have made this clearer in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The addition of lipids via fusogenic liposomes is the fundamental basis of the study and needs to be thoroughly characterized. Why is the lipid distribution by TIRF in Figure 1B homogenous but not in Figure 1F? How does this non-homogeneous distribution overlap with Cav1 spots?

The even distribution of lipids in the PM was observed for all lipid species (see data throughout manuscript). Occasionally, however, bright stable spots and some enrichment of lipids in cellular protrusions were observed independent of lipid species as was shown in Figure 1B. These structures did not colocalize with Cav-1. We have now changed Figure 1F in order not to cause confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Caveolae dynamics are inferred from TIRF imaging of Cav1-mCherry.

Caveolae from fixed and live cells were counted using the Imaris software and similar numbers of caveolae was identified showing that the application is reliable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And how to exclude that these structures are rosettes, associated with EHD2 expression? How can the authors exclude the possibility that the changes in mobility they are seeing relate not to caveolae scission but to rosette fragmentation?</p></disp-quote><p>We do see some spots that are larger and of greater intensity than others which could be rosettas or just caveolae close to each other. In the CLEM analysis of caveolae in Hela cells we do only rarely detect rosettas. However, using TIRF we don’t have the resolution to determine this. Occasionally, we have observed that one spot can break up into two spots although this is rare. We do not observe any increase in the number of caveolae spots following treatments which would be the case if many clusters or rosettas are fragmented. Furthermore, the observed increase in speed of caveolae following incorporation of Chol and sphingolipids is too fast to be explained by increased lateral diffusion of individual caveolae. Fragmentation of rosettas in terms of scission would be indistinguishable from scission of individual caveolae.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please include figures and videos showing the spots selected for study, along with superimposed tracks. A clear discussion of criteria used to assign Cav1 spots as individual caveolae should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>A detailed figure that outlines the method in Imaris software has been added for illustration of spot selection (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The fusogenic liposomes allow for the incorporation of lipid species specifically enriched in caveolae such as cholesterol, sphingomyelin, ceramides and glycosphingolipids. To prove that the regulation of caveolae stability is specific for caveolar lipids, it would be nice if the authors could show that caveolae dynamics are not perturbed after the addition of other phospholipids, found outside caveolae, such as PC, PA, PG. In parallel, the tracking experiments only focus on Cav1 dynamics upon liposome fusion (Figure 2 and Figure 3E-H). But it is not clear whether other non-caveolar PM protein (clathrin HC for instance) dynamics would be changed after addition of the selected lipids? These data would strongly support the specificity of the described phenomenon.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified in the text that we do not only analyze lipids known to be enriched in caveolae and that the precise lipidomics of caveolae is not known. The lipids in our study are carefully selected, where we use a glycerophospholipid PE (not caveolae enriched), glycosphingolipids LacCer and GM1 (proposed to be enriched), Ceramide (not enriched, but used to compare to glycosylated LacCer and GM1), sphingomyelin (proposed to be enriched) and Chol (proposed to be enriched). We agree that there are more lipids that could be interesting to study but that this would be out of the scope for this study.</p><p>We do not intend to claim that an altered lipid composition will specifically affect only caveolae dynamics. This could also affect for example clathrin coated pits (CCP), but, in order to be useful such studies would have to be put into context of CCP-formation and dynamics, which would require a complete design dedicated to such system. Such measurement would require setting up and controlling this system and performing all relevant controls to validate potential effects as we have now done for the caveolae system in this manuscript. Therefore, although interesting, we believe that this would need to be addressed in further studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 2A presents a schematic of how track durations are interpreted to reflect caveolae dynamics. The basis for these classifications is not clearly presented nor is it clear why they are required. Indeed, why even introduce the surface adjacent class which according to the quantification in Figure 2B is very much a minority of the tracks detected. The data in Figure 2B clearly shows that EDH2 siRNA reduces the number of tracks with slow track speed for essentially all track durations, clearly reflecting the increased scission of caveolae upon EDH2 knockdown. In light of authors concerns with respect to reliability of track duration, why not just use the simple classification of track speed used in 2B to analyze the effects of lipids on caveolae dynamics.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the classification was not clearly described, and we thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now reworked the schematic figure (Figure 2A) and the section of the text describing the classification. We also agree that the track speed should be used to analyze the effects on caveolae dynamics along with duration and have now clarified this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The effect of SM-C12 addition to EDH2 overexpressing cells is interesting. What is the effect of sphingomyelinase treatment on EDH2 OE cells?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this, we have performed new experiments analyzing the effects of SMase on caveolae dynamics when EHD2 is overexpressed. The data is presented in the text and in Figure 3F and shows that EHD2 can partly restrain the decreased duration and increased speed of caveolae induced by reduced SM-levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Please include the data for control siRNA in Figure 3C and Figure 3F.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the data for control siRNA in Figure 3C. We assume that the reviewer is referring to Figure 3E instead of F, and we would like to point out that the data for control siRNA is presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Some of the lipids exhibit less efficient incorporation (SM C5 and C12 and to a lesser extent Cer). Since all experiments are done with the same amount of liposomes, this could explain why tracking parameters (Figure 3D, F) are not different from control condition. Will adding 3 times more SM C5 perturb caveolae dynamics?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed experiments where 3 times more liposomes containing SMC5 has been added to cells. The incorporation of this lipid was thereby increased (Figure 2D), but yet no effect on the dynamics of caveolae was detected (Figure 2—figure supplement 2D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Is the lipid-induced caveolae scission purely driven by lipids through membrane curvature perturbations or is it mediated by membrane pinching proteins? The authors should test the involvement of dynamin2, which is known to associate with the neck of caveolae and favor their internalization. Less EHD2 is colocalized with Cav1-mCherry 1h after the fusion of liposomes containing GM1, LacCer or Chol but is Dynamin2 found more often with Cav1 positive structures under these conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that this is a very interesting question. However, it will require very far-reaching mechanistic studies to elucidate this in order not to jump the conclusions. We are performing an extensive study of the role of dynamin2 in caveolae scission in collaboration with several research groups. This work is still in progress, but it is clear that our data are not fully consistent with current literature on the role of dynamin2, which is very interesting. We aim to put together a comprehensive study of dynamin2 and caveolae and therefore the addition of individual data regarding dynamin2 in the current manuscript would risk to cause distort the overall conclusions on the role of dynamin2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The diffusion of lipids on caveolae is an important part of this manuscript. Please include this point in the Abstract. Please highlight a comparison of FRAP at caveolae to that of the bulk PM is necessary for discussing the diffusion of lipids in caveolae and in bulk PM. In Figure 4D, the FRAP curves are of ROIs, but these ROIs are not specified.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, these are very good suggestions, and we have now specified the ROIs where recovery curves are measured and included the comparison of the recovery in caveolae and in the surrounding PM (Figure 4E and Figure 4—figure supplement 3). We agree that this is an important part of the manuscript and have added lipid diffusion and sequestering to the Abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) In Figure 4C, it is not clear what the bleach zone is and in Figure 4D why is this analysis not extended to other lipids? Similar for the EM studies in Figure 5, why are these not performed for other lipids, in particular SM-C12?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We have now made a clearer presentation of the bleached zone and the ROIs where the recovery is analyzed. We have now also extended the analysis to include SM C<sub>12</sub>, which is also heavily enriched in caveolae in EHD2 overexpressing cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 3). See also response to point 11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Please clarify the difference between the upper and lower panels in Figure 5B and 5C. Also, clarify why is meant by different appearance between the upper and lower panels. The shape measurements were done only for the cholesterol-supplemented cells, this analysis should also be carried out for the LacCer-supplemented cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not clearly describing the difference between upper and lower panels. This has now been added to the figure legend. We have also further explained how we use these data to quantify either the caveolae neck or the caveolae surface area.</p><p>The adipocyte cells were used as a system, where we can address the effect of Chol in a quantitative way since these cells are physiologically important for Chol homeostasis, the caveolea are enriched in Chol (Örtegren et.al., 2004), and these cells have numerous caveolae at the cell surface. Adipocyte cells do not and contain detectable levels of LacCer (Örtegren et.al., 2004). Therefore, we have not included analysis of LacCer incorporation since interpretation of such data, alongside Chol data, would be difficult given that we in that case would introduce a lipid not normally present in these cells. We have now clarified this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) In Figure 5, if caveolae scission was enhanced, then some of them would go to endosomes. Is this the case? Some control experiments using, for instance, Bodipy-PE would be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>In the CLEM analysis of HeLa cells, we did observe occasional internal red spots (Cav1-mCherry) where caveolae-like structures were fused to what appeared like endosomes. However, these were quite rare, preventing quantitative statements, and without further labelling the endosomal-like compartment could not be verified. We have therefore not included this in the manuscript. We have quantified the amount of caveolae that colocalize with Rab5 before and after lipid-treatment and we do not detect a significant change (Figure 6C). As mentioned in the text and in the response to comment 15, most of the scissioned caveolae appear to remain as surface adjacent caveolae following lipid-induced scission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) The results of Figure 6 show no obvious effect of Cav1 depletion on endosomal localization of Bodipy-lipids. So, after scission what is the fate of lipid filled internalized caveolae? Do they stay in the vicinity of PM and fuse back? What is the amount/fraction of lipids (LacCer) found in Rab5 positive structures after 15 minutes and 3 hours? Also, the possibility of caveolae flattening induced by lipid loading of the PM should be assayed. Figure 3B shows colocalization of Cav1-mCh with endogenous Cavin1 in maximum z-projection of confocal images. The authors should also monitor Cav1-Cavin colocalization by TIRF and compare the number of Cav1 positive structure/dot colocalizing with Cavin1, before and after addition of fusogenic liposomes, and see if this condition triggers caveolae disappearance/disassembly (not internalization).</p></disp-quote><p>We do not see an altered number of spots in cells where caveolae are dynamic due to lipid addition, which suggest that they fission off and stay in vicinity or refuse. We have now clarified this in the text. As suggested, we have now also added a quantification of the amount of caveolae that colocalize to Rab5-positive structures before and after lipid-treatment. The percentages are quite low and we do detect a significant change following lipid treatment.</p><p>Thanks for the nice suggestion to analyze effects on caveolae disassembly/flattening by monitoring colocalization of Cav1 and cavin1 by TIRF. We have now performed these experiments before and after lipid treatments and the data is presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. We find that there is no significant difference in the amount of colocalization following incorporation of any of the lipids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Experiments where lipid composition is changed in the opposite direction would enhance the arguments of this paper. It would be useful to compare the effects of cholesterol depletion, by methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment for example.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the manuscript, acute, but controlled decrease of the levels of specific lipids is technically challenging. We have been able to use SMase-treatmentto reduce the levels of SM (Figure 2G). We have also performed many experiments to optimize the use of MBCD (time and concentrations) to reduce the levels of Chol as suggested. However, treatment with MBCD results in an immediate and drastic shrinkage of the cells, whereby the tracking is obscured and impossible to quantify. Therefore, we are not confident to use this methodology to lower Chol levels and measure effects on caveolae dynamics.</p></body></sub-article></article>
