hypothesized to be relevant to the cause of human disease. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of PHP are just emerging and direct disease associations remain obscure. In a forward genetic screen for mutations that block PHP we identified <italic>mctp</italic> (Multiple C2 Domain Proteins with Two Transmembrane Regions). Here we show that MCTP localizes to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that elaborate throughout the soma, dendrites, axon and presynaptic terminal. Then, we demonstrate that MCTP functions downstream of presynaptic calcium influx with separable activities to stabilize baseline transmission, short-term release dynamics and PHP. Notably, PHP specifically requires the calcium coordinating residues in each of the three C2 domains of MCTP. Thus, we propose MCTP as a novel, ER-localized calcium sensor and a source of calcium-dependent feedback for the homeostatic stabilization of neurotransmission.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22904.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22904.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>homeostatic plasticity</kwd><kwd>presynaptic release</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>calcium sensor</kwd><kwd>bipolar</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS039313</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Graeme W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS097212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Graeme W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>MCTP is a novel presynaptic calcium sensor, resident within the endoplasmic reticulum, that is required for normal baseline neurotransmission, short-term synaptic plasticity and presynaptic homeostatic plasticity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Homeostasis can be defined as the ability of a cell,or system of cells, to detect a perturbation and, in the continued presence of that perturbation, generate a compensatory response that precisely restores baseline function. It is well established that homeostatic signaling stabilizes the active properties of excitable cells, including neurons and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis and Müller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Turrigiano, 2011</xref>). It is also generally accepted that neuronal homeostatic signaling will be essential for the life-long robustness of brain function and animal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2013</xref>). Indeed, numerous reviews have speculated about potential connections between homeostatic plasticity and psychiatric or neurological disease, including autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mullins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nelson and Valakh, 2015</xref>), schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dickman and Davis, 2009</xref>) and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noebels, 2015</xref>). But, the cellular and molecular underpinnings of neuronal homeostasis are only just beginning to emerge through forward genetic and biochemical screening efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dickman and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis and Müller, 2015</xref>). Delineating these signaling systems and defining how they succeed or fail, in health and disease, will be essential before concrete connections between homeostatic plasticity and disease can be established.</p><p>Signaling mechanisms that are capable of homeostatic control are known to incorporate basic elements including sensors that can detect a perturbation, error signals that define the magnitude of a perturbation, feedback and feed-forward signaling loops, and mechanisms of signal integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cowan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitrophanov and Groisman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lemmon et al., 2016</xref>). For example, we have a detailed understanding of the homeostatic signaling systems that control blood glucose levels and organismal metabolism. Hundreds of proteins and enzymes are organized into intersecting regulatory pathways, inclusive of feedback and feed-forward signaling elements that are dependent upon reversible and irreversible enzymatic reactions. By comparison, the biological basis for the homeostatic control of neural function remains almost completely uncharacterized. It seems essential that new homeostatic plasticity genes be identified so that entire signaling pathways can be delineated and new regulatory mechanisms defined. Here, we identify and characterize a novel presynaptic calcium sensor for homeostatic synaptic plasticity. We present evidence that this calcium sensor resides on the membranes of the presynaptic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and, as such, defines a new homeostatic signaling relationship between the ER and the presynaptic neurotransmitter release mechanism.</p><p>The homeostatic modulation of presynaptic neurotransmitter release, termed presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP), is highly conserved from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis and Müller, 2015</xref>). In response to a perturbation that disrupts the function of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors, there is a compensatory increase in presynaptic neurotransmitter release that precisely offsets the change in neurotransmitter receptor function and maintains postsynaptic excitation at baseline, set point levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis and Müller, 2015</xref>). PHP can be rapidly induced on a time scale of seconds to minutes, can precisely adjust the presynaptic release mechanism to offset a wide range of postsynaptic perturbations and can be stably maintained for the life of an organism; months in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mahoney et al., 2014</xref>) and decades in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cull-Candy et al., 1980</xref>).</p><p>It remains a formidable challenge to define signaling mechanisms that are capable of the rapid, accurate and persistent modification of presynaptic neurotransmitter release observed during PHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2013</xref>). Recent advances include the identification and involvement of a presynaptic ENaC channel capable of mediating analogue modulation of presynaptic calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Younger et al., 2013</xref>), the RIM/RIM-Binding Protein scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Müller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Müller et al., 2015</xref>) and a novel presynaptic innate immune receptor, PGRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris et al., 2015</xref>). Although these genes are causally linked to the induction and expression of PHP, the adaptive controls that are able to modulate the vesicle release mechanism in an accurate and persistent manner remain poorly defined. For example, how does a presynaptic scaffolding protein such as RIM participate in a regulated, rheostat-like control of presynaptic release? Homeostatic signaling systems are often built upon feedback signaling. But, to date, the molecular basis of homeostatic feedback within the presynaptic terminal remains a mystery.</p><p>In the original forward genetic screen for candidate PHP genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dickman and Davis, 2009</xref>) we identified mutations that disrupted a gene encoding a C2 domain containing protein of unknown function, termed MCTP (Multiple C2 Domain Proteins with Two Transmembrane Regions). MCTPs are evolutionarily conserved proteins with three C2 domains and two C-terminal membrane-spanning domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2005</xref>). The C2 domains are unusual in that they are able to bind calcium with relatively high affinity (1–2.5 µM) and do so in the apparent absence of phospholipid binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, genetic deletion of <italic>mctp</italic> is embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maeda et al., 2001</xref>). In mammals, <italic>mctp</italic> is expressed in the brain and spinal cord and genetic mutations in <italic>mctp</italic> have been linked to bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Djurovic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scott et al., 2009</xref>). Beyond this, little is known about the function of MCTP. Here, we demonstrate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> MCTP is resident on the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum that extends from the soma to the presynaptic terminal. We provide evidence that MCTP functions in motoneurons as a potential source of calcium-dependent feedback control that sustains both baseline neurotransmitter release and presynaptic homeostatic plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of <italic>mctp</italic> as a homeostatic plasticity gene</title><p>A large-scale forward genetic screen is being employed to identify genes that are required for PHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dickman and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Younger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Müller et al., 2015</xref>). This screen is based on the application of the glutamate receptor antagonist philanthotoxin-433 (PhTx) to the NMJ at sub-blocking concentrations (4–20 µM). Following application of PhTx, miniature excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes (mEPSP) are initially decreased by ~50% and there is a parallel decrease in the amplitude of evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frank et al., 2006</xref>). During the next 10 min, in the continued presence of PhTx, mEPSP amplitudes remain inhibited while EPSP amplitude gradually increases, ultimately reaching amplitudes observed prior to the application of PhTx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frank et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, enhanced presynaptic release rapidly and precisely offsets the magnitude of postsynaptic glutamate receptor inhibition, homeostatically restoring EPSP amplitudes. This process has been observed at mammalian central and peripheral synapses and is conserved at the human NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis and Müller, 2015</xref> for review). Recently, the rapid induction and rapid reversal of PHP were also documented at the mouse NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). To identify the molecular mechanisms of PHP, we have screened more than 2000 individual gene mutations for impaired PHP using electrophysiological recordings of synaptic transmission as a primary assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dickman and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Müller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Younger et al., 2013</xref>). To date, very few genes have been identified that are required for both the rapid induction and sustained expression of PHP. This screen identified a transposon insertion in the <italic>mctp</italic> gene that blocks the rapid induction of PHP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MCTP is necessary for both PHP and baseline presynaptic release</title><p>The <italic>mctp<sup>1</sup></italic> transposon insertion resides in the non-coding, 3’ untranslated region of the <italic>mctp</italic> gene and is predicted to be a loss of function allele.

More specifically, application of sub-blocking concentrations of PhTx causes a significant decrease in mEPSP amplitude in wild type and in all of the <italic>mctp</italic> mutant combinations that we tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; Student’s t-test; p&lt;0.01 for each genotype, comparing the absence versus presence of PhTx). In wild type, there is a homeostatic increase in quantal content (EPSP/mEPSP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; p&lt;0.01) that precisely offsets the decrease in mEPSP amplitude and restores EPSP amplitudes to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,E</xref>). However, in all four <italic>mctp</italic> mutant combinations, the homeostatic increase in quantal content is blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; p&gt;0.05 for each genotype relative to baseline in the absence of PhTx) and EPSP amplitudes remain smaller than baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, <italic>mctp</italic> is essential for the rapid induction of PHP.</p><p>An analysis of baseline transmission in response to single action potential stimulation, under these recording conditions (0.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>), reveals a significant deficit in presynaptic release in all of the <italic>mctp</italic> mutant combinations that we tested.

An additional analysis of baseline neurotransmission across a 5-fold range of extracellular calcium concentration, performed under two-electrode voltage clamp configuration and inclusive of an analysis of short-term synaptic modulation, is shown below. Importantly, while there are relatively mild effects on baseline transmission under these conditions, the expression of PHP is completely blocked.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MCTP functions in motoneurons during PHP</title><p>To confirm that MCTP is necessary for PHP and to define where MCTP functions, pre- versus postsynaptically, we performed genetic rescue experiments. A full-length <italic>mctp</italic> transgene was generated and expressed under <italic>UAS</italic> control using either the neuron-specific <italic>Gal4</italic> driver <italic>elav-Gal4</italic> or the muscle specific driver <italic>MHC-Gal4</italic>. Neuron-specific expression of <italic>UAS-mctp</italic> in the <italic>mctp<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant background (‘rescue neuron’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–J</xref>) fully rescues PHP as demonstrated by a large increase in quantal content and the restoration of EPSP amplitudes to baseline values in the presence of PhTx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–J</xref>; p&gt;0.5 compared to wild type for mEPSP, EPSP and quantal content values). By contrast, muscle-specific expression of <italic>UAS-mctp</italic> (‘rescue muscle’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–J</xref>) does not rescue PHP. Indeed, we note that while expression of <italic>UAS-mctp</italic> in muscle alone has no effect on quantal content compared to wild type (p&gt;0.1), in the presence of PhTx the quantal content is reduced below levels observed at baseline in the absence of PhTx, suggesting a dominant interfering effect of postsynaptic expression that is somehow specific to the condition of PhTx application. Regardless, taken together, these data confirm that <italic>mctp</italic> is essential for the rapid induction of PHP and that MCTP activity is necessary in the presynaptic neuron for PHP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>MCTP is essential for the long-term maintenance of PHP</title><p>Mutations in the muscle-specific glutamate receptor subunit <italic>GluRIIA</italic> decrease mEPSP amplitudes and induce a homeostatic potentiation of presynaptic release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petersen et al., 1997</xref>). This manipulation has been interpreted to reflect the long-term maintenance of PHP and represents an independent experimental method to induce PHP. Here, we confirm that the <italic>GluRIIA</italic> mutant has decreased mEPSP amplitudes and a robust, homeostatic increase in quantal content (p&lt;0.01). However, when PHP is assessed in the <italic>mctp<sup>1</sup></italic>,<italic>GluRIIA</italic> double mutant, PHP is completely blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). More specifically, in <italic>mctp<sup>1</sup></italic>,<italic>GluRIIA</italic> double mutants, mEPSP amplitudes are decreased to levels identical to that observed in the <italic>GluRIIA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). But, unlike the <italic>GluRIIA</italic> mutant, there is a failure to increase quantal content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The specificity of this effect is confirmed by genetic rescue experiments. Presynaptic expression of <italic>UAS-mctp</italic> fully restores PHP in the <italic>mctp<sup>1</sup></italic>,<italic>GluRIIA</italic> double mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Efforts to generate MCTP-specific antibodies were unsuccessful. We note that <italic>UAS-mctp</italic> expression fully rescues the mutant phenotype. MCTP has two highly conserved transmembrane segments, implying localization to a cellular membrane system. We now demonstrate that MCTP-Flag localizes to the internal membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We expressed <italic>UAS-mctp-flag</italic> in a pair of identified motoneurons that are segmentally repeated in the larval central nervous system using the <italic>MN1-Gal4</italic> driver (see Materials and methods). Within the soma, MCTP concentrates within a reticulated, peri-nuclear membrane system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and co-localizes with co-expressed ER-resident KDEL-RFP (not shown), indicative of ER localization. MCTP-Flag is observed to extend into the axon on similarly reticulated internal membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and inset). Co-staining with anti-HRP to label the neuronal plasma membrane confirms that these are a membrane system within the axonal plasma membrane (not shown). MCTP-Flag extends throughout the dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and then extends all the way to the presynaptic nerve terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

We demonstrate that the isolated transmembrane domains of MCTP are sufficient to localize GFP to the ER, defined by co-localization with ER-tracker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, compare full length MCTP-GFP to TM only GFP). Each image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> is a single confocal section through the cell, highlighting the peri-nuclear organization of the ER. We then performed the converse experiment. When the two transmembrane domains of MCTP are removed from MCTP-GFP, the truncated protein no longer localizes to the ER and is found broadly distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, MCTP noTM GFP). Finally, we note that full length MCTP-GFP protein was never observed to reside on the cell plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and data not shown).</p><p>We then explored co-labeling with other synaptic markers at the nerve terminal. First, we co-stained the terminal with MCTP-Flag and the active zone marker anti-BRP and imaged the NMJ using super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Single sections reveal that MCTP-Flag does not co-localize with anti-Brp, but does come into close proximity at many, though not all, active zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Next, we perform co-labeling with the synaptic vesicle marker anti-synaptotagmin1 (Syt1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We note that MCTP is essentially absent from clusters of synaptic vesicles, identified by anti-Syt1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> arrows). These data are consistent with retention of MCTP-Flag in the ER since over-expressed protein does not appear to extend to post-golgi membranes of synaptic vesicles. Co-labeling with a membrane marker (anti-HRP) again demonstrates that MCTP-Flag labeled membranes are often closely opposed to the neuronal plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> inset; See also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This is intriguing given the recent demonstration that the Extended Synaptotagmins (eSyts), which are members of the same extended gene family as MCTP, localize to sites of ER-plasma membrane contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22904.005</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>MCTP does not co-localize with the synaptic vesicle marker Syt1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Synaptic distribution of MCTP-Flag (green) at the NMJ.

Both techniques have well-established caveats. The incorporation of a fluorescent tag into a protein of interest can alter protein localization, irrespective of whether the tagged protein is overexpressed or regulated by endogenous gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stadler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schnell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moore and Murphy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2014</xref>).

We note, however, a recent study of more than 500 human proteins that documented ~80% concordance between fluorescent protein tagging and antibody labeling in human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stadler et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, while acknowledging the caveats of each approach, there is evidence that each remains a reliable technique in modern cell biology. We were unable to verify MCTP localization with antibody staining. However, we do document identical MCTP localization in both neurons and S2 cells, rescue of the <italic>mctp</italic> mutant phenotype and we demonstrate the required function of the transmembrane region of MCTP for ER localization in S2 cells. Thus, based on these and related data, we conclude that MCTP is an ER resident protein, distributed on the ER throughout motoneurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Loss of MCTP does not alter NMJ growth or morphology</title><p>Several ER-resident proteins have recently been implicated in the control of synaptic morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Summerville et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moustaqim-Barrette et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Sullivan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we quantified NMJ morphology in the <italic>mctp</italic> mutant background. We find a small, but statistically significant, increase in bouton number in both <italic>mctp<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>mctp<sup>2</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We also quantified active zone number, assessed by counting the number of anti-Brp puncta that identify the presynaptic T-bar, resident at individual active zones. There is also no significant change in active zone number or active zone density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Beyond this, the <italic>mctp</italic> mutant NMJ appears morphologically normal, without the appearance of satellite boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marie et al., 2004</xref>) and without any evidence of NMJ degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eaton et al., 2002</xref>).

We find that anti-Futsch staining is qualitatively normal, consistent with normal NMJ growth and normal NMJ integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We repeated our analyses of baseline transmission using two-electrode voltage clamp to measure EPSC amplitudes across a 5-fold range of extracellular calcium (0.3–1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>) and find that EPSC amplitudes are significantly impaired across this entire range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Thus, in the <italic>mctp<sup>OG9</sup></italic> mutant, there is an impaired calcium sensitivity of release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This occurs without a change in the apparent calcium-cooperativity of release (see below), given that the magnitude of change is similar at all external calcium concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Consistent with the conclusion <italic>mctp</italic> alters baseline release, we also find a significant change in short-term release dynamics at 0.7, 1.0 and 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Indeed, at 1.0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> synaptic depression is observed at the wild type synapse compared to short-term facilitation at the <italic>mctp</italic> mutant synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Similar alterations in short-term release dynamics were observed in the two additional <italic>mctp</italic> mutant alleles (data not shown). We then compare short-term release dynamics for wild type and <italic>mctp</italic> under [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> where baseline release is equivalent. For example, comparing wild type at 0.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> with <italic>mctp</italic> at 0.7 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> it is apparent that baseline EPSCs are equivalent (p&gt;0.05) and so are short-term release dynamics (p&gt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>).

We tested the effects of EGTA-AM (25 μM or 125 µM) on single AP-evoked EPSCs and short-term release dynamics at 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> comparing wild-type and <italic>mctp<sup>OG9</sup></italic> mutant synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). At the wild type synapse, the presence of EGTA-AM causes a significant decrease in EPSC amplitude. In contrast, EPSCs in <italic>mctp<sup>OG9</sup></italic> mutants are completely insensitive to EGTA-AM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

In the <italic>mctp<sup>OG9</sup></italic> mutant, access to weakly coupled vesicles is impaired. Our estimates suggest that the RRP in <italic>mctp</italic> is normal, an effect that can be accounted for by pronounced facilitation during the early phase of the stimulus train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Indeed, repetitive stimulation reliably invokes facilitation in the <italic>mctp</italic> mutant. One interpretation is that the elevated intra-terminal calcium that occurs during repetitive stimulation overcomes impaired access to the weakly coupled vesicle pool caused by loss of MCTP. EGTA should buffer the slow rise in intra-terminal calcium during a stimulus train and, thereby, the calcium-dependent recruitment of weakly coupled vesicles. Thus, EGTA should convert facilitation to depression in <italic>mctp</italic> mutants. This is precisely what we observe. In wild type, application of EGTA-AM has little effect on short-term release dynamics. However, in <italic>mctp</italic>, short-term facilitation is converted to short-term depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>).

Next, we increased the concentration of EGTA five-fold (125 µm), keeping the incubation time for EGTA-AM constant. In this condition, baseline release is significantly impaired, reducing quantal content by ~50%. None-the-less, we observe statistically significant PHP, although it is suppressed relative to controls in the absence of EGTA-AM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, PHP does not require the MCTP<italic>-</italic>dependent, EGTA-sensitive vesicle pool.

There are many non-linear process that are combined in the calcium-coupled release process, particularly over such a large range of extracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</xref>).

To determine whether the calcium-coordinating residues in C2A, C2B and C2C domains are necessary for PHP, we mutated all of the predicted calcium coordinating residues from aspartic acid to asparagine. There are five critical residues predicted to be necessary for calcium coordination in C2A, two in C2B and five in C2C. Four mutant transgenes were generated. The first transgene included mutations in all twelve residues, termed <italic>mctp<sup>C2D12N</sup></italic>, which is predicted to render the MCTP protein unable to coordinate calcium in any of the three C2 domains.

All transgenes are inserted at a common genomic site, suggesting that these differences in protein distribution are not caused by differences in transgene expression. None-the-less, since all three transgenes are present at the NMJ, it argues that these transgenic proteins do not dramatically alter the ER membrane system and the extension of this membrane system to the presynaptic terminal. With this information in hand, we tested PHP and find that all three transgenes fail to rescue PHP in the <italic>mctp<sup>OG9</sup></italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B,C</xref>).

We demonstrate that loss of MCTP does not alter the spatially averaged presynaptic calcium signal in response to single or repetitive nerve stimulation. Thus, MCTP functions downstream of cytosolic calcium originating from either plasma membrane calcium channels or ER calcium stores. Prior evidence suggests that MCTP is sensitive to calcium in the 1 µM range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2005</xref>). As such, MCTP could ‘sense’ action-potential induced calcium influx or residual calcium following an action potential. Prior evidence also indicates that MCTP does not bind membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2005</xref>). This does not rule out the possibility that MCTP could confer calcium sensitivity to the protein complexes that mediate an interaction of ER membranes with plasma membranes at or near presynaptic release sites. A recent paper has underscored the role of axonal ER in the regulation of presynaptic release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Juan-Sanz et al., 2017</xref>). In this work, depletion of ER calcium strongly suppresses presynaptic release in a STIM1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Juan-Sanz et al., 2017</xref>). However, STIM-1 knockdown was shown to have no effect on baseline transmission under normal physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Juan-Sanz et al., 2017</xref>). By contrast, our work specifies a role for ER-localized MCTP as a critical regulator of baseline release, short-term plasticity and PHP, under physiological conditions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Separable actions of MCTP support baseline release and PHP</title><p>Loss of MCTP appears to have two separable effects on presynaptic release. On the one hand, loss of MCTP impairs presynaptic vesicle release across a 3-fold range of extracellular calcium (0.5–1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>). This represents a shift in the calcium sensitivity of release without a change in the calcium-dependent cooperativity of release. We further demonstrate that loss of MCTP causes increased short-term facilitation. This effect is generally associated with decreased presynaptic release probability. Indeed, there is no change in stimulus-dependent RRP size or synaptic ultrastructure. However, there is also no change in the spatially averaged calcium signal in response to single or repetitive action potential stimulation. Rather, it appears that MCTP controls access to an EGTA-sensitive component of presynaptic release, also termed ‘weakly calcium-coupled vesicles’. It is worth noting that the magnitude of the decrease in baseline release in <italic>mctp</italic> under physiological calcium conditions is quantitatively similar to that observed in mutations deleting Rab3-Interacting Molecule (RIM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Müller et al., 2012</xref>), a presynaptic component of the active zone cytomatrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Südhof, 2012</xref>). As such, the effects of <italic>mctp</italic> mutants are dramatic and consistent with emerging evidence that presynaptic ER signaling is a potent regulator of synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Juan-Sanz et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>MCTP is also required for the expression of PHP. Unlike the effects on baseline release, which occur over a range of 0.5 to 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>, the block of PHP in the <italic>mctp</italic> mutant occurs when extracellular calcium concentration is diminished below 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>. The physiological range for extracellular calcium at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ is considered to be 0.7–2.2 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stewart et al., 1994</xref>). It is remarkable, therefore, that PHP can be both accurate and robust when recordings are made at 0.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> at a wild type synapse. One possibility is that MCTP functions as part of a calcium-dependent feedback signaling system that stabilizes the expression of PHP. Since PHP can be induced in the absence of action potential induced presynaptic calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frank et al., 2006</xref>), MCTP would need to be sensitive to changes in extracellular calcium, presumably detecting corresponding changes in cytoplasmic calcium since MCTP resides on the internal ER membranes. In the mammalian central nervous system, there is considerable evidence that extracellular calcium concentrations can be substantially diminished, well below the physiological range (hypocalcaemia) during periods of normal neural activity or as a consequence of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borst and Sakmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Silver and Erecińska, 1990</xref>). As such, MCTP-dependent stabilization of PHP could be an essential mechanism to prevent the failure of synaptic transmission at neuromuscular and, possibly, central synapses under convergent conditions of hypocalcaemia and homeostatic stress.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Potential models for MCTP-mediated stabilization of PHP</title><p>One possibility is that MCTP-dependent signaling occurs at sites of ER-plasma membrane contact. This is consistent with the demonstration that the ER-plasma membrane interface is controlled in a calcium-dependent manner in other cell types. For example, the eSyts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Idevall-Hagren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saheki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>) and orthologous Tricalbins in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manford et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Toulmay and Prinz, 2012</xref>) are calcium sensitive molecular tethers that control the extent of ER-plasma membrane contact. One action of the eSyts is to control plasma membrane lipid homeostasis through the action of their SMP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saheki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schauder et al., 2014</xref>). This represents a homeostatic system that controls plasma membrane phospholipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saheki et al., 2016</xref>). MCTP lacks an SMP domain, but this does not rule out the possibility that MCTP functions as part of a related protein complex that mediates such an activity. As another example, it has been established that oligomerization of the ER-resident protein STIM1 occurs in response to lowered levels of calcium within the ER, triggering its interaction with and activation of the plasma membrane calcium channel Orai1. This represents a calcium-dependent signaling system that sustains calcium levels in the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feske et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liou et al., 2005</xref>) and has been recently linked to the regulation of presynaptic release under conditions of ER calcium depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Juan-Sanz et al., 2017</xref>). It is worth noting that ER-plasma membrane contact sites exist prior to calcium-dependent STIM1 recruitment, an observation that has highlighted the importance of ER-plasma membrane contact sites as platforms for other signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stefan et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2013</xref>). It is also worth noting that proteins resident at ER-plasma membrane contacts are not always selectively localized to these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>), an observation that is consistent with the observed distribution of MCTP throughout the ER in neurons.</p><p>It remains to be determined whether loss of MCTP disrupts ER-plasma membrane contacts in the presynaptic terminal and whether these hypothetical sites are controlled in a calcium dependent manner via MCTP activity. Indeed, the observation that C2-domain specific mutations in MCTP block PHP without dramatically altering the distribution of MCTP-labeled ER membranes within the presynaptic terminal argues against the simple possibility that MCTP controls PHP by organizing ER morphology. It seems more likely that MCTP could confer calcium-dependence to signaling between the ER and other internal membrane systems. Without question, there are many experiments that could be performed to pursue these ideas. None-the-less, we provide strong evidence that MCTP is a calcium sensor that acts downstream of calcium influx to stabilize baseline release and confer robustness to the expression of PHP.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Relevance to disease</title><p>Disruption of the extended neuronal endoplasmic reticulum has been repeatedly associated with neurological disease.

Second, we did not observe changes in ER organization in the <italic>mctp</italic> mutant and the microtubule cytoskeleton is unaltered in <italic>mctp</italic>. Third, there is no substantive change in NMJ growth, organization or changes in synaptic ultrastructure caused by loss of <italic>mctp</italic>. Finally, we extend our work to the analysis of calcium-coordinating residues in the individual C2 domains of MCTP and demonstrate that the distribution of C2-domain mutations are largely normal, implying that PHP is blocked while the ER membrane system remains intact. In this respect, it is very intriguing that mutations in human <italic>mctp</italic> were recently associated with psychiatric disease in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Djurovic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scott et al., 2009</xref>). Bipolar disorder can be considered a disease of neuronal malfunction that could reasonably be related to the role of MCTP in the homeostatic stabilization of synaptic transmission.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks were raised at 25°C on standard food.

Dissected third instar larvae were fixed with PFA (4%) and incubated overnight at 4 C with primary antibodies (mouse anti Flag 1:50; rabbit anti-RFP 1:100; rabbit anti-Dlg, 1:1000; anti-Syt1 1:1000, anti-Brp 1:100, Life Technologies). Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies and goat anti-HRP were used (Jackson Laboratories 1:500). Images were acquired with either a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope equipped with Zen software using a 63X 1.6 NA oil immersion objective or an upright epifluorescence deconvolution confocal microscope (Axiovert 200, Zeiss) equipped with a 100X objective (N.A. 1.4), cooled CCD camera (CoolSnap HQ, Roper Scientific). Slidebook 5.0 (3I, Intelligent Imaging) was used for capturing, deconvolving and analyzing images. Structured illumination microscopy (Nikon LSM 710 equipped with 63X objective and Andor Ixon EMCCD camera) was used to perform Brp-GFP and MCTP-Flag colocalization experiments.

Ca<sup>2+</sup> was added to the HL3 at the day of the experiment at different concentrations (0.3 to 1.5 mM). Homeostatic plasticity was induced by incubating the larvae with Philantotoxin-433 (PhTx, 15–20 µM, Sigma) for 10 min as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frank et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris et al., 2015</xref>). EGTA-AM was diluted in calcium-free HL3 to its final concentration (25 and 125 µM, Sigma), applied to the unstretched larvae for 10 min of incubation. Quantal content was calculated by dividing average EPSP to mEPSP. For estimating the pool size, cumulative peak EPSP amplitudes at 60 Hz were line-fitted and back-extrapolated to time = 0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneggenburger et al., 1999</xref>). mEPSPs were analyzed with MiniAnalysis program (Synaptosoft).

A scanning confocal microscope (Ultima, Prairie Technologies) with a 60× objective (1.0 NA, Olympus) was used for imaging. 488 nm excitation wavelength from a krypton-argon laser used for excitation and emitted photons were collected through a pinhole at a photocathode photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu). All line scans were performed at type 1b boutons of muscle 6/7, segments A2-A3. Loading efficiency of the dye was assessed by the intensity of co-loaded Alexa 568. Single stimuli (1 ms) and stimulus trains (5 pulse, 1 ms duration, 50 Hz) were used.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Bing Zhang (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Based on the reviews as well as subsequent discussions among the reviewers, we would like to invite you to submit a revised manuscript. From the reviews below, you will see that a common concern is that it is inadequate to determine the subcellular localization of MCTP based on overexpressed proteins. This should be determined by antibody against endogenous protein, or MiMIC or CRISPR/Cas9-produced tag of endogenous protein. We also expect that you will respond to other critiques of the reviewers as thoroughly as possible with new data (e.g., potential artifact of ER localization caused by fixation; testing new Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer). Where it is not possible, please tone down the assertions based on available data.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The last 15 years have seen a marked increase in our knowledge of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP), largely driven by studies from the Davis lab at the fly NMJ. However, the molecular underpinnings of these events are incompletely known. In this manuscript, Genc and colleagues identify MCTP, a C2-domain containing transmembrane protein, as a new player involved in PHP. It is necessary for both acute and chronic invocations of PHP as well as coordination of PHP over a wide range of calcium concentrations. MCTP localizes broadly throughout nerves, and overlaps somewhat with KDEL, suggesting that it localizes (though not exclusively) to the ER. Beyond its involvement in PHP, MCTP also plays a role in baseline neurotransmission, allowing access to a pool of weakly coupled, EGTA-sensitive vesicles, which may also factor into PHP, though the link is somewhat murky. Perturbation of MCTP does not affect morphology or vesicle parameters at the NMJ. Finally, the authors demonstrate that all three C2 domains of the protein are necessary for PHP, suggesting that the calcium-binding activity of MCTP is what drives its role in PHP.</p><p>The experiments are well done, the physiology well controlled, and the data (largely, see below) very strong. There is some question, however, as to how the roles of MCTP regarding PHP and the weakly coupled vesicle population are connected and how separable are the functions of MCTP in baseline transmission and PHP. As such, the mechanistic insight offered by this new player into how PHP functions is limited. The feedback system, as suggested by the authors, is a tantalizing prospect, though more insight into that mechanism would be necessary to elevate this paper to <italic>eLife</italic>. This is an excellent analysis of a new PHP player that would be better suited for a specialty journal.</p><p>Specific Points:</p><p>I am, however, concerned about the conclusions regarding MCTP overexpression. Due to the widespread localization, it is likely to partially colocalize with many markers. So co-staining with Syt, Brp, and HRP is only mildly informative. The KDEL staining is convincing in the segmental nerves (though again, overexpressed), but doesn't match informatively at the NMJ. Thus, I wonder if overexpression causes mislocalization. I would recommend qPCR to compare overexpression levels with those of endogenous. If they are vastly different, identify expression conditions that most closely resemble WT. That would allow for more confidence regarding the localization. Further, commercial KDEL antibodies exist as well as monoclonals to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Golgi and ER proteins (Riedel et al., 2016, Biology Open) that might be helpful to avoid concomitant KDEL overexpression.</p><p>In the mctp mutants, the AP waveform is unchanged, but is calcium influx (the currents themselves) is affected?

The same change doesn't appear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Rather, it looks like the level is maintained: is the change only present at certain frequencies? Calcium concentrations? The differences could be made clearer. Or perhaps a more representative trace used?</p><p>Regarding the interpretation of MCTP function, the presence of PHP at high extracellular calcium levels in mctp is interesting. In this case, the calcium driving force is greater, likely overloading normal buffering, or at least slowing it. This would alter the average extra / intra calcium ratio. Is it possible that MCTP is, instead of detecting extracellular calcium, detecting influx, clearance, or extrusion rates from other buffering mechanisms, like PMCA or SERCA? Calcium imaging of transients at high calcium levels may shed some light on the mechanism by which MCTP might work as a sensor. This could further enlighten a mechanistic role.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is an interesting and original study on identification of a presynaptic molecule that plays a key role in homeostatic synaptic plasticity. The author identified an ER- multi-domain Ca sensor from a large scale genetic screen and presented strong electrophysiological evidence that MCTP acts downstream of Ca influx to facilitate the expression of presynaptic compensatory increase in quantal release upon a reduction in postsynaptic glutamate receptors. This work extends previous findings from the Davis lab and appears to add a new presynaptic molecule to the network of proteins involved in homeostatic regulation.

However, the molecular underpinnings of these events are incompletely known. In this manuscript, Genc and colleagues identify MCTP, a C2-domain containing transmembrane protein, as a new player involved in PHP. It is necessary for both acute and chronic invocations of PHP as well as coordination of PHP over a wide range of calcium concentrations. MCTP localizes broadly throughout nerves, and overlaps somewhat with KDEL, suggesting that it localizes (though not exclusively) to the ER. Beyond its involvement in PHP, MCTP also plays a role in baseline neurotransmission, allowing access to a pool of weakly coupled, EGTA-sensitive vesicles, which may also factor into PHP, though the link is somewhat murky. Perturbation of MCTP does not affect morphology or vesicle parameters at the NMJ. Finally, the authors demonstrate that all three C2 domains of the protein are necessary for PHP, suggesting that the calcium-binding activity of MCTP is what drives its role in PHP.</italic> </p><p>Regarding the general significance of our findings: We would like to emphasize that our paper defines the function of a new calcium-binding protein that affects presynaptic neurotransmitter release <underline>and</underline> homeostatic plasticity. We consider it even more striking that this is an ER-localized protein. We draw attention to the recent work on presynaptic ER calcium signaling in neurons, including recent work publish in Neuron (Juan-Sanz et al., Neuron 2017), now cited in our study.</p><p>What distinguishes our work from the existing literature is that we not only identify a novel presynaptic calcium sensor (something remarkable given the long history of the field of synaptic biology), we also place this protein within the presynaptic ER. Thus, we define a new signaling function of the presynaptic ER. Finally, we demonstrate that this protein is a component of the regulatory mechanisms responsible for presynaptic homeostatic plasticity and baseline neurotransmitter release under normal physiological conditions. We would like to emphasize that recent work by Juan-Sanz et al., (Neuron2017) demonstrated that depletion of ER calcium causes a suppression of neurotransmitter release in a Stim1-dependent manner. But, they show that, under normal conditions, <italic>Stim1</italic> knockdown had no effect on baseline release. Our work defines MCTP as essential controller of release and plasticity under normal physiological conditions.</p><p><italic>The experiments are well done, the physiology well controlled, and the data (largely, see below) very strong. There is some question, however, as to how the roles of MCTP regarding PHP and the weakly coupled vesicle population are connected and how separable are the functions of MCTP in baseline transmission and PHP. As such, the mechanistic insight offered by this new player into how PHP functions is limited.</italic> </p><p>As stated in our Abstract and Discussion sections, we provide evidence that MCTP has separableactivities to stabilize baseline transmission, short-term release dynamics and PHP. The evidence that MCTP has separable effects on PHP and baseline release is as follows:</p><p>a) At 1.5mM extracellular calcium, baseline release is significantly impaired but PHP is fully expressed. Under this condition, the effects are separable.</p><p>b) PHP fails in <italic>mctp</italic> mutants as extracellular calcium concentrations are decreased, but baseline release is impaired throughout the calcium range.</p><p>c)EGTA-AM normalizes baseline release in wild type and <italic>mctp</italic>, consistent with the conclusion that MCTP is responsible for a weakly coupled vesicle pool. But, EGTA-AM does not block PHP. Again, the effects are separable.</p><p>d) Mutations in the three C2 domains of MCTP fail to rescue PHP, but have no effect on baseline transmission compared to the wild type MCTP transgene. Again, the effects are separable.</p><p>Thus, it is a conservative conclusion to suggest that MCTP has ‘separable’ effects on baseline release and PHP.</p><p>We would also like to emphasize the extent of the information that we provide. We provide strong evidence for how baseline neurotransmission is disrupted (inclusive of EM, calcium imaging, pharmacology and numerous electrophysiological experiments). We also provide strong evidence that MCTP is a novel, presynaptic calcium binding protein necessary for PHP (inclusive a structure function analysis of all three MCTP C2 domains).</p><p>Finally, with regard to the intersection of baseline neurotransmitter release and PHP, there are a number of additional points worth making. First, mutations that affect baseline release do notpredict a parallel disruption of PHP. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in the results of our genetic screens and published work (Frank et al., 2006; Frank et al., 2009; Dickman and Davis, 2009; Younger et al., 2013; Goold et al., 2007). Conversely, PHP can be blocked by mutations that have no effect on baseline transmission (Frank et al., 2009; Younger et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014). Baseline release and PHP are genetically separable processes.Indeed, PHP seems to be a regulatory process that is layered on top of the presynaptic fusion apparatus (Davis and Muller, 2015). There are points of convergence between PHP and the release mechanism including a role for the auxiliary calcium channel subunit (Wang et al., 2016) and the presynaptic cytomatrix (Muller et al., 2012; Muller et al., 2014).</p><p><italic>The feedback system, as suggested by the authors, is a tantalizing prospect, though more insight into that mechanism would be necessary to elevate this paper to eLife. This is an excellent analysis of a new PHP player that would be better suited for a specialty journal.</italic> </p><p>We have done our best to consider the implications of our data and have come up with a plausible model that this reviewer considers “tantalizing”. We hope that our model will spark similar interest in other laboratories, in other systems, thereby extending our existing work and ideas. Models are, by definition, unproven ideas. No one will ever put forward a model in a paper if the reviewers request that the model be proven. Models are intended to stimulate speculation and new ideas!</p><p>With respect to elevating our work to the level of <italic>eLife</italic>, we refer the reviewer to a new paragraph that we have added to the Discussion section, referring to recent literature. The work that we cite de Juan-Sanz et al. 2017, recently appeared in Neuron. Because our data define a function for MCTP in the control of baseline release and plasticity under physiological conditions, I argue that our data are at least as relevant.</p><p>“A recent paper has underscored the role of axonal ER in the regulation of presynaptic release (de Juan-Sanz et al. 2017). In this work, depletion of ER calcium strongly suppresses presynaptic release in a STIM1-dependent manner (de Juan-Sanz et al. 2017). However, STIM-1 knockdown was shown to have no effect on baseline transmission under normal physiological conditions (de Juan-Sanz et al. 2017). By contrast, our work specifies a role for ER-localized MCTP as a critical regulator of baseline release, short-term plasticity and PHP, under physiological conditions.”</p><p>Finally, as we now state in our Discussion, the effects of MCTP knockdown are as dramatic as that observed following the knockdown of other important presynaptic proteins such as Rab3 Interacting Molecule (RIM). As such, the phenotypes of <italic>mctp</italic> mutants are rather remarkable for their effects on baseline transmission, downstream of presynaptic calcium influx.</p><p><italic>Specific Points:</italic> </p><p><italic>I am, however, concerned about the conclusions regarding MCTP overexpression. Due to the widespread localization, it is likely to partially colocalize with many markers. So co-staining with Syt, Brp, and HRP is only mildly informative. The KDEL staining is convincing in the segmental nerves (though again, overexpressed), but doesn't match informatively at the NMJ. Thus, I wonder if overexpression causes mislocalization. I would recommend qPCR to compare overexpression levels with those of endogenous. If they are vastly different, identify expression conditions that most closely resemble WT. That would allow for more confidence regarding the localization. Further, commercial KDEL antibodies exist as well as monoclonals to Drosophila Golgi and ER proteins (Riedel et al., 2016, Biology Open) that might be helpful to avoid concomitant KDEL overexpression.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the concern of this reviewer. We have added new experiments and data to address these concerns.</p><p>First, we went to great lengths to define, more precisely, the extent of MCTP co- localization with markers of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ER. This was achieved using new HDEL- GFP transgenes, as suggested by reviewer 3. We also revised our protocols to image HDEL-GFP live, thereby preserving the integrity of the ER morphology. With light fixation and post-fixation processing we are able to precisely correlate MCTP-myc localization with the morphology of HDEL-GFP. Indeed, we think that our data are vastly improved (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We thank the reviewers for prompting us to do this work. We now show that MCTP-GFP shows very strong co-localization with ER tubules within the presynaptic terminal (see New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This complements strong localization in axons and cell bodies of an identified motoneuron.</p><p>Second, we moved to heterologous insect cells (S2 cells) for cellular work and an additional structure function analysis of the MCTP protein. These experiments were guided by work on the extended synaptotagmins, done by the DeCamilli laboratory in heterologous cells (Idevall-Hagren et al.). We demonstrate that the transmembrane spanning regions of MCTP are necessary and sufficient for ER-localization of the MCTP protein. The transmembrane region is sufficient to localize GFP to the ER in S2 cells. Conversely, if the transmembrane domains are deleted, the truncated GFP-tagged MCTP protein is no longer retained in the ER. Thus, just like the ER retention signal HDEL, that is a consensus ER retention motif, the transmembrane domains of MCTP function as an ER localization signal.</p><p>While there are always caveats to protein overexpression, we would like to point out that this approach remains a powerful tool in modern cell biology. Synaptic vesicle proteins localize to synaptic vesicles when overexpressed. The Rab proteins identify unique endosomal membranes when overexpressed.</p><p>When overexpressed, we do not find MCTP appearing on synaptic vesicle membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) or on the neuronal plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), an observation that is now confirmed by work in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). There is close apposition of these markers in some cases. This is expected given the pervasive tubular architecture of the presynaptic ER. But, there is no evidence of pervasive ‘leak’ of the overexpressed protein onto other membrane systems. Finally, we now present evidence that the transmembrane domains of MCTP are necessary and sufficient for ER protein localization, just as HDEL and KDEL sequences retain GFP in the ER. As this reviewer points out, HDEL-GFP is an excellent ER marker and the same can be said for MCTP based upon our existing and new data. Finally, we demonstrate that overexpression of MCTP rescues a null mutation and does not create a neomorphic phenotype. So, there is no functional evidence for an overexpression artifact.</p><p><italic>In the mctp mutants, the AP waveform is unchanged, but is calcium influx (the currents themselves) is affected? It seems important to know, given the assertions made later on regarding slow calcium buffering with the EGTA experiments.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer missed data that we presented in our original submission. We did measure presynaptic calcium transients, in response to both single AP stimulation and short trains of AP stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> was dedicated to these data). There is no change in presynaptic calcium influx. This was our stated evidence that MCTP must act downstream of presynaptic calcium influx during baseline neurotransmission and PHP. This was a major point of the original submission and remains so in the revised version.</p><p><italic>I'm particularly intrigued by the change from short-term depression to facilitation in mctp in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The same change doesn't appear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Rather, it looks like the level is maintained: is the change only present at certain frequencies? Calcium concentrations? The differences could be made clearer. Or perhaps a more representative trace used?</italic> </p><p>This reviewer seems to have missed the quantification of our data that we presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. In this figure, we specifically quantified short-term release dynamics across a full range of extracellular calcium concentrations. The confusion seems to arise because this reviewer is comparing example traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and these traces were recorded at different extracellular calcium concentrations (as indicated). The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> were recorded at 1.0 mM and the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> were recorded in 1.5mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. These sample traces are representative of two very different experiments. Most importantly, the representative traces are precisely representative of the quantified data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, calculating short-term release dynamics across a range of extracellular calcium concentrations. The specific calcium concentrations have been made more explicit so as to avoid confusion by other readers.</p><p><italic>Regarding the interpretation of MCTP function, the presence of PHP at high extracellular calcium levels in mctp is interesting. In this case, the calcium driving force is greater, likely overloading normal buffering, or at least slowing it. This would alter the average extra / intra calcium ratio. Is it possible that MCTP is, instead of detecting extracellular calcium, detecting influx, clearance, or extrusion rates from other buffering mechanisms, like PMCA or SERCA? Calcium imaging of transients at high calcium levels may shed some light on the mechanism by which MCTP might work as a sensor. This could further enlighten a mechanistic role.</italic> </p><p>In the original submission, we did perform measurements of calcium influx at high (physiological) extracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). There is no difference in calcium transients in response to single action potential or multiple action potential stimulation. Our calcium measurements show that there is no change in rate of calcium transient decay comparing wild type and MCTP mutants, supporting the conclusion that MCTP does not influence calcium buffering. The question of what calcium MCTP is detecting is a good point, but we can only speculate. What seems clear is that MCTP does not act to alter presynaptic calcium influx.</p><p>In a conservative statement in the Results section we write, “We propose that MCTP normally functions to ensure that PHP is robustly and accurately expressed under variable [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]e conditions. To do so, MCTP must have a profound ability to counter changes in extracellular calcium and ensure robust doubling of presynaptic release in the presence of PhTx.” Later, we speculate the following: “Since PHP requires calcium-coordinating residues in all three MCTP C2 domains, we propose that MCTP functions as a presynaptic calcium sensor and a source of calcium-feedback signaling to ensure robust expression of PHP.” We think that we have been careful with the language that we use. Our conclusions stick closely to the data and speculation is referred to as a ‘proposal’ or a ‘model’.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is an interesting and original study on identification of a presynaptic molecule that plays a key role in homeostatic synaptic plasticity.

Reagents to look at the ER in unfixed preparations are available.</italic> </p><p>We are grateful to this reviewer for prompting us to explore this issue in greater detail. We worked hard to find conditions that would preserve the presynaptic ER and we think that we have been quite successful (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We have imaged HDEL-GFP in a live preparation, followed by mild fixation/antibody labeling and then re-imaging of the same synapses for MCTP localization. The ER tubules in the presynaptic terminal are obvious in the live imaging data, and much better preserved in our new data. As a consequence, the co-localization of MCTP and HDEL is striking. This represents a major improvement to our study and, again, we thank the reviewer for prompting us to work hard on this result (it did take considerable time, with extensive repetitions of trial and error).</p><p>With respect to the ER localization at or near active zones: Our new data from both live images and fixed synapses show that the ER is localized near the plasma membrane in tubules that extend throughout the NMJ. Given that active zones are distributed evenly throughout the nerve terminal (at ~400nm centers), it evident that the ER will come in close apposition to many active zones. The image that we show in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> also highlights the fact that the ER is not, necessarily, present at active zones. The inset shows that half of a bouton lacks ER membranes, whereas active zones will be distributed throughout all synaptic boutons.</p><p><italic>2) Overexpression of mctp is used to determine the localization of the protein, which is not acceptable, especially given the availability of tools to look at this without overexpression or antibodies (e.g., introduction of a tag into the genomic locus via CRISPR).

We have added new experiments and data to our manuscript. First, we went to great lengths to define, more precisely, the extent of co-localization of MCTP with markers of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ER. This was achieved using new HDEL transgenes, as suggested by this reviewer and improved protocols to preserve the presynaptic ER. Second, we resorted to S2 cells for cellular work and an additional structure function analysis of the MCTP proteins. We now show that MCTP-GFP shows very strong co-localization with ER tubules within the presynaptic terminal (see New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This complements strong localization in axons and cell bodies of an identified motoneuron.</p><p>We then pursued experiments to demonstrate that the two-transmembrane spanning region of MCTP is necessary and sufficient for ER-retention of the MCTP protein. The transmembrane region is sufficient to localize GFP to the ER in S2 cells.

For example, we previously stated, “There is a trend toward increased quantal content in animals expressing UAS-mctp<sup>C2B</sup>*, but this fails to reach significance.” We considered this to be common usage. However, we agree that there were places in the text that were less explicit. Therefore, we have removed all statements that include the word ‘trend’ from the text, allowing each individual reader to examine our data for themselves, as presented in our figures with the accompanying tests of statistical significance. We agree that this is preferable.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Although your rebuttal cited examples that overexpressed proteins reflect the localization of endogenous proteins, this is not guaranteed for a novel protein. We recognize that the revised manuscript contains a lot of new data, and after discussions among reviewers, we agree that the manuscript is acceptable for publication if you clearly point out the limitations of using overexpressed protein to infer the localization of an endogenous protein.</italic> </p><p>We have taken this request seriously and have endeavored to write a paragraph that highlights this issue and which cites relevant review articles and primary research studies that deal directly with the issue of defining where proteins reside within a cell. As can be seen from these papers, this is a non trivial issue and one that is worth highlighting. The following paragraph has been added to the text of our Results section.</p><p>“We acknowledge that our evidence for ER localization is based on protein overexpression. […] Thus, based on these and related data, we conclude that MCTP is an ER resident protein, distributed on the ER throughout motoneurons.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
