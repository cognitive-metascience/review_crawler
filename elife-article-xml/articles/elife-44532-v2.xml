homeostasis – begins with folding of the proinsulin precursor, including formation of three evolutionarily conserved intramolecular disulfide bonds. Remarkably, normal pancreatic islets contain a subset of proinsulin molecules bearing at least one free cysteine thiol. In human (or rodent) islets with a perturbed endoplasmic reticulum folding environment, non-native proinsulin enters intermolecular disulfide-linked complexes. In genetically obese mice with otherwise wild-type islets, disulfide-linked complexes of proinsulin are more abundant, and leptin receptor-deficient mice, the further increase of such complexes tracks with the onset of islet insulin deficiency and diabetes. Proinsulin-Cys(B19) and Cys(A20) are necessary and sufficient for the formation of proinsulin disulfide-linked complexes; indeed, proinsulin Cys(B19)-Cys(B19) covalent homodimers resist reductive dissociation, highlighting a structural basis for aberrant proinsulin complex formation. We conclude that increased proinsulin misfolding via disulfide-linked complexes is an early event associated with prediabetes that worsens with ß-cell dysfunction in type two diabetes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44532.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our body fine-tunes the amount of sugar in our blood thanks to specialized ‘beta cells’ in the pancreas, which can release a hormone called insulin. To produce insulin, the beta cells first need to build an early version of the molecule – known as proinsulin – inside a cellular compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum. This process involves the formation of internal staples that keep the molecule of proinsulin folded correctly.</p><p>Individuals developing type 2 diabetes have spikes of sugar in their blood, and so their bodies often respond by trying to make large amounts of insulin. After a while, the beta cells can fail to keep up, which brings on the full-blown disease.</p><p>However, scientists have discovered that early in type 2 diabetes, the endoplasmic reticulum of beta cells can already show signs of stress; yet, the exact causes of this early damage are still unknown. To investigate this, Arunagiri et al. looked into whether proinsulin folds correctly during the earliest stages of type 2 diabetes. Biochemical experiments showed that even healthy beta cells contained some misfolded proinsulin molecules, where the molecular staples that should fold proinsulin internally were instead abnormally linking proinsulin molecules together. Further work revealed that the misfolded proinsulin was accumulating inside the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, obese mice that were in the earliest stages of type 2 diabetes had the highest levels of abnormal proinsulin in their beta cells.</p><p>Overall, the work by Arunagiri et al. suggests that large amounts of proinsulin molecules stapling themselves to each other in the endoplasmic reticulum of beta cells could be an early hallmark of the disease, and could make it get worse. A separate study by Jang et al. also shows that a protein that limits the misfolding of proinsulin is key to maintain successful insulin production in animals eating a Western-style, high fat diet.</p><p>Hundreds of millions of people around the world have type 2 diabetes, and this number is rising quickly. Detecting and then fixing early problems associated with the condition may help to stop the disease in its track.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>GRP78</kwd><kwd>disulfide bonds</kwd><kwd>prediabetes</kwd><kwd>protein trafficking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK111174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsai</surname><given-names>Billy</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Ming</given-names></name><name><surname>Arvan</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R24DK110973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Itkin-Ansari</surname><given-names>Pamela</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaufman</surname><given-names>Randal J</given-names></name><name><surname>Arvan</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK48280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arvan</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000901</institution-id><institution>Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2-SRA-2018-539-A-B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arvan</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proinsulin misfolding, an established cause of diabetes in patients with INS gene mutations, is now observed in normal human pancreatic islets, and rodents with genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The progression of β-cell dysfunction with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in prediabetes, to ß-cell failure with full-blown type two diabetes (T2D), has long been the subject of intensive investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fonseca et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rabhi et al., 2014</xref>). What is observed is that a chronic increase in insulin secretory demand over time leads to depletion of ß-cell secretory granule reserves despite a dramatic compensatory increase in secretory pathway activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alarcon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rustenbeck, 2002</xref>). By electron microscopy, pancreatic sections of human subjects with T2D show a marked increase of ER volume density in β-cells with an induction of ER stress markers triggered by high glucose exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marchetti et al., 2007</xref>). Similar indicators of ER stress have been established in the β-cells of animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2016</xref>), such as leptin receptor-deficient diabetic mice [known as LepR<italic><sup>db/db</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diani et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laybutt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Like and Chick, 1970</xref>) that develop insulin resistance progressing to T2D, which is linked to overeating. Hypersynthesis of proinsulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arunagiri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Back et al., 2009</xref>) is a condition proposed to increase proinsulin misfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scheuner et al., 2005</xref>) — which can promote ER stress with abnormal ß-cell ER expansion — whereas suppression of proinsulin protein synthesis actually alleviates ß-cell ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Szabat et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Insulin-deficiency caused directly by proinsulin misfolding has been proved unequivocally in an autosomal-dominant form of diabetes known as Mutant <italic>INS</italic>-gene-induced Diabetes of Youth (MIDY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2010b</xref>), which occurs in patients bearing one mutant and one wild-type <italic>INS</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Støy et al., 2010</xref>). The disease in humans is pathogenetically identical to that seen in the mutant <italic>Akita</italic> diabetic mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Izumi et al., 2003</xref>) or Munich MIDY Pig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blutke et al., 2017</xref>) – which are animals expressing one mutant <italic>INS</italic> allele encoding proinsulin-C(A7)Y that is quantitatively misfolded due to an inability to form the Cys(B7)-Cys(A7) disulfide bond. Ordinarily the expression of only one WT <italic>INS</italic> allele would be sufficient to avoid diabetes, but <italic>Akita</italic> mice develop diabetes despite expressing three alleles encoding WT proinsulin in addition to the one encoding mutant proinsulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2010b</xref>). Both preclinical and clinical data prove that in MIDY, it is the expression of misfolded proinsulin that triggers diabetes; yet MIDY is a rare disease. Of far broader significance is the β-cell failure that accompanies ‘garden variety’ T2D without <italic>INS</italic> mutations, and though the molecular pathogenesis of insulin deficiency in this condition remains murky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Halban et al., 2014</xref>), β-cell ER stress is a recognized part of the disease. It has been suggested that β-cells compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin production that may eventually overwhelm the ER capacity for efficient protein folding, thereby provoking β-cell ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Back and Kaufman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eizirik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herbert and Laybutt, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Papa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rabhi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Volchuk and Ron, 2010</xref>). However, in the absence of <italic>INS</italic> gene mutations, it has not been established the extent to which proinsulin misfolding is present in the early triggering stages of T2D, including prediabetes and mild dysglycemia — prior to more obvious islet failure including β-cell degranulation and dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accili et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kahn, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kahn et al., 2009</xref>) that occurs in both human islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cinti et al., 2016</xref>) and rodent islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishida et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we have exploited several independent lines of evidence to establish the presence of aberrant disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes in the β-cells of human islets and model systems, in states that alter the ER folding environment, and in T2D progression prior to onset of β-cell dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bensellam et al., 2018</xref>) or death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eizirik and Millard, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kanekura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marchetti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Papa, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Proinsulin in the ER has reactive cysteine thiols and is predisposed to aberrant Disulfide-Linked complex formation</title><p>Both murine islets and the INS1 (rat) pancreatic ß-cell line cells secrete successfully-folded proinsulin in addition to processed insulin. Native proinsulin folding requires formation of Cys(B7)-Cys(A7), Cys(B19)-Cys(A20) and Cys(A6)-Cys(A11) disulfide pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haataja et al., 2016</xref>). One way to detect improperly folded wild-type proinsulin in pancreatic β-cells is to look for the possible presence of unpaired Cys residues. Alkylation of proinsulin Cys residues with 4-acetamido-4'-maleimidyl-stilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (AMS) adds 0.5 kD of molecular mass for each cysteine modified, shifting proinsulin from its normal molecular mass. As examined by immunoblotting with anti-proinsulin antibody, no modification by AMS could be detected in secreted recombinant human proinsulin or proinsulin from rodent islets, or INS cells (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Remarkably, however, alkylation of intracellular proinsulin with AMS in human islets caused a decrease in unmodified proinsulin accompanied by the appearance of proinsulin alkylated on at least one cysteine thiol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Alkylation of intracellular proinsulin was also observed in rodent islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The presence of a free thiol in a significant subpopulation of proinsulin molecules can lead to inappropriate intermolecular disulfide attack on neighboring proinsulin molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cunningham et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 1999</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44532.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Detection of improperly folded proinsulin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Non-diabetic human pancreatic islets were lysed in RIPA buffer and divided into three equal parts, one of which was (partially) pre-reduced by boiling in the presence of 2 mM DTT (<italic>lane 3</italic>).

Indeed, WT proinsulin is predisposed to misfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haataja et al., 2016</xref>). Proinsulin misfolding has not been demonstrated to be exacerbated in ß-cells deficient for Ire1 or ATF6, but it has been repeatedly found to be exacerbated in ß-cells with dysfunctional PERK (caused either by gene knockout, dominant-negative mutant, or specific chemical inhibitor) — leading to what has been described as the ‘proinsulin-impacted-ER’ phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scheuner et al., 2005</xref>). We performed immunoblotting of nonreducing SDS-PAGE samples with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes rodent proinsulin but not insulin (mAb CCI-17, <italic>see</italic> Materials and methods), with the intent to identify intermolecular disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes. Immunoblotting of either untreated ß-cells or those treated with vehicle alone detected proinsulin monomers and disulfide-linked dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> <italic>left</italic>) the latter of which are, by definition, non-native. Moreover, whereas inhibition of PERK dramatically increased the intracellular accumulation of proinsulin and shifted its distribution to the classic impacted-ER phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>), a remarkable ladder of higher molecular mass bands appeared upon Western blotting with mAb anti-proinsulin after nonreducing SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> <italic>left</italic>). Despite this increase of intracellular proinsulin, secretion of proinsulin to the medium was not increased; furthermore, by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, secreted proinsulin was recovered exclusively as the monomeric form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> <italic>right</italic>), demonstrating efficient quality control in the secretory pathway. The intracellular accumulation of a ladder of proinsulin immunoreactive species upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE was not detected by conventional Western blotting with polyclonal anti-insulin, despite that this antibody identifies both proinsulin and proinsulin conversion intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> <italic>left</italic>). However, dimers and higher order complexes were detected by Western blotting of the identical samples with mAb anti-proinsulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> <italic>right</italic>), and all such higher bands, comprising the majority of intracellular proinsulin molecules, collapsed to monomers upon reduction of disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that the ladder of Western blotted bands detected by nonreducing SDS-PAGE specifically reflects disulfide-linked complexes of proinsulin, a similarly-generated sample was analyzed on a second-dimensional reducing SDS-PAGE, which demonstrated that nearly all bands in the nonreduced ladder contained proinsulin, with molecular masses expected of disulfide-linked complexes as simple as homodimers, homotrimers, homotetramers, and homopentamers, as well as higher order complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Quantitatively these complexes comprised 87% of all recovered proinsulin. This is very similar to what has been reported for the islets of <italic>Akita</italic> mice that express misfolded proinsulin from one mutant allele that entraps wild-type proinsulin expressed from three wild-type alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Izumi et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, Western blotting of nonreduced lysates of <italic>Akita</italic> mouse islets with anti-proinsulin demonstrated that the majority of proinsulin was recovered in aberrant disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), which were converted to monomeric proinsulin upon SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions.</p><p>To confirm that even in the absence of <italic>INS</italic> gene mutations, formation of disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes constitutes improper proinsulin folding, we exposed INS1 pancreatic beta cells to PERK inhibitor for times up to 20 hr. With increasing time of exposure, the majority of intracellular proinsulin accumulated in disulfide-linked complexes in the ß-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> <italic>second panel</italic>), and this increase was ultimately accompanied by decreased insulin content (<italic>third panel</italic>) as well as decreased proinsulin secretion (<italic>final panel</italic>). These observations are consistent with ER quality control limiting the ER export of misfolded proinsulin resulting in diminished delivery to post-Golgi sites (including the extracellular medium, also noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Significantly, treatment of intracellular proinsulin dimers and larger complexes with AMS, followed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, revealed that each of the oligomeric species in the ladder of bands shifted up after alkylation, indicating that each of these forms still bears at least one unpaired cysteine thiol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These data provide a rationale for the propagation of disulfide-linked dimers into trimers, trimers into tetramers, etc. We found that pretreatment of cells with NEM before (and during) cell lysis results in the detection of dramatically less of the ladder of disulfide-linked proinsulin oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) — and additionally, NEM pretreatment favors an increase in the detection of higher molecular weight proinsulin-containing complexes. Nevertheless, the relative abundance of the distinct disulfide-linked oligomeric species of proinsulin was essentially unchanged in cells that were either alkylated in situ with 20 mM N-ethyl maleimide prior to cell lysis, or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These data render it unlikely that the detection of aberrant disulfide-linked complexes of nonmutant proinsulin is an artifact of cell lysis conditions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44532.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Formation of proinsulin disulfide-linked complexes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) INS1E cells were incubated for 20 hr in culture medium; the last 0, 5, 10, or 20 hr of this incubation included PERK inhibitor as indicated.

Although five of the six Cys residues could make a homotypic covalent association, Cys(A7) preferred not to make the disulfide bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> <italic>left panel</italic>; quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

We establish that proinsulin misfolding includes the inability to successfully complete its three internal disulfide bonds, with a subfraction of proinsulin molecules in the ER bearing unpaired cysteine residues. This population of improperly folded proinsulin molecules enters into aberrant disulfide-linked partnerships with other proinsulin molecules in the ER, resulting in misfolded proinsulin complexes that are for the first time identified in the islets of human beings.</p><p>There is strong reason to believe that proinsulin disulfide-linked complex formation provides a status report on the health of the ß-cell ER folding environment. Many studies point to the idea that the activity of ER stress (UPR) sensor proteins are required to actively maintain a proper ER chaperone and oxidoreductase environment for optimal proinsulin folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hassler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sowers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsuchiya et al., 2018</xref>). Recent work indicates that protein disulfide isomerase is one of the ER luminal factors that regulates the balance of proinsulin disulfide-linked complexes and monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jang et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, BiP plays a central role in ER stress sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin-Wetzel et al., 2017</xref>). We show here that even a modest decrease of BiP levels results in improperly folded proinsulin rapidly accumulating in disulfide-linked complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), supporting that proinsulin folding is highly sensitive to changes in the ER folding environment, which can include excessive proinsulin biosynthesis, altered chaperone and/or oxidoreductase expression, and changes in the rate of clearance of misfolded proinsulin molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arunagiri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). We believe that these and other ER luminal factors are needed to enhance the efficiency of formation of the proinsulin intramolecular Cys(B19)-Cys(A20) disulfide bond.

However, those complexes bearing a homotypic Cys(B19)-Cys(B19) covalent bond are likely to be the most difficult to successfully isomerize, as this bond cannot be broken in vitro even in the presence of SDS plus 200 mM DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>A specific goal of T2D research is to better understand the natural history of ß-cell failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Halban et al., 2014</xref>).

We note that we have been unable to detect secreted proinsulin that can be alkylated with AMS, or that is recovered in disulfide-linked complexes, even from islets or cells in which proinsulin has accumulated intracellularly in disulfide-linked complexes at massive levels. However, experiments such as these will need to be rigorously tested with islets from human T2D subjects, as these patients are known to have abnormally high levels of immunoreactive proinsulin in the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Porte and Kahn, 2001</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our data establish the presence of a previously underappreciated population of aberrant proinsulin complexes that accumulates in prediabetic conditions and persists until ß-cell failure ensues. We note that the proinsulin complexes defined by nonreducing SDS-PAGE highlight a core of covalently-associated proteins; further work will be needed to explore additional protein partners including those that may be noncovalently associated. Nevertheless, the data presented herein establish disulfide-linked complexes of proinsulin as one of the earliest tissue biomarkers indicating ß-cell secretory pathway dysfunction, which is associated with ER stress and ultimate insulin deficiency that occurs in the natural progression of T2D.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>AMS, DTT, N-ethylmaleimide, PERK inhibitor (GSK2656157), MG132, Cycloheximide, and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or ThermoFisher Scientific.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Proinsulin misfolding is an early event in the progression to Type 2 Diabetes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Reid Gilmore as the Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Arunagiri and colleagues have investigated the formation of misfolded proinsulin complexes during the development and progression of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). They found that native proinsulin forms intermolecular disulfide bonds in murine and human islets and show that this process is enhanced when the ER folding machinery is disrupted. The authors have determined that aggregate formation is linked to the generation of non-native disulfides involving B19 and A20. Importantly, the authors show in two models of diabetes that disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes accumulate during early stages of diabetes prior to development of hyperglycemia suggesting that formation of misfolded proinsulin complexes is an early event in the course of diabetes that might have a role in the β-cell dysfunction. The findings are novel and interesting; however, additional experiments are required to clarify the impact of these complexes on β-cell stress and function.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The majority of data is based on non-reducing SDS-PAGE immunoblots. The authors performed multiple experiments to demonstrate the specificity of the assay. The authors should reconsider their interpretation of the experiments shown in Figure 2C. The NEM treatment prior to cell lysis (lane 2) seems to stabilize very large aggregates (&gt;pentamers). Cell lysis without blocking free thiols favors formation of the proinsulin ladders (dimers to pentamers) at the expense of the larger aggregates presumably due to reductants in the cytosol. The observation that higher order aggregates are predominant does not detract from the manuscript, nor does it alter the conclusion that proinsulin aggregates are a not an artifact of cell lysis. The 2X lane does not appear very informative, as it doesn't support the author's view that the relative abundance of the proinsulin forms are similar (w/wo NEM) unless you ignore the large aggregates.</p><p>2) In human islets, the majority of proinsulin appears as dimers, rather than monomers even before treatment with SubAB (Figure 3D). Please explain.</p><p>3) The immunofluorescence microscopy figure (Figure 4C) showing islets from wild type and db/db mice could be improved by adding additional panels to solidify the author's conclusion that proinsulin accumulates in the ER of db/db, fed mouse islets. Specifically, it would be important to add a panel showing IF for proinsulin, calnexin and merge, as well as a second panel showing proinsulin, GM130 and merge for both the db/db fed and db/db fasted conditions. Preferably, these additional images would be incorporated into the main-text figure (Figure 4C), perhaps replacing the second panels that are currently shown for the fed and fasted conditions. Alternatively, these panels could be incorporated into the supplemental figure (Figure S3) that shows the quantitative analysis of proinsulin/calnexin colocalization for the db/db mice, fed and fasted conditions.</p><p>4) A central feature of the author's model is that the accumulation of disulfide-linked proinsulin aggregates is an early event in T2D that causes activation of the UPR pathway. The reviewers concluded that it would be important to document increased ER stress in islets from the db/db mice at the same stages of T2D progression that were analyzed for insulin expression and proinsulin aggregate formation (Figure 4D). Specifically, is BiP expression already elevated in islets from mice that have normal blood glucose levels, but &gt;90% proinsulin aggregates. BiP expression could either be evaluated by immunofluoresence microscopy, or by protein immunoblotting.</p><p>5) The manuscript is written as if it is targeted for diabetes experts. Better background with logic developed should be provided for certain tools such as the Akita mouse and Leptin receptor mutant line to enhance readability by a wider audience.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44532.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The majority of data is based on non-reducing SDS-PAGE immunoblots.

We have more explicitly stated this point in the Results, consistent with the reviewers’ comments. Additionally, as requested, we have removed the overexposure lane “2X” (and altered the Figure Legend accordingly).</p><p>To continue with this point, there are two alternative possibilities that the reviewers seek to bring to our attention: our hypothesis that upon PERK inhibitor treatment or other disorders of ER homeostasis, disulfidelinked proinsulin oligomers are abundant in the cells but their detection with our antibodies is inhibited by alkylation with NEM, and the reviewers’ alternative that proinsulin oligomers are formed by dissolution of higher molecular weight complexes and it is their formation that is inhibited (by consumption of putative cytosolic reductants) upon NEM treatment. The reviewers have asked that we give further consideration to this sentence from our main text, which said: “The <italic><underline>relative</underline></italic> abundance of the distinct disulfide-linked <italic>oligomeric species</italic> of proinsulin was essentially unchanged in cells that were either alkylated <italic>in situ</italic> with 20 mM N-ethyl maleimide prior to cell lysis, or not (Figure 2C)“. Our sentence did not address the higher molecular weight complexes but rather the relative abundance of monomers, dimers, trimers, etc., so our sentence was actually correct as written. But the reviewers’ comment prompted us to consider the alternatives proposed above, which led us to perform new experiments, described below.</p><p>First, when we treat cells with NEM, there is indeed an increase in the highest molecular weight proinsulin complexes, but it is sufficiently modest that on a light exposure like that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> (Panel A), the band intensity increase of the higher molecular weight complexes is almost undetectable, and does not account for the loss of signal in the lower molecular weight ladder of disulfide-linked proinsulin bands. Second, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> (Panel B), identical wells of INS1 β cells incubated O/N with PERK inhibitor were treated one of three ways: (1) we allowed the lysate to remain on ice for one hour before adding sample buffer and running the gel (first and third lanes) – we have checked this previously and can confirm that this has no impact on the appearance of the ladder of disulfide-linked proinsulin bands. (2) we pre-treated cells with NEM before (and during) lysis (second lane), exactly as done in the manuscript Figure 2C which attracted the reviewers’ comment, or (3) we allowed the lysate to remain on ice for one hour, exactly as in lane 1, and only afterwards treated the lysate with 2 mM NEM (last lane, marked with asterisk).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44532.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44532-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Then all were resolved by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (moreover, we always treat the nonreducing gel, after it has finished running, with 25 mM DTT to reduce all possible disulfide complexes prior to electrotransfer and immunoblotting). NEM pretreatment before lysis caused a drastic loss of the detection of the proinsulin ladder of bands (second lane), consistent with the reviewers’ comment. However, initiating NEM treatment of lysates 1 hour post-lysis yielded a similar loss of detection of the ladder of disulfide-linked proinsulin oligomeric bands (panel B, lane 4) (by reducing SDS-PAGE the reduced monomeric proinsulin band is comparably recovered in all samples, as in panel A). This result has been repeated and confirmed x 3. The cytosolic volume of a cell is on the order of 1 picoliter, so at the time of cell lysis, reductants of the cytosol (glutathione, etc.) are suddenly released but thereafter are drastically diluted. If the lower molecular weight ladder of disulfide-linked proinsulin bands is formed by dissolution of higher molecular weight complexes at the time of lysis in the absence of NEM, then this should have happened in the latter condition; however, this was not observed. We’ve also obtained the very same result by treating with 2 mM NEM after SDS gel-sample buffer has already been mixed with the lysate sample. To us, these data suggest that alkylation impairs detection of the lower molecular weight ladder of bands with our antibodies. We don’t seek to exclude the reviewers’ point of view, indeed, we have not elaborated on this point in the manuscript – but we want the reviewers to understand our thought process. Additionally, we strongly agree with the reviewers and thank them for their point that the finding of higher order aggregates (which are actually enriched in live cells treated with NEM or treated with menadione — as shown in a companion manuscript) does not alter our conclusion that disulfidelinked proinsulin complexes are not an artifact of cell lysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In human islets, the majority of proinsulin appears as dimers, rather than monomers even before treatment with SubAB (Figure 3D). Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers’ point is well taken. Unlike our work in congenic mice or β cell lines which have a smaller range of variability between samples, the results of islets isolated and shipped from genetically (and environmentally) unrelated human donors do vary meaningfully, so we must not assume that an identical result should be obtained for all humans. We have now analyzed a few additional human islet preps. In the nonreducing SDS-PAGE shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> (panel A) at right, human islet prep #1 reveals proinsulin monomers, which are nearly undetectable in islet prep #2 from an unrelated human donor. Similarly, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> (panel B) we obtained a human islet prep in which proinsulin monomer was the primarily species detected, until the islets were incubated overnight with PERK inhibitor. These experiments have now been added as Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1. We also note that in rodent β cells, covalent proinsulin dimers were routinely detected (see Figure 1B of the manuscript). The proinsulin disulfidelinked complexes are a biomarker of proinsulin misfolding; however, whereas we prepare rodent islets (or β cell lines) ourselves, we obtain human islets from external sources and we do not control clinical conditions at the time of obtaining the pancreas (needless to say, no healthy living person willingly gives up their pancreas!). Moreover, even when the clinical record of human patients shows no evidence of diabetes, that alone does not assure metabolic uniformity between different individuals, nor does it address any technical differences between human islet preparations. All in all, this does not alter our conclusion that the recovery of proinsulin covalent dimers from the islets of non-diabetic humans strongly suggests that proinsulin misfolding can occur in normal β cells without <italic>INS</italic> gene mutations, and this can occur prior to the detectable onset of diabetes.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44532.024</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44532-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The immunofluorescence microscopy figure (Figure 4C) showing islets from wild type and db/db mice could be improved by adding additional panels to solidify the author's conclusion that proinsulin accumulates in the ER of db/db, fed mouse islets. Specifically, it would be important to add a panel showing IF for proinsulin, calnexin and merge, as well as a second panel showing proinsulin, GM130 and merge for both the db/db fed and db/db fasted conditions. Preferably, these additional images would be incorporated into the main-text figure (Figure 4C), perhaps replacing the second panels that are currently shown for the fed and fasted conditions. Alternatively, these panels could be incorporated into the supplemental figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1and Figure 8) that shows the quantitative analysis of proinsulin/calnexin colocalization for the db/db mice, fed and fasted conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the reviewers for this suggestion; we have followed the advice and added a new Figure 5—figure supplement 1 containing additional images including those suggested by the reviewers and additional comparators (note that we have changed the numbering of the Supplemental figures by instructions from the Journal, but we have not deleted any data from the manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A central feature of the author's model is that the accumulation of disulfide-linked proinsulin aggregates is an early event in T2D that causes activation of the UPR pathway. The reviewers concluded that it would be important to document increased ER stress in islets from the db/db mice at the same stages of T2D progression that were analyzed for insulin expression and proinsulin aggregate formation (Figure 4D). Specifically, is BiP expression already elevated in islets from mice that have normal blood glucose levels, but &gt;90% proinsulin aggregates. BiP expression could either be evaluated by immunofluoresence microscopy, or by protein immunoblotting.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion, thanks. As the reviewers may know, in the paper we cited about human islets (Marchetti et al., 2007), neither BiP, XBP1, or CHOP were higher in T2D β cells or isolated islets cultured at normal glucose. In <italic>db/db</italic> mice. (Laybutt et al., 2007) reported that one of the most robust ER stress response markers was the target gene DNAJC3 encoding p58ipk (also known as ERdj6). p58ipk is a cochaperone for BiP that has been studied in many labs including those of David Ron, Linda Hendershot, Markus Stoffel, Warren Ladiges, in addition to one of our own team (RJK) as well as others. The stages of T2D progression were presented in the previous Figure 5. We performed new experiments and introduced these results as new Figure 5A and 5B; the previous Figure 5 is now Figure 5C. The results are in general agreement with those reported by Ross Laybutt, Trevor Biden and others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The manuscript is written as if it is targeted for diabetes experts. Better background with logic developed should be provided for certain tools such as the Akita mouse and Leptin receptor mutant line to enhance readability by a wider audience.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this concern, we have changed words in the Abstract and Introduction to “leptin receptordeficient animals” and clarified that such animals are predisposed to hyperphagia (we used the word “overeating” that anyone can understand). Further, in the Introduction, we have modified the paragraph first referring to the <italic>Akita</italic> mouse, as follows: “Insulin-deficiency caused directly by proinsulin misfolding has been proved unequivocally in an autosomal-dominant form of diabetes known as Mutant <italic>INS</italic>-gene-induced Diabetes of Youth (MIDY) (Liu et al., 2010b), which occurs in patients bearing one mutant and one wild-type <italic>INS</italic> allele (Liu et al., 2015; Stoy et al., 2010). The disease in humans is pathogenetically identical to that seen in the mutant <italic>Akita</italic> diabetic mouse (Izumi et al., 2003) or Munich MIDY Pig (Blutke et al., 2017) – which are animals expressing one mutant <italic>INS</italic> allele encoding proinsulin-C(A7)Y that is quantitatively misfolded due to an inability to form the Cys(B7)-Cys(A7) disulfide bond. Ordinarily the expression of only one WT <italic>INS</italic> allele would be sufficient to avoid diabetes, but <italic>Akita</italic> mice develop diabetes despite expressing three alleles encoding WT proinsulin in addition to the one encoding mutant proinsulin (Liu et al., 2010b). Both preclinical and clinical data prove that in MIDY, it is the expression of misfolded proinsulin that triggers diabetes…”</p></body></sub-article></article>
