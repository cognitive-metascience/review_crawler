rodents. MRAP2 mediates its action in part through the potentiation of the MC4R, however, it is clear that MRAP2 is expressed in tissues that do not express MC4R, and that the deletion of MRAP2 does not recapitulate the phenotype of <italic>Mc4r</italic> KO mice. Consequently, we hypothesized that other GPCRs involved in the control of energy homeostasis are likely to be regulated by MRAP2. In this study we identified PKR1 as the first non-melanocortin GPCR to be regulated by MRAP2. We show that MRAP2 significantly and specifically inhibits PKR1 signaling. We also demonstrate that PKR1 and MRAP2 co-localize in neurons and that <italic>Mrap2</italic> KO mice are hypersensitive to PKR1 stimulation. This study not only identifies new partners of MRAP2 but also a new pathway through which MRAP2 regulates energy homeostasis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12397.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12397.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12397.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain plays a major role in controlling how much food animals eat. The nerve cells (neurons) involved in this process contain “receptors” that respond to cues from various parts of the body. For example, a receptor called PKR1 acts to limit food intake. The activities of PKR1 and other receptors are tightly regulated in cells, but it is not clear how this works.</p><p>A protein called MRAP2 is known to regulate the activity of a receptor that regulates food intake and energy use in the brain. However, MRAP2 may also interact with other receptors to control food intake. Here, Chaly, Srisai et al. investigated whether MRAP2 can regulate the activity of PKR1 in animal cells and rodents.</p><p>The experiments show that MRAP2 can interact with and inhibit the activity of PKR1. Furthermore, both MRAP2 and PKR1 can be found in the same neurons. Mutant mice that lack the gene that encodes MRAP2 have higher levels of PKR1 activity and eat less than normal mice when PKR1 is stimulated. Together the experiments suggest that MRAP2 can increase food intake by preventing PKR1 from being activated in the brain. The next steps are to find out if this protein regulates other receptors involved in the control of food intake, and to test whether PKR1 and MRAP2 also play a role in regulating energy usage.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12397.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12397.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>melanocortin</kwd><kwd>MRAP2</kwd><kwd>accessory protein</kwd><kwd>prokineticin</kwd><kwd>PKR1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fraternal Order of Eagles Diabetes Research Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sebag</surname><given-names>Julien A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Carver Trust Young Investigator award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sebag</surname><given-names>Julien A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A non-melanocortin G-protein coupled receptor is inhibited by the Melanocortin Receptor Accessory Protein 2 (MRAP2) to control food intake in mammals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) are responsible for a wide variety of physiological functions, and their activity is precisely regulated, not only by their ligands (agonists and in some cases antagonists) but also by other factors including G-proteins, β-arrestins, kinases, lipids, ions and accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">van der Westhuizen et al., 2015</xref>). GPCR accessory proteins are single-pass transmembrane proteins that regulate trafficking and/or signaling of the receptors to which they bind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cooray et al., 2009</xref>). A few examples include: the receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPs), which promote the trafficking and ligand specificity of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor/adrenomedullin receptor and several other GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Parameswaran and Spielman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sexton et al., 2006</xref>); the receptor transporting proteins (RTPs), which promote the trafficking of odorant and taste receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Saito et al., 2004</xref>); and the melanocortin receptor accessory proteins (MRAPs), whose known roles prior to this study were limited to the regulation of trafficking and signaling of melanocortin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Metherell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sebag and Hinkle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sebag et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cerdá-Reverter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asai et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Two MRAPs exist in mammals. MRAP1 is expressed in few tissues like adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xu et al., 2002</xref>) and the adrenal glands, where it is essential for proper trafficking and signaling of the melanocortin-2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Metherell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sebag and Hinkle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sebag and Hinkle, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2009b</xref>). MRAP2 is likewise expressed in the adrenal glands, but also in the brain and other tissues. Unlike MRAP1, the physiological functions and binding partners of MRAP2 are largely unknown. MRAPs display a remarkable topology: they are inserted in the plasma membrane in both the N<sub>out</sub>/C<sub>in</sub> and N<sub>in</sub>/C<sub>out</sub> orientation, with MRAPs of opposite orientation forming anti-parallel homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sebag and Hinkle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2009b</xref>). This structure is important for MRAP function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sebag and Hinkle, 2009b</xref>), and so far appears to be unique to these proteins in the eukaryotic proteome.</p><p>MRAP2 is an important regulator of energy homeostasis and <italic>Mrap2</italic> KO mice develop severe obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asai et al., 2013</xref>). The mechanisms through which MRAP2 regulates energy balance have not yet been fully identified, however, they include the potentiation of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sebag et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asai et al., 2013</xref>), a protein central to the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. Notably, like their <italic>Mrap2</italic> KO counterparts, <italic>Mc4r</italic> KO mice are severely obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butler and Cone, 2003</xref>). There are however key differences between the obesity phenotypes of the two strains. In particular, the <italic>Mc4r</italic> KO mice are hyperphagic, have decreased energy expenditure and are insulin resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butler and Cone, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2003</xref>), characteristics that are absent in the <italic>Mrap2</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asai et al., 2013</xref>). These phenotypic differences suggest that MC4R is not the only effector through which MRAP2 regulates the energy state, a conclusion consistent with the fact that MRAP2 is expressed in tissues that do not express MC4R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asai et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Food intake is regulated by the activity of several GPCRs including the prokineticin receptor 1 (PKR1). Activation of PKR1 in vivo, through central or peripheral injection of its ligand prokineticin 2 (PK2), was shown to significantly decrease food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gardiner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beale et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to food intake, PKR1 plays important roles in the regulation of a variety of physiological functions including energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>), insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dormishian et al., 2013</xref>), gastrointestinal contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Li et al., 2001</xref>), nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Negri and Lattanzi, 2011</xref>), cardiovascular function and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boulberdaa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Urayama et al., 2007</xref>). Meanwhile, its orthologue PKR2 regulates placentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoffmann et al., 2007</xref>), inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denison et al., 2008</xref>) and nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Negri and Lattanzi, 2011</xref>). PKR1 and 2 couple to both the Gαs and Gαq proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ngan and Tam, 2008</xref>), and consequently signal through the cAMP as well as the IP3/calcium pathways. Even though PKR1 and PKR2 appear to have some redundant physiological functions, it was shown that only PKR1 regulates food intake since injection of PK2 retains its full anorexigenic effect in PKR2 KO mice but does not decrease food intake in PKR1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beale et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study we identify PKR1 as the first non-melanocortin receptor to be regulated by MRAP2 and discover a novel mechanism of regulation of energy homeostasis by MRAP2 through the modulation of PKR1 signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>For PKR1 signaling to be regulated by MRAP2 in-vivo, the latter needs to be expressed along with the receptor. To determine what organs express both proteins, we performed RT-PCR on mRNA extracted from several mouse tissues. MRAP2 was readily detectable in the brain (hypothalamus and pituitary gland), the adrenal glands, the lungs, the spleen and the kidneys, but also, at lower level, in the heart and the pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both PKR1 and PKR2 seem to be expressed in a large number of tissues including brain, heart, lungs, stomach, colon, kidneys, adrenals, fat and testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), thus confirming that MRAP2 and PKRs expression overlap in several organs. Because of the known involvement of both MRAP2 and PKR1 in the regulation of energy homeostasis, and the fact that both PKR1 and MRAP2 mRNA were detected in the hypothalamus, we tested if both proteins co-localized in hypothalamic neurons. In order to detect MRAP2 in brain slices we validated a commercial antibody by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). The MRAP2 antibody was validated by western blot using lysates from CHO cells transfected with mouse MRAP2-V5 or empty vector as a control. Both the MRAP2-antibody and the V5-antibody detected the same bands and no signal was detectable in the lysate of mock transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also validated the MRAP2 antibody for immunofluorescence using a GT1-1 hypothalamic neuronal cell line stably expressing GFP (GT1-1-GFP) as a control, or MRAP2 (GT1-1-MRAP2). We show that the MRAP2 antibody specifically labeled GT1-1-MRAP2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H and E</xref>) but not GT1-1-GFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E and F</xref>), further validating the specificity of the antibody. Due to the fact that the cell lines used are not clonal, not all the cells show the same intensity of staining. Unfortunately, the MRAP2 antibody could not be validated on the <italic>Mrap2</italic> KO mouse because of the way this mouse model was generated. Indeed, to produce this mouse, the cassette was inserted in the intron between exon 3 and 4 before the region coding for the transmembrane domain of MRAP2, thus allowing the N-terminal region to be produced (details can be found on the EUCOMM website). This region by itself is soluble and non-functional but can be recognized by the polyclonal MRAP2 antibody. Due to the lack of specific antibody to detect PKR1 in-vivo, we generated a mouse expressing a tagged PKR1. In order for PKR1 expression level, localization and activity to remain unchanged in this mouse model, we used the CRISPR / Cas9 technology to insert 2XHA tag immediately after the start codon of the endogenous PKR1 gene in chromosome 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). The insertion of the HA tags was verified by sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using immunofluorescence method we show that MRAP2 is readily detectable in cells of the arcuate nucleus in both WT and 2HA-<italic>Prokr1</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and N</xref>). In contrast, PKR1 was only detected, using the HA antibody, in the 2HA-<italic>Prokr1</italic> mouse, therefore validating the specificity of PKR1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and O</xref>). Finally we show that PKR1 and MRAP2 colocalize in a large number of cells in the arcuate nucleus, making it physiologically relevant to study the regulation of PKR1 by MRAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P and Q</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12397.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tissue distribution of PKRs and MRAP2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of MRAP2, PKR1 and PKR2 mRNA, measured by RT-PCR in tissues harvested from male mice.

To this end, we transfected CHO cells with 2HA-PKR1 and MRAP2-3Flag and pulled down either PKR1 with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody or MRAP2 with a monoclonal anti-Flag antibody from the cell lysates. The precipitated proteins were then identified by western blot using an anti-HA antibody to detect the receptor and an anti-flag antibody to detect MRAP2. We observed that a significant fraction of PKR1 co-immunoprecipitates with MRAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and that a large fraction of MRAP2 co-immunoprecipitates with PKR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), thus demonstrating that PKR1 and MRAP2 interact. Like MRAP1, MRAP2 is detected as two bands, one band representing the non-glycosylated form of MRAP2 and a higher band corresponding to the glycosylated form as confirmed by treatment with the deglycosylation enzyme, PNGase F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In some cases a higher molecular weight smear is detectable but the molecular identity of this band remains unclear. We verified that the bands corresponding to PKR1 in cells transfected with both PKR1 and MRAP2 matched the bands in cells transfected with PKR1 and empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and that the bands corresponding to MRAP2 in cells transfected with both PKR1 and MRAP2 matched the bands in cells transfected with MRAP2 and empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) in order to further confirm that the bands observed in the co-immunoprecipitation were in fact PKR1 and MRAP2. We then determined whether this interaction happens in live cells and identified the sub-cellular localization of the complex. To this end we used a bi-molecular fluorescence complementation assay, or BiFC. PKR1 C-terminally fused to a fragment of YFP (Y2) was co-expressed with MRAP2 C-terminally fused to the complementary fragment of YFP (Y1). Using this method fluorescence can only be achieved if PKR1 and MRAP2 come in close proximity and allow the YFP to complement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We found that, as predicted, expressing only one of the two fusion proteins did not yield any fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>), whereas YFP fluorescence was readily detectable in intracellular compartments as well as on the plasma membrane of cells expressing both fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). This result confirms that PKR1 and MRAP2 can interact in live cells.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12397.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>PKR1 and MRAP2 coimmunoprecipitation and localization in live cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B</bold>) Co-immunoprecipitation of 2HA-PKR1 and MRAP2-3Flag from transfected CHO cells.

Prokineticin receptors are coupled to both the Gαs and the Gαq signaling pathways. In the former they activate adenylyl cyclase, leading to the production of cAMP. In the latter they activate phospholipases, leading to the production of IP3 and to the release of calcium from the ER. In order to measure the effects of MRAP2 on PKRs signaling through the Gαs pathway, CHO cells were transfected with the CRE-luciferase reporter and either PKR1 or PKR2 in the presence or absence of MRAP2. We find that MRAP2 dose-dependently inhibits PKR1 efficacy and decreases its potency four to five fold with a maximum effect at a receptor to MRAP2 DNA ratio between 1:7 and 1:10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For this reason all subsequent experiments were performed at a 1:10 ratio. To further validate the inhibitory effect of MRAP2 on PKR1, we tested the effect of both human and mouse MRAP2 on cAMP production stimulated by both agonists (PK1 and PK2). Both MRAP2 isoforms inhibited PKR1 responses stimulated by either PK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) or PK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and in both cases mouse MRAP2 was a more effective inhibitor of PKR1 than human MRAP2. In the rest of the study we only use the human MRAP2 since the receptors used are the human isoforms. To rule out the possibility that MRAP2 interfered with the luciferase reporter rather than inhibiting PKR1-mediated cAMP production, we stimulated CHO cells expressing PKR1 with empty vector at a 1:10 ratio or with MRAP2 at the same ratio with increasing concentration of PK2 in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX. Accumulated cAMP was measured using the Perkin Elmer LANCE cAMP assay. This assay directly measures cAMP concentration using a TR-FRET technology and does not involve luminescence. MRAP2 inhibited PK2 responses similarly in the two assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), confirming its inhibitory role in PKR1-mediated cAMP signaling.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12397.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>MRAP2 inhibits PKR1 signaling.</title><p>CHO cells in a 10 cm dish were transfected with 2.5 μg CRE-luciferase, 225 ng PKR1 and a total of 2.25 μg of plasmids encoding MRAP2 and/or empty vector in the ratios shown.

For those experiments, we used CHO-M1 cells, which stably express the Gαq-coupled muscarinic M1 receptor; this allowed us to use the response to the M1R agonist carbachol to normalize the results and correct for possible differences in growth rates in the different transfection conditions. The assay used measures the accumulation of IP1, a degradation product of IP3, in the presence of lithium, an inhibitor of the inositol monophosphatase. We found that, as with the cAMP pathway, MRAP2 significantly inhibits PKR1-mediated IP3 production in response to both PK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and PK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This result suggests that MRAP2 can inhibit both known signaling pathways downstream of PKR1.</p><p>Since several GPCR accessory proteins have been shown to modulate GPCR trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cooray et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sexton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Metherell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sebag and Hinkle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Matsunami et al., 2009</xref>), we tested the impact of MRAP2 on PKR1 trafficking to the plasma membrane. To this end we measured both the surface density (in non-permeabilized cells) and total expression (in permeabilized cells) of 2HA-PKR1 when expressed with empty vector or with MRAP2 by fixed-cell ELISA. We found that MRAP2 decreased PKR1 expression at the cell surface by approximately 35% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Analysis of total expression revealed that the level of PKR1 is reduced in the presence of MRAP2 by 27% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). The fact that the decreases in surface and total expression of PKR1 in the presence of MRAP2 are similar suggests that MRAP2 does not significantly impact PKR1 trafficking.</p><p>We also investigated the ability of MRAP2 to regulate PKR2, a GPCR closely related to PKR1. We transfected CHO cells with 2HA- PKR2 and MRAP2-3Flag and performed a co-immunoprecipitation as described earlier. A significant fraction of PKR2 was pulled down with MRAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and conversely, a significant fraction of MRAP2 co-immunoprecipitated with PKR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As for PKR1, we confirmed that the bands observed for PKR2 and MRAP2 in the co-immunoprecipitation match the bands obtained with cells expressing either PKR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) or MRAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) alone. The interaction of PKR2 with MRAP2 was also confirmed by BiFC in cells expressing PKR2 fused to a fragment of YFP and MRAP2 fused to the complementary fragment of YFP. As expected, no YFP fluorescence was detected when only one of the two fusion proteins was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), however, YFP fluorescence was readily detectable when both fusion proteins were expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), especially in intracellular compartments, thus confirming that PKR2 and MRAP2 can form complexes in live cells. We then measured the effect of MRAP2 on PKR2 signaling in response to PK2 through both the cAMP and the IP3 pathway. MRAP2 significantly inhibited PKR2-mediated cAMP and IP3 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). It is, however, noticeable that MRAP2 inhibited the cAMP and IP3 pathways to the same extent (about 50%) with PKR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C, E and F</xref>), whereas MRAP2 inhibited the cAMP pathway more effectively than the IP3 pathway downstream of PKR2 (about 70% for cAMP vs. about 20% for IP3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). Unlike for PKR1, MRAP2 decreased PKR2 efficacy but did not significantly affect its potency. We also measured the effect of MRAP2 on PKR2 trafficking and showed that, unlike with PKR1, MRAP2 decreased the surface expression of PKR2 by over 70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>) with only 20% to 30% change in total receptor expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>), suggesting a possible effect of MRAP2 on PKR2 trafficking.

In this study we identify a non-melanocortin GPCR regulated by a member of the MRAP protein family, i.e. the prokineticin receptors. This finding not only demonstrates the importance of considering the expression of MRAP2 when studying PKRs, but also establishes that MRAPs, especially MRAP2 due to its broader tissue distribution, can regulate various GPCRs and are involved in numerous physiological functions. We also show that, unlike all the other GPCR accessory proteins (RAMPs, REEP and RTPs), which to date have been shown only to promote GPCR trafficking or signaling, MRAPs can either potentiate or inhibit the GPCRs they regulate. For example, whereas MRAP1 is required for MC2R activity, it prevents MC5R trafficking and homodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sebag and Hinkle, 2009a</xref>). In zebrafish, the two isoforms of MRAP2, zMRAP2a and zMRAP2b, have opposite effects on MC4R signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sebag et al., 2013</xref>) and here we demonstrate that mammalian MRAP2, which had previously been shown to potentiate MC4R signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asai et al., 2013</xref>), strongly inhibits PKR1 and PKR2 signaling.</p><p>GPCR accessory proteins have so far been described as potentiators of GPCR trafficking and/or signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ritter and Hall, 2009</xref>) with the exception of MRAPs. Indeed, to our knowledge, the ability to selectively potentiate a subset of GPCRs while inhibiting another is unique to MRAP proteins. As such, it will be exciting to pursue the study of the mechanisms underlying MRAP2 targeting of specific GPCRs and the directionality of the resulting regulation.</p><p>The finding that MRAP2 inhibits rather than activates PKRs was unexpected since both PKRs and MRAP2 are thought to promote leanness. In fact, knocking out PKR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Szatkowski et al., 2013</xref>) or MRAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asai et al., 2013</xref>) in mice causes obesity, and central administration of the PKR1 agonist PK2 leads to a significant decrease in food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gardiner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beale et al., 2013</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>. It is, however, important to note that Asai et al. showed that MC4R / MRAP2 double KO mice have an intermediate obesity phenotype between the <italic>Mrap2</italic> KO and the <italic>Mc4r</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asai et al., 2013</xref>). In other words, losing the function of both MRAP2 and MC4R causes a milder obesity than losing the function of MC4R alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asai et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that MRAP2 can promote weight gain through a mechanism that is distinct and independent from the regulation of the MC4R. Further arguing this hypothesis, we showed that the anorexigenic effect of PKR1 is independent of MC4R since central injection of PK2 in fasted <italic>Mc4r</italic> KO mice significantly decreased food intake. Consequently, we conclude that MRAP2-mediated inhibition of PKR1 is an important mechanism through which MRAP2 promotes hunger, energy intake and weight gain and that MRAP2 is a major component of the machinery that controls energy homeostasis. The cause of the more potent anorexigenic effect of PK2 in female compared to male <italic>Mrap2</italic> KO mice remains unclear and will require further studies. It is also important to note that PKR1 and PKR2 are expressed in many tissues and play roles in numerous physiological processes for which negative regulation by MRAP2 could be critical.</p><p>Increasingly, GPCRs are found to be regulated by accessory proteins, thus strongly suggesting that the importance of this mode of receptor regulation is underestimated. Moreover, our study indicates that accessory proteins not only potentiate, but can also inhibit receptor signaling. For these reasons, identifying the accessory proteins that are associated with specific GPCRs is an important step in accurately determining their pharmacology. Additionally, a better understanding of GPCR regulation by accessory proteins will allow the development of more accurate and more relevant model systems for the identification of small molecules targeting receptors and will increase the likelihood of such compounds to retain their activity in vivo. Finally, this study illustrates the important role of the interaction of PKR1 and MRAP2 in the regulation of energy homeostasis and suggests that this complex may be a valuable new target for the treatment of obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Mrap2</italic> KO mice are on a C57BL/6 background and were obtained from the EUCOMM program.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Chaly and colleagues describe results from a series of studies investigating the functional interactions of melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2 (MRAP2) and the prokineticin receptor 1 (PKR1). The manuscript provides a strong series of in vitro experiments, all properly controlled, that MRAP2 directly interacts with PKR1 and PKR2 and MRAP2 inhibits the activity of the prokineticin receptors through both Gs and Gq signaling pathways. There was little evidence for altered trafficking of PKR1 to the cell surface, while MRAP2 decreased the cell surface expression of PKR2. These are novel and potentially important findings as they demonstrate interaction of MRAP2 with a non-melanocortin receptor, and they show inhibition of PKR signaling instead of activation, as with the melanocortin receptors. The studies are well described and performed and provide novel information that may be of wide interest. A few issues need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The majority of the signaling and interaction data is done using heterologous cell systems. While this is clearly useful and understandable the in vivo data is less developed. They report extensive co-expression of the PKRs and MRAP2 at the tissue level, and in individual cells in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. On the basis of the latter finding, the authors then tested whether icv injection of PK2 had differential effects on short-term food intake in wild-type and MRAP2 KO mice. PK2 appeared to be more potent in the MRAP2 KOs. Although somewhat supportive of the in vitro work performed with transfected CHO cells, clearly much more work beyond the scope of this manuscript will need to be done to further explore the interactions of PKRs and MRAP2 in vivo.</p><p>2) The authors use a MRAP2 antisera to demonstrate that neurons co-express PRK1 mRNA. The photos provided are somewhat difficult to discern double labeling. More importantly, the authors demonstrate specificity of the antisera by using transfected cells. It is unclear why knockout brain tissue was not used to validate the antisera.</p><p>3) Some more information is needed regarded the food intake paradigms. Specifically, is PK2 known to cause non-specific effects such as malaise or sickness like behavior when given at higher doses? If this has been described in the literature (or not) should be discussed at a minimum.</p><p>4) Another concern with the Introduction to the paper is why the authors focused on PKRs in the first place. There are many GPCRs to test, but no specific rationale was provided to go after PKRs in the first place. It might make more sense to first present the expression data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, then proceed with the other data figures.</p><p>5) Another concern is the immunoprecipitation studies of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In particular, the HA-PKR1 that co-immunoprecipitates with MRAP2-Flag appears as three bands, which are labeled as &quot;Glyco PKR1&quot; and Non-GlycoPKR1&quot;. The immunoprecipitated HA-PKR1 of panel C also appears as multiple bands. Would those bands collapse to one band with the predicted molecular weight of PKR1 when the immunoprecipitated samples are de-glycosylated? In the absence of such experiments the designation of the bands remains to be demonstrated. Similar considerations apply to the MRAP2 bands and, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, to the PKR2 bands. In general, given the multiple bands, the IP experiments should be validated by carrying out the Western Blot analysis with primary antibodies directly conjugated to POD, or by other approaches to eliminate the confusing contribution of the background IgG bands.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the meaning of *** in panels G and H is unclear. Is this a post-hoc test, comparing what to what? Panels B and C are missing a control of PKR2 and mMRAP2 at ratio of 1:0. Vmax is cleared decreased in a dose response manner, what about ED50? This point is worth some discussion in the text.</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> was the hMRAP2 construct used for these experiments with PKR2, but in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, mMRAP2 was used in combination with PKR2?</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. It would be preferable to indicate the actual amount of PK2 administered, rather than the concentration of the solution. The exact statistical comparisons used here are not clear. There are multiple doses of PK2, multiple time points, two genotypes of mice and two sexes. In addition, the comparison between saline and drug is a repeated measure for each mouse.

While this is clearly useful and understandable the in vivo data is less developed. They report extensive co-expression of the PKRs and MRAP2 at the tissue level, and in individual cells in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. On the basis of the latter finding, the authors then tested whether icv injection of PK2 had differential effects on short-term food intake in wild-type and MRAP2 KO mice. PK2 appeared to be more potent in the MRAP2 KOs. Although somewhat supportive of the in vitro work performed with transfected CHO cells, clearly much more work beyond the scope of this manuscript will need to be done to further explore the interactions of PKRs and MRAP2 in vivo.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate that most of the in-vitro work is done in CHO cells and in order to confirm our findings in a more relevant system we tested the effect of MRAP2 on PKR1 trafficking and signaling in the GT1-1 hypothalamic neuronal cell line. Additionally, because another group suggested that PKR1 might be downstream of MC4R, we tested the requirement of MC4R signaling for the PKR1-mediated decrease in food intake by using MC4R KO mice. Finally, we agree with the reviewers that more work needs to be done on the role of PKR1 and MRAP2 in- vivo and that these studies are indeed out of the scope of this manuscript, however, it will be addressed in a following study on the physiology of the PKR1/MRAP2 complex.</p><p><italic>2) The authors use a MRAP2 antisera to demonstrate that neurons co-express PRK1 mRNA. The photos provided are somewhat difficult to discern double labeling. More importantly, the authors demonstrate specificity of the antisera by using transfected cells. It is unclear why knockout brain tissue was not used to validate the antisera.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that being able to use the MRAP2 KO as a negative control for the immunofluorescence would have been ideal, however, like we now clarify in the body of the manuscript, the MRAP2 KO still produces a non-functional but immunogenic fragment of MRAP2. In order to further prove the specificity of the MRAP2 antisera (in addition to the western blot previously included) we validated it for immunofluorescence using control GT1-cells (not expressing MRAP2) and GT1-1 line stably expressing MRAP2.</p><p>We also understand why the reviewers found the PKR1 staining too weak and not convincing but we were limited to in-situ hybridization due to the lack of a validated antibody raised against PKR1. In order to definitively establish the colocalization of PKR1 and MRAP2 in the brain we took advantage of a new mouse model we recently generated using CRISPR/Cas9 in which we inserted 2HA tags after the start codon of the endogenous gene, thus allowing us to detect PKR1 with the highly specific anti-HA antibody without perturbing PKR1 expression level, localization or function We hope the new microscopy results will be satisfactory.</p><p><italic>3) Some more information is needed regarded the food intake paradigms. Specifically, is PK2 known to cause non-specific effects such as malaise or sickness like behavior when given at higher doses? If this has been described in the literature (or not) should be discussed at a minimum.</italic> </p><p>We now discuss the fact that in our hands and in published work, PK2 injection has not been observed to cause malaise or sickness like behavior. It was an important point, thank you for bringing it up.</p><p> <italic>4) Another concern with the Introduction to the paper is why the authors focused on PKRs in the first place. There are many GPCRs to test, but no specific rationale was provided to go after PKRs in the first place. It might make more sense to first present the expression data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, then proceed with the other data figures.</italic> </p><p>This is a good point and even though we mention that we did test numerous GPCRs involved in energy homeostasis and found that several were not regulated by MRAP2 (specifically GLP1R, Y2R, Y5R and MC3R) we can see how this may feel random. For this reason, we went ahead and followed your advice to move <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) Another concern is the immunoprecipitation studies of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In particular, the HA-PKR1 that co-immunoprecipitates with MRAP2-Flag appears as three bands, which are labeled as &quot;Glyco PKR1&quot; and Non-GlycoPKR1&quot;. The immunoprecipitated HA-PKR1 of panel C also appears as multiple bands. Would those bands collapse to one band with the predicted molecular weight of PKR1 when the immunoprecipitated samples are de-glycosylated? In the absence of such experiments the designation of the bands remains to be demonstrated. Similar considerations apply to the MRAP2 bands and, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, to the PKR2 bands. In general, given the multiple bands, the IP experiments should be validated by carrying out the Western Blot analysis with primary antibodies directly conjugated to POD, or by other approaches to eliminate the confusing contribution of the background IgG bands.</italic> </p><p>It is true that even though most GPCRs run as several bands and that the high molecular weight smear has been shown to be a glycosylated form for many of them, we did not provide proof that it was the case for PKR1 and PKR2. In response to your comment we tried different approaches. First, we mutated the asparagine of the 2 predicted glycosylation sites to glutamine in order to prevent glycosylation of the receptors but those mutations caused the receptors to not be expressed. We then attempted to deglycosylate the receptors with PNGase F and with an Endo F1, F2, F3 mix but the receptors were mostly resistant to enzymatic deglycosylation. Because the glycosylation state of the receptors is irrelevant to our finding that MRAP2 interacts and regulate PKR1 in-vitro and in-vivo, and because we could not prove that the high molecular weight smears were glycosylated forms of the receptor, we opted to remove the label “glycosylated PKRs” from the figures. We were, however, successful in deglycosylating MRAP2 and showing that all bands collapse to the lowest molecular weight band. This result is now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Finally, to eliminate the confusion brought by the IgG bands on the co-immunoprecipitation blots, we repeated the experiments but immunoprecipitated with a mouse antibody and blotted with a rabbit primary, allowing us to use an anti-rabbit secondary that does not detect the mouse antibody used for the IP.</p><p><italic>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the meaning of *** in panels G and H is unclear. Is this a post-hoc test, comparing what to what? Panels B and C are missing a control of PKR2 and mMRAP2 at ratio of 1:0. Vmax is cleared decreased in a dose response manner, what about ED50? This point is worth some discussion in the text.</italic> </p><p>The statistics are now more detailed in the Methods section and the values that are compared are now linked by solid lines for clarity. We now discuss the effect of MRAP2 on PKR1 and PKR2 potency in the Results section. The “PKR2” label in the former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> was a typo and was supposed to read “PKR1” and the control for PKR1 is present in the same graph. Thank you for noticing our mistake and allowing us to fix it.</p><p><italic>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> was the hMRAP2 construct used for these experiments with PKR2, but in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, mMRAP2 was used in combination with PKR2?</italic> </p><p>In the former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> we used hMRAP2 with PKR2. Also, in our previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, PKR2 was a typo – it was in fact PKR1 that was tested with both human and mouse MRAP2. Thank you for noticing this mistake and allowing us to fix it.</p><p><italic>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. It would be preferable to indicate the actual amount of PK2 administered, rather than the concentration of the solution. The exact statistical comparisons used here are not clear. There are multiple doses of PK2, multiple time points, two genotypes of mice and two sexes. In addition, the comparison between saline and drug is a repeated measure for each mouse. Please expand on the statistical analyses here beyond a one-way ANOVA as indicated in the figure legend.
