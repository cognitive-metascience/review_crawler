ZRS enhancer. Here, we examine in mouse and in a mouse limb-derived cell line the dynamic events that activate and restrict the spatial activity of the ZRS. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling in the distal limb primes the ZRS at early embryonic stages maintaining a poised, but inactive state broadly across the distal limb mesenchyme. The E26 transformation-specific transcription factor, ETV4, which is induced by FGF signalling and acts as a repressor of ZRS activity, interacts with the histone deacetylase HDAC2 and ensures that the poised ZRS remains transcriptionally inactive. Conversely, GABPα, an activator of the ZRS, recruits p300, which is associated with histone acetylation (H3K27ac) indicative of an active enhancer. Hence, the primed but inactive state of the ZRS is induced by FGF signalling and in combination with balanced histone modification events establishes the restricted, active enhancer responsible for patterning the limb bud during development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28590.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As an animal embryo develops, specific genes need to be switched on and off at the right time and place to ensure that the embryo’s tissues and organs form properly. Proteins called transcription factors control the activity of individual genes by binding to regions of DNA known as enhancers. Changes in the way DNA is packaged inside cells can affect the ability of transcription factors to access the enhancers, and therefore also influence when particular genes are switched on or off.</p><p>Sonic hedgehog (or <italic>Shh</italic> for short) is a gene that helps to control various aspects of development including the formation of the limbs and brain. The limb forms from a structure in the embryo referred to as the limb bud. An enhancer called ZRS regulates the precise position within the limb bud where the <italic>Shh</italic> gene is active in a region designated as the “zone of polarizing activity”. Yet, it was not known how the enhancer is controlled to ensure this pattern is achieved. Peluso et al. investigated the events that lead to ZRS becoming active in mice embryos.</p><p>The experiments show that the ZRS enhancer exists in three different states in cells across the limb bud: poised, active and inactive. The enhancer is poised in a broad region of the limb bud in cells that are potentially able to switch on the <italic>Shh</italic> gene. Proteins called fibroblast growth factors drive the enhancer to enter this poised state by altering the way the DNA containing the enhancer is packaged in the cell. Specific transcription factors are able to bind to the poised enhancer and it is the balance between these different transcription factors that activates the enhancer in the zone of polarizing activity. Furthermore in the region of the limb bud where the fibroblast growth factors are not present the ZRS is inactive.</p><p>These findings show that fibroblast growth factors, in combination with other changes to the ZRS enhancer, restrict the area in which the enhancer is active to a particular region of the limb bud. Differences in enhancer elements are known to underlie a range of inherited characteristics and may influence whether an individual develops many common diseases. In the future, investigating how cells control the activity of enhancers may provide clues to identifying new targets for drugs to treat some of these diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>histone acetylation</kwd><kwd>ETS factors</kwd><kwd>Shh</kwd><kwd>ZRS</kwd><kwd>Enhancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peluso</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name><name><surname>Douglas</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name><name><surname>Hill</surname><given-names>Alison</given-names></name><name><surname>De Angelis</surname><given-names>Carlo</given-names></name><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>Benjamin L</given-names></name><name><surname>Grimes</surname><given-names>Graeme</given-names></name><name><surname>Petrovich</surname><given-names>Giulia</given-names></name><name><surname>Essafi</surname><given-names>Abdelkader</given-names></name><name><surname>Hill</surname><given-names>Robert E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>FGF signalling is responsible for priming the developmental enhancer ZRS across the distal limb mesenchyme during development, allowing ETS factors to modulate its activity through balancing histone acetylation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spatial specific gene expression is fundamental to controlling cell identity in embryonic tissue. Early in the mesenchyme of the developing mammalian limb bud there are no observable morphological differences or histological boundaries; nevertheless, the limb bud is initially polarized along the anterior-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tickle, 2015</xref>) establishing a specialized compartment of cells at the posterior margin called the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA). The function of the ZPA is the expression of <italic>Shh</italic>, which operates as a morphogen and a mitogen to coordinate digit formation by integrating growth with digit specification during limb development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Towers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). A highly conserved ~780 bp enhancer called the ZRS controls the spatiotemporal expression of the <italic>Shh</italic> gene in the ZPA of both the fore and hind limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lettice et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sagai et al., 2005</xref>). The ZRS lies in an intron of the ubiquitously expressed <italic>Lmbr1</italic> gene at a distance of 1 Mb from the <italic>Shh</italic> gene in human. Well over 20 different point mutations occurring in the ZRS are associated with the misregulation of <italic>Shh</italic> and consequently, to limb skeletal defects. These include preaxial polydactyly type 2 (PPD2), triphalangeal thumb polysyndactyly, syndactyly type IV, and Werner’s mesomelic syndrome, collectively referred to as ZRS-associated syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lettice et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lettice et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Farooq et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Furniss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gurnett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Semerci et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wieczorek et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The regulatory mechanisms that direct gene expression to embryonic compartments are not well established in mammalian development; therefore, to understand the events that occur, it is crucial to investigate the activation of spatiotemporal specific enhancers during this process. We previously showed that members of the E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sharrocks, 2001</xref>) are involved in the spatial pattern of <italic>Shh</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lettice et al., 2012</xref>). Occupancy at multiple ETS sites, which bind the factors GABPα and ETS1, regulates the position of the <italic>Shh</italic> expression boundary in the limb, thus defining the ZPA. In contrast, binding sites for ETV4 and ETV5 in the ZRS, when occupied, repress ectopic <italic>Shh</italic> expression outside the ZPA. A single base pair change is able to subvert this normal developmental process to give rise to skeletal abnormalities. For example, two different human PPD2 point mutations generate additional ETS binding sites, thereby, de-repressing expression of <italic>Shh</italic> in the anterior limb bud. The balance between binding of the activators and repressors is crucial for normal <italic>Shh</italic> expression and the mutations that disrupt this balance result in skeletal defects.</p><p>Analysis of developmental gene regulation must also take into account the mechanisms of long-range enhancer/promoter interactions. Previously, we showed that the ZRS contains two domains with distinct activities; one domain, the 5’ end of the ZRS (472 bp), directs the spatiotemporal activity and the second domain, the 3’ half (308 bp), is required to mediate activity over long genomic distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lettice et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally higher-order chromatin conformational changes that occur in the <italic>Shh</italic> locus play a role in gene expression. Elevated frequencies of <italic>Shh</italic>/ZRS co-localization were observed only in the <italic>Shh</italic> expressing regions of the limb bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amano et al., 2009</xref>), in a conformation consistent with enhancer-promoter loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Williamson et al., 2016</xref>). However, the domain between <italic>Shh</italic> and ZRS is highly compacted in all tissues and developmental stages analysed independent of <italic>Shh</italic> expression.</p><p>Here, we investigate the stepwise events that mediate the spatiotemporal activation of an enhancer during development. We demonstrate that even though the activity of the ZRS is restricted to the ZPA, it retains features of a poised enhancer along the full distal portion of the limb bud composed of the mesenchymal cells of the progress zone; whereas, H3K27ac is enriched just in the distal-posterior limb region. We show that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling plays a key role in priming the ZRS as indicated by an increase in H3K4me1 at the enhancer. In addition, we show the mechanism of acetylation/deacetylation that GABPα, an activator, and ETV4, a repressor, employ to restrict and promote ZRS activation in the distal limb bud.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Modifications of chromatin at the ZRS differ in different regions of the limb bud</title><p>In order to characterize specific features of the <italic>Shh</italic> limb enhancer, the ZRS, in different regions of the developing limb, we microdissected the limb bud at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) into several defined segments. Firstly, we examined the distal region which contained the specialized epithelial structure called the AER (apical ectodermal ridge), the mesenchyme of both the progress zone and the ZPA and, in addition, the proximal region which contained the shank of the limb bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysed by quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) was performed on the dissected limb tissue for the two modified histones, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that these modifications are markers for enhancer activity. H3K4me1 is a predictive chromatin signature for both poised and active enhancers in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heintzman et al., 2007</xref>), but in association with H3K27ac, these mark active regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cotney et al., 2012</xref>). We found specific enrichment of H3K4me1 at the ZRS in the distal region of the dissected E11.5 limb buds, which was appreciably lower in the proximal region of the limb buds. Further dissections of the distal limb bud into anterior and posterior halves enabled us to discern more precisely the location of the H3K4me1 at the ZRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Even though <italic>Shh</italic> was not expressed in the anterior region of the limb bud, the H3K4me1 mark was enriched in both dissected halves suggesting that the ZRS was poised across the distal compartment of the limb.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28590.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>H3K4me1 and H3K27ac distribution over the ZRS in embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) limb buds.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representation of an E11.5 mouse limb bud.

To investigate acetylation of histone H3 across the large 770 bp enhancer, two sets of PCR primers were used to amplify each end of the ZRS. The ZRS encompasses two distinct regulatory activities; one residing in the 5’ half driving spatiotemporal expression and one residing in the 3’ half mediating long-range activation of the <italic>Shh</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lettice et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Analysis of each half of the enhancer after ChIP identified differential acetylation of H3 across the ZRS. PCR primers complementary to the 5’ spatiotemporal half (5’ST primers) of the ZRS showed an increase in H3 acetylation compared to the 3’ long-range (3’LR primers) end. H3K27ac was associated with the 5’ end of the ZRS and was enriched in the distal region of the limb bud. H3K27ac was, therefore, associated with the distal, posterior quadrant of the limb bud consistent with the presence of the ZPA where the <italic>Shh</italic> gene is transcriptionally active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Hence, in the case of the ZRS, the enhancer is poised throughout the posterior distal mesenchyme; further events occur to activate the enhancer for productive transcription in the ZPA.</p><p>We next assessed the chromatin state of the ZRS in the distal region of the limb bud using ChIP coupled with microarray called ChIP-on-chip. The ChIP analysis using antibodies to H3K4me1 and H3K27ac highlighted the specificity of the histone modifications over the ZRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The pattern of the H3K4me1 covered the extent of the ZRS; whereas, the pattern of H3K27ac, as predicted by the PCR primers, was not centred over the ZRS but was skewed toward the 5’ side. Thus, the ZRS exists in differential chromatin states in the limb depending on position and gene activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A limb-derived cell line shows ZRS activation and <italic>Shh</italic> induction</title><p>To investigate the dynamics of <italic>Shh</italic> regulation in relation to the ZRS, we generated immortalized cell lines from early limb bud mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Williamson et al., 2012</xref>).

We performed ChIP-on-chip using antibodies against H3K4me1 and H3K27ac which revealed that, H3K4me1 marked the full extent of the ZRS in the cell line; whereas, H3K27ac was not enriched, demonstrating that the ZRS resides in a poised state reflecting the origin of the cell line from the distal mesenchyme of the limb bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28590.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Trichostatin A (TSA) treatment activates <italic>Shh</italic> in a limb-derived cell line (14Fp).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) from two biological replicates of E11.5 limb-derived cell line (14Fp cell line) using antibodies to two different histone modifications (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) analysed by hybridizing to tiling microarrays.

Previous attempts to activate <italic>Shh</italic> expression in limb bud-derived cells using cocktails of known developmental activators such as FGFs and retinoic acid or transfection with HoxD genes have shown that <italic>Shh</italic> is refractory to activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kimura and Ide, 1998</xref>). Our attempts with known <italic>Shh</italic> activators confirmed these observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>); however, the drug trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, stimulated expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>). <italic>Shh</italic> expression was detectable within 6 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) reaching a maximum at ~24 hr. To further investigate <italic>Shh</italic> activation in the cell line, we carried out a TSA time course to assay H3K27ac enrichment at the ZRS. H3K27ac enrichment was observed over both the ZRS and the <italic>Shh</italic> promoter at 16 hr of treatment, reaching a maximum at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), accordingly, with the <italic>Shh</italic> expression time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The fold enrichment of H3K27ac in the limb buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) seemed dramatically different; therefore, enrichment of H3K27ac was directly compared between the limbs buds and the cells in the same experiment showing that the magnitude of enrichment is comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In the cell lines, the correlation between <italic>Shh</italic> induction of expression and recruitment of H3K27ac suggests that the ZRS is involved in the activation of the transcriptional process. In addition H3K27ac was more highly associated with the region involved in the spatiotemporal activity of the ZRS (as shown using the 5’ST primers). Two control mouse cell lines were used to investigate the specificity of <italic>Shh</italic> activation in the 14Fp cells. Firstly, the mouse ES cell line, E14, which in response to retinoic acid induces <italic>Shh</italic> expression, and secondly, an immortalized mesenchymal cell line from the embryonic mandible at E11.5, called the MD cell line, were used. In both cell lines, the histone mark, H3K4me1, was not enriched over the ZRS, and TSA treatment did not lead to <italic>Shh</italic> induction after 24 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–C</xref>).</p><p>Extragenic transcription sites correlate with active regulatory elements and in accord are occupied by RNA Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Santa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Genome-wide studies highlighted Pol II occupancy and the synthesis of noncoding transcripts at active enhancer sites, the roles of which, so far, remain unclear. In order to confirm the limb specific enhancer activation, Pol II ChIP-qPCR was carried out in limb cells after TSA treatment. In the untreated 14Fp cell line, even though the enhancer is in a poised state, Pol II was not appreciably enriched at the <italic>Shh</italic> promoter nor at the ZRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). After activation with TSA, Pol II was detected at both sites confirming the association of Pol II recruitment to the enhancer and the promoter, further suggesting that TSA mediated <italic>Shh</italic> activation in 14Fp involves the ZRS. Thus, this cell line derived from early limb bud mesenchyme showed that the ZRS could be induced to undergo modifications consistent with enhancer activation and concomitantly, <italic>Shh</italic> expression was activated.

We tested the hypothesis that localized FGF expression is correlated with the poised state of the ZRS. Firstly, the 14Fp cell line pre-treated with nintedanib (NIN), a potent broad spectrum inhibitor of FGFR1/2/3, VEGFR1/2/3, and PDGFRα/β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hilberg et al., 2008</xref>), showed a significant reduction in <italic>Shh</italic> after TSA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Hence, as control for the efficiency of the FGF inhibition, <italic>Grem1</italic> and <italic>Etv4</italic> levels were evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) after 4 hr incubation with NIN or after 4 hr NIN plus FGF8/10 incubation. Since NIN can also inhibit VEGF and PDGF receptors, another FGFR inhibitor, BGJ398 (BGJ), was also tested for <italic>Grem1</italic> and <italic>Etv4</italic> expression. Increased levels of <italic>Grem1</italic> were observed after 4 hr of NIN and BGJ incubations while <italic>Etv4</italic> levels were reduced.

One of these, GABPα, interacts with the ZRS in the limb bud and activates <italic>Shh</italic> expression. In addition others have demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kang et al., 2008</xref>) that GABPα recruits the co-activator histone acetyltransferase (HAT) CBP/p300. Therefore, binding of GABPα to the ZRS and recruitment of p300 was examined in the 14Fp cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). ChIP-on-chip analysis on untreated cells for both GABPα and p300 showed an overlapping peak of enrichment for both factors, suggesting a co-occupancy over the ZRS. To further study the interaction between these factors, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments on nuclear extracts from 14Fp cells transfected with GABPα tagged with three copies of the flag epitope. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous p300 co-precipitates the flag-GABPα indicating an association between these two factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Western blot for p300 normalized against the histone H3 showed that p300 levels were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Based on the assumption that GABPα and p300 together have an important, yet undefined role in the activation of the regulatory element, we next addressed whether the presence of GABPα/p300 influenced ZRS activation. <italic>Shh</italic> expression was examined in cells induced with TSA after reduction of <italic>Gabpa</italic> expression. <italic>Gabpα</italic> small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) revealed decreased <italic>Shh</italic> expression after TSA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

In addition, ChIP analysis for H3K27ac in cells overexpressing GABPα showed an appreciable enrichment over the ZRS; whereas, the transcription factor ETV4, a repressor (see below) which restricts expression outside the ZPA, is displaced from the ZRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Under these conditions, enrichment of GABPα and p300 over the ZRS is also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). These data suggest that GABPα regulates <italic>Shh</italic> expression by modulating the acetylation status of H3K27 of the ZRS. Furthermore, FGF signalling plays a central role, since both GABPα and p300 are released from the ZRS when FGF signalling is inhibited by NIN and the enhancer is no longer poised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>).

Since there is a close association between GABPα and p300, we investigated the possibility that the repressive role of ETV4/ETV5 was related to HDAC activity. In order to investigate specific HDAC candidates, RNA-seq data obtained from the cell line and the distal and proximal portions of the limb bud showed nearly all the HDAC classes are represented in both 14Fp and in limb tissue between the cells and the tissue, with the exception of HDAC9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Most of the HDACs represented were subjected to ChIP in 14Fp (HDAC1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9) and HDAC2 appeared significantly enriched over the ZRS (data not shown) and is one of the most abundant <italic>Hdac</italic> in the RNA samples analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Both are class I HDACs and often work in concert. <italic>Hdac1</italic> downregulation had no effect on <italic>Shh</italic> expression, while the reduction of <italic>Hdac2</italic> levels (by siRNA) in 14Fp showed an increase in <italic>Shh</italic> levels. Simultaneous reduction of both <italic>Hdac1</italic> and <italic>Hdac2</italic> did not have an additive effect on the induction of <italic>Shh</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To investigate the relationship between the repressor activity of the ETV genes and HDAC2, we performed ChIP-on-chip for these two factors to visualize their distribution over the ZRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Since in the 14Fp cell line ETV5 expression is low (approximately eightfold to tenfold lower than ETV4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), depletion of ETV5 activity was not necessary in this analysis. ETV4 exhibits two peaks encompassing the ZRS which correspond to the two ETV4 binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lettice et al., 2012</xref>); interestingly, the HDAC2 peak overlapped one of these peaks located at the 3’ end which encodes the long-range activity of the regulatory element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lettice et al., 2014</xref>). We next tested if HDAC2 and ETV4 were able to physically interact; analysis showed that endogenous ETV4 co-immunoprecipitated with HDAC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

We showed that an initial input is the event that primes the ZRS, such that the enhancer is poised but transcriptionally inactive. The ZRS priming occurs in a broad region of the distal limb bud mesenchyme that includes tissue that will not express <italic>Shh</italic> in addition to the ZPA. Furthermore, we undertook studies to identify the signalling pathway involved in the induction of ZRS priming. Distal limb mesenchyme, referred to as the progress zone, is known to be under the influence of the FGFs produced in the AER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laufer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Niswander et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crossley et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vogel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ohuchi et al., 1997</xref>) and we showed that FGFs can induce ZRS priming in distal mesenchyme; whereas, inhibition of FGF signalling results in chromatin changes and loss of H3K4me1 and loss of transcription factor binding suggesting that the ZRS is no longer recognized as a poised enhancer and is in a ‘closed’ configuration. Thus, one role of FGF signalling is the establishment and maintenance of ZRS priming. Activation of the ZRS, therefore, appears to be a two-step process; ZRS priming occurring broadly in the distal mesenchyme which is a prerequisite for subsequent action by other signals in the posterior region containing the ZPA to activate the ZRS.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28590.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling is responsible for priming the ZRS for local chromatin changes mediated by E26 transformation-specific factors.</title><p>Summary model showing how FGF signalling in the distal mesenchyme regulates the ZRS poised state and that this allows the stepwise recruitment of transcriptional regulators to the ZRS. FGF signalling has a dual fundamental role; firstly, as an activator it is responsible for priming and maintaining the ZRS and secondly, as a repressor inducing the expression on ETV4 which restricts the expression of the ZRS. ETV4 (red oval) interacts with HDAC2 (light blue rectangle) to maintain the inactivity of the poised ZRS enhancer throughout the distal mesenchyme, while GABPα (blue oval) acts within the ZPA domain to recruit p300 (yellow rectangle), trigger H3K27 (orange circle) acetylation, and thereby activate <italic>Shh</italic> transcription.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-28590-fig7-v2"/></fig><p>The poised state of the enhancer is notable in light of the response of the ZRS to the point mutations that cause PPD2 and other associated skeletal abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>). These mutations cause misregulation of <italic>Shh</italic> expression in the developing limb bud such that <italic>Shh</italic> expression occurs at an ectopic anterior site in the distal mesenchyme in addition to the ZPA. Ectopic expression of all ZRS mutations examined, thus far, is restricted to the distal mesenchyme suggesting that there is a requirement for the ZRS to be in a poised state in order to be activated and demonstrates a mechanism for <italic>Shh</italic> ectopic activation restricted to the distal mesenchyme of the limb bud.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Levels of GABPα and ETV4 regulate <italic>Shh</italic> expression</title><p>Attempts to understand how developmental enhancers operate over such large distances have led to the general idea that chromatin looping assists the interactions of a long-range enhancer with its target promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sanyal et al., 2012</xref>). In the limb bud, 3C assay revealed a physical interaction between the ZRS and the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amano et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we confirmed, that upon activation of <italic>Shh</italic> expression in the limb-derived cell line, there is highly specific co-localization of the ZRS with the <italic>Shh</italic> promoter fragment. Thus, the <italic>Shh</italic> limb regulator in the cell line exists in two states; one in which the ZRS is poised reflecting its origin from the distal mesenchyme of the developing limb bud and secondly, in an active state in which the ZRS and the promoter recruit Pol II and interact. Hence, the cell line reveals the chromatin dynamics that occur during long-range activation.</p><p>GABPα/ETS1 and ETV4/ETV5 have antagonistic effects on <italic>Shh</italic> activity in the limb. Occupancy at multiple GABPα/ETS1 sites in the ZRS regulates the position of the ZPA boundary, whereas ETV4/ETV5 binding acts as repressors to restrict expression outside the ZPA. We have hypothesized that the balance between these activator and repressor factors is responsible for regulating activity levels in the developing limb bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lettice et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we showed that GABPα and ETV4 bind to the ZRS in the cell lines similar to that in the limb bud. GABPα is associated with p300 HAT at the ZRS in the cell lines. Previous reports demonstrated that GABPα physically interacts with p300 in myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Resendes and Rosmarin, 2006</xref>). Activation of AChR (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) gene in subsynaptic nuclei in adult skeletal muscle is mediated by GABPα, which recruits the HAT p300 to the AChR ε-subunit promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ravel-Chapuis et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the surface of the GABPα OST domain binds to the CH1 and CH3 domains of the co-activator HAT CBP/p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kang et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we showed in the limb-derived cells that a similar interaction of these two factors occurs. In addition, overexpression of GABPα results in an increase in the levels of H3K27ac at the ZRS. A correlation between <italic>Gabpα</italic> expression and the presence of ETV4 at the ZRS is also observed; in that, expression of <italic>Gabpα</italic> results in a displacement of ETV4 at the enhancer. Thus GABPα operates at the ZRS to increase levels of H3K27ac by recruiting p300 and decreasing levels of the repressor ETV4.</p><p>ETV4 appears to operate in the opposite manner and is one of the dominant factors in maintaining the ZRS in a poised state. Reduction of ETV4 levels is sufficient to activate <italic>Shh</italic> expression. ETV4 interacts with HDAC2 and we further showed the co-localization of HDAC2 and ETV4 at the ZRS in the cell line. Similar to the downregulation of ETV4 the knockdown of HDAC2 induces <italic>Shh</italic>. Activation of <italic>Shh</italic> by TSA releases ETV4 and HDAC2 from the ZRS. Hence activation of the ZRS by both the overexpression of GABPα and treatment with TSA is associated with loss of ETV4 binding which acts directly on HDAC activity.</p><p>The FGFs play a central role in <italic>Shh</italic> expression by ensuring that the ZRS maintains its primed state throughout the distal limb mesenchyme. This widespread priming, however, opens the ZRS for potential ectopic activation as occurs in preaxial polydactyly and associated phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>). ETV4 is a repressor that restricts this activity and FGF signalling also induces the levels of ETV4 in the distal mesenchyme of the limb bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). The FGFs, therefore, operate by regulating two contrasting events; firstly, by effecting the chromatin in the distal mesenchyme ensuring that the ZRS is maintained in a poised state and secondly, acting counter to enhancer activation by inducing the level of a repressor that ensures <italic>Shh</italic> expression does not occur outside the region of the ZPA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines, Transfections, and Treatments</title><p>The 14Fp cell line was derived from the posterior third of distal forelimb buds from an Immortomouse (H-2k-tsA58) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jat et al., 1991</xref>).

For the Agilent arrays a custom tiling array was designed including some of the genes involved in limb development, including gene deserts associated with such genes. GEO accession number for the ChIP data is GSE104074 and GSE104208.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Nimblegen arrays</title><p>Microarray data were analysed in R/Bioconductor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/10/R80">http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/10/R80</ext-link>) with the Epigenome (PROT43) protocol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.epigenesys.eu/images/stories/protocols/pdf/20111025114444_p43.pdf">https://www.epigenesys.eu/images/stories/protocols/pdf/20111025114444_p43.pdf</ext-link>) with the following parameters. The mean signal intensity of the two replicate probes on each array was taken. Loess normalization was used within arrays to correct for the dye bias, and scale normalization was used within the replicates group to control interarray variability using the R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>). The log<sub>2</sub> enrichment for each ChIP group was calculated by subtracting the mean of log<sub>2</sub> input intensities from the mean of d enriched intensities and averaging over the two biological replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Agilent arrays</title><p>The Median Signal was extracted from the scanned image files and processed using the R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Toedling et al., 2007</xref>). Probe intensities were transformed from raw values into background-corrected normalized log ratios (ChIP/Input) using Ringo's preprocess method (VSN normalization). Smoothing over individual probe intensities was performed using a sliding window of 1000 bp along the chromosome and replacing the intensity at the genomic position by the median over the intensities of those reporters inside the window.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunoprecipitation of FLAG fusion proteins</title><p>The pSV40-Tet3G- pTRE3G-mCherry- Gabpα plasmid was generated using the In-Fusion cloning technology (Clontech, St Germaine en Laye, France catalogue no. 639649). First, the pTRE3G-mCherry vector (Clontech, catalogue nos. 631160 and 631175) was linearized using a unique restriction site between the origin of replication and the Tet-responsive promoter (pTRE3G). Second, the sequences encoding for SV40 promoter, Kanamycin/Neomycin resistance, internal ribosome entry site IRES2, and Tet-ON 3G transactivator were inserted. Third, we removed the Ampicillin resistance cassette. Lastly, the sequence of the self-cleaving peptide P2A was cloned between the mCherry fluorescent marker and the 3xFLAG tagged Gabpα gene, in order to generate a bicistronic expression under the control of the TRE3G promoter and an empty control vector was also used. Overexpression analyses were performed in 14fp cells by transfecting plasmids using Lipofectamine LTX with plus reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific) and following standard manufacturer’s protocol. Nuclear extracts used in the immunoprecipitation were prepared from 14fp using a NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). The nuclear extract was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for 3 hr at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with washing buffer. The immunoprecipitates were eluted with 1× SDS buffer, separated on a 4–20% Novex Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen), transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore), incubated with anti-FLAG (Sigma) or with anti-GABPα (Santa Cruz, sc-22810).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Gene expression analysis, RNA library Preparation, Sequencing, and Analysis</title><p>Total RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol (for limb buds, dissected anterior, posterior, distal, and proximal tissue was dissociated into single cell suspensions in Trizol using a syringe fitted with a 25G (0.5 mm) needle (Sigma Aldrich, BD Microlance), followed by acid phenol:chloroform:isopropyl alcohol extraction, and then digested with 2U DNaseI (ThermoFisher Scientific, Ambion) for 30 min at 37°C). RNA was reverse-transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen). The quantitative real-time PCRs were performed in a 7300 system (ThermoFisher Scientific, Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies) by using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche) and gene specific primer sets for shh, Gabpα, and Etv4. The cycle threshold (CT) values from all quantitative real-time PCR experiments were analysed using ΔΔCT method. Data were normalized to GAPDH and expressed as fold changes over that in control treatment group. From each biological replicate three technical replicates were analysed. All statistical analyses were performed using a two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test.</p><p>RNA sequencing was conducted by GATC Biotech (Konstantz, Germany). Samples were only submitted with an OD 260/280 ratio ≥1.8, a 260/230 ratio ≥1.7, and a RNA Integrity Number value ≥8 as detected by Agilent Technologies 2100 Bionalayser. The InView Transcriptome Explore service provided by GATC was used to provide a randomly primed and amplified cDNA library with Illumina adaptors ready for sequencing. Illumina sequencing was conducted producing 50 bp single end reads and a guarantee of over 30 million reads per sample. All samples were analysed on the main Galaxy server by first checking sequence quality by FastQC. Reads were then trimmed and any Illumina sequencing adaptors removed as appropriate and aligned to the mouse genome (mm9, NCBI 37) using Tophat2 (Galaxy Tool Version 0.9). The results for each condition were fed into Cuffdiff (Galaxy Tool Version 2.2.1.3) and visualized using the R Bioconductor package CummeRbund (Release 3.2). This process was repeated using RNA isolated from both immortalized limb cell lines and isolated limb tissue. Two biological replicates were analysed for each condition.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the staff at the Evans Building and especially Anna Thornburn for expert technical assistance.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Lee Niswander (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Deneen Wellik (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Peluso, Hill and colleagues focuses on the ZRS enhancer that lies 800Kb from the <italic>Shh</italic> gene and regulates <italic>Shh</italic> in the developing limb. This long-range enhancer and the wealth of human and mouse genetic data and molecular mechanisms elucidated to date on activators and repressors make for an excellent system to study enhancer/promoter interactions in the context of a complex mammalian tissue. Here the Hill group provide significant insights into how the balance of opposing chromatin modifying enzymes on the ZRS are involved in the epigenetic regulation of the ZRS enhancer and how developmental regulators of <italic>Shh</italic> expression affect the chromatin state of the ZRS. A strength of the paper is that the combined evidence provides a coherent, holistic model of how activation localized to the ZPA of the limb bud occurs. The existence of a poised, then activated state is not highly novel and the technology and chromatin marks analyzed are standard but the biological insights into how a developmental enhancer is deployed in a spatiotemporal and long-range manner are excellent.</p><p>This work shows clear lines of evidence that the ZRS <italic>Shh</italic> enhancer is poised in the distal, but not proximal limb bud as judged by H3K4me1. The H3K27ac, a mark of active enhancers, is shown to be higher in posterior, but not the anterior limb bud. While expected factors do not lead to <italic>Shh</italic> activation in a cell line derived from posterior-distal limbs, tricostatin A leads to <italic>Shh</italic> expression and this correlates with H3K27ac. FGF inhibition leads to loss of the primed or poised state, and correlations with GABPalpha binding and activation and <italic>Etv4</italic> repression are made (confirming previous data from this and other labs). A model is presented in which the authors propose that <italic>Shh</italic> expression in ZPA requires first that the enhancer become poised, which requires FGF signaling, and then activated.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although there is enthusiasm, the reviewers raised the following criticisms.</p><p>Use of the cell line appears to have led to exploration of the epigenetic states, and as such, contributes to the story, but the true integrity of this cell line as a bona fide system for distal limb bud mesenchyme is not completely compelling based on the expression comparisons in supplemental data. No mention of the cell line is found in Abstract, for instance. Further comparisons of this cell line will be required to support this and confirmation and conclusions regarding the integrity of this cell line and its broad usefulness as a distal, posterior limb population should not be concluded here. This reviewer would recommend that there is less emphasis on this aspect in Results and Discussion. How reflective of posterior, distal limb bud this cell line is more broadly could be explored in a future publication.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the fold enrichment of H3K27ac at the ZRS is not so strong (ca. 2 fold) in the limb bud that contains ZPA, but much stronger enrichment is seen in control of the cultured cells (more than 10 fold in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). How is this difference explained? It would be thought that acetylation of H3K27 at the ZRS in ZPA is abolished under the culture condition due to detachment of AER signals. Is it not the case? Direct comparison of ChIP-qPCR for H3K27ac between in vivo and the culture condition may be one way to address this question. Alternatively, a time course of deacetylation at H3K27 in ZRS in cultured limb bud cells should be presented.</p><p>Procedure of the 4C-seq is not clearly stated, and therefore the present result is not scientifically sound. The anchor (bait) point is not clearly shown. Digestion efficiency with restriction enzymes is not evaluated. Method of the 4C-DNA mapping is not well described. Mapping rate per total read counts is also lacking. Another concern is weak and very specific interaction between the ZRS and <italic>Shh</italic>. In a previous report from the same group (Anderson et al., 2014), it was stated that the <italic>Shh</italic> locus forms a topological domain where various genomic regions frequently interact with each other, consistent with Hi-C data from other groups. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, ZRS seems to exclusively interact with <italic>Shh</italic>. It is an intriguing possibility that the TSA treatment facilitate a specific interaction in cultured cells. If it is the case, reproducibility of such weak interaction should be shown by experimental replicates of the 4C-analysis. Alternatively, 3C-qPCR could be fine to evaluate such specific interactions.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and legend, it is unclear if a specific region is analyzed (the ZRS? 5', 3'?). As presented it appears that H3K4me1 ChIP is severely altered at all loci by FGF inhibition with nintedanib. Presumably this is data from a single locus but it does lead to the question as to whether the tissue is severely compromised/dying. The relative expression of <italic>Grem1</italic> goes up only modestly and relying on proximal tissue results is a biased comparison of tissue health since these cells are more mature.</p><p><italic>Etv4</italic> null mutant mouse is viable, and exhibits no apparent defect in the limb morphology (Laing et al., 2000). This is inconsistent with the claim of this study that binding of ETV4 to the ZRS suppresses <italic>Shh</italic>. Is <italic>Etv4</italic> indispensable for suppression of <italic>Shh</italic> in the fp14 cells, whereas in general ETV4 and other ETV proteins including ETV5 are functionally redundant. At a minimum the authors need to include a discussion about the possibility that other ETV proteins suppress <italic>Shh</italic> expression. It is preferable that the expression level of <italic>Etv5</italic> in the cell culture conditions is analyzed.</p><p>There is an opportunity to better summarize and highlight the contribution of this study in the conclusions; it currently reads more as a summary of results, both current and past, and could be shortened.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28590.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although there is enthusiasm, the reviewers raised the following criticisms.</p><p>Use of the cell line appears to have led to exploration of the epigenetic states, and as such, contributes to the story, but the true integrity of this cell line as a bona fide system for distal limb bud mesenchyme is not completely compelling based on the expression comparisons in supplemental data.

This cell line expresses a number of the genes found in the distal limb and the aspect that is important for our studies is that it retains a poised ZRS. Interestingly these lines retain limb identity since we can direct these cells to differentiate toward chondrocytes or tenocytes depending on culture conditions. So as the referee suggests we will attempt to publish these cells in a future publication, but for the purpose of the paper we have placed less emphasis on our lines as a model system for distal limb mesenchyme. In rewriting and shortening the Discussion I removed the reference that the cell line was a good model system.</p><p>Also, the section title has been changed to – “A limb-derived cell line shows ZRS activation and <italic>Shh</italic> induction”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the fold enrichment of H3K27ac at the ZRS is not so strong (ca. 2 fold) in the limb bud that contains ZPA, but much stronger enrichment is seen in control of the cultured cells (more than 10 fold in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

The differences detected between fold enrichments in limb buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) is more than likely due to the fact that we changed our supplier of the anti-H3K27ac antibody (from Abcam to Active Motif) during these studies. As the referee suggested we did a direct comparison of limb vs. cell culture in the same experiment and found very good agreement in the fold enrichment. These data are shown in the supplementary figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In the text, we added the following comment…“The fold enrichment of H3K27ac in the limb buds [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>] and cell lines [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>] seemed dramatically different; therefore, enrichment of H3K27ac was directly compared between the limbs buds and the cells in the same experiment showing that the magnitude of enrichment is comparable [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>]”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Procedure of the 4C-seq is not clearly stated, and therefore the present result is not scientifically sound. The anchor (bait) point is not clearly shown. Digestion efficiency with restriction enzymes is not evaluated. Method of the 4C-DNA mapping is not well described.

In a previous report from the same group (Anderson et al., 2014), it was stated that the Shh locus forms a topological domain where various genomic regions frequently interact with each other, consistent with Hi-C data from other groups.

We have added the statement … “The interaction between the <italic>Shh</italic> gene and the ZRS was confirmed by 3C-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><p>The data has been added as a supplementary figure – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>.

In addition for the 3C-qPCR technique the digestion efficiencies were assayed by PCR and the primers used are in TABLE S2. We now feel that using two different 3C technologies to analyze the enhancer promoter interactions helps to strongly support our conclusions that conformational changes occur in the cell line that brings the enhancer and promoter in contact and is acting in a similar fashion to the limb bud.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and legend, it is unclear if a specific region is analyzed (the ZRS? 5', 3'?).

No signs of increased cell death was observed after 4h of NIN treatment”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Etv4 null mutant mouse is viable, and exhibits no apparent defect in the limb morphology (Laing et al., 2000). This is inconsistent with the claim of this study that binding of ETV4 to the ZRS suppresses Shh. Is Etv4 indispensable for suppression of Shh in the fp14 cells, whereas in general ETV4 and other ETV proteins including ETV5 are functionally redundant. At a minimum the authors need to include a discussion about the possibility that other ETV proteins suppress Shh expression. It is preferable that the expression level of Etv5 in the cell culture conditions is analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>In the 14Fp cell line the ETV5 mRNA levels are low and are some 8-10 fold lower than those for the ETV4 gene as shown in the supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>); whereas, in distal limb mesenchyme there is less than a 2 fold difference. Thus ETV5 did not play a large role in our analysis. We have now added a sentence “Since in the 14Fp cell line ETV5 expression is low (approx. 8-10 fold lower than ETV4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), depletion of ETV5 activity was not necessary in this analysis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is an opportunity to better summarize and highlight the contribution of this study in the conclusions; it currently reads more as a summary of results, both current and past, and could be shortened.</p></disp-quote><p>The conclusions have now been shortened and emphasis has been placed on the contribution of our studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
