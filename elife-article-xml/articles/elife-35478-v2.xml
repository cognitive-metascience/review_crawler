In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline, a diverse repertoire of regulatory pathways promote the expression of endogenous germline genes and limit the expression of deleterious transcripts to maintain genome homeostasis.

We uncover a role for NHL-2 as a co-factor in both positively (CSR-1) and negatively (HRDE-1) acting germline 22G-small RNA pathways and the somatic nuclear RNAi pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NHL-2 is a bona fide RNA binding protein and, along with RNA-seq data point to a small RNA independent role for NHL-2 in regulating transcripts at the level of RNA stability. Collectively, our data implicate NHL-2 as an essential hub of gene regulatory activity in both the germline and soma.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The conserved family of TRIM-NHL proteins have emerged as key regulatory points of gene expression to impact a variety of processes including stem cell self-renewal, developmental patterning and cellular differentiation in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tocchini and Ciosk, 2015</xref>). TRIM-NHL proteins contain a N-terminal <underline>tri</underline>partite <underline>m</underline>otif (TRIM), composed of a zinc finger RING domain, one or two B-box zinc finger motifs (distinct from the RING domain), and a coiled-coil region, in association with six C-terminal NHL motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This combination of domains enables TRIM-NHL proteins to modulate gene expression in versatile ways, ranging from the ubiquitination of protein targets (via the RING domain and associated B-box motifs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikeda and Inoue, 2012</xref>) to regulating mRNA stability or translation via the NHL domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loedige et al., 2013</xref>). However, the full repertoire of gene regulatory activities and the developmental specificity of such functions by TRIM-NHL proteins remains to be fully elucidated.</p><p>How TRIM-NHL proteins regulate specific mRNAs is only beginning to become clear. The prevailing notion has been that TRIM-NHL proteins interact with mRNA via interactions with other proteins. For instance, the Drosophila TRIM-NHL protein Brat was long thought to recognize maternal mRNAs via an interaction with the RNA binding protein Pumilio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sonoda and Wharton, 2001</xref>). However, TRIM-NHL proteins have recently been shown to directly bind to RNA via NHL motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Laver et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Loedige et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Loedige et al., 2014</xref>). For some TRIM-NHL proteins, such as Brat, this interaction occurs with a reasonable degree of sequence specificity, with a preference for U rich motifs, and leads to the post-transcriptional and/or translational regulation of target transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Laver et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Loedige et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Loedige et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to binding and regulating RNA directly, several TRIM-NHL proteins have been implicated in miRNA-mediated regulation of transcripts, adding another layer of complexity to their gene regulatory capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwamborn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neumüller et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>NHL-2 is one of five members of the TRIM-NHL family in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (including NHL-1, 2, 3; LIN-41; NCL-1). Thus far, these paralogs have been shown to control pluripotency (LIN-41) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tocchini et al., 2014</xref>), oocyte growth and meiotic maturation (LIN-41) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsukamoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spike et al., 2014</xref>), and inhibit translation (NCL-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yi et al., 2015</xref>). In comparison, NHL-2 has been shown function the sex determination pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McJunkin and Ambros, 2017</xref>) and also acts as a co-factor in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> miRNA pathway where it is required for proper developmental timing and cell fate progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karp and Ambros, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammell et al., 2009</xref>). In the miRNA pathway, NHL-2 does not impact the biogenesis of miRNAs but exerts a positive influence on RNA Induced Silencing Complex activity (RISC, including small RNA or miRNA bound to the Argonaute effector, along with accessory proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammell et al., 2009</xref>). NHL-2 associates with the miRNA specific Argonaute effectors, ALG-1/2, and other miRISC co-factors, including AIN-1/GW182 and the DEAD-box RNA helicase CGH-1/DDX6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammell et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, loss of <italic>nhl-2</italic> does not broadly affect miRNA activity, but instead specifically influences miRISC activity associated with two miRNAs: <italic>let-7</italic> and <italic>lsy-6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammell et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, the NHL-2 ortholog TRIM32 in <italic>M. musculus</italic> and <italic>H. sapiens</italic> regulates a small number of miRNAs, including <italic>let-7a</italic>, while in <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> Brat and Mei-P26 have also been shown to act broadly as miRNA co-factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Loedige et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwamborn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neumüller et al., 2008</xref>). Individual TRIM-NHL proteins exert positive or negative effects on the miRNA pathway, and thereby control developmental programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Loedige et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwamborn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neumüller et al., 2008</xref>). Although the functions of NHL-2 in the soma are linked to miRNA function, what role, if any, NHL-2 plays in the germline remains unclear.</p><p>In addition to miRNAs, the small RNA regulatory repertoire in <italic>C. elegans</italic> includes endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs; 22G-RNAs, 26G-RNAs), and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs/21U-RNAs), which are part of an elaborate surveillance system to regulate homeostasis of the germline transcriptome (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Youngman and Claycomb, 2014</xref>)). The 22G-RNA family of endo-siRNAs is the most functionally diverse class of germline small RNAs (named 22G because they are generally 22 nucleotides in length, and possess a 5'-triphosphorylated guanosine residue) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2009</xref>). It has been proposed that 22G-RNAs are selectively loaded onto either the Argonaute CSR-1 or the WAGO sub-family of AGOs, where they subsequently go on to fulfill distinct gene-regulatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Albuquerque et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Phillips et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Phillips et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Claycomb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2009</xref>). The synthesis of 22G-RNAs relies on a complex containing an RNA dependent RNA polymerase enzyme (RdRP; EGO-1 or RRF-1), in association with the DEAD-box RNA helicase DRH-3 and the dual Tudor domain protein EKL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2007</xref>). Although it remains largely unclear how the 22G-RNAs are specified for their different AGO effectors, one notable feature of the two pathways is that the CSR-1 22G-RNAs are produced solely by the RdRP EGO-1, while the WAGO 22G-RNAs rely on both RRF-1 and EGO-1 for their biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Phillips et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Claycomb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The CSR-1 22G-RNAs are required for normal chromosome organization in the germline and embryos, likely due to genome-wide effects on chromatin and/or transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wedeles et al., 2013a</xref>). CSR-1 associates with genomic loci of its gene targets, and recent data point to a role for the CSR-1 pathway in promoting the transcription of these germline genes trans-generationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cecere et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conine et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wedeles et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Claycomb et al., 2009</xref>), as well as post-transcriptionally fine-tuning the expression of target genes in embryos via its endonucleolytic Slicer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerson-Gurwitz et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the WAGO 22G-RNAs, namely those associated with WAGO-1 and HRDE-1, are required for silencing of endogenous pseudogenes, transposons, and some protein-coding genes both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. These activities are largely downstream of the piRNA pathway, and function to recognize and silence foreign nucleic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shirayama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2009</xref>). Together, the CSR-1 and WAGO pathways provide an epigenetic memory of self (CSR-1) from non-self (WAGOs) nucleic acid and are critical for maintaining genomic and transcriptional integrity of the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wedeles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conine et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wedeles et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Claycomb et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Here we characterize the role of NHL-2 in the germline and provide evidence that, in addition to its role in the somatic microRNA pathway, NHL-2 is a biogenesis factor in the CSR-1 and WAGO germline 22G-RNA pathways. Like other 22G-RNA biogenesis factors and AGOs, including CSR-1 and WAGO-1, NHL-2 localizes to P granules in the germline. Characterization of <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants reveals phenotypes consistent with loss of CSR-1 pathway activity, including: embryonic lethality, defects in oocyte chromosome organization, and aberrant accumulation of the repressive histone modification, H3K9me2 on germline autosome chromatin. We also found an unexpected role for NHL-2 in the nuclear RNAi pathway, and accompanying temperature-sensitive transgenerational fertility defect.

High throughput sequencing of small RNAs in <italic>nhl-2</italic>(<italic>ok818</italic>) mutants reveals a depletion of 22G-RNAs for a subset of CSR-1 and WAGO target genes. Moreover, alterations in the distribution of 22G-RNAs across CSR-1 target genes suggest a mechanism of NHL-2 action in 22G-RNA biogenesis, and implicate NHL-2 in distinct roles for germline versus somatic small RNA pathways. RNA binding assays demonstrate that NHL-2 is a bona fide RNA binding protein that specifically associates with U-rich sequences, and mRNA-seq experiments on <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants support the model that NHL-2 regulates a large number of somatic transcripts via this intrinsic RNA binding activity.

This resistance was rescued in <italic>nhl-2(ok818) w</italic>orms expressing a GFP-NHL-2 transgene in the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Next, because some RNAi factors, such as <italic>hrde-1</italic>, have a temperature-sensitive transgenerational mortal germline (Mrt) phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spracklin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weiser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>), we tested if <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> also displays this phenotype. Consistent with the Mrt phenotype, after 10–12 generations <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> worms grown at 25°C became sterile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) while wild-type worms remained fertile.

We next examined if shifting <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> worms grown at 25°C to 20°C could rescue the decline in fertility in subsequent generations. As has been demonstrated for other Mrt mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spracklin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ni et al., 2016</xref>), when the F1 generation of <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> worms were moved at the L1 stage to 20°C it took three generations for the brood size to recover to the normal <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and embryonic lethality took a generation to recover to the <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> 20°C level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Similar results were obtained using <italic>nhl-2(ma372 ma399)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). These findings are consistent the Mrt phenotype observed in mutants in the nuclear RNAi pathway and suggests the decreased brood size observed at 25°C is not simply the result of DNA damage. Finally, we tested whether loss of <italic>nhl-2</italic> impacted the ability of worms to inherit RNAi, as is typical for factors of the nuclear RNAi pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spracklin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weiser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>). In this assay, we treated worms expressing a germline GFP marker RNAi food against <italic>gfp</italic> in the P0 generation, and asked whether the progeny remained silenced.

These data suggest that NHL-2 may influence the activity and/or processivity of the RdRP complex.</p><p>Because our small RNA results indicated a possible role for NHL-2 in RdRP complex processivity or activity, and we had observed genetic and physical interactions between NHL-2 and the RdRP complex via DRH-3, we asked whether NHL-2 was required for the formation or stability of the RdRP complex. Therefore, we tested whether the CSR-1 RdRP complex, as measured by an association between the key components DRH-3, EGO-1, and EKL-1, could properly form in the absence of NHL-2. To answer this question, we immunoprecipitated DRH-3 and probed for EGO-1 and EKL-1, and found that the association between DRH-3, EGO-1, and EKL-1 was maintained in the absence of NHL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Thus, NHL-2 is not required for the formation or maintenance of the RdRP complex, and may play a different role in the biogenesis of 22G-RNAs. This role could be in the handoff of newly synthesized 22G-RNAs to CSR-1 (because of its physical association with both CSR-1 and DRH-3, but the lack of a demonstrated interaction between CSR-1 and DRH-3 from the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duchaine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2009</xref>), aiding the assembled RdRP complex in moving along the RNA template, or in the selection of particular mRNAs as templates for 22G-RNA synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The NHL domain of NHL-2 binds RNA</title><p>We went on to explore a role for NHL-2 in directly interacting with mRNA transcripts.

To determine whether the C-terminal NHL domain of NHL-2 binds RNA, we first generated a structural homology model based on the crystal structure of Brat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edwards et al., 2003</xref>). This modeling of the NHL domain revealed the canonical six-bladed ‘propeller’ characteristic of this domain. It also showed that much of the surface of the protein was positively charged and therefore would likely interact with negatively charged RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To explore if the NHL domain of NHL-2 binds to RNA we performed the RNAcompete in vitro binding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ray et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ray et al., 2009</xref>).

Although several lines of data previously suggested that NHL-2 functioned with miRISC in the translational regulation of targets, no genome-wide transcriptome data in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants were available to test the possibility that NHL-2 and miRISC could impact targets via mRNA stability or turnover. Using TargetScan (Worm Release 6.2, June 2012), we identified 162 predicted targets of <italic>lsy-6</italic>, and 126 predicted targets of the <italic>let-7</italic> family of miRNAs.

Overall, these data indicate that miRNA target genes are not regulated by NHL-2 at the level of transcript abundance or stability, and instead, NHL-2 is likely to exert a predominantly translational mode of regulation on these genes.</p><p>We next asked whether the genes with altered 22G-RNA levels in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants were differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). First, we overlapped the sets of genes depleted of 22G-RNAs in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at either temperature and were surprised to find only modest effects overall. Of the 573 genes depleted of 22G-RNAs at 20°C, 78 displayed increased steady-state mRNA levels (13.6%; 78/573 genes; q-value = 3.3E-14) and 11 had decreased steady-state mRNA levels (1.9%; 11/573: not significant). At 25°C, 724 genes showed depleted 22G-RNA levels, and of these 210 were up-regulated (29%; 210/724, q-value = 1.8E-13), while 81 were down-regulated (11.2%; 81/724: not significant). Thus, overall, genes displaying altered 22G-RNA levels were not extensively affected at the mRNA level by the loss of <italic>nhl-2</italic>, and the fraction that were affected at the mRNA level tended to be repressed by NHL-2 under wild-type conditions. Overall, these data are consistent with a role for NHL-2 in the biogenesis, but not necessarily the effector steps, of a subset of 22G-RNAs. These data could also point to a role for NHL-2 in regulating the translation of this subset of germline small RNA target genes for which the 22G-RNA levels are altered in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants, perhaps in a manner similar to the miRNA pathway.</p><p>Next, we examined the steady state levels by evaluating the levels of CSR-1 or WAGO pathway target genes in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants, independent of any changes in 22G-RNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Claycomb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2009</xref>). In accordance with the opposing roles of the WAGO and CSR-1 pathways in germline gene regulation, we anticipated that the WAGO targets with decreased 22G-RNAs would display increased mRNA levels, while the CSR-1 targets with decreased 22G-RNAs would display decreased mRNA levels in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants. We observed that a statistically significant subset of WAGO-1 target genes (18%; 141/1718 genes; q-value = 9.9E-8) were de-repressed at 20°C, and 291 out of 1718 WAGO-1 target genes were de-repressed at 25°C (16.9%; q = 0.6790). HRDE-1 target genes also tended to be up-regulated in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at both temperatures (141/1661; 8.5% q-value = 9.9E-9 at 20°C, 335/1661; 20.2%, q-value = 9.9E-2 at 25°C). These results are consistent with a cooperative role for NHL-2 in the repression of WAGO target genes, albeit in a small RNA-independent manner.</p><p>Unexpectedly, CSR-1 target mRNAs were significantly up-regulated <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants, and this effect occurred specifically at 25°C (2,025/4932; 41%, q-value &lt;1E-300). This was further supported by the significant overlap between the global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) analysis of <italic>csr-1</italic> partially rescued (hypomorphic) mutant, which identified 361 genes that were down-regulated upon loss of <italic>csr-1</italic> (50%; 181/361 genes; q-value = 4.39E-47) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cecere et al., 2014</xref>) and the genes that were up-regulated in <italic>csr-1</italic> ‘slicer dead’ mutants (59%; 78/132 genes; q-value = 4.16E-27) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerson-Gurwitz et al., 2016</xref>). These data suggest that NHL-2 acts consistently to down-regulate CSR-1 target genes, regardless of whether CSR-1 positively (GRO-seq data) or negatively (‘slicer dead’ data) impacts these subsets of its targets (notably, only 15 genes overlap between these two groups).</p><p>Similarly, when examined the behavior of total set of genes targeted by germline small RNAs using the <italic>glp-4(bn2)</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2009</xref>), we found a strong overlap between genes depleted of small RNAs in the <italic>glp-4(bn2)</italic> mutant and genes up-regulated in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants specifically at 25°C (60%; 2155/3554, q-value &lt;1E-300) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These results are consistent with a small RNA-independent role for NHL-2 in the repression of CSR-1 germline 22G-RNA targets overall. Moreover, the functions of NHL-2 in regulating germline small RNA pathway target genes, especially those of the CSR-1 pathway, appear to be particularly important at high temperature (25°C) or perhaps other stressful conditions. Overall, the changes in steady-state mRNA levels for germline 22G-RNA pathway target genes point to a role for NHL-2 in regulating transcripts via its intrinsic RNA binding capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Loss of <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> impacts genes involved in Gametogenesis, Signaling, and Chromosome Organization</title><p>In an attempt to link alterations in gene expression to changes in phenotype for <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants, we next compared the <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> transcriptome data to spermatogenic versus oogenic gonad transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ortiz et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

Next, we found that genes up-regulated in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 25°C were significantly enriched for gender neutral and oogenesis-associated transcripts (46.1%, 1637/3554; 25.2%, 894/3554; hypergeometric test q-values = 3.8E-100, and 2.8E-259, respectively), while, for those genes up-regulated at 20°C, only oogenesis-associated transcripts were enriched (14%, 142/1014; hypergeometric test q-value = 9.2E-8). Interestingly, down-regulated genes in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at both 20°C and 25°C were enriched for spermatogenesis-associated transcripts (47%, 766/1630; 35.6%, 1556/4370; hypergeometric test q-value = 1.8E-265 and &lt;1E-300, respectively). These data point to an overall misregulation of the germline transcriptome that leads to defects gametogenesis and decreased fertility.</p><p>Given that NHL-2 and CGH-1 have been shown to physically interact, we next compared the CGH-1 RNA-IP/microarray data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boag et al., 2008</xref>) with the <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In the germline, CGH-1 is required to protect specific maternal mRNAs (which overlap with those enriched in the oogenesis and gender neutral transcriptomes) from degradation, and is also involved in translational regulation of some transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boag et al., 2008</xref>). We observed a small, but significant, enrichment between CGH-1-associated and up-regulated transcripts in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 25°C, (12.9%, 458/3554; hypergeometric test q-values = 4.2E-76). These data suggest an antagonistic role between NHL-2 and CGH-1 in the regulation of the stability of these transcripts. To determine if there was any interaction with NHL-2 and other described germline RNP complexes we examined mRNA targets of the cytoplasmic poly(A) polyermase GLD-2 targets and the RNA-binding proteins OMA-1 and LIN-41, all three critical for post-transcriptional regulation of the oocyte-to-embryo transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsukamoto et al., 2017</xref>). Similar to CGH-1-associated transcripts, GLD-2 target mRNAs (16.5%, 588/3554, q-value = 1.0E-207) and OMA-1 (20.4%, 725/3554, q-value = 7E-67) and LIN-41-enriched transcripts (13%, 462;3554, q-value = 8E-80) had a small but significant enrichment compared to up-regulated transcripts in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 25°C. This is consistent with the strong overlap between genes expressed during oogenesis and those upregulated in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 25°C. These data suggest that NHL-2 does not regulate the majority of mRNAs found in the key pathways governing the oocyte-to-embryo transitions, however, we cannot rule out any translational effects of NHL-2 in this context.</p><p>When we performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, we found that the genes that are down-regulated in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 20°C and 25°C shared consistent sets of GO terms, and are strongly enriched in cuticle/collagen proteins, kinases and phosphatases, and spermatogenesis proteins (FDR = 6.1E-20 <italic>protein kinase, core</italic>, 7.9E-25 <italic>phosphatase activity</italic>, and 1.5E-31 <italic>major sperm protein,</italic> respectively). Genes that are up-regulated in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants at 20°C are weakly enriched in signaling molecules and oxidative metabolism (FDR = 1.4E-12 <italic>signal peptide</italic>, and 2.8E-3 <italic>oxidation reduction</italic>, respectively), and differ from the GO terms observed for the genes up-regulated at 25°C, which were enriched for cell cycle, <italic>kinetochore</italic>, <italic>RNA-binding</italic> and <italic>DNA replication</italic> and <italic>damage repair</italic> (FDR = 5.5E-35 cell cycle, 3.7E-12 <italic>kinetochore</italic>, 1.1E-16 <italic>RNA binding</italic>, and 3.7E14 <italic>DNA replication</italic> and 9.6E10 damage repair GO terms. In addition to analyzing the complete sets of up-regulated or down-regulated genes in the <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants, we also performed GO analysis on sets of transcripts that were expressed in the gonad, and observed comparable results (data not shown). Collectively, our data point to a role for NHL-2 in regulating the stability of a large fraction of gonad/germline transcripts that are involved in spermatogenesis, cellular signaling cascades, cuticle formation, and kinase/phosphatase activities, and chromosome organization. NHL-2 impacts these mRNAs both positively and negatively, and likely utilizes the intrinsic RNA binding properties of its NHL domain, perhaps in association with other protein binding partners, to do so.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>TRIM-NHL proteins have been shown to play a variety of crucial roles in the context of the proliferation versus differentiation decision in metazoans. With modular and varied domains, TRIM-NHL proteins can function as E3 ligases as well as sequence-specific RNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwamborn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kudryashova et al., 2005</xref>). TRIM-NHL proteins also engage the miRNA pathway, whereby, remarkably, their functions relate to only a few miRNAs, and impact the efficacy of the RISC both positively and negatively. With their intrinsic RNA binding activity, TRIM-NHL proteins could regulate RNA directly or function at various steps and in virtually any small RNA pathway.</p><p>NHL-2 is one of five TRIM-NHL proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (paralogs include NHL-1,–3, LIN-41, and NCL-1). NHL-2 has been shown to modulate miRISC via two specific miRNAs, <italic>let-7</italic> and <italic>lsy-6</italic>, which act in the soma to regulate developmental timing and cell fate transitions in multiple tissues. Recently it was also shown that NHL-2 is also required for sex determination, although the mechanism is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McJunkin and Ambros, 2017</xref>). In spite of these intriguing roles for NHL-2 in the embryo and soma, little is known about its functions in germline development. Here, we set out to explore a role for NHL-2 in the germline and in germ cell development. We found that NHL-2 is required for proper germline chromatin organization and wild-type levels of fertility at high temperatures and for the somatic nuclear RNAi pathway. We also identified the AGOs CSR-1 and HRDE-1 and the RdRP component DRH-3 as genetic and physical interactors of NHL-2. High throughput sequencing of small RNA populations in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants revealed an additional role for NHL-2 in the WAGO-1, and HRDE-1 22G-RNA pathways, but as previous data suggested, little biologically meaningful perturbation in the overall miRNA population. Binding assays confirm that NHL-2 is a bona fide RNA binding protein, and examination of the mRNA transcriptome by mRNA-seq points to NHL-2 as a post-transcriptional regulator of a substantial set of mRNAs involved in signaling, phosphorylation and transcription independent of its small RNA activities. Together, our data, implicate NHL-2 as a regulator of mRNA stability for a significant portion of the genome, a likely translational regulator of miRNA targets, and a biogenesis factor and/or possible translational regulator of targets in the CSR-1 and WAGO 22G-RNA pathways.</p><p>We first identified a link between NHL-2 and the CSR-1 pathway by genetic and phenotypic studies, in which loss of CSR-1 pathway factors enhanced the aggregation of diakinetic oocyte chromosomes in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants. Loss of <italic>nhl-2</italic> also led to increased levels of H3K9me2 in pachytene germline nuclei and a spreading of this heterochromatin modification onto autosomes, where it is not normally observed. This phenotype is consistent with loss of CSR-1 pathway members, providing another phenotypic link between NHL-2 and the CSR-1 pathway. At this time, we do not entirely understand why this phenotype emerges in <italic>nhl-2</italic> or <italic>csr-1</italic> pathway mutants. It is possible that CSR-1 is not properly recruited to its target genes, due to mis-regulation of CSR-1 target transcripts in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants. This, in turn, could disrupt the formation or maintenance of euchromatin at these loci and allow for the mis-direction of chromatin modifiers throughout the genome, as observed in <italic>csr-1</italic> mutants (Christopher Wedeles and Julie Claycomb, unpublished results). This leads to the aberrant accumulation of histone modifications throughout the genome, which could impact chromosome structure. Future ChIP-seq studies for histone modifications and CSR-1 recruitment in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants will enable us to address this possibility. Alternatively, and based on the GO analysis, this chromosome organization defect could result indirectly from alterations in the levels of key transcripts associated with chromosome organization and metabolism, as has been proposed for CSR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerson-Gurwitz et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It was somewhat surprising to observe little correlation between the genes depleted of 22G-RNAs and genes with altered mRNA levels in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants. Based on the known regulatory functions of these pathways we expected there would be a slight decrease in the level of CSR-1 target genes for which the 22G-RNAs were depleted, and an increase in the set of genes targeted by WAGO-1 or HRDE-1 for which the 22G-RNAs were depleted. Instead, we observed little change in the steady-state levels of transcripts with depleted 22G-RNAs, indicating that NHL-2 is involved in the translation of these genes, or that there is a different role for NHL-2 with regard to these genes in the 22G-RNA pathways.</p><p>The lack of correlation between mRNAs with altered levels and changes in 22G-RNAs raises another possibility: that NHL-2 is mainly involved mainly in the biogenesis of a subset of the 22G-RNAs. This model seems plausible for several reasons. First, DRH-3 and NHL-2 physically interact by co-IP. Second, our metagene analysis of the distribution of 22G-RNAs along the length of target mRNA transcripts is similar to the pattern observed for <italic>drh-3(ne4253)</italic> mutants, in which the 22G-RNAs are reduced along the length of the gene body, with most significant decreases present at the 5ʹ end of the transcript. This pattern is consistent with a role for NHL-2 in the processivity or activity of the RdRP complex on a subset of CSR-1 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The RNA binding activity of NHL-2 points to a model whereby NHL-2 could help to identify particular mRNAs as candidates for 22G-RNA synthesis. Furthermore, because NHL-2 also associates with CSR-1 and HRDE-1 as well as DRH-3, it could also act as a chaperone required efficient handoff of 22G-RNAs from the RdRP complex to the Argonaute (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35478.022</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model: NHL-2 acts as a hub of gene regulatory activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) NHL-2 interacts with the miRNA pathway in the soma, where it may regulate the translation of <italic>let-7</italic> and <italic>lsy-6</italic> targets. The NHL RNA binding domain of NHL-2 may help to reinforce target selection of miRISC in this pathway. (<bold>B</bold>) In the germline, NHL-2 interacts with the 22G-RNA pathway, specifically via genetic and physical interactions with the RdRP helicase DRH-3. In this capacity, NHL-2 could impact the processivity or reloading of the RdRP complex on mRNA templates, and/or could aid in target mRNA selection via its RNA binding capacity. Owing to its genetic and physical interaction with CSR-1, NHL-2 could also be involved in the handoff of 22G-RNAs from the RdRP complex to Argonaute. If NHL-2 mediates gene regulation via 22G-RNAs, it is likely to be at the level of translation. (<bold>C</bold>) The intrinsic RNA binding capacity of NHL-2 could enable it to regulate a large number of transcripts in the soma and germline, both positively and negatively. This activity could be influenced by additional binding partners, and we speculate that it may occur in P bodies (soma) and P granules (germline) based on the localization pattern of NHL-2.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-35478-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>This potential role for NHL-2 with the RdRP complex is noteworthy for several reasons. First, because TRIM/NHL proteins have thus far only been implicated in the effector step of miRNA pathways, this is the first indication that NHL-2 (and thus TRIM/NHL proteins) could also be involved in the biogenesis of endo-siRNAs. Second, we still have relatively little insight into the factors that route particular transcripts into the 22G-RNA pathways, and NHL-2 provides an attractive candidate for one such factor. Third, the role for NHL-2 in biogenesis of a subset of germline 22G-RNAs and the effector steps of somatic miRNAs demonstrate differential roles for this intriguing protein in the germline versus soma, and points to differences in protein binding partners in each of these tissues that should be examined further.</p><p>Notably, many of the up-regulated genes in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants were the targets of 22G-RNAs, yet these genes did not display alterations in the levels of 22G-RNAs. These data point to a role for NHL-2 in regulating transcript stability, in cooperation with the WAGOs, and in opposition to CSR-1, and suggest a combinatorial regulatory mechanism that engages both small RNA pathways and <italic>bona fide</italic> RBPs such as NHL-2. The fact that <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants display temperature dependent fertility defects is consistent with several small RNA pathway factors, including both the piRNA/WAGO and the CSR-1 pathways and points to NHL-2 as a co-factor and/or co-regulator required for optimal pathway activity under stressful conditions. Although NHL-2 was not identified previously as a factor in the piRNA or 22G-RNA pathways, our results exemplify the power of synthetic genetic screens to identify accessory factors involved in the optimal function these pathways.</p><p>In light of our data, we propose that NHL-2 acts as a hub of gene regulation, where it works cooperatively with core factors in a diverse set of pathways that are central to both somatic and germline gene regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). NHL-2 localizes to several ribonucleoprotein structures involved in RNA regulation, including P granules in the germline, CGH-1 granules in the gonad core, and cytoplasmic P bodies in the soma, placing it in key cellular positions to regulate multiple facets of gene expression and RNA metabolism throughout development. For instance, P granules and related Mutator Foci (to which NHL-2 does not appear to localize) are thought to be important sites for the synthesis of 22G-RNAs and 22G-RNA-mediated gene regulation, as RdRP components and Argonautes, including CSR-1, WAGO-1, and HRDE-1 also localize to these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Claycomb et al., 2009</xref>). CGH-1 granules of the gonad core have a complex interplay with P granules and are enriched for translational regulators, including CGH-1 and IFET-1. The localization of NHL-2 to both P and CGH-1 granules in the germline supports the observation that NHL-2 and CGH-1 regulate the stability of a shared set of germline/oogenesis transcripts, and opens the possibility that NHL-2 and CGH-1 could regulate the translation of a shared set of targets. The intrinsic RNA binding capacity of NHL-2 via its NHL domain also makes it plausible that NHL-2 could regulate its own set of target mRNAs, independent of small RNA pathways or CGH-1. In fact, we observed that a large number of non-gonadal transcripts are regulated, both positively and negatively, in an NHL-2-dependent manner, and these transcripts are a separate group from those targeted by 22G-RNAs or CGH-1. Ultimately, quantitative proteomic studies, ribosome profiling in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants, and NHL-2 RNA-IP or CLIP-seq experiments will enable us to identify the full repertoire of mechanisms of NHL-2 regulation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we characterized the roles of NHL-2 in the germline and showed it localizes to P granules and impacts a subset of 22G-RNAs in both the CSR-1 and WAGO/HRDE pathways. This germline role in small RNA biogenesis is distinct from its role in the miRNA pathway in the soma, and implicates NHL-2 in RdRP activity in the germline. Interestingly, also NHL-2 was required for the nuclear RNAi pathway, suggesting that NHL-2 is a promiscuous co-factor of multiple distinct, but related small RNA pathways. NHL-2 displays intrinsic RNA binding ability via its NHL domain and thus is capable of binding and regulating the stability or translation of a large number of germline transcripts in a small RNA-independent manner. NHL-2 may exemplify a new class of co-factor that is required for optimal activity of small RNA pathways (both miRNA and 22G-RNA pathways). Although this type of co-factor appears to be extremely important for the fidelity and robustness of developmental gene expression programs, additional examples of such co-factors are not likely to be identified by forward genetic screens, but may be revealed through similar screens in sensitized backgrounds. Overall, our study highlights the complex roles of the TRIM-NHL protein NHL-2 and lays the foundation for deeper mechanistic insights into how these versatile and conserved proteins act to regulate gene expression in various tissues.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm strains</title><p>Strains used in this study were Bristol N2 as the wild-type, PRB310 (<italic>nhl-2</italic>(<italic>ok818</italic>) <italic>III</italic>), YY186 (<italic>nrde-2</italic>(<italic>gg091</italic>) <italic>II</italic>), WM49 (<italic>rde-4</italic>(<italic>ne301</italic>) <italic>III</italic>), WM182 <italic>csr-1</italic>(<italic>tm892</italic>) IV/nT1 [<italic>unc-?</italic>(<italic>n754</italic>) <italic>let-?</italic>] (IV;V), WM206 (<italic>drh-3</italic>(<italic>ne4253</italic>) I), PRB316 (<italic>nhl-2</italic>(<italic>ok818</italic>)III; <italic>mjIs31[ppie-1::gfp::h2b]</italic>II, SX1442 (<italic>mjIs31</italic>[<italic>ppie-1::gfp::h2b</italic>]II; <italic>nrde-2</italic>(<italic>mj168</italic>)II), SX2127 (<italic>mjIs31</italic>[<italic>ppie-1::gfp::h2b</italic>]<italic>II; hrde-1</italic>(<italic>tm1200</italic>)III) and VT3653 (<italic>nhl-2</italic>(<italic>ma372 ma399</italic>) <italic>III</italic>).

Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mM Tris.Cl pH 7.0, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT supplemented with 1 x ‘cOmplete’ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), passed through a French press 4 times at 16,000–18,000 psi. and the lysate clarified by centrifugation at 8,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min. The GST-NHL-2 fusion protein was purified using a 5 mL GSTrap FF based on the manufactures specification (GE healthcare). Alterations to the protocol included washing the column 5 x volumes of binding buffer (1 x PBS pH 7.3) containing an additional 2 M NaCl to remove any DNA and RNA bound to NHL-2, followed by five column volumes of binding buffer. To elute the bound protein, the column was washed with elution buffer (1x PBS, 10 mM reduced glutathione pH 8.0) and eluted fractions run on a SDS-PAGE gel to determine which fractions GST-NHL-2 eluted in, these fractions were then pooled and concentrated to be then further purified using size exclusion on the HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200. The NHL domain purity was &gt;95% by SDS-PAGE and was quantitated by OD<sub>280</sub> using an extinction coefficient of 61935 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pace et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>To examine the RNA-binding ability of the NHL domain, a 12-point serial dilution (0–52.81 µM) of GST and GST-NHL-2 NHL domain was incubated with 1 nM 5'-Fluorescein labelled 17 mer poly-U single-stranded RNA (Dharmacon GE, USA) in assay buffer (50 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature in 96-well non-binding black plates (Greiner Bio-One). Fluorescence anisotropy was measured in triplicate using PHERAstar FS (BMG) with FP 488-520-520 nm filters. Data were corrected for anisotropy of RNA alone samples, and then fitted to a one-site binding model using the Equation, A = (A<sub>max</sub> [L])/(<italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>+[L]), where A is the corrected fluorescence anisotropy; A<sub>max</sub> is maximum binding fluorescence anisotropy signal, [L] is the NHL concentration, and <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> is the dissociation equilibrium constant. A<sub>max</sub> and <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> were used as fitting parameters and nonlinear regression was performed using SigmaPlot 13.0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Small RNA cloning and data analysis</title><p>Total RNA was collected from wild-type and <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants that were grown to gravid adulthood at either 20°C or 25°C on OP50 <italic>E. coli</italic>.

The only minor modification to these protocols was that we used 0.1X the normal amount of Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase (enabling us to capture a greater proportion of miRNAs, while still sufficiently recovering 22G-RNAs). Small RNA analysis was conducted using custom Shell and Perl (5.10.0) scripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tu et al., 2015</xref>). The reference genome of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and genomic annotations were downloaded from WormBase (Release WS230) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yook et al., 2012</xref>). The snoRNAs annotated in GenBank were also included in the category of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). The sequences of pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs were fetched from miRBase (Release 19). After removing the barcodes from small RNA-seq reads for each sample, the insert size were extracted by allowing at most one mismatch in the first 6 nt of the 3´ linker (CTGTAG). We first excluded the reads that could be aligned to the ncRNAs, and then aligned the remaining reads to the genome using Bowtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) without mismatches. Small RNA abundance were normalized to the sequencing depth (the sum of genome-mapping and junction-mapping reads but those known ncRNAs) as reads per million (rpm). We used the same lists of CSR-1 targets, WAGO-1 targets, etc. as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tu et al., 2015</xref>), and the same criteria to define the genes depleted of 22G-RNAs in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants, that is at least 2-fold depletion in mutants than wild-type and at least 10 rpm reads in wild-type. The significance of the overlap between gene sets was calculated by hypergeometric test. The miRNA targets were predicted using TargetScan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>mRNA-Seq</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from triplicate samples of wild-type and <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> mutants that were grown to gravid adulthood at either 20°C or 25°C on OP50 <italic>E. coli</italic>. mRNA-seq libraries were generated and sequenced at the Donnelly Sequencing Centre (University of Toronto) using the Illumina Tru-Seq Stranded mRNA Library Construction Kit and the HiSeq2500 sequencer. The mRNA-seq reads were mapped to the reference genome by Tophat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trapnell et al., 2009</xref>) with default parameters. For each gene, we counted the number of the 22G-RNA reads that are antisense to the corresponding gene transcript.

NHL-2 is involved in the regulation of lsy-6 and let-7 associated miRISC activity (Hammell et al., 2009) and in the sex determination pathway (McJunkin and Ambros, 2017). The function of TRIM-NHL proteins was hypothesized to be driven by protein-protein interaction, like in the miRNA pathway. However, TRIM-NHL proteins can also directly bind RNA (Laver et al., 2015). This paper provides insights into the mechanistic details of NHL-2 function mainly in the germline.</p><p>NHL-2 colocalized with CGH-1 in both germline P granules and the germline cytoplasmic core. nhl-2(ok818) showed defects in brood size and increased embryonic lethality. nhl-2(ok818) oocytes also exhibited defects in chromosome segregation at diakinesis with greater than 6 DAPI stained bodies and chromosomal aggregations. A genome-wide RNAi screen revealed that knockdown of several 22G-RNA factors like drh-3, csr-1, ekl-1 and cde-1 in nhl-2(ok818) animals resulted in enhanced chromosomal segregation defects. nhl-2(ok818) animals were resistant to lir-1 RNAi mediated larval arrest and displayed a transgenerational mortal germline phenotype, indicating a possible role for NHL-2 in germline and somatic nuclear RNAi. NHL-2 was found to physically interact with DRH-3, HRDE-1 and CSR-1. Small RNA-seq in nhl-2(ok818) animals showed that there was a decrease in 22G-RNA and 26G-RNA populations. The genes corresponding to these small RNAs showed significant overlap with HRDE-1, CSR-1 and WAGO-1 targets. Analysis of the distribution of the 22G-RNAs indicated that the depletion was observed mainly in the 5' end of the CSR-1 target genes, suggesting that NHL-2 influences the processivity of the RdRP complex. in vitro binding assays showed that NHL-2 is capable of binding U-rich RNA. mRNA-seq in nhl-2(ok818) animals showed that a several genes had misregulated transcript levels. However, a very small proportion of genes that show alteration in 22G levels exhibit upregulated transcript levels. Significant overlap was found between the upregulated genes in nhl-2(ok818) and WAGO-1, HRDE-1 and CSR-1 targets indicating that NHL-2 regulates transcript levels in a small RNA independent manner, probably by binding mRNAs directly.</p><p>This is the first paper to elucidate the detailed role of NHL-2 in the germline and thus makes an important contribution to the field. The authors use both genetic and biochemical techniques to show convincingly that NHL-2 may act as a cofactor in the 22G-RNA pathway, not only by influencing the processivity of RdRPs but also by regulating stability of transcripts.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 2 has elegantly designed experiments. However, as aberrant chromosomal aggregation is one of the outcomes of 22G misregulation, enhancement of this phenotype with knockdown of 22G factors in nhl-2(ok818) animals, suggests that nhl-2 is probably involved in a parallel pathway to the 22G-RNA pathway (and not in the same pathway, as mentioned in the paper) that together result in proper chromosomal segregation. Similarly, looking at the H3K9me2 distribution in nhl-2(ok818) with drh-3 or csr-1 RNAi will provide more insight. This also helps bring the paper together, when data from Figure 7 is considered.</p><p>2) Given that HRDE-1 is involved in transgenerational germline silencing, it will be interesting to subject nhl-2(ok818) animals to transgenerational reporter silencing assays (for instance with a Ppie1::GFP reporter system).</p><p>3) It may be useful to include a scatter plot in Figure 5 to clearly indicate the population of 22G and 26G-RNAs that get depleted in nhl-2(ok818).</p><p>4) In Figure 5D, for WAGO-1 targets, a depletion at the 5' end is also seen, but not mentioned in the text anywhere. Is this not significant?</p><p>5) It will be interesting to see if the genes with altered transcript levels in nhl-2(ok818) overlap with CSR-1 mediated slicer target genes or CSR-1 mediated transcriptional activation (Cecere et al., 2014).</p><p>6) For Figure 5 and Figure 7, make sure that the references for all the data sets used are mentioned. For instance, the reference for the data set associated with the RdRP complex mutants has not been mentioned.</p><p>7) In Figure 1—figure supplement 1, schematic for NCL-1 is not shown, but mentioned in the legend. It may also be useful to include a legend relating the color and the corresponding domain.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The TRIM-NHL protein NHL-2 is a Co-Factor in the Nuclear and Somatic RNAi Pathways in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The reviewers and editor agree that it is essential that the authors analyze a second allele of nhl-2 and recommend the usage of a null allele described by the Ambros lab (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28279983).

We agree that it is somewhat unsatisfying to not completely understand HOW NHL-2 does what it does. This is why we continue to work on understanding the mechanisms by which NHL-2 performs the many functions we have implicated it in via this manuscript. In fact, we currently have a number of structure-function experiments underway to disentangle which portions of NHL-2 are required for which functions. However, we have had these current data for some time and we think it is important to publish the current findings so that others may begin to build upon our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Technical concerns.

To address this issue and strengthen our findings, we provide several additional lines of data. First, we generated a strain in which nhl-2 is expressed from the nhl-2 promoter via a multicopy extrachromosomal array. Such extrachromosomal array transgenes are normally silenced in the germline but expressed in the soma. Because of this feature, we were able to test for the ability of this transgene to rescue the nuclear RNAi deficiency of the nhl-2(ok818) mutant (a somatic assay). We show in our new Figure 3B that this transgene rescues the mutant nuclear RNAi deficiency, thus increasing our confidence in attributing this phenotype to loss of nhl-2 in the nhl-2(ok818) strain. Although we are not able to assay the ability of this transgene to rescue germline phenotypes, we know from our own previous RNAi experiments (that we unfortunately did not quantify and thus have not presented herein), and RNAi experiments performed by others (Wormbase) that loss of nhl-2 by RNAi leads to sterility in adult hermaphrodites, consistent with what we have reported here for the mutant. Finally, we examined whether RNAi of nhl-2 leads to a mortal germline phenotype and found that the results recapitulate the Mrt phenotype of the mutant. Collectively, these data provide solid evidence supporting the phenotypes we have observed for the nhl-2(ok818) mutant. [We also note that we attempted to make deletion mutants of nhl-2 via CRISPR-Cas9 editing and recovered alleles that were not useful for our analysis because they produced an in frame truncated NHL-2 protein. Due to time limitations, we were unable to recover a second allele in time.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper investigates the role of the TRIM-NHL protein NHL-2 as a cofactor in the 22G-RNA pathways in C. elegans.

However, a very small proportion of genes that show alteration in 22G levels exhibit upregulated transcript levels. Significant overlap was found between the upregulated genes in nhl-2(ok818) and WAGO-1, HRDE-1 and CSR-1 targets indicating that NHL-2 regulates transcript levels in a small RNA independent manner, probably by binding mRNAs directly.</p><p>This is the first paper to elucidate the detailed role of NHL-2 in the germline and thus makes an important contribution to the field. The authors use both genetic and biochemical techniques to show convincingly that NHL-2 may act as a cofactor in the 22G-RNA pathway, not only by influencing the processivity of RdRPs but also by regulating stability of transcripts.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comprehensive summary and constructive comments to improve this manuscript. Your comments were valuable in improving the quality of the science and strengthening our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 2 has elegantly designed experiments. However, as aberrant chromosomal aggregation is one of the outcomes of 22G misregulation, enhancement of this phenotype with knockdown of 22G factors in nhl-2(ok818) animals, suggests that nhl-2 is probably involved in a parallel pathway to the 22G-RNA pathway (and not in the same pathway, as mentioned in the paper) that together result in proper chromosomal segregation.</p></disp-quote><p>Interpretation of these genetic data is complicated, we agree, thus we have softened statements about the genetic interactions in the manuscript overall. It is correct that there could be several possible interpretations for the data at hand. We see a synergistic phenotype in double mutants/RNAi relative to either single mutant/RNAi (enhanced aggregation) for the diakinesis chromosomal defects (but not for the H3K9me2 spreading, see below). This could indicate that the proteins function in two different pathways and converge on a single molecular/cellular process (chromosome condensation/packaging), as the reviewer suggests. A distinct possibility is that the two proteins are part of a protein complex (acting in the same pathway) that has disrupted function when either is mutated and is even more greatly impaired when both are lost. Because we see a physical interaction between NHL-2 and CSR-1 or DRH-3, this suggests that the synergy could come from disruption of a protein complex within a single pathway. Because we see so many changes in mRNA expression that are independent of small RNA changes in <italic>nhl-2</italic> mutants, it could well be that there is a role for NHL-2 both within the small RNA pathways and within parallel mRNA regulatory pathways. Separation of function alleles and tissue-specific studies will reveal these relationships going forward.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, looking at the H3K9me2 distribution in nhl-2(ok818) with drh-3 or csr-1 RNAi will provide more insight. This also helps bring the paper together, when data from Figure 7 is considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the H3K9me2 data as per the reviewer’s suggestion, and find that for this phenotype, the H3K9me2 spreading is comparable between <italic>nhl-2, csr-1,</italic> and <italic>drh-3</italic> single mutants, and double mutants of <italic>nhl-2</italic> with <italic>csr-1</italic> or <italic>drh-3</italic> show no significant enhancement of the phenotype (Figure 2F, G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given that HRDE-1 is involved in transgenerational germline silencing, it will be interesting to subject nhl-2(ok818) animals to transgenerational reporter silencing assays (for instance with a Ppie1::GFP reporter system).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We generated <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> H2B::GFP reporter worms and examined the inheritance of silencing. We had to conduct these experiments at 20<sup>o</sup>C as the proximal gonad was too disorganized to score at 25°C. <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> H2B::GFP worms showed a modest increase in GFP expression (14%) compared to the <italic>hdre-1(tm1200)</italic> and <italic>ndre-2(mj168</italic>) controls (88% and 84%) (Figure 3F). The comparatively low level of <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> de-silencing may reflect the temperature dependent nature of the <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It may be useful to include a scatter plot in Figure 5 to clearly indicate the population of 22G and 26G-RNAs that get depleted in nhl-2(ok818).</p></disp-quote><p>This seemed like a good suggestion, but it wasn’t as informative as we’d hoped in the end. The best information on populations of 22G-RNAs altered in the mutant comes from Supplementary file 2 and Supplementary file 3, in which we report on the levels of small RNAs for each gene in each data set used. If in the end, you would still like to see these plots, we would be happy to share them with you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 5D, for WAGO-1 targets, a depletion at the 5' end is also seen, but not mentioned in the text anywhere. Is this not significant?</p></disp-quote><p>Good question. This is an interesting situation. It seems that overall, the profile of small RNAs along WAGO targets is noisier than CSR-1 targets (though we are uncertain of what this reflects at this point), and in fact when we performed the same centroid analysis as we did for CSR-1, we found that there is actually a shift in the small RNA pool ever so slightly toward the 5' end of WAGO targets (and this shift is barely statistically significant). We report this observation in the text and in new Figure 5—figure supplement 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 6. The reason for this shift could be due to technical issues: we captured more of these small RNAs in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> samples because other small RNAs were missing in these samples (the “filling the cloning space” phenomenon), or it could be biological (perhaps RRF-1 complexes have greater activity on WAGO targets in this scenario because other shared factors like DRH-3, EKL-1 are limiting, for instance).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It will be interesting to see if the genes with altered transcript levels in nhl-2(ok818) overlap with CSR-1 mediated slicer target genes or CSR-1 mediated transcriptional activation (Cecere et al., 2014).</p></disp-quote><p>Another good question. We should have done this analysis from the start. Now we have included a comparison between in <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> and the CSR-1 GRO-Seq (updated Figure 7C. Upregulated genes in downregulated genes) and the <italic>csr-1</italic> slicer dead (upregulated genes) datasets <italic>nhl-2(ok818)</italic> animals (25°C) showed a significant overlap with both <italic>csr-1</italic> GRO-Seq downregulated and CSR-1 slicer dead upregulated targets. There is minimal overlap between the GRO-Seq downregulated genes and the Slice dead upregulated genes (~15 genes), so it seems that NHL-2 is a consistently negative regulator these different subsets of CSR-1 targets, despite the impact of CSR-1 on these genes (positive vs. negative roles for CSR-1). We would note, however, that these are shockingly small subsets of the CSR-1 targets overall (4932 genes in total), so it is important to keep this in perspective.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) For Figure 5 and Figure 7, make sure that the references for all the data sets used are mentioned. For instance, the reference for the data set associated with the RdRP complex mutants has not been mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for voicing this concern. We could have been more clear about these refs.</p><p>throughout the paper, it’s true. We have now added a tab to the Supplementary file 3, reporting all references for the data sets included therein and providing what we hope is a useful legend for each column in this table.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 1—figure supplement 1, schematic for NCL-1 is not shown, but mentioned in the legend.

Rescue has only been provided for one specific (quite uninformative) phenotype, L1 arrest. And the RNAi phenocopy analysis is also limited. The reviewers and editor agree that it is essential that the authors analyze a second allele of nhl-2 and recommend the usage of a null allele described by the Ambros lab (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28279983). This analysis should not be limited to a single phenotype, but to all of the relevant phenotypes that the authors describe for the currently existing allele.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken advantage of a newly developed <italic>nhl-2</italic> null allele (<italic>nhl-2(ma372 ma399)</italic>) that removes the entire NHL-2 coding sequence and replaces it with GFP.
