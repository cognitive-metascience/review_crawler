machinery are poorly understood. Here, we study this process using the predator <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and the bacterial prey <italic>Streptomyces,</italic> which have evolved a powerful defense: the production of nematicides. We demonstrate that upon exposure to <italic>Streptomyces</italic> at their head or tail, nematodes display an escape response that is mediated by bacterially produced cues. Avoidance requires a predicted G-protein-coupled receptor, SRB-6, which is expressed in five types of amphid and phasmid chemosensory neurons. We establish that species of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> secrete dodecanoic acid, which is sensed by SRB-6. This behavioral adaptation represents an important strategy for the nematode, which utilizes specialized sensory organs and a chemoreceptor that is tuned to recognize the bacteria. These findings provide a window into the molecules and organs used in the coevolutionary arms race between predator and potential prey.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>predator</kwd><kwd>prey</kwd><kwd>Streptomyces</kwd><kwd>srb-6</kwd><kwd>dodecanoic acid</kwd><kwd>phasmid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HRD-1302873</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Angelina</given-names></name><name><surname>Matthews</surname><given-names>Sarah Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH MARC Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T34GM008253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wellbrook</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS087544</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>L'Etoile</surname><given-names>Noelle</given-names></name><name><surname>VanHoven</surname><given-names>Miri K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5SC3GM118199</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller Conrad</surname><given-names>Laura C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1355202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>VanHoven</surname><given-names>Miri K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM089595</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>VanHoven</surname><given-names>Miri K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> require a GPCR to recognize and rapidly escape from toxin-producing <italic>Streptomyces</italic> at their head or tail.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The evolutionary interactions of predators with their prey have profoundly influenced the history of life on earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lotka, 1920</xref>).

The avoidance could be due to a non-specific interaction that is based on the compound’s surfactant properties, or it could be due to specific binding and recognition of SDS. We found that the surfactant activity of SDS was not required for the avoidance response, as concentrations ten-fold below the critical micelle concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rahman and Brown, 1983</xref>) were still avoided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, a surfactant (Triton X-100) at its critical micelle concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">(Tiller et al., 1984</xref>) did not elicit a strong avoidance response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These findings indicate that SDS is unlikely to elicit a response through a non-specific detergent effect.

There are two pairs of chemosensory neurons in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> tail that have exposed dendrites: the PHA and PHB chemosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hedgecock et al., 1985</xref>). These neurons mediate the rapid avoidance of SDS and other chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hilliard et al., 2002</xref>). In the head, additional neurons play roles in chemical avoidance, including the polymodal nociceptor ASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bargmann, 2006</xref>). Therefore, to identify the cognate receptor for dodecanoic acid, we performed an expression screen using existing data that are available on Wormbase.org (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">WormBase web site, 2017</xref>) for chemoreceptor genes that are expressed in the PHA and PHB neurons and in at least one set of head or amphid neurons. We performed RNA interference (RNAi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fraser et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kamath and Ahringer, 2003</xref>) to knock down the function of these genes and screened for defects in the phasmid response to dodecanoic acid. We ranked the chemoreceptor genes by the magnitude of the defect, and focused our work on the gene whose knock-down resulted in the most severe phenotype, that encoding the SRB-6 G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>srb-6</italic> knock-down also resulted in the most severe defect among knockdowns of <italic>srb</italic> family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition to <italic>srb-6</italic>’s expression in PHA and PHB neurons in the tail, this gene is expressed in only three sets of sensory neurons in the head; <italic>srb-6</italic> is highly expressed in the ASH and ADL neurons, and weakly expressed in the ADF neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Troemel et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>To further test the role of <italic>srb-6</italic> in mediating the rapid avoidance response, we performed behavioral assays with <italic>srb-6</italic> presumptive null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thompson et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>srb-6</italic> mutants were defective in the tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) avoidance response to species of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> and to dodecanoic acid.

Interestingly, dodecanoic acid is secreted by crown daisy plants (<italic>Chrysanthemum coronarium L.</italic>), which are intercropped with tomatoes (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) to prevent parasitism by root-knot nematodes (<italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic>), and root-knot nematodes are repelled by 4 mM dodecanoic acid (but not by lower concentrations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2014</xref>). This, in addition to our phylogenetic analyses, suggests conservation among nematodes of this mechanism of escaping toxin-producing organisms that would otherwise be a good food source.</p><p>In addition to the detection of dodecanoic acid, we also discovered that decanoic acid elicits a strong escape response in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that is also mediated by the SRB-6 GPCR. However, high levels of decanoic acid are not secreted by <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. Decanoic acid has also been shown to have nematicidal properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tarjan and Cheo, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel-Rahman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), and decanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, and fatty acids of similar lengths are present in many plant seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), indicating that avoiding decanoic acid in the environment may also be important to nematodes, outside the context of bacterial avoidance.</p><p>The more well-studied interaction between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and bacterial species is the host–pathogen interaction, in which bacteria infect <italic>C. elegans. Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is frequently attracted to pathogens initially, facilitating colonization of the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schulenburg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meisel and Kim, 2014</xref>). In the predator–prey interaction disclosed in the present work, however, we demonstrate that <italic>C. elegans</italic> has evolved a mechanism to recognize and escape from the powerful defenses presented by <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. This avoidance mechanism probably arose through selection pressure on GPCRs, and by employment of reflex-like neural circuits in the head and tail sensory organs, a mechanism that may be common to other predator–prey interactions. Thus, this study deepens our understanding of the molecules, neural circuitry, and behavior used in the arms race between predators and their prey.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> strains</title><p>Wild-type C. <italic>elegan</italic>s strains were the Bristol strain N2 or <italic>wyIs157 IV ox9</italic> (<italic>10</italic>).

There was no reason to restrict the sample sizes to 14 for most genotypes, therefore we used samples sizes of at least 40 for most genotypes.</p><p>Results are reported in the form of <italic>P</italic>-values in the figures (*, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01; ***, p&lt;0.001; NS, p&gt;0.05), and exact <italic>P-</italic>values are reported in the source data files for the figures. <italic>P</italic>-values provide precise information about whether two populations differ significantly in either means or proportions.</p><p>For the amphid (head) avoidance assay, statistical significance was determined by two-independent-sample <italic>z</italic>-tests, followed by the Hochberg procedure. Independent sample z-tests can be used to compare two population proportions if the sample sizes are sufficiently large. The Hochberg procedure is a standard procedure applied to adjust for the tendency to reject a null hypothesis incorrectly when multiple comparison are made, and can only conservatively increase <italic>P</italic>-values. A multiple comparison procedure is required whenever several conclusions are drawn from the same group of data in order to assure that the overall error rate for a type I error is still bound by the chosen significance level (here 0.05, 0.01, 0.001). For phasmid (tail) response assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2, a</xref> one-way ANOVA model to compare the means of three or more populations was fitted in R. Tukey’s post-hoc test was performed in R to compare the means of the individual treatments while simultaneously adjusting for multiple comparisons. For the phasmid (tail) response assays reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, data representing mean length or means of percentages were analyzed with two-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests followed by the Hochberg procedure for multiple comparisons. For the pair-wise comparison of population means in the chemotaxis assays, Tukey’s post-hoc test was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.</p><p>Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) for major results include the following: wild-type phasmid response to <italic>S. avermitilis</italic> cell-free supernatant compared with buffer – 2.8; wild-type amphid response to <italic>S. avermitilis</italic> compared with buffer – 1.4; wild-type phasmid response to dodecanoic acid compared with buffer – 2.1; wild-type amphid response to dodecanoic acid compared with buffer –1.4; <italic>srb-6</italic> phasmid response to dodecanoic acid compared to wild-type phasmid response to dodecanoic acid – 1.8; <italic>srb-6</italic> amphid response to dodecanoic acid compared to wild-type amphid response to dodecanoic acid – 0.54.</p><p>For calcium-imaging experiments, we normalized the two different compound treatments to animals exposed to buffer in the first channel, then buffer in the second channel, then buffer in the first channel again (buffer control) by subtracting the averaged time series in the buffer control worms from each individual treatment time series. Then we computed the area under the curve during exposure to stimulus (15–75 s) for each individual normalized worm, and compared wild-type to <italic>srb-6</italic> using a two-sample t-test. We did this separately for the two different treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RNAi feeding experiments</title><p>The RNAi feeding screen was performed using the Ahringer library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fraser et al., 2000</xref>) according to the Source BioScience protocol using the RNAi-sensitive strain <italic>eri-1</italic>(<italic>mg366</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kennedy et al., 2004</xref>).

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>C. elegans</italic> avoids toxin-producing <italic>Streptomyces</italic> using a seven transmembrane domain chemosensory receptor&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Oliver Hobert as Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Leslie B Vosshall (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers appreciate the description of a potential mechanism by which <italic>C. elegans</italic> nematodes detect and avoid toxic bacteria. The paper catalogues the species of bacteria that induce avoidance responses, use analytical chemistry to identify the bioactive repellents, and discover the sensory neurons and receptors responsible. The work is an engaging read on many levels: behavioral neuroscience, chemical ecology, and chemoreceptor biology.</p><p>The main experimental issue that needs to be addressed is based on the fact that the <italic>srb-6</italic> phenotype is based on a single allele and no rescue data is provided. Since the focus of <italic>srb-6</italic> action is also not explored, the reviewers suggest addressing both issues simultaneously by rescuing the <italic>srb-6</italic> phenotype with available neuron-type specific promoters. This would confirm that <italic>srb-6</italic> is indeed responsible for the phenotype and assess where the gene acts.</p><p>Other points that need to be fixed, but may not require further experimentation:</p><p>1) Statistical analysis throughout seems flawed. Rather than comparing everything to the saline buffer control and reporting significance relative to this, can the authors do ANOVA analysis and show us which of the data points differ from each other? Conventional presentation is to label plots that differ at some significance level with different letters.</p><p>2) It's not clear from the experiments what the actual link is between <italic>Streptomyces</italic> avoidance and dodecanoate (dodecanoic acid? see comment below) avoidance. First, most compounds that were tested elicited an avoidance response in this assay, and presumably many other bacterial metabolites that were not tested would also elicit a similar response. Second, what concentrations of metabolites were tested? This information does not appear to be provided. Was dose-response analysis performed?</p><p>3) There is confusion about the actual compounds that were tested. The authors refer to &quot;dodecanoate&quot; and &quot;decanoate&quot; as the tested compounds. But this isn't actually a compound. Does this mean sodium dodecanoate and sodium decanoate, or dodecanoic acid and decanoic acid? Based on the chemical structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, I</xref>'m guessing it was the acids that were tested. But then in the Discussion, &quot;dodecanoate&quot; is mentioned in the same paragraph as &quot;dodecanoic acid&quot; as if these are two different compounds. The authors need to specify exactly which chemicals they are testing and refer to them consistently throughout the paper. A table with CAS numbers would be helpful. Also, these compounds are referred to as &quot;water-soluble cues&quot; when I don't think they are very water-soluble.</p><p>4) Results paragraph three: This paragraph is confusing. Is there a reason to think that PHA and PHB only sense SDS and similar compounds? Also, how does the conclusion that <italic>Streptomyces</italic> is unlikely to act by physically disrupting the nematode follow from the fact that the surfactant activity of SDS is not required for avoidance? If PHA and PHB express multiple chemoreceptors, presumably they can sense a number of unrelated compounds.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>:</p><p>a) It would help to show molecular structures for C and E in addition to D.</p><p>b) It would be helpful to show statistics relative to the SDS positive control in addition to the buffer negative control. Based only on comparisons to the buffer control, it's hard to tell which compounds are as effective as SDS in eliciting an avoidance response.</p><p>c) In E, why are only a subset of the tested compounds listed in the legend? Also, why was a two-sample z-test used? I thought a z-test was for cases where you know there are two different populations embedded within the larger population (e.g. males vs. females).</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: The legend needs to be more detailed to be comprehensible to a non-chemist.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: The authors mention that they did an expression screen, but no details are provided. Was this by transcriptional profiling? Using existing data available on WormBase? Were other receptors found that were also expressed in the PHA and PHB neurons in addition to a subset of amphid neurons? Since there is no information about the expression screen, it's not clear how unique <italic>srb-6</italic> really is. A rationale should be provided for why <italic>srb-6</italic> was picked for analysis.</p><p>8) Along the same lines as previous point: Have other GRCR mutants with similar expression pattern been tested for <italic>Streptomyces</italic> avoidance; if so, this data could be provided as control? Similarly, have other <italic>srb</italic> genes been tested? It would also be nice to see data for a screen of other <italic>srb</italic> mutants to see if the defect seen with <italic>srb-6</italic> is really specific to <italic>srb-6</italic>.</p><p>9) The authors show that <italic>srb-6</italic> mutants are defective in their response to S. avermitilis. Have <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species been tested? If <italic>srb-6</italic> is the primary receptor gene required for avoidance of <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, you'd expect <italic>srb-6</italic> mutants to be defective in their avoidance of all three species.</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>: It would help to highlight <italic>srb-6</italic> so it is easier to find it in the phylogenetic tree. Also, aren't all of the srb genes nematode-specific?</p><p>11) Were the behavioral experiments performed across multiple days to control for day-to-day variation in behavior?</p><p>12) It would improve presentation clarity if the authors de-cluttered their plots by eliminated extraneous vertical lines to mark off the axis units</p><p>13) Figure 1—figure supplement 2 contains bar plots, which should be converted to box plots or dot plots so that readers can see something closer to the raw data</p><p>14) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>: hard to see the black text on top of the cyan semi-circle. Maybe play with color to enhance clarity</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised article &quot;<italic>C. elegans</italic> avoids toxin-producing <italic>Streptomyces</italic> using a seven transmembrane domain chemosensory receptor&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>It was generally agreed upon that the revisions did not properly address the concerns raised in the original review. The specific problems are as follows:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4 D and E</xref> need to be modified to include data from the mutant. Mutant rescue cannot be interpreted without side-by-side data from the mutant vs. wild type vs. mutant rescue. From the graph, it looks like the authors did not test wt, <italic>srb-6</italic>, and <italic>ocr-2::srb-6</italic> in parallel. However, in the methods section, the authors say that they injected the rescue construct into <italic>srb-6</italic> mutants, and in the behavioral assays they tested &quot;non-array carrying animals (data not shown)&quot;. Based on this statement, it's possible that the authors did test wt<italic>, srb-6</italic> (non-array carrying animals), and <italic>ocr-2::srb-6</italic> in parallel, but for some reason didn't show this. If this really is what they did, they should show the data and do the appropriate statistics to show that <italic>srb-6</italic> mutants are different from wt and the rescue line when tested in parallel. If this is not what they did, the authors need to repeat the experiment and test the three genotypes in parallel.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 D</xref>: where is the missing &quot;wild type buffer&quot; control?</p><p>3) Since the authors have not individually rescued <italic>srb-6</italic> function in each of the 5 neurons in which it is expressed, they should soften language and interpretations about circuitry accordingly.</p><p>4) The authors' description of the rescue is ambiguous. In the main text, they say that they used a promoter that &quot;drives expression selectively in PHA and PHB.&quot; However, they chose a promoter that is expressed in PHA, PHB, ASH, ADL, ADF, and AWA. The language implies to me that <italic>srb-6</italic> is only expressed in the phasmid neurons, but this is not the case. In the Materials and methods, they also talk about &quot;cell-specific rescue,&quot; which again is ambiguous.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23770.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The main experimental issue that needs to be addressed is based on the fact that the srb-6 phenotype is based on a single allele and no rescue data is provided. Since the focus of srb-6 action is also not explored, the reviewers suggest to address both issues simultaneously by rescuing the srb-6 phenotype with available neuron-type specific promoters. This would confirm that srb-6 is indeed responsible for the phenotype and assess where the gene acts.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is an interesting experiment. We cloned and sequenced the <italic>srb-6</italic> cDNA, which has a sequence identical to that predicted on Wormbase.org. Troemel et al., 1995 reported that <italic>srb-6</italic> is strongly expressed in PHA and PHB neurons in the tail, and ASH and ADL neurons in the head, and also weakly expressed in ADF neurons in the head, which are presynaptic to ASH. We therefore searched for a promoter that was expressed in ASH, ADL and ADF neurons and as few other pairs of head neurons as possible. The well characterized gene <italic>ocr-2</italic> is expressed in these three pairs of cells and only one other, the AWA olfactory neurons. <italic>ocr-2</italic> is additionally expressed in PHA and PHB neurons in the tail. We therefore generated an <italic>pocr-2::srb-6</italic> transgene, allowing us to perform cell-specific rescue assays in the head and tail with the same transgenic animals. The ability of <italic>srb-6</italic> mutants to respond to <italic>S. avermitilis</italic> and dodecanoic acid exposure at the tail and head, respectively, was rescued by addition of the <italic>pocr-2::srb-6</italic> transgene. These results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and are described in the Results section with the following text:</p><p>“In the tail, the limited expression of the <italic>srb-6</italic> GPCR in PHA and PHB neurons indicates that <italic>srb-6</italic> likely functions in these neurons to drive the tail response. […] Taken together, these data and previous results indicate that the circuit responsible for mediating the response to <italic>Streptomyces</italic> and dodecanoic acid exposure at the head may differ from the circuit responsible for the response to SDS.”</p><p>In the Discussion, we also added the following text:</p><p>“Rescue of gene expression in these cells and one additional amphid olfactory neuron largely restores the response of <italic>srb-6</italic> mutants to <italic>Streptomyces</italic> and dodecanoic acid exposure at the tail and head, respectively. […] While ASH, ADL and ASK mediate the response to SDS exposure at the head, ASH, ADL and ADF likely mediate the response to <italic>Streptomyces</italic> and dodecanoic acid exposure at the head, indicating distinct response circuits for these structurally similar compounds.”</p><p>In addition, <italic>srb-6</italic> RNAi produces a similar phenotype to that observed for the <italic>srb-6</italic> allele used in these studies (see response to reviewer comment 7), which should also help to address this concern.</p><p><italic>Other points that need to be fixed, but may not require further experimentation:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Statistical analysis throughout seems flawed. Rather than comparing everything to the saline buffer control and reporting significance relative to this, can the authors do ANOVA analysis and show us which of the datapoints differ from each other? Conventional presentation is to label plots that differ at some significance level with different letters.</italic> </p><p>We performed 1-factor ANOVA analysis for relative response index data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>, and D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. In order to better illustrate the similarities and differences in backing times to SDS and buffer, respectively (as requested in the similar reviewer comment #5 part 2), we modified the appropriate figure panels to include both of these comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, we now include tables of Tukey’s post-hoc test values for all pairwise comparisons for each of these figures in the source data files associated with these figures.</p><p>Since the worms utilized for the amphid assays are not the same in different treatment groups (e.g. buffer, SDS, dodecanoic acid, etc.), and we are interested in comparing proportions of worms that react to the treatment across the different groups, we are using independent sample Z-tests for proportions to establish significance. In order to better illustrate the similarities and differences of proportions to SDS and buffer, respectively (and address reviewer comment #5 part 2), we modified the appropriate figure panels to include both of these comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Additionally, we included tables of all pairwise comparisons for each of these figures in the source data files associated with these figures. All p-values are adjusted by the Hochberg method for multiple comparisons.</p><p><italic>2) It's not clear from the experiments what the actual link is between Streptomyces avoidance and dodecanoate (dodecanoic acid? see comment below) avoidance. First, most compounds that were tested elicited an avoidance response in this assay, and presumably many other bacterial metabolites that were not tested would also elicit a similar response.</italic> </p><p>We propose in this manuscript that dodecanoic acid secreted by <italic>Streptomyces</italic> in a contributor to <italic>C. elegans</italic> avoidance of these toxin-producing species. It is likely that other secreted factors also contribute to this response. In support of this, we demonstrate that <italic>C. elegans</italic> avoids the species that secrete dodecanoic acid, species of <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, but do not avoid the control species that does not secrete dodecanoic acid, <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. We also identify a G protein-coupled receptor, <italic>srb-6</italic>, that is required for the response to both <italic>Streptomyces</italic> and dodecanoic acid. To clarify this for the readers, we have revised text in the Results: “While additional cues from <italic>Streptomyces</italic> likely contribute to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> response, our observation of dodecanoic acid supports the hypothesis that it is a cue produced by <italic>Streptomyces</italic>.” Also please note in the Discussion: “<italic>C. elegans</italic> rapidly avoids secretions from the bacteria, which include dodecanoic acid.”</p><p>To address the point that most compounds that were tested elicited an avoidance response in this assay, our goal was to understand the structure-activity relationship of compounds related to SDS, the most potent chemical activator of the phasmid neurons known, and a potent activator of ASH and ADL in the head in hermaphrodites. We predicted that most related compounds would have some activity. Still, we found that certain components were critical for detection. For example, when we removed the carboxylate or sulfate group (e.g. 1-dodecanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, 2E</xref>) or 1-decanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>)), we lost all activity.</p><p>To address the point that presumably many other bacterial metabolites that were not tested would also elicit a similar response, we propose that the toxic <italic>Streptomyces</italic> secretion dodecanoic acid is avoided, but non-toxic secretions from bacteria that serve as a food source for <italic>C. elegans</italic> would be unlikely to elicit an escape response. In support of this, we show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> avoided secretions from <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, but they do not rapidly avoid secretions from <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>B. subtilis.</italic> However, as stated above, we agree that other secretions from <italic>Streptomyces</italic> likely contribute to the avoidance response. We have softened language in the paper to reflect the possibility that other bacterial secretions could be involved in this avoidance.</p><p><italic>Second, what concentrations of metabolites were tested? This information does not appear to be provided. Was dose-response analysis performed?</italic> </p><p>Thank you for catching this accidental deletion. We have included concentration information to the captions of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Dose-response analysis for SDS, decanoic acid, and dodecanoic acid was also added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) There is confusion about the actual compounds that were tested. The authors refer to &quot;dodecanoate&quot; and &quot;decanoate&quot; as the tested compounds. But this isn't actually a compound. Does this mean sodium dodecanoate and sodium decanoate, or dodecanoic acid and decanoic acid? Based on the chemical structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, I</xref>'m guessing it was the acids that were tested. But then in the Discussion, &quot;dodecanoate&quot; is mentioned in the same paragraph as &quot;dodecanoic acid&quot; as if these are two different compounds. The authors need to specify exactly which chemicals they are testing and refer to them consistently throughout the paper. A table with CAS numbers would be helpful. Also, these compounds are referred to as &quot;water-soluble cues&quot; when I don't think they are very water-soluble.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the confusion and thank the editors for their suggestion of adding CAS numbers. We have added a table with the CAS numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we used the terms for the carboxylic acids in the text, but have added the following statement to make it clear that at pH 7, the carboxylate form would be the predominant form in solution: “Both SDS and these carboxylic acids have long hydrophobic alkyl tails and negatively charged head groups at pH 7.” In the figures, we have maintained the terms and structures for the carboxylate forms, because these are the relevant forms when the compounds are dissolved in the pH 7 assay buffer. We feel that this is important to demonstrate the structural similarities among these molecules. For further clarity, in each appropriate figure panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B–E</xref>) we added in the statement that compounds are represented as the predominant form in a pH 7 solution, the carboxylates. To prevent confusion, we also removed the three uses of the term “water-soluble” from the text.</p><p><italic>4) Results paragraph three: This paragraph is confusing. Is there a reason to think that PHA and PHB only sense SDS and similar compounds? Also, how does the conclusion that Streptomyces is unlikely to act by physically disrupting the nematode follow from the fact that the surfactant activity of SDS is not required for avoidance? If PHA and PHB express multiple chemoreceptors, presumably they can sense a number of unrelated compounds.</italic> </p><p>We acknowledge that this point was not well explained in the original manuscript. We reworked this paragraph to clarify. It now reads:</p><p>“Previously, the PHA and PHB-class neurons in the tail were shown to act in a defined circuit respond to the man-made detergent SDS, which does not appear in nature. […] Therefore, we looked to define the structural elements of SDS that are responsible for the avoidance response.”</p><p>We do not think that PHA and PHB only sense SDS and similar compounds. However, SDS is the compound that elicits the most robust phasmid response known, and few other compounds have been fully characterized with respect to these neurons. This is why we chose it as a starting point for our studies. To make this more clear in the text, we added the following sentence: “Few compounds have been fully characterized with respect to these neurons, however dilute concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) have been shown to elicit a rapid and robust avoidance response in hermaphrodites, the primary sex found in nature.”</p><p>Finally, we agree that PHA and PHB express multiple chemoreceptors, and presumably can sense a number of unrelated compounds. We explained why we focused on SDS and related compounds in this study above, but it would be very interesting to explore this large topic in future studies.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>:</italic> </p><p><italic>a) It would help to show molecular structures for C and E in addition to D.</italic> </p><p>We have added in molecular structures for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and 2E</xref> in addition to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>.</p><p><italic>b) It would be helpful to show statistics relative to the SDS positive control in addition to the buffer negative control. Based only on comparisons to the buffer control, it's hard to tell which compounds are as effective as SDS in eliciting an avoidance response.</italic> </p><p>Please see the response to reviewer comment #1, which addresses this directly. In summary, we have added in statistics relative to the SDS positive control in addition to the buffer negative control for all appropriate Figure panels.</p><p><italic>c) In E, why are only a subset of the tested compounds listed in the legend? Also, why was a two-sample z-test used? I thought a z-test was for cases where you know there are two different populations embedded within the larger population (e.g. males vs. females).</italic> </p><p>We have now listed all compounds in the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. For the question regarding the use of the two-sample z-test, please see the second paragraph in the response to reviewer comment #1, which addresses this directly.</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: The legend needs to be more detailed to be comprehensible to a non-chemist.</italic> </p><p>More detail has been added to the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> legend, and for clarity, we have also added labels into the figure. The legend now reads:</p><p>“<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.Detection of carboxylates secreted by <italic>S. avermitilis, S. costaricanus,</italic> and <italic>S. milbemycinicus.</italic> Carboxylates were extracted from species of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> and labeled with a pyridinium moiety for easier detection by mass spectrometry. For example, to detect dodecanoate, after <italic>Streptomyces</italic> cell-free supernatants were extracted and concentrated, dodecanoate and the other carboxylates in the extract were converted to pyridinium esters by treatment with carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) in acetonitrile (ACN).”</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: The authors mention that they did an expression screen, but no details are provided. Was this by transcriptional profiling? Using existing data available on WormBase? Were other receptors found that were also expressed in the PHA and PHB neurons in addition to a subset of amphid neurons? Since there is no information about the expression screen, it's not clear how unique srb-6 really is. A rationale should be provided for why srb-6 was picked for analysis.</italic> </p><p>Using existing data available on WormBase, we screened for receptors expressed in the PHA and PHB neurons in addition to a subset of amphid neurons. The majority of these genes do not have characterized loss-of-function alleles, therefore we used RNAi to screen for behavioral defects. <italic>srb-6</italic> RNAi had the most severe defect. We have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> to present the results of this RNAi screen. We also revised the appropriate section of the Results to describe the screen. The text now reads:</p><p>“To identify the cognate receptor, we performed an expression screen using existing data available on Wormbase.org for chemoreceptors that are expressed in the PHA and PHB neurons and at least one set of amphid neurons. […] We ranked them by the magnitude of the defect, and focused our work on the gene whose knock-down resulted in the most severe phenotype, namely the <italic>srb-6</italic> G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><p><italic>8) Along the same lines as previous point: Have other GRCR mutants with similar expression pattern been tested for Streptomyces avoidance; if so, this data could be provided as control? Similarly, have other srb genes been tested? It would also be nice to see data for a screen of other srb mutants to see if the defect seen with srb-6 is really specific to srb-6.</italic> </p><p>For testing of other GPCRs with similar expression patterns please see our response to reviewer comment #7. To address the question about other <italic>srb</italic> genes, only one <italic>srb</italic> gene has previously reported phasmid expression, <italic>srb-3</italic>, but RNAi of <italic>srb-3</italic> did not yield a severe behavioral defect in our RNAi screen (see response to reviewer comment #7). However to further address this comment, in case expression in the phasmid was not reported, we obtained all RNAi strains available for <italic>srb</italic> genes from the Ahringer collection (excluding pseudogenes) and performed RNAi. <italic>srb-6</italic> again had the most severe defect. The data has been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. We added the following sentence to the Results section:</p><p>“<italic>srb-6</italic> similarly had the most severe defect within the <italic>srb</italic> family of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><p><italic>9) The authors show that srb-6 mutants are defective in their response to S. avermitilis. Have Streptomyces species been tested? If srb-6 is the primary receptor gene required for avoidance of Streptomyces, you'd expect srb-6 mutants to be defective in their avoidance of all three species.</italic> </p><p>We tested <italic>srb-6</italic> mutants for their response to exposure to <italic>S. costaricanus,</italic> and <italic>S.milbemycinicus</italic> at the tail and head and found <italic>srb-6</italic> mutants to be defective in their avoidance of these species. We have added this data into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>.</p><p><italic>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>: It would help to highlight srb-6 so it is easier to find it in the phylogenetic tree. Also, aren't all of the srb genes nematode-specific?</italic> </p><p>We have highlighted <italic>srb-6</italic>, its closest homologs within the <italic>Caenhorabditis</italic> genus, and the monophyletic group containing nematodes outside the <italic>Caenhorabditis</italic> genus in different colors (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, entitled “<italic>C. elegans srb-6</italic> has homologs within the <italic>Caenhorabditis</italic> genus and the nematode phylum”). We have also revised and moved the section describing the tree to attempt to make our purpose more clear. The section is now at the end of the Results and reads:</p><p>“These circuits in the head and tail of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and the GPCR required for the avoidance response provide <italic>C. elegans</italic> with the machinery needed to avoid potentially deadly prey. […] Although the sequences for most nematodes are not complete, the next monophyletic group contains several other species of nematodes with life cycles that include free-living soil-dwelling stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting possible conservation of this mechanism.”</p><p><italic>11) Were the behavioral experiments performed across multiple days to control for day-to-day variation in behavior?</italic> </p><p>The sequence of behavioral experiments was performed across several years. In the phasmid assay, while absolute back-up times into both buffer and compounds are variable from day to day, the ratio of back-up times between SDS and buffer, between other compounds and buffer, and between different compounds and SDS, stays fairly consistent. Therefore to control for day-to-day variation, we work with ratios of individual back-up times in a given compound compared to average backup times in SDS. In the amphid assay, not much variation from day to day was observed for proportions of animals that responded to SDS or buffer. However, both RNAi and chemotaxis assays performed in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> are variable from day-to-day due to variable success of RNAi and possible other sources of variation in chemotaxis assays, so these experiments were performed on more than one day in order to be able to quantify day-to-day variation.</p><p><italic>12) It would improve presentation clarity if the authors de-cluttered their plots by eliminated extraneous vertical lines to mark off the axis units</italic> </p><p>We have removed vertical lines to mark off the axis units from all plots.</p><p><italic>13) Figure 1—figure supplement 2 contains bar plots, which should be converted to box plots or dot plots so that readers can see something closer to the raw data</italic> </p><p>The figure has been converted into a dot plot.</p><p><italic>14) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>: hard to see the black text on top of the cyan semi-circle. Maybe play with color to enhance clarity</italic> </p><p>We have lightened the cyan color, and are happy to lighten it further if the text is still hard to see on your screen.</p><p>We have one additional note. When we performed the cell-specific rescue experiments requested by the reviewers, we used new <italic>Streptomyces</italic> preparations, and the response rate in the head was a little higher in wild-type animals, possibly due to improved growth conditions. We have revised the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> to be consistent with the new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, but no text changes were required, as this does not change the interpretation.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4 D and E</xref> need to be modified to include data from the mutant. Mutant rescue cannot be interpreted without side-by-side data from the mutant vs. wild type vs. mutant rescue. From the graph, it looks like the authors did not test wt, srb-6, and ocr-2::srb-6 in parallel. However, in the Materials and methods section, the authors say that they injected the rescue construct into srb-6 mutants, and in the behavioral assays they tested &quot;non-array carrying animals (data not shown)&quot;. Based on this statement, it's possible that the authors did test wt, srb-6 (non-array carrying animals), and ocr-2::srb-6 in parallel, but for some reason didn't show this. If this really is what they did, they should show the data and do the appropriate statistics to show that srb-6 mutants are different from wt and the rescue line when tested in parallel. If this is not what they did, the authors need to repeat the experiment and test the three genotypes in parallel.</italic> </p><p>We have tested wild type, <italic>srb-6</italic> (non-transgene) and <italic>ocr-2::srb-6; srb-6</italic> in parallel, and performed the appropriate statistics to show that <italic>srb-6</italic> mutants are different from wild-type and the rescue lines when tested in parallel, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref> (previously <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>) and figure legend.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 D</xref>: where is the missing &quot;wild type buffer&quot; control?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this potential point of confusion. We have added a wild type buffer control to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> (previously 4D) and we have revised our Materials and methods section to make more clear that the relative response index measurements, which we previously simply cited, include a normalization to buffer controls (Statistical analysis, final paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) Since the authors have not individually rescued srb-6 function in each of the 5 neurons in which it is expressed, they should soften language and interpretations about circuitry accordingly.</italic> </p><p>We agree and have revised the text accordingly. Specifically, we have softened the language and interpretations about circuitry throughout the manuscript. Major examples include the following: in the Results, we are now careful to say that one or a subset of the cells mediates the response in the tail and in the head. Similarly, in the Discussion, instead of discussing a model in which all of the <italic>srb-6</italic> expressing neurons function in the same circuit, we instead mention chemosensory roles of each sensory neuron in which <italic>srb-6</italic> is expressed. These changes streamlined the focus of the paper and we thank you for suggesting them. In addition, we performed calcium imaging experiments on ASH neurons in wild-type and <italic>srb-6</italic> mutant animals, and found that <italic>srb-6</italic> mutants have significantly reduced calcium influx in response to both <italic>S. avermitilis</italic> and dodecanoic acid, thus specifically implicating this neuron in the head and indicating that <italic>srb-6</italic> can act as a receptor for both stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E-F</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) The authors' description of the rescue is ambiguous. In the main text, they say that they used a promoter that &quot;drives expression selectively in PHA and PHB.&quot; However, they chose a promoter that is expressed in PHA, PHB, ASH, ADL, ADF, and AWA. The language implies to me that srb-6 is only expressed in the phasmid neurons, but this is not the case. In the Materials and methods, they also talk about &quot;cell-specific rescue,&quot; which again is ambiguous.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for drawing this potential point of confusion to our attention. We were trying to convey that within the tail region, the promoter selectively drives expression in PHA and PHB neurons. Our previous phrasing, “[…] we cloned the <italic>srb-6</italic> cDNA and expressed it under the direction of a promoter that drives expression selectively in the PHA and PHB neurons in the tail region (p<italic>ocr-2</italic>)” could be ambiguous. Therefore we have clarified to the following statement, “[…] we cloned the <italic>srb-6</italic> cDNA and expressed it under the direction of the <italic>ocr-2</italic> promoter. Within the tail region, this promoter selectively drives expression in the PHA and PHB neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">25</xref>).” It is important to note that in the next paragraph we describe the use of the <italic>ocr-2</italic> promoter to rescue <italic>srb-6</italic> function in chemosensory neurons in the head, and also use the name of the <italic>ocr-2</italic> promoter in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and in the Materials and methods. Just in case there might be any similar confusion about expression of the <italic>ocr-2</italic> promoter in the head region, we also moved “Within the head” to the beginning of the sentence/paragraph to clarify; the text now reads, “In the head, the ocr-2 promoter drives expression in ASH, ADL and ADF gustatory neurons in addition to AWA olfactory neurons.” Also, in the Materials and methods, we removed the word “cell-specific”. The sentence now reads, “Transgenes used for rescue of <italic>srb-6</italic> and maintained as extrachromosomal arrays are iyEx348 and iyEx350<italic>”</italic></p></body></sub-article></article>
