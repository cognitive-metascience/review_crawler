triggered by variation in the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) bound to cyclins. Malaria-causing parasites have a life cycle with unique cell-division cycles, and a repertoire of divergent CDKs and cyclins of poorly understood function and interdependency. We show that <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> CDK-related kinase 5 (CRK5), is a critical regulator of atypical mitosis in the gametogony and is required for mosquito transmission. It phosphorylates canonical CDK motifs of components in the pre-replicative complex and is essential for DNA replication. During a replicative cycle, CRK5 stably interacts with a single <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-specific cyclin (SOC2), although we obtained no evidence of SOC2 cycling by transcription, translation or degradation. Our results provide evidence that during <italic>Plasmodium</italic> male gametogony, this divergent cyclin/CDK pair fills the functional space of other eukaryotic cell-cycle kinases controlling DNA replication.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Plasmodium</italic></kwd><kwd>gametogenesis</kwd><kwd>transmission</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>cyclin-dependent

the cell cycle critically relies upon post-translational mechanisms including changes in activity of cell cycle kinases and phosphatases, and ubiquitin-mediated degradation of specific components once their function is complete. Central components of these networks are the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Many different families of CDK exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lim and Kaldis, 2013</xref>). In most model organisms however, those primarily regulating DNA replication and mitosis belong to a monophyletic family that includes human CDK1-CDK4/6, Cdc2 and Cdc28 in fission and budding yeasts, respectively, and CDKA in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo and Stiller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2014</xref>). In malaria parasites, seven CDKs have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Talevich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tewari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Solyakov et al., 2011</xref>). Of these, five are divergent CDK-related kinases (CRK), i.e. they are clearly related to CDKs but have no clear orthologues in the yeast or human kinomes. These include CRK5 (PBANKA_1230200), which forms a distinct branch within the CDK cluster with atypical sequence motifs in the activation loop and an additional 148 amino acid C-terminal extension found only in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorin-Semblat et al., 2013</xref>). The gene is required, but not essential, for proliferation of asexual blood stages of the human parasite <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorin-Semblat et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The primary regulator of CDK activity is the cyclin subunit. Cyclins were originally named because of their oscillation in level that reach a threshold required to drive cell-cycle transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morgan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009</xref>). Cyclins are now defined as a family of evolutionarily related proteins encoding a cyclin box motif that is required for binding to the CDK catalytic subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genomes contain no sequence-identifiable G<sub>1</sub>-, S-, or M-phase cyclins, and only three proteins have sequence homology with cyclin family members in other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Merckx et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roques et al., 2015</xref>). Cyc1 is important for cytokinesis in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> blood stage replication, possibly regulating the CDK7 homolog MRK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robbins et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>P. berghei</italic> Cyc3 is dispensable for blood-stage replication but important for oocyst maturation in the mosquito midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roques et al., 2015</xref>). The paucity of putative cyclins and the diversity of CDKs has led to suggestions that some of these kinases function without a cyclin partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">White and Suvorova, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The malaria parasite has several proliferative phases in its life cycle. Male gametogony or gametogenesis is a proliferative sexual stage in the mosquito vector that is essential for parasite transmission. Circulating mature male gametocytes in the vertebrate host are arrested in a G<sub>0</sub>-like phase and resume development in the mosquito midgut following a blood meal, activated by the presence of xanthurenic acid (XA) and a drop in temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billker et al., 1998</xref>). In about ten minutes the haploid male gametocyte completes three rounds of genome replication and closed endomitosis, assembles the component parts of eight axonemes, and following nuclear division, produces eight flagellated motile male gametes in a process called exflagellation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Billker and Alano, 2005</xref>). The organisation and regulation of the cell cycle during male gametogony is unclear. Current evidence suggests that certain canonical cell-cycle checkpoints are absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez and Suvorova, 2017</xref>). For example, compounds that interfere with mitotic spindle formation do not prevent DNA replication from proceeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zeeshan et al., 2019</xref>), while spindle formation is not affected in a mutant that is unable to replicate DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zeeshan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, we observed that proteins involved in DNA replication and cytoskeletal reorganisation are similarly phosphorylated during the first seconds of gametogony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Invergo et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, CRK5 was linked to both groups of proteins, suggesting it has a key regulatory role during male gametogony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Invergo et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we provide evidence suggesting CRK5 is part of a unique and divergent CDK/cyclin complex required for progression through male gametogony and essential for parasite transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CRK5 is a key regulator of gametogony and sporogony in the mosquito</title><p>Previous attempts to disrupt <italic>P. berghei crk5</italic> had suggested the gene is essential for asexual blood-stage proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tewari et al., 2010</xref>). However, using long sequence homology regions to replace <italic>crk5</italic> with a <italic>T. gondii</italic> DHFR/TS resistance marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we obtained resistant parasites and cloned them following a two-step enrichment. The gene deletion in the resulting CRK5-knockout (KO) clone was confirmed by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and RNAseq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). There was no significant growth defect during erythrocytic asexual multiplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), nor an inability to produce morphologically normal gametocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, upon XA activation only a few microgametocytes formed active exflagellation centres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). While no major transcriptional changes were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), a significant (p-value&lt;10<sup>−2</sup>) but limited increase in expression (0 &lt; log<sub>2</sub>[Fold Change]&lt;1) of multiple regulators of gametogony (including <italic>cdpk4</italic>, <italic>map2k</italic>, <italic>nek1</italic> and <italic>ark2</italic>) was observed in CRK5-KO gametocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This could indicate that CRK5 plays a role during gametocytogenesis prior to activation of gametocytes or that deletion of its coding sequence may be compensated by upregulation of other kinases. Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed these observations but in most cases, changes were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To test the possibility that the exflagellation defect was due to multiple subtle transcriptional changes prior to activation, we used an additional approach to study the effect of rapid CRK5 degradation in mature gametocytes.

Addition of the AID/HA tag to the CRK5 C-terminus imposed a significant fitness cost, with a 2-fold decrease in exflagellation in the absence of auxin, but importantly, depletion of CRK5-AID/HA by one hour of auxin treatment of mature gametocytes prior to activation resulted in a dramatic reduction in exflagellation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CRK5 is a key regulator of gametogony and sporogony during mosquito transmission.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of CRK5 showing the eleven regions that constitute the catalytic domain in pink, and the <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-specific C-terminal extension that is phosphorylated at eight sites (green bars).

It is important to note that this decrease is also observed in absence of Auxin in the CRK5-AID/HA line suggesting that the defect in exflagellation observed for this line is also associated with a slower gametogenesis.

Development of activated gametocytes is highly synchronous and we used this property to investigate the interaction between CRK5 and SOC2 in the first minute after activation. We immunoprecipitated SOC2-3xHA and CRK5-3xHA at 0, 15, 30 and 60 seconds pa and measured the relative abundance of immunoprecipitated proteins in the CSC complex by label-free mass-spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). We detected no difference in the levels of SOC2 or CRK5 protein/protein interactions over this time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, we noticed that a CDT1-like protein became less abundant in CRK5 and SOC2 immunoprecipitates following gametocyte activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Pre-treatment of gametocytes with BKI-294, a CDPK4 inhibitor, prevented this reduction. This suggests that the protein is degraded or less accessible to the complex following CDPK4 activation. These results suggest that SOC2-CRK5 binding is not dynamic during the first round of DNA replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>CSC is dynamically phosphorylated during the first round of replication</title><p>Reversible phosphorylation of cyclin-CDK complexes regulates kinase activity and therefore we examined whether this mechanism may regulate the activity of the CSC complex.

Interestingly, all eight detected phosphorylation sites in CRK5 are located in the 148-residue C-terminal extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), which is only found in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> CRK5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorin-Semblat et al., 2013</xref>). We considered that this extension may have an important role in the regulation of CRK5 activity, and to test this hypothesis we generated a parasite clonal line, CRK5<sub>1-562</sub>, with the last 148 amino acids of CRK5 deleted, leaving an intact catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>).

These results suggest the <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-specific C-terminus extension of CRK5 is essential for its function and may act as a regulatory platform to coordinate cell cycle progression during gametogony.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have identified an atypical cyclin-CDK pair that is essential for male gametogony in a malaria parasite. The divergent CDK-related kinase, CRK5, interacts with a <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-restricted cyclin, SOC2, and with another putative regulatory subunit to form a complex we have named CSC. We provide evidence of CRK5-dependent phosphorylation of multiple components of the pre-replicative complex at a conserved eukaryotic CDK motif. Altogether, this suggests a very early requirement for CRK5 during DNA replication. Further studies are necessary to link phosphorylation of these proteins with CRK5 activity and to characterise the functional relevance of their phosphorylation on the activity of the pre-replicative complex. Given our poor understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the rapid DNA synthesis and the three rounds of mitosis during gametogony, it is unclear whether components of the CSC complex are required for a single checkpoint at the onset of S-phase or for two independent checkpoints, necessary to enter S- and M-phases, respectively. In any case, the abundance of phosphorylated dyneins increased upon CRK5 deletion suggesting that CRK5-dependent regulation of M-phase would likely be indirect, possibly affecting microtubule-dependent processes such as formation or segregation of nuclear poles or mitotic spindle organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agircan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raaijmakers and Medema, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>CRK5, SOC2 and CDKrs have similar transcriptional profiles during asexual replication in erythrocytes with a peak in late trophozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">López-Barragán et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting the CSC complex may have conserved control functions in cell cycle progression during schizogony. Consistent with this idea, CRK5 deletion reduced nuclear division during erythrocytic schizogony in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorin-Semblat et al., 2013</xref>), while SOC2 deletion led to slower proliferation of <italic>P. berghei</italic> in erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang et al., 2017</xref>). Given the versatile nature of cyclin-CDK complex function in other organisms, it is possible that other CDKs or cyclins partially compensate for the loss of CRK5 or SOC2 in asexual blood stages. For example, CRK4 activity may compensate for the lack of CRK5 during schizogony, because it is also important for DNA replication during this developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ganter et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Usually there are significant oscillations in the abundance of cyclins during the cell cycle. However, SOC2 shows no evidence of oscillation or changes in the level of its interaction with CRK5. Such changes may be undetectable in the experimental conditions and we cannot exclude more subtle changes that may regulate the CSC complex. The observed absence of cycling may also reflect the constraints imposed by the extremely rapid nature of gametogony. No marked Cyc1 oscillations were detected during the slower <italic>P. falciparum</italic> blood stage schizogony. Furthermore, the Cyc1/MRK complex was detected in mature segmented schizonts after Cyc1 is required to complete cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robbins et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is also possible that non-oscillating cell-cycle cyclins and stable cyclin/CDK complexes are a conserved feature of the various cycles of division within <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites. However, PbCyc3 showed fluctuating expression patterns during oocyst development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roques et al., 2015</xref>). It thus remains unclear whether non-cycling cyclins and stable cyclin/CDK complexes represent conserved features of the various cell cycles of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites.</p><p>We provide evidence that the C-terminal extension of CRK5 is important in the control of its function. Interestingly, SOC2 and the C-terminal extension of CRK5 are both Haemosporidia-specific. For example, they are absent in the related Apicomplexa parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> in which the homologue of CRK5 is also involved in DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">White and Suvorova, 2018</xref>), highlighting a specific evolution of this cyclin/CDK system in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. It is tempting to speculate that the CRK5 C-terminal extension and its phosphorylation are important in the regulation of CRK5 activity via conformational changes within the complex, but this hypothesis remains untested as the exact role of SOC2 in CRK5 regulation. Very few studied CDKs contain additional domains with known function. For example, phosphorylation of the Cdk16 N-terminal domain blocks binding to cyclin Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mikolcevic et al., 2012</xref>). Multiple CRK5 and SOC2 residues are phosphorylated in a CDPK4-dependent manner and it is possible that CDPK4 works as a <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-specific link to translate a calcium signal triggering gametogony to prime the CSC complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). In addition, CDPK4-independent phosphorylation of CRK5 is also observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Invergo et al., 2017</xref>) and other kinases or phosphatases may control CSC activity during the rounds of DNA replication and mitosis. However, given the absence of canonical checkpoint kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tewari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Solyakov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brochet et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that the successive mitotic cycles of gametogony are separated from each other by a clock mechanism rather than by checkpoints that rely on signals from one event in the cell cycle to regulate the next.</p><p><italic>Plasmodium</italic> species lack clear CDK orthologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2014</xref>) that are usually highly conserved across Eukarya and indispensable in yeasts and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Malumbres, 2014</xref>). This study indicates that CRK5, despite its divergence from canonical CDKs, possibly acts as a CDK by binding a divergent cyclin and phosphorylating classical CDK motifs on proteins that are targeted by conventional CDKs and involved in the initiation of DNA replication in human and yeast. However, it remains difficult to identify a specific direct functional orthologue due to functional similarities with multiple CDKs and even non-CDK cell-cycle kinases, and it is tempting to speculate that CRK5 and SOC2 cover the functional space of multiple cell-cycle regulators in other organisms, to satisfy the specificities of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> cell cycle. Future functional analyses will have to confirm that CRK5 activity is regulated in a SOC2-dependent manner and the direct phosphorylation of the pre-replicative complex by CRK5.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Six to ten week-old mice were obtained from Charles River laboratories, and females were used for all experiments. Mice were specific pathogen free (including mycoplasma pulmonis) and subjected to regular pathogen monitoring by sentinel screening. They were housed in individually ventilated cages furnished with a cardboard mouse house and Nestlet, maintained at 21 ± 2°C under a 12 hr light/dark cycle, and given commercially prepared autoclaved dry rodent diet and water ad libitum. The parasitaemia of infected animals was determined by microscopy of methanol-fixed and Giemsa-stained thin blood smears.</p><p>For gametocyte production, parasites were grown in mice that had been phenyl hydrazine-treated three days before infection. One day after infection, sulfadiazine (20 mg/L) was added in the drinking water to eliminate asexually replicating parasites.

To calculate the number of exflagellation centres per 100 microgametocytes, the percentage of red blood cells (RBCs) infected with microgametocytes was assessed on Giemsa-stained smears. For gametocyte purification, parasites were harvested in suspended animation medium (SA; RPMI 1640 containing 25 mM HEPES, 5% FCS, 4 mM sodium bicarbonate, pH 7.20) and separated from uninfected erythrocytes on a Histodenz/Nycodenz cushion made from 48% of a Histodenz/Nycodenz stock (27.6% [w/v] Histodenz/Nycodenz [Sigma/Alere Technologies] in 5.0 mM TrisHCl, 3.0 mM KCl, 0.3 mM EDTA, pH 7.20) and 52% SA, final pH 7.2.

Parasite selection with 0.07 mg/mL pyrimethamine (Sigma) in the drinking water (pH ~4.5) was initiated one day after infection. Each mutant parasite was genotyped by PCR using three combinations of primers, specific for either the WT or the modified locus on both sides of the targeted region (experimental designs are shown in Figure supplements). For allelic replacements, sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing using the indicated primers.

Precursor ion tolerance was set to 10 ppm and fragment ion tolerance to 0.02 Da for Q-Exactive Plus data and to 0.6 for Lumos data. Variable amino acid modifications were oxidised methionine and deamination (Asn and Gln) as well as phosphorylated serine, threonine and tyrosine. Fixed amino acid modification was carbamidomethyl cysteine. The Mascot search was validated using Scaffold 4.8.4 (Proteome Software) with 1% of protein false discovery rate (FDR) and at least two unique peptides per protein with a 0.1% peptide FDR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-4"><title>PCA analysis</title><p>Enrichment and principal component analysis was performed in the statistical programming package ‘R’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</ext-link>).

Peptide-spectrum matches were validated using Percolator validator node with a target FDR of 0.01 and a Delta Cn of 0.5. For label-free quantification, features and chromatographic peaks were detected using the ‘Minora Feature Detector’ Node with the default parameters. PSM and peptides were filtered with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%, and then grouped to proteins with again a FDR of 1% and using only peptides with high confidence level. Both unique and razor peptides were used for quantitation and protein abundances are calculated by summing samples abundances of the connected peptides group. The abundances were normalised on the ‘Total Peptide Amount’ and then ‘The pairwise Ratio Based’ option was selected for protein ratio calculation and associated p-values were calculated with an ANOVA test based on background.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Proteomics and phosphoproteomics</title><sec id="s4-12-1"><title>Sample preparation (SDS buffer-FASP procedure)</title><p>Activated and non-activated purified gametocytes were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 sec pa.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is “in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>”.

(If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Progression through gametogony is critical for the transmission cycle of malaria parasites. A key feature of this progression is the development of male gametocytes, which undergo three rounds of record-speed DNA replication and segregation following activation in the mosquito midgut, through a process termed exflagellation. However, a lack of canonical cyclins and cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) leaves open critical questions about the regulation of cell cycle progression through the complex life cycle of malaria parasites and related apicomplexans.</p><p>Balestra and co-authors describe the identification of an atypical CDK-cyclin complex that plays a major role regulating male gametogenesis in malaria parasites. The authors propose that a cyclin-related kinase (CRK5) is part of a stable complex with an unusual cyclin-like protein (SOC2), and a CDK regulatory subunit (CDKrs). Using quantitative phosphoproteomics the authors show that CRK5 loss affects the phosphorylation of components of the pre-replicative complex and the mitotic spindle, consistent with profound defects in endomitosis. Investigating the regulation of the complex, the authors demonstrate that, unlike canonical CDK-cyclin complexes, CRK5, SOC2, and CDKrs remain stably associated. The data instead suggest that C-terminal phosphorylation of CRK5 by CDPK4 acts as an alternative mechanism of activation.</p><p>Genetic evidence for the complex and its critical role in cell-cycle progression during gametogony is convincing, and an important advance for the field. However, the divergent cyclin/CDK complex should be supported through more careful analysis and evidence of cyclin-dependent activity. Some of the claims attributing molecular function to the complex, also need to be more carefully written, absent further experimental evidence.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major concerns of the reviewers fall into three general categories:</p><p>1) Complex formation and mass spectrometry.</p><p>a) The mass-spectrometry experiments are poorly explained and the tables poorly annotated.

An experiment establishing the stoichiometry of components, or their hierarchy of association should aid in defining the putative complex.

Furthermore, CRK4 is involved in S/M phase progression at the RBC stage and may also play a role in gametogenesis (Ganter et al., 2017); authors consider this possibility (Discussion paragraph two) but do not include it in their final statements (Abstract). Furthermore, changes in phosphorylation are not sufficient to establish regulation, especially since the possibility that the block in cell cycle progression has not caused a change in total protein abundance.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for re-submitting your article &quot;A divergent cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complex controls replication of a malaria parasite during transmission&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article was re-reviewed by the three peer reviewers including Sebastian Lourido as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Elena Suvorova (Reviewer #2); Moritz Treeck (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162).</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Progression through the cell cycle is governed by divergent cell cycle kinases in Apicomplexan parasites. The authors characterize the role of one such kinase, CRK5, during the incredibly fast replicative cycle of the male gametocytes, following activation of the precursor in the mosquito midgut. The manuscript makes two claims of significant importance: that CRK5 functions as part of a complex (CSC) that includes proteins that are distantly homologous to CDK regulatory subunits, and that the CSC complex regulates key cell cycle transitions during exflagellation. The authors also provide intriguing evidence that suggests regulation of this complex by CDPK4 integrating the function of the complex into a broader regulatory network.</p><p>The revised manuscript addresses many of the issues raised during the previous round of reviews, and provide more convincing support for the constitution of the CSC. However, the reviewers all agree that three main issues require additional clarification prior to acceptance for publication. This therefore represents a conditional acceptance, providing the authors faithfully address the reviewer's comments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Proteomics: Authors should use the same gene IDs in the source data files as in the text. All columns should be labelled and a legend should explain how the values for that column were derived. Log<sub>2</sub>FCs for each phosphorylation site should be clearly visible with most important datapoints (localisation score, quality of MS assignment, peptide identified) for each timepoint. The authors should comment and discuss why some of the proteins are already differentially phosphorylated at t=0 (for example ORC2).</p><p>2) CDK nomenclature and function: The authors are meticulous throughout the text stating that their conclusions are suggestive of CDK function, but the final statements of the Introduction or Discussion are not supported by the results e.g. &quot;This study indicates that CRK5, despite its divergence from canonical CDKs, acts as a genuine CDK by binding a cyclin and phosphorylating classical CDK motifs on proteins that are targeted by conventional CDKs and involved in the initiation of DNA replication in human and yeast.&quot; The reviewers instruct the authors to limit their claims to those supported by the results. Authors should explicitly state that they have been unable to measure CRK5 activity and therefore cannot unequivocally state that it requires SOC2 or that the complex behaves as a cyclin-dependent kinase, despite the hints from sequence similarity; cyclin-dependent activity needs to be demonstrated for it to be considered a bonafide CDK. Moreover, authors should not assume that changes in phosphorylation can be directly attributed to CRK5 activity because too many changes are occurring during exflagellation (or are not occurring when CRK5 is absent) to unequivocally attribute them as direct phosphorylation events.</p><p>3) Further discussion of the AID system: The authors should discuss that the spindle formation is already deficient in the AID-tagged strain (at the level of the KO) and therefore not further diminished by auxin treatment. Please include the following critical experimental details: Was the timing of CRK5 degradation following auxin treatment determined? Were gametocytes pre-treated with auxin in the pa experiments and, if so, for how long? Presumably, it was not 1 min pa activation combined with 1 min auxin induction, which would simply be not enough to eliminate CRK5.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56474.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major concerns of the reviewers fall into three general categories:</p><p>1) Complex formation and mass spectrometry.</p><p>a) The mass-spectrometry experiments are poorly explained and the tables poorly annotated.

We agree methods and results were not clearly explained in the initial version. Therefore, the presentation of the results did not reflect well the richness of the datasets.</p><p>We are now indicating in the Results section which time points have been analysed for SOC2, CRK5 and CDKrs IPs. We have removed the Venn diagram representing a qualitative analysis all IPs (previous Figure 3C). Instead, we now show a semi-quantitative PCA analysis of SOC2, CRK5, CDKrs IPs at 1 min post-activation. We are comparing these results with IPs of CDPK4-HA and its substrates SOC1-HA and SOC3-HA as well as of MCM5-HA. This analysis shows that the three proteins cluster together consistent with the formation of a complex.</p><p>We omitted to state that the IP data was already compared to a control IP against gametocytes lacking an epitope tag. All proteins identified in this control were already filtered out in the previous version. We have now included this information and show the control results in Supplementary file 4. Proteins identified by less than 2 peptides were also filtered out in this table. We have also included a WT-GFP control in Supplementary file 4.</p><p>Label-free comparison of peptide and phosphopeptides in SOC2 or CRK5 immunoprecipitates. Label-free comparison of peptide and phosphopeptides in SOC2 or CRK5 immunoprecipitates during the first minute of gametogony was determined using the “Minora Feature Detector” Node of pProteome dDiscoverer 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptide-spectrum matches were validated using Percolator validator node with a target FDR of 0.01 and a Delta Cn of 0.5. For label-free quantification, features and chromatographic peaks were detected using the “Minora Feature Detector” Node with the default parameters. PSM and peptides were filtered with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%, and then grouped to proteins with again an FDR of 1% and using only peptides with high confidence level. Both unique and razor peptides were used for quantitation and protein abundances are calculated by summing samples abundances of the connected peptides group. The abundances were normalised on the “Total Peptide Amount” and then “The pairwise Ratio Based” option was selected for protein ratio calculation and associated p-values were calculated with an ANOVA test based on background. We now indicate this information in the main text and detail the analysis in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>We used TMT labelling for the proteomics and phosphoproteomics comparison of WT and CRK5-KO. Each of the five time points was analysed with two independent biological replicates, i.e. from purified gametocytes isolated from different mice. We now indicate this information in the Results and Materials and methods sections.</p><p>We did not use any cut-off to determine fold-change significance of proteomics and phosphoproteomics analyses. We only based our selection criteria on Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p values (&lt;0.05). We agree the grey areas in Figure 2B was misleading and suggested we used an arbitrary cut-off -0.5&lt;Log<sub>2</sub>FC&lt;0.5. The standard deviation ranged from 0.28 to 0.39 (proteome) and from 0.24 to 0.27 (phosphoproteome). As no significantly regulated sites with Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p values &lt;0.05 were below a Log<sub>2</sub>FC of 0.5 this does not affect our previous analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) IPs for CRK5, SOC2, and CDKrs all recovered the other putative complex components, but also several members of the MCM and ORC complexes.

However, we agree we cannot rule out that CRK5 or the complex itself could possibly be activated prior to gametocyte stimulation or independently of SOC2. In vitro kinase assays to assess SOC2-dependent activation of CRK5 is an excellent suggestion. We have tried to reproduce the in vitro kinase assays presented by Dorin-Semblat et al., 2013, but our attempts indicate that such experiments may not be as trivial as suggested.</p><p>In a first time, we have tried to perform in vitro kinase assays using CRK5-GFP immunoprecipitates from activated gametocytes. Of note, our MS analysis of such immunoprecipitates indicate the presence of other kinases in these immunoprecipitates including CDPK4, MAPK2, NEK4 possibly masking CRK5 activity. Kinase assays were performed using Kinase-Glo Assay kit as per manufacturer instructions. As a control, we used immunoprecipitates from MyoB-GFP, a protein with no kinase or ATPase function expressed in gametocytes. Kinase reactions containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20m M MgCl<sub>2</sub> were performed at 10 μM ATP and 50 μM Histone H1 with different dilutions of immunoprecipitates in solid white 96-well plates in 50μl kinase reaction buffer. MyoB-GFP was used as negative control whereas recombinant Protein kinase A (PKA, 10 units) was used as positive control. Following the kinase reaction, an equal volume of Kinase Glo Max Reagent (50μl) was added. Luminescence was recorded on a GloMax 96 Microplate Luminometer after ten minutes. Unfortunately, the kinase activity assays did not show any specific kinase activity for CRK5-GFP (Author response image 1) when compared to MyoB-GFP.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>CRK5 Kinase activity assay using Kinase-Glo Assay kit.</title><p>Kinase reactions containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> were performed at 10 μM ATP, 50 μM Histone with different dilutions of kinases for 1 hour.

As our results indicate that the C-terminus extension of CRK5 is essential for its function in vivo, we also decided to express full-length CRK5. The SOC2 (PfCyc2) expressed in Dorin-Semblat et al., 2013, only encompasses 391 amino acids of the cyclin box (see Merckx et al., 2003) which only represents a fraction of full length SOC2. Here we have cloned the full sequence encoding the 1314 amino acid protein that is detected to interact with CRK5. Similarly, we aimed at expressing and purifying full-length CDKrs. Codon-optimised sequences for <italic>E. coli</italic> were obtained from GeneArt with N-terminus 6xHis tags. After full-length sequencing of each construct, we attempted overnight expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 cells. Although a strong expression of each protein was achieved, none of them was soluble preventing further purification steps (Author response image 2). This suggests either that the proteins aggregate because they are not properly folded, or that they interact with membranes and sediment upon centrifugation after cell lysis.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Expression of CRK5, CDKrs and SOC2 in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 cells.</title><p>Overnight IPTG-induced expression of CRK5, CDKrs or SOC2 in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells at 16ᵒC.

Cell debris and membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (30'000 g, 35 min, 4 °C). Soluble (supernatant) and non-soluble (pellet) fractions were denatured and analysed by SDS-PAGE.

Baculoviruses expressing the protein of interest were generated from a modified pFastBac vector following the &quot;Bac to Bac&quot; protocol. Briefly, a bacmid encoding the gene of interest was isolated and transfected into fresh Sf9 insect cells. After 7 days of infection, first generation (P1) viruses were harvested and directly used to infect fresh Sf9 cells to produce highly infective second-generation viruses (P2). 4500 ml of Sf9 insect cells were infected with 4 ml of P2 viruses and grown for 66 h at 27°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 g for 12 min. Initial tests indicated low expression of the three proteins.</p><p>We reasoned that co-expression of all three proteins could maximise our chances of expression and stabilisation. To this aim, we used a MultiBacmid expression system that enabled the expression of many proteins and protein complexes that have been intractable before. Using the same expression protocol, an improved expression was observed. To lyse the cells, the pellet was resuspended in 60 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4/ 200 mM NaCl/ 3 mM 2-ME – fresh). Cells were lysed by two passages through a French Press at 1000 psi, followed by sonication for 20 sec, 20 % duty cycle, power 5. Cell debris and membranes were removed by centrifugation (30'000 g, 35 min, 4 °C). However, proteins were again poorly soluble (Author response image 3A).</p><p>In parallel, we added the signal sequence for honeybee melittin, a highly expressed and efficiently secreted protein, to direct expression of recombinant proteins through the secretory pathway to the extracellular medium. Mellitin improved the expression or stabilisation of each of the three proteins; however, none of them could be recovered from the culture supernatant (data not shown) or could be solubilised efficiently from cell lysates (Author response image 3A). Chromatography affinity purification on His-Tap resin of solubilised proteins allowed significant enrichment for CDKrs but not for CRK5 or SOC2 although the three proteins could be detected by western blot after purification (Author response image 3B and 3C).

We have been over-enthusiastic in interpreting the data presented in this manuscript probably because we have obtained in parallel to this project more and more data suggesting an uncoupling between S and M-phases during gametogony. We have toned down our interpretation regarding a possible role of CRK5 during M-phase in the Results and Discussion. As this only represents an anecdotal part of the manuscript, we removed any mention of a possible role in M-phase regulation from the Abstract.</p><p>We agree that changes in phosphorylation are not sufficient or necessary to establish regulation. However, we observe CRK5-dependent phosphorylation of multiple components of the pre-replicative complex at CDK consensus motifs and show a strong defect in DNA replication, all in a very narrow time window, which strongly suggest an important role of phosphorylation in establishing regulation. Although we cannot rule out a kinase-independent role of CRK5, it is likely that CRK5 kinase activity is important to regulate DNA replication and more likely initiation of DNA replication. We only mention this possibility in the Discussion and emphasize that future studies will have to (i) directly link CRK5 activity and phosphorylation of the pre-replicative complex and (ii) to experimentally determine the functional relevance of this phosphorylation events.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Proteomics: Authors should use the same gene IDs in the source data files as in the text.

Presumably, it was not 1 min pa activation combined with 1 min auxin induction, which would simply be not enough to eliminate CRK5.</p></disp-quote><p>The information was stated in the Results section but we have now added the procedure in the Results section and provided more details in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>Results: “Addition of the AID/HA tag to the CRK5 C-terminus imposed a significant fitness cost, with a 2-fold decrease in exflagellation in the absence of auxin, but importantly, depletion of CRK5-AID/HA by <italic>one hour of</italic> auxin treatment of mature gametocytes <italic>prior to activation</italic> resulted in a dramatic reduction in exflagellation (Figure 1H).” (emphasis added)</p><p>Materials and methods: “To induce CRK5-AID/HA degradation, 1 mM auxin dissolved in ethanol <italic>(0.2% final concentration)</italic> was added to purified gametocytes for one hour <italic>prior to activation by XA.”</italic> (emphasis added)</p></body></sub-article></article>
