Here we test the hypothesis that the dorsal striatum receives also GABAergic projections from the cortex. We addressed this fundamental question by taking advantage of optogenetics and directly examining the functional effects of cortical GABAergic inputs to spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the mouse auditory and motor cortex. We found that the cortex, via corticostriatal somatostatin neurons (CS-SOM), has a direct inhibitory influence on the output of the striatum SPNs. Our results describe a corticostriatal long-range inhibitory circuit (CS-SOM inhibitory projections → striatal SPNs) underlying the control of spike timing/generation in SPNs and attributes a specific function to a genetically defined type of cortical interneuron in corticostriatal communication.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15890.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15890.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15890.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The striatum is located beneath the cerebral cortex, where it contributes to processes including learning and movement. The Spanish anatomist Ramon y Cajal, working in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, was the first to observe individual neurons extending from the cortex to the striatum. Cajal published drawings of these neurons in his now celebrated anatomical papers, but knew little about their properties.</p><p>In the 1980s, advances in techniques for labeling individual cells made it possible to study these neurons in detail. The results suggested that the pathways are exclusively excitatory: that is, the cortical neurons always increase the activity of their partners in the striatum. However, this result made it difficult to explain why electrically stimulating the cortex can sometimes reduce or inhibit the activity of the striatum. To reconcile these facts, most people assumed that inhibition must occur when excitatory cortical neurons activate networks of inhibitory cells within the striatum itself.</p><p>Rock et al. now challenge this view by providing anatomical and physiological evidence for the existence of long-range inhibitory pathways from the cortex to the striatum in the mouse brain. These inhibitory neurons project from the auditory and motor regions of the cortex, and contain a substance called somatostatin. These neurons form connections with a specific type of striatal neuron called medium spiny neurons, which in turn project to other brain regions outside the striatum. The inhibitory cortical neurons can alter the activity of the medium spiny neurons, and can therefore directly control the output of the striatum.</p><p>The discovery that the striatum receives both excitatory and inhibitory inputs from cortex suggests that the timing and relative strength of these inputs can affect the activity of the striatum. Future experiments should examine whether this is a general mechanism by which sensory stimuli can influence the processes controlled by the striatum, such as movement.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15890.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15890.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>CS-SOM neurons</kwd><kwd>corticostriatal</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd><kwd>dSPNs</kwd><kwd>iSPNs</kwd><kwd>auditory</kwd><kwd>motor cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS072197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Charles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The discovery of somatostatin-positive inhibitory neurons projecting from mouse cortex to striatum shows that corticostriatal pathways are not exclusively excitatory.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is very well established that cortical neurons regulate the activity of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in the striatum through long-range glutamatergic/excitatory projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Landry et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graybiel et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lovinger and Tyler, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reiner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kress et al., 2013</xref>), while inhibition is mediated by local feed-forward and feed-back circuits (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tepper et al., 2008</xref>]).

Using this virus, CS-SOM neurons were retrogradely labelled with GFP, and their somata were present primarily in layers 5 and 6 of the AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, middle). This approach allowed us to visually identify and record from layer 5 and 6 CS-SOM neurons using whole-cell patch clamp. Confocal images of biocytin-filled CS-SOM neurons showed that they are similar to SOM interneurons in their morphology and send an axonal projection into the subcortical white matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, right; Neurolucida-reconstructed CS-SOM neuron <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). We verified their identity based on the comparison with electrophysiological properties of SOM interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2006</xref>). These properties include a wide action potential and low rheobase (the smallest current step evoking an action potential) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, top; action potentials in CS-SOM neurons, shown in black, are wider than those from fast-spiking interneurons, example in red). The responses to current steps in CS-SOM neurons were typical for SOM interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, bottom; notice the sag from a hyperpolarizing current step).

In contrast, when we injected this virus into the dorsal striatum, we observed transfected SOM somata both in the dorsal striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, left) and in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, middle left and middle right). These data show that this inhibitory projection is unidirectional, arising preferentially from layer 5 and 6 SOM neurons in the cortex which project to the dorsal striatum.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Do corticostriatal somatostatin neurons inhibit striatal neurons?</title><p>To determine the connectivity pattern of CS-SOM neurons onto neurons in the dorsal striatum, we used an optogenetic approach in which we conditionally expressed channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in SOM neurons by injecting AAV1.ChR2.Flex into the right AC of SOM-Cre transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>; injection site <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). After 3–4 weeks, we recorded from the right dorsal striatum, in which ChR2-positive axons could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, right). These axons have been reported to remain photoexcitable even when severed from their parent somata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petreanu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rock and Apicella, 2015</xref>). To determine the synaptic properties of CS-SOM projections onto striatal neurons, we photoactivated CS-SOM ChR2-positive axons by flashing blue light (470 nm) for 2–5 ms during whole-cell recordings from striatal neurons. IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, red trace) were isolated by applying a command potential of 0 mV (the calculated reversal potential for glutamatergic excitatory conductance). The IPSCs onset of the photo-evoked response was 2.2 ± 0.11 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>, left). This latency is consistent with the IPSCs being the result of a monosynaptic inhibitory input from the cortex and not a local striatal feedback inhibitory network recruited by cortical projections. Blocking excitatory neurotransmission by application of glutamate receptor antagonists NBQX and CPP did not abolish the CS-SOM-ChR2-evoked synaptic IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, magenta trace). In contrast, blocking inhibitory neurotransmission by application of gabazine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, black trace) completely abolished the CS-SOM-ChR2-evoked synaptic IPSCs, confirming they were elicited by direct cortical inhibitory transmission. Basic biophysical properties for CS-SOM-ChR2-evoked synaptic IPSCs (<italic>n</italic> = 16) included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g,h,i</xref>): peak, 122 ± 26 pA; charge, 3.85 ± 0.67 pC; rise time, 1.64 ± 0.13 ms; decay time, 28.87 ± 2.76 ms. Biocytin-filled neurons were morphologically identified as SPNs post-hoc by the presence of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, right, white arrows). Eight out of 16 neurons were recovered after patching and were processed for imaging; all eight of these neurons showed a high density of dendritic spines at 40-63X magnification. These data reveal that a large proportion of striatal SPNs receive direct inhibitory input driven by CS-SOM neurons but does not exclude the possibility that other striatal neurons also receive inhibitory input from these projections.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15890.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Photostimulation of auditory CS-SOM projections elicits direct inhibition and modulates action potentials in striatal SPNs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic depicting injection site using the SOM-Cre transgenic mouse line to transfect CS-SOM projections to the dorsal striatum with ChR2.

In these mice, AAV.ChR2.Flex injected in the AC induces ChR2 expression in CS-SOM neurons. Although both D1-type dopamine receptors and our ChR2 virus are tagged with tdTomato, ChR2-tdTomato-positive axons were detectable in the area of our recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, left and right panels, white arrows). To determine the relative strength of CS-SOM connections onto the two classes of SPNs, we recorded in coronal brain slices from a dSPN and a neighboring iSPN (~100 μm) in the dorsal striatum ipsilateral to the injection site. It has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ade et al., 2011</xref>) that in <italic>Drd1a</italic>-tdTomato and <italic>Drd2</italic>-EGFP mice, fluorescent labeling is restricted to SPNs (i.e. no fluorescent labeling of the three main classes of interneurons in the striatum: parvalbumin-expressing, somatostatin-expressing, and cholinergic). However, to ensure that the neurons we recorded from were in fact SPNs, we also identified them post-hoc by the presence of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, right, white arrow). Six out of fourteen neurons were recovered after patching and were processed for imaging; all six of these neurons showed a high density of dendritic spines at 40-63X magnification. All recordings were performed in the presence of NBQX and CPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, red traces); CS-SOM-ChR2-evoked synaptic IPSCs were completely blocked by application of gabazine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, black traces). The peak and charge of the maximal IPSCs were used as measures of the strength of the CS-SOM projections to dSPNs (n = 7) and iSPNs (n = 7). IPSCs peak amplitude (dSPN: 149 ± 30 pA; iSPN: 130 ± 21 pA; p = 0.7 rank-sum test) and charge (dSPN: 6.26 ± 1.03 pC; iSPN: 5.24 ± 1.38 pC; p = 0.3 rank-sum test) were similar in dSPNs and iSPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).

Our results support this hypothesis and additionally conclude that both the motor and the auditory cortices send long-range GABAergic projections to the dorsal striatum, via CS-SOM neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Because of its presence in two such disparate cortical areas, this would suggest that the corticostriatal somatostatin projection connectivity pattern is likely a general feature of the corticostriatal network. We demonstrated that a class of corticostriatal long-range inhibitory neurons in the auditory and motor cortex of the mice are somatostatin-expressing neurons. Our results suggest that CS-SOM neurons provide a major GABAergic projection to the dorsal striatum, in agreement with a recent anatomical study in the mouse frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tomioka et al., 2015</xref>). However previous results from retrospinal and somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jinno and Kosaka, 2004</xref>) have provided anatomical evidence for expression of parvalbumin in glutamatergic and GABAergic pathways in mice suggesting that corticostriatal long-range inhibitory neurons are characterized predominantly by parvalbumin-expressing neurons. Moreover, recent results from prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2014</xref>), show that corticostriatal long-range inhibitory neurons are characterized predominantly by parvalbumin-expressing or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing but not somatostatin-expressing interneurons. Overall, these suggest that corticostriatal long-range GABAergic projections may be characterized by heterogeneous subtypes of interneurons, and that additional studies are necessary to determine the subtypes and the physiological impact of long-range corticostriatal GABAergic projections on striatal neurons.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15890.007</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Summary diagram: CS-SOM neurons directly inhibit striatal SPNs.</title><p>Auditory and motor CS-SOM projections modulate the activity of striatal SPNs by direct inhibition.

Particularly, CS-SOM neurons target SPNs and have the ability to affect their spike timing and generation. In the cortex, interneurons target the somatodendritic compartment of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Somogyi et al., 1998</xref>). SOM cortical and striatal interneurons in particular target the dendrites of pyramidal neurons and SPNs, respectively; although not specifically tuft dendrites as is characteristic of their hippocampal analogue, OLM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Freund and Buzsaki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kubota and Kawaguchi, 2000</xref>). This connectivity pattern may allow the dendrites to sum incoming activity over a broader window of time (synaptic integration) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pouille and Scanziani, 2001</xref>). We suggest that a similar inhibitory mechanism might be applied to the corticostriatal long-range inhibitory circuit, in which CS-SOM neurons, by targeting the dendrites of SPNs, play a role in the integration of incoming cortical excitatory inputs to the striatum.</p><p>The dorsal striatum is characterized by two parallel networks: the direct and indirect pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gerfen et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawaguchi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lei et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calabresi et al., 2014</xref>). Particularly, it is suggested that dSPNs promote behaviors that have previously been rewarded while iSPNs suppress behaviors that have not previously been rewarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ade et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calabresi et al., 2014</xref>). It is very well established that long-range glutamatergic/excitatory projections regulate the activity of dSPNs and iSPNs. However, how activity of CS-SOM neurons influences dSPNs and iSPNs has not been established. Our results show that the cortex provides an inhibitory projection to both direct and indirect pathway neurons, influencing the output of both striatal networks involved in action selection and suppression of action. The functional role of inhibition from CS-SOM neurons might be not in separating the activity of direct and indirect striatal pathways, but rather in shaping the output of both. This is reminiscent of the finding by Kress et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kress et al., 2013</xref>) that long-range excitatory corticostriatal connections from intratelencephalic and pyramidal tract neurons in motor cortex are made onto both dSPNs and iSPNs in the mouse dorsal striatum.</p><p>The dorsal striatum is a brain structure where functionally distinct cortical regions (e.g. motor, auditory, visual, somatosensory) converge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilson et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schneider, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flaherty and Graybiel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chudler et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reig and Silberberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wilson, 2014</xref>). Anatomical and physiological data have suggested that once this information reaches the dorsal striatum via the corticostriatal projection, it is either channeled into parallel functional segregated circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bordi and LeDoux, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bordi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parent and Hazrati, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Middleton and Strick, 2000</xref>) or integrated within these circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nauta and Domesick, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoffer and Alloway, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kolomiets et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reig and Silberberg, 2014</xref>). The existence of direct inhibitory cortical inputs to the dorsal striatum is likely to have profound consequences for corticostriatal mechanisms by which the AC regulates the output of the striatum and how auditory information is transformed into motor command (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Znamenskiy and Zador, 2013</xref>). It is very well established that the dorsal striatum is characterized by activity-dependent plasticity (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kreitzer and Malenka, 2008</xref>]). Particularly, striatal plasticity can alter the transfer of information throughout the striatum and may serve as a neuronal substrate for the transformation of sensory information and motor planning for flexible motor actions and procedural memory. Recently, Xiong et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>) found that auditory corticostriatal projections are involved in the learning of an auditory frequency discrimination task. They found that neurons in the dorsal striatum of the rat are selectively potentiated by auditory corticostriatal neurons to promote the learned transformation of sounds into motor actions. Moreover, Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>) demonstrated that motor learning is characterized by structural rearrangements of presynaptic boutons of cortical SOM interneurons. Further experiments are needed to understand the functional significance of this direct cortical inhibition to the dorsal striatum, but in combination with the two above mentioned studies it invites speculation that CS-SOM neurons might play a role in mechanisms underlying spine dynamics by inducing a specific reorganization of dendritic excitatory synapses on SPNs and have consequences on learning and/or memory retrieval.</p><p>Our results establish a previously unknown corticostriatal long-range inhibitory circuit (<bold>CS-SOM inhibitory projections → striatal SPNs</bold>) underlying the control of spike timing/generation in striatal spiny neurons and attribute a specific function to a genetically defined type of cortical neuron in corticostriatal communication. We have shown that the dorsal striatum receives not only glutamatergic excitatory inputs from the cortex, but also inhibitory inputs. This may suggest that the timing and ratio of excitation and inhibition, two opposing forces in the mammalian cerebral cortex, can dynamically affect the output of the dorsal striatum, providing a general mechanism for motor control driven by sensory stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSCs) were recorded in the voltage-clamp configuration with a holding potential of 0 mV (the calculated reversal potential for glutamatergic excitatory conductances). Intrinsic properties were recorded in the current-clamp configuration using a potassium-based intracellular solution at 31–33°C. Potassium-based intracellular solution contained the following (in mM): 120 potassium gluconate, 20 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 phosphocreatine, 4 ATP, 0.3 GTP, 0.2 EGTA, and 0.3–0.5% biocytin).</p><p>Signals were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 4 kHz. Pharmacological blockers used were: CPP (5 μM; Tocris Bioscience), NBQX (10 μM; Abcam), and gabazine (25 μM; Abcam). Hardware control and data acquisition were performed by Ephus (www.ephus.org) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suter et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>ChR2 photostimulation</title><p>CS-SOM neurons transfected with ChR2 showed ChR2-tdTomato-positive axons in the dorsal striatum related to the cortical area where the virus was injected (auditory or motor). Because of variability both in ChR2 expression levels (number of ChR2 molecules per transfected neuron) and transfection efficiency (number of ChR2-expressing neurons per animal), to minimize the variability from experiment to experiment we performed the electrophysiological recording in the same dorsal striatum slices (identified by specific landmarks as slice 1 and 2) and with the highest density of ChR2 transfected axons. We recorded IPSCs from putative spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in the dorsal striatum during photoactivation of the CS-SOM ChR2-positive axon terminals. A 470nm wavelength blue LED (CoolLED <italic>p</italic>E excitation system) passed through a GFP filter cube (Endow GFP/EGFP longpass, C-156625; Chroma) and a 60X water-immersion objective was used to photoactivate CS-SOM ChR2-positive axon terminals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Delay/silencing of first action potential in striatal neurons</title><p>We recorded from putative SPNs in the dorsal striatum in an area containing ChR2-tdTomato-positive CS-SOM axons. In current-clamp configuration, a step of current was injected to cause the striatal neuron to fire 2–7 action potentials. To determine the effect of CS-SOM projections on the output of striatal neurons, we photoactivated CS-SOM ChR2-positive axons by flashing blue light (470 nm) for 2–10 ms starting 10–50 ms before the first action potential. Combining current injection with photoactivation of CS-SOM projections delayed the current-evoked action potentials in striatal neurons. The action potential delay due to the combined current injection with photoactivation of CS-SOM projections was normalized to the onset of the first action potential measured during the current injection alone.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Identification of D1- and D2-receptor-expressing striatal neurons</title><p>D1- and D2-receptor-expressing neurons in the dorsal striatum were identified by the presence of fluorescent markers in the SOM-Cre-D1/D2 line of mice. Somatic expression of either tdTomato (D1-receptor-expressing neurons) or GFP (D2-receptor-expressing neurons) fluorescence was visualized under a 60X objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Histology</title><p>During whole-cell recordings, neurons were filled with an internal solution containing 0.3–0.5% biocytin. Filled neurons were held for at least 20 min, and then the slices were fixed in a formalin solution (neutral buffered, 10% solution; Sigma-Aldrich) for several days at 4°C. The slices were washed well in PBS (6 times, 10 min per wash) and placed in a 4% streptavidin (Alexa Fluor 488, 594, or 680 conjugate; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) solution (498 μl 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, 2 μl streptavidin per slice). Slices were allowed to incubate in this solution at 4°C overnight, then washed well in PBS (6 times, 10 min per wash) and mounted with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech) on a glass microscope slide. Confocal images were taken with a Zeiss LSM-710 microscope at varying magnifications (3-63X). The identities of SPNs recorded in the dorsal striatum were confirmed by the presence of spines on their dendritic processes when imaged at 40-63X magnification. Individual high magnification images were stitched together, when necessary, using XuvStitch software (XuvTools). Image adjustment was performed in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) for brightness/contrast corrections and pseudocoloring.</p><p>Some filled neurons were processed for light microscopy. In brief, after overnight incubation in ABC-Elite solution (Vector Laboratories) at 4°C, slices were pre-incubated in 3′3-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Vector Laboratories) for 20 min at 4°C and visualized by adding H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to the DAB solution. The reaction was stopped when dendritic and axonal processes were visible under light microscopy examination. After washing well in 0.1 M PB (6 times, 10 min per wash), a DAB Enhancing Solution (Vector Laboratories) was applied for 10–20 s to intensify the DAB reaction product in the stained section. Slices were washed again in 0.1 M PB, then mounted with Fluoromount-G on a glass microscope slide for light microscopy. Neurons were morphologically reconstructed in three dimensions using Neurolucida (MicroBrightField) and an upright microscope fitted with a 63X/0.85 oil-immersion objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Figure error bars represent SEM.

The significance of this finding cannot be overstated as for over 30 years the assumption has been that cortical input to the striatum is exclusively excitatory. A few partial descriptions have previously indicated an inhibitory component to this project. Here the authors use modern state of the art optogenetic techniques to characterize the nature and physiological impact of this projection.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide better documentation of the neuroanatomy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The main finding in this paper concerns SOM cortical neuron projections to the striatum. The one low magnification of the labeling in the striatum is inadequate, both a low and high magnification image of the distribution of the fibers in the striatum would be nice. Also, the low level images of the retrograde labeling of SOM neurons in the cortex should be added to with higher magnification images that allow one to get a sense of the numbers and laminar distribution of these neurons. It would also be nice if the authors were able to provide a Neurolucida drawing of an axon from one of the cortical neurons going into the striatum (although it is recognized this might be difficult).</p><p>2) The rigorous characterization of SOM neurons projecting from layer 5 and 6 of cortex to striatal D1 and D2 MSNs in this paper will be important for the field. However, because the existence of GABAergic projections from the cortex to the striatum, and the fact that some of them were SOM neurons (and PV neurons), have already been reported anatomically and physiologically, it is very important to show what proportion of these GABAergic projections are from SOM neurons and what proportion of MSNs in the striatum receive these projections.</p><p>3) The text (Introduction, Results, and Discussion) should more thoroughly discuss past studies of corticostriatal GABAergic projections. For example, are the present physiological results consistent with previous ones in the ventral striatum or different? &quot;A class of GABAergic neurons in the PFC sends long-range projections to NAc and elicits acute avoidance behavior&quot; By Lee et al. in J.

We agree with reviewers that would be useful to have a Neurolucida drawing of an axon from one of the cortical neurons going into the striatum. There are too many axons though and they cross over each other too much to allow an axon reconstruction from our virus injections. Of course, intracellular staining of cells in the slice does not fill axons to their terminals in the striatum. It would be very useful to stain individual CS-SOM neurons in vivo using juxtacellular labelling, but so far we have not been successful at this technically challenging experiment.</p><p><italic>2) The rigorous characterization of SOM neurons projecting from layer 5 and 6 of cortex to striatal D1 and D2 MSNs in this paper will be important for the field. However, because the existence of GABAergic projections from the cortex to the striatum, and the fact that some of them were SOM neurons (and PV neurons), have already been reported anatomically and physiologically, it is very important to show what proportion of these GABAergic projections are from SOM neurons and what proportion of MSNs in the striatum receive these projections.</italic></p><p>In our experiments, <italic>all</italic> the recorded SPNs (MSNs) received inhibitory projections from SOM neurons. Of course, these measurements were made in the region of maximal innervation for our injection sites. Because of variability both in ChR2 expression levels (number of ChR2 molecules per transfected neuron) and transfection efficiency (number of ChR2-expressing neurons per animal), we performed the electrophysiological recording in the same dorsal striatum slices (identified by specific landmarks as slice 1 and 2) and with the highest density of ChR2 transfected axons. We did not see a mosaic structure in the terminal fields, and we think that all SPNs are inhibited by CS-SOM neurons. Of course this does not exclude the possibility that other striatal neurons receive inhibitory input from these projections. We have added this comment in our Results section. The phrase now reads:</p><p>“These data reveal that a large proportion of striatal SPNs receive direct inhibitory input driven by CS-SOM neurons but does not exclude the possibility that other striatal neurons also receive inhibitory input from these projections.”</p><p>We have now specified in the Materials and methods section a paragraph to clarify how IPSCs recording from SPNs were performed during photo-activation of CS-SOM projections. The paragraph now reads:</p><p>“Because of variability both in ChR2 expression levels (number of ChR2 molecules per transfected neuron) and transfection efficiency (number of ChR2-expressing neurons per animal), to minimize the variability from experiment to experiment we performed the electrophysiological recording in the same dorsal striatum slices (identified by specific landmarks as slice 1 and 2) and with the highest density of ChR2 transfected axons.”</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the inhibitory corticostriatal projection probably contains GABAergic cell types in addition to SOM-expressing cells (e.g. PARV-expressing and VIP-expressing cells). We would like to measure the proportion of the total corticostriatal projection accounted for by SOM cells, and also the size of the component arising from other GABAergic neurons. Although it has been shown that PARV-positive neurons project to the striatum (and we have seen this ourselves), we think it is critical to characterize the labelling in the PARV-Cre animal before doing the measurement. Because the pyramidal cell projection to the striatum is so large, even a tiny expression of channelrhodopsin in pyramidal cells would invalidate the measurement. We are currently working on evaluating the selectivity of the PARV Cre mouse and resolving technical problems associated with its use in this experiment.</p><p><italic>3) The text (Introduction, Results, and Discussion) should more thoroughly discuss past studies of corticostriatal GABAergic projections.
