However, translation has also been shown to affect mRNA stability depending on codon composition in model organisms, although universality of this mechanism remains unclear. Here, using three independent approaches to measure exogenous and endogenous mRNA decay, we define which codons are associated with stable or unstable mRNAs in human cells. We demonstrate that the regulatory information affecting mRNA stability is encoded in codons and not in nucleotides. Stabilizing codons tend to be associated with higher tRNA levels and higher charged/total tRNA ratios. While mRNAs enriched in destabilizing codons tend to possess shorter poly(A)-tails, the poly(A)-tail is not required for the codon-mediated mRNA stability. This mechanism depends on translation; however, the number of ribosome loads into a mRNA modulates the codon-mediated effects on gene expression. This work provides definitive evidence that translation strongly affects mRNA stability in a codon-dependent manner in human cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45396.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are made by joining together building blocks called amino acids into strings. The proteins are ‘translated’ from genetic sequences called mRNA molecules. These sequences can be thought of as series of ‘letters’, which are read in groups of three known as codons. Molecules called tRNAs recognize the codons and add the matching amino acids to the end of the protein. Each tRNA can recognize one or several codons, and the levels of different tRNAs inside the cell vary.</p><p>There are 61 codons that code for amino acids, but only 20 amino acids. This means that some codons produce the same amino acid. Despite this, there is evidence to suggest that not all of the codons that produce the same amino acid are exactly equivalent. In bacteria, yeast and zebrafish, some codons seem to make the mRNA molecule more stable, and others make it less stable. This might help the cell to control how many proteins it makes. It was not clear whether the same is true for humans.</p><p>To find out, Wu et al. used three separate methods to examine mRNA stability in four types of human cell. Overall, the results revealed that some codons help to stabilize the mRNA, while others make the mRNA molecule break down faster. The effect seems to depend on the supply of tRNAs that have a charged amino acid; mRNA molecules were more likely to self-destruct in cells that contained codons with low levels of the tRNA molecules.</p><p>Wu et al. also found that conditions in the cell can alter how strongly the codons affect mRNA stability. For example, a cell that has been infected by a virus reduces translation. Under these conditions, the identity of the codons in the mRNA has less effect on the stability of the mRNA molecule.</p><p>Changes to protein production happen in many diseases. Understanding what controls these changes could help to reveal more about our fundamental biology, and what happens when it goes wrong.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>codon optimality</kwd><kwd>mRNA stability</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>tRNA</kwd><kwd>poly(A)-tail</kwd><kwd>SLAM-seq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007795</institution-id><institution>Stowers Institute for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bazzini</surname><given-names>Ariel Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genomic-profiles and reporters reveal that the three-nucleotide ‘words’ read by the ribosome, codons, have a strong effect on mRNA stability, impacting the homeostatic mRNA and protein levels in human cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation and mRNA translation represent two fundamental steps in the regulation of gene expression. Stability of the mRNA affects mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Herzog et al., 2017</xref>) which in turn, impact protein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ingolia, 2016</xref>). Alterations in mRNA degradation leads to developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giraldez et al., 2006</xref>) and human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodarzi et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, aberrant mRNA translation has been implicated in protein misfolding and neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kapur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pechmann and Frydman, 2013</xref>), viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walsh et al., 2013</xref>) and developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonskikh and Polacek, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kong and Lasko, 2012</xref>). Recent studies have shown that translation impacts mRNA stability in a codon-dependent manner in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harigaya and Parker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boël et al., 2016</xref>), zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mishima and Tomari, 2016</xref>), <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Freitas Nascimento et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeacock et al., 2018</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila melanogaste</italic>r (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burow et al., 2018</xref>). This mechanism, termed codon optimality, refers to the ability of a given codon to affect mRNA stability in a translation-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>). mRNAs enriched in ‘optimal’ codons tend to be more stable, display greater abundance, higher translation efficiency and longer poly(A)-tails. Conversely, mRNAs enriched in ‘non-optimal’ codons tend to be unstable, display lower homeostatic RNA levels, poor translation efficiency and shorter poly(A)-tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mishima and Tomari, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Webster et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Most efforts aimed at identifying <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements affecting mRNA stability have focused on sequences within 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs). MicroRNAs and RNA binding proteins repress translation and/or destabilize target mRNAs through recognition of regulatory elements located primarily in the 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bazzini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Despic and Neugebauer, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giraldez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ray et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tadros et al., 2007</xref>). However, on average, the coding sequence is approximately twice as long as the 3’UTR and is recognized by the most abundant RNA-binding complex in the cell: the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doudna and Rath, 2002</xref>). While translating the information from the mRNA into protein is crucial, translation is also involved in quality control mechanisms of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shoemaker and Green, 2012</xref>). The mechanism of codon optimality represents a novel regulatory function of the ribosome upon properly processed mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Richter and Coller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schikora-Tamarit and Carey, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu and Bazzini, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Translation elongation rates underlie codon-mediated mRNA stability in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hanson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>). While less clear in higher organisms, optimal and non-optimal codons tend to be decoded by tRNAs that are highly or poorly expressed, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that the supply and/or demand for specific tRNAs affects translation elongation, which in turn, affects mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Despic and Neugebauer, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Richter and Coller, 2015</xref>). The tRNA repertoire can fluctuate in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gingold et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodarzi et al., 2016</xref>) and/or following stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Torrent et al., 2018</xref>). For example, proliferating cells undergoing differentiation contain tRNA profiles that correlate with codon usage of the specific transcriptome of each cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gingold et al., 2014</xref>). Altering tRNA availability can lead to neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ishimura et al., 2014</xref>) and upregulation of specific tRNAs drives metastasis by enhancing stability of transcripts enriched in their cognate codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodarzi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether translation affects mRNA stability in a codon-dependent manner in humans, we have measured the ability of each codon to affect mRNA stability. We have conducted analyses in four different human cell lines, using three independent methods to measure mRNA stability. We demonstrate that the regulatory information affecting mRNA stability is encoded specifically within codon identity, rather than other nucleotide sequence information. Destabilizing codons tend to have lower respective tRNA levels, as well as lower ratios of charged-tRNA (with amino acid) compared to stabilizing codons. Genes enriched in stabilizing codons also tend to possess longer poly(A)-tails than genes enriched in destabilizing codons. However, the poly(A)-tail is not essential for affecting mRNA stability in a codon-dependent manner. We demonstrate that codon-mediated effect on gene expression can also be modulated by tuning the translational level (number of ribosomes on mRNA) through either global change in translation efficiency (e.g. viral infection) or specific UTRs sequences. Our studies reveal that in human cells, the ribosome interprets two codes within the mRNA: the genetic code, which specifies the amino acid sequence, and a ‘codon-optimality-code’, which shapes mRNA stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human mRNA decay correlates with codon composition in human cell lines</title><p>To determine whether codon composition affects mRNA stability in human cells, we treated 293T, HeLa and RPE cells with Actinomycin D to block transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and measured decay of existing mRNAs by performing time-course mRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We calculated the codon stability coefficient (CSC) as the Pearson correlation coefficient between mRNA stability and codon occurrence. Based on this approach, we and others have previously determined the properties of each of 61 codons in mRNA stability in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>), zebrafish, and <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Codons displaying a positive correlation were referred to as ‘optimal’ codons because mRNAs enriched in those codons were more stable. Conversely, codons displaying a negative correlation were referred to as ‘non-optimal’ codons because mRNAs enriched in those codons were less stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>).

To separate the effects on stability related to codon composition from those due to <italic>cis</italic>-elements in the UTRs, we have previously developed a method to measure the regulatory properties of the coding sequence in a UTR-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>). We compared the decay of millions of exogenous mRNAs in zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos which possess similar 5’ and 3’UTRs but differ in codon composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>). To adapt this strategy to human cells, we developed a method using a vector-based library, termed ORFome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2011</xref>), containing ~17,000 different human coding sequences fused to common promoter, 5’ and 3’ UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). ORFome library infection into 293T and K562 cells was followed by transcriptional inhibition (Actinomycin D treatment) and ORFome mRNA levels were monitored over time using small barcodes in the 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The distribution of mRNA level in the more than ten thousand ORFome genes is narrower than the endogenous mRNAs, likely because all ORFome mRNAs share the same strong promoter, 5’ and 3’ UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Nonetheless, the CSC scores derived from ORFome mRNAs correlated with respective endogenous mRNAs, further supporting that codon composition affects mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To further explore that stability of the ORFome-derived mRNAs are indeed independent of UTR-mediated regulation, we selected mRNAs predicted to be targets of methylation (m6A) and compared that to a control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>). As expected, the endogenous m6A target mRNAs are more unstable than a control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yue et al., 2015</xref>). However, there was significantly less difference between the same mRNAs when derived from ORFome, most likely due to the absence of methylation-sensitive 3’UTR regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that this approach enables the dissection and measurement of regulatory activities embedded within coding regions and/or UTRs.</p><p>The above analyses depend on blocking transcription by Actinomycin D treatment, which may have unintended consequences. To circumvent this problem and to measure mRNA decay without blocking transcription, we employed SLAM-seq method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Herzog et al., 2017</xref>). This method measures endogenous mRNA half-lives based on 4-thiouridine (s<sup>4</sup>U) incorporation and orthogonal-chemistry-based RNA sequencing, where incorporated s<sup>4</sup>U is read as cytosine (C) rather than uracil (U) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Herzog et al., 2017</xref>). Cells were ‘fed’ with s<sup>4</sup>U, followed by washout and unlabeled chase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E, F, G</xref> and methods). We observed a strong CSC score correlation using the SLAM-seq approach akin to the exogenous ORFome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>) approach as well as sequencing of endogenous mRNAs in different cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed strong half-lives correlation between our SLAM-seq data and a similar methodology, TimeLapse-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schofield et al., 2018</xref>) in K562 cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>) and so, strong CSC scores correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Furthermore, SLAM-seq has also been done in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Herzog et al., 2017</xref>), we calculated CSC scores based on their data, it also correlated with our human SLAM-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>), indicating a similar codon optimality code in mouse embryonic stem cells. And similar to our endogenous mRNA, mRNAs previously defined as targets of the m6A pathway display increased decay compared to a control set of mRNAs in our SLAM-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In sum, we have measured mRNA decay using three independent approaches in different human cells (293T, HeLa, RPE and K562) to score codon-optimality-code. Our results suggest that codon composition affects mRNA stability in all the tested human cell lines, and that the regulatory properties of each codon are similar between cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Codon identity affects mRNA stability in human cell lines</title><p>The results above indicate that regulatory information is embedded in the coding sequence. To determine whether this sequence information is ‘read’ in a codon-dependent manner or simply nucleotide composition, we compared a pair of reporters that differed by a single nucleotide insertion (1nt frame-shift), causing a frameshift that converts an ‘optimal’ coding sequence (enriched in optimal codons) into a ‘non-optimal’ sequence (enriched in non-optimal codons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), keeping the nucleotide composition otherwise almost identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We redeployed a reporter system where mCherry (red fluorescent protein) or GFP (green fluorescent protein) was followed by a ribosome skipping sequence (P2A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Felipe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donnelly et al., 2001</xref>) and a coding region enriched in either optimal or non-optimal codons (due to 1 nucleotide frameshift) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The P2A sequence allowed the analysis of protein production in vivo independent of potential folding effects from the optimal or non-optimal peptide. If the regulatory information is ‘read’ in a manner that was dependent on codon identity, there should be a correlation between codon-optimality scores and expression levels. We found that mRNA derived from the non-optimal reporter was less stable than mRNA derived from its optimal counterpart after blocking transcription with Actinomycin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Further, this difference was observed at RNA level 24 hr post-transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that codon composition can affect homeostatic mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to higher mRNA abundance, we also observed higher fluorescence intensity from the optimal reporter vs the non-optimal reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). No significant differences were observed in the co-transfection control (GFP), ruling out potential global expression changes due to toxicity of the non-optimal peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These changes due to the codon composition were independent of the nucleotide used to cause the frameshift (G, C, U or A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), fluorescence protein used in the reporter assay (mCherry-based, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; GFP-based reporters, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or coding sequence of the frame-shifted reporter (different frame-shifted coding sequence pair, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Differently to the 1nt-out of frame reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the ‘extreme’ reporters enriched in optimal or non-optimal codons do not share the same nucleotide composition but contain higher optimality differences. Therefore, if translation in cis is important, translation of a coding region enriched in either optimal or non-optimal codons should increase or decrease mRNA stability, respectively, when compared to their untranslated counterparts (referred to as Mut) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Indeed, a translation-competent reporter enriched in optimal codons resulted in, increased mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) and fluorescent intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) compared to its translation-deficient counterpart in 293 T cells.

Similar fluorescent intensity differences were observed in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

This data demonstrates that mRNA stability and expression are influenced by the codon composition in a translation-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Synonymous codons affect mRNA stability in human cell lines</title><p>The above results indicate that codon identity impacts mRNA stability in human cells. In yeast, translation elongation speed is related to codon optimality, where ‘non-optimal’ codons are more slowly translated compared to ‘optimal’ codons. The decoding rate can be influenced by both amino acid identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artieri and Fraser, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gardin et al., 2014</xref>) and tRNA levels. To address whether amino acid identity influences mRNA stability, we first assessed whether synonymous codons behaved in the same way. We hypothesized that synonymous codons should share the same optimality behavior if amino acid identity was the main determinant. For example, in zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic>, we found that some amino acids share either optimal or non-optimal codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>). Of the 20 different amino acids, we found that in human, only histidine possessed synonymous codons that were exclusively non-optimal across all three assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For a few other amino acids (e.g. glycine, serine), synonymous codons were largely encoded by optimal or non-optimal codons in most of the assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For the majority of amino acids, synonymous codons possessed different regulatory properties. However, a preprint recently proposed that amino acid identity also acts as a driver of translation-dependent decay regulation using similar dataset in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forrest et al., 2018</xref>), which shows strong correlation with ours CSC scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, we calculated the amino acid stabilization coefficient (ASC), as the Person correlation coefficient between mRNA stability and amino acid occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>). Similar to the preprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forrest et al., 2018</xref>), amino acids presented correlations with mRNA decay (ASC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, in human those correlations are strongly affected after removing the most abundance synonymous codon for most of the amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). For example, Leucine and Isoleucine displayed a positive ASC score suggesting that both amino acids might be optimal (also mentioned in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forrest et al., 2018</xref>); however, in all the datasets both amino acids are encoded by optimal and non-optimal codons and the most abundance codon dominates the ASC calculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Actually, both amino acids would be referred as non-optimal after removing the single most abundant synonymous codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, as mentioned before, there are few amino acids like Histidine or Serine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), where all the synonymous codons temp to share the same optimality trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and so those few amino acids might have an implication on mRNA stability.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45396.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Synonymous codons affect mRNA stability in human lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap showing the codon stability coefficient (CSC) sorted by the encoded amino-acid, for the indicated cell lines and approaches used to measure mRNA stability.

First, using reporter genes differing in silent mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), we observed that mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and fluorescent intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) were higher in the reporters enriched in optimal codons compared to counterparts enriched in non-optimal codons. These results suggested that synonymous codons can have different effects on gene expression. Second, we designed individual reporters (Mini-gene) that contained coding sequences, in which all even positions (61 of 122 codons) after the P2A releasing sequence possessed a single codon type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). As before, we measured expression levels between translation-competent and translation-deficient reporters (due to premature stop codon, Mut) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Due to the enrichment on a single codon in each mini-gene reporter, the Mini-gene reporters provide a way to analyze the regulatory properties at a single codon resolution. Consistent with our observations of endogenous mRNAs, we found that several amino acids possessed synonymous codons that differed in optimality identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Specifically, mini-genes enriched in optimal codons displayed increased expression when compared to translation-deficient counterparts, whereas mini-genes enriched in non-optimal displayed either decreased expression, or no significant change when compared to respective translation-deficient counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These observations further validate the differences in optimality between synonymous codons for leucine, cysteine and isoleucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As predicted, in the case of Histidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), both mini-gene reporters presented the same non-optimality trend found for endogenous profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) (with CAT being consistently more non-optimal than CAC, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>)). These several results together suggest that codon identity affects mRNA stability in a translation-dependent manner.</p><p>To explore how synonymous codons display different regulatory behaviors, we examined their respective tRNA levels, which have been proposed to be an important determinant of codon optimality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>). tRNA levels measured by two independent techniques in 293T cells, Hydro-tRNA-seq and TGIRT-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gogakos et al., 2017</xref>), correlates with 293T CSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), supporting the idea that tRNA levels affect mRNA stability. However, these correlations are not strong, and the two methods do not strongly correlate ((<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) , evidencing that measuring tRNA level is challenging. Beside the level of total tRNA, we investigate the relation between tRNA quality and codon optimality. Interestingly, the ratio of charged tRNA (with amino acid) to total tRNAs (with and without amino acid) in 293T cells also correlated with the CSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), suggesting that the ratio of charged tRNA might also affect mRNA stability. In particular, the four encoded nuclear tRNAs for Serine were the most uncharged tRNAs and Serine is one of the amino acids that appears to be non-optimal in human, zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>).

However, translation is also important for mRNA quality control, targeting defective mRNAs for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shoemaker and Green, 2012</xref>).

We observed that particular codons were enriched within stable mRNAs and other codons were enriched within unstable mRNAs, optimal and non-optimal codons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In particular, we developed a method (ORFome) to distinguish mRNA decay regulation between regulation coming from codon composition versus other regulatory information (UTRs). In addition to highlighting codon effects, this method proved to be a viable strategy to identify other <italic>cis</italic> regulatory features impacting stability. For example, by comparing endogenous decay profiles with ORFome profiles, we found that predicted m6A targets displayed considerable different destabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrated that the regulatory information was based on codon identity rather than other sequence information, by using reporter gene pairs differing in the codon composition due to a single nucleotide insertion causing a framed shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). While most synonymous codons affect mRNA stability differently, a few amino acids (e.g. Histidine, Serine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), appear to have an effect at the amino acid level by either impacting the rate of peptidyl transfer or the amino-acyl tRNA charging step (potentially, Serine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Comparing to human, in zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>), few more amino acids could be proposed to be optimal or non-optimal, suggesting potential multilayer regulatory differences between species or cell stage (embryogenesis). In human cells, a variety of data indicate that codons rather than the amino acid they encode—affects mRNA stability in a translation-dependent manner. First, most amino acids (e.g Leucine, Isoleucine, Cysteine, Glutamic acid, Arginine, Asparagine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tyrosine, Valine) display both optimal and non-optimal codons in most decay profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Second, two set of reporters having synonymous mutations confirmed that synonymous codon affects mRNA stability differently, especially the mini-genes we designed have high resolution at single codon level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Third, we observed, that non-optimal codons tend to be decoded by lowly expressed tRNAs, and optimal codons by highly expressed tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This suggests that tRNA supply/demand might be an important determinant of codon-mediated mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Despic and Neugebauer, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frumkin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Richter and Coller, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that non-optimal codons also displayed a low ratio of charged to total tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, in the case of serine, defined as non-optimal, all nuclear-encoded tRNAs were the most poorly charged, suggesting that charging tRNA may be another crucial point impacting codon-mediated gene regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, the ‘tRNA ready to go’ level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rak et al., 2018</xref>) may be modulating translation elongation rates and serving as a determinant of codon optimality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In addition of aminoacyl charging, tRNA quality is also related to tRNA modifications, therefore, it will be worthwhile to examine the effects of tRNA modifications on mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duechler et al., 2016</xref>). Our data support the idea that tRNAs are master gene regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gingold et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodarzi et al., 2016</xref>) and highlight the need to fully understand how tRNA expression and processing are regulated in different cells and different conditions, including human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ishimura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kirchner and Ignatova, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Torrent et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, genes involve in tRNA expression regulation and processing, would be strong candidates to explain a part of the codon optimality molecular mechanism.</p><p>With respect to the function of the ribosome in mRNA quality control, it was proposed that codon optimality might be a Slowness-mediated decay (SMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rak et al., 2018</xref>) because it is similar to a slow-go-decay (SGD) pathway where the elongation speed of the ribosome might be the trigger for regulation. This is distinct from no-go-decay (NGD), where stalling ribosomes trigger mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simms et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, codon optimality may be related to mRNA quality control mechanisms for: recognition, labeling and cleaning of the mRNA. However, the molecular mechanisms of how translation affects mRNA stability in a codon-dependent manner remains poorly characterized. While Dhh1p in yeast senses ribosome elongation speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>) and affects mRNA stability in a codon-dependent manner, the role of the vertebrate ortholog, DDX6, with respect of codon optimality is not clear. In human cells, there is a clear correlation between mRNA enriched in non-optimal codons and shortening of the poly(A)-tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) similar to that observed in yeast and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mishima and Tomari, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Webster et al., 2018</xref>). However, reporter genes possessing a histone tail and therefore lacking a poly(A)-tail were still affected by codon composition in both human and zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, these results indicate that the poly(A)-tail is not required and likely, the shortening of the poly(A)-tail in genes enriched in non-optimal codons is an indirect consequence of decreased stability rather than a required step in the codon optimality mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Future work should explore the molecular mechanism of how the translation affects mRNA destabilization.</p><p>In addition to altered dynamics of mRNA stability due to specific misregulation of tRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodarzi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kirchner and Ignatova, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Torrent et al., 2018</xref>), we showed that codon-mediated mRNA stability can be affected by altering the translational level through either global changes in translation efficiency (during viral infection) or specific 5’ and 3’ UTRs sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests an alternative way for the cell to differentially regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, it will be important to integrate the evolutionary and functional relationship between translation initiation driven by the UTRs and translation elongation dictated by the coding sequence with respect to codon-mediated gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2014</xref>) as well as the effects of codon composition and translation speed on protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The observation that codon optimality effects can be modulated by altering baseline translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), leads us to speculate that, global reductions in translation efficiency might explain the predicted attenuated codon optimality effect in neural-specific mRNA decay in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burow et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, molecular factors such microRNAs or RNA-binding protein regulating mRNA translation could potentially modulate the impact of codon-mediated regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Hence, it is worth exploring how codon-mediated regulation is impacted in disease states where translation rates are globally affected, such as in neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2017</xref>), ribosomopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Danilova and Gazda, 2015</xref>), virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walsh et al., 2013</xref>) and other cellular stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonskikh and Polacek, 2017</xref>). In addition to the cell-specific translational competency (ribosome specificity, translation level), the ready to go tRNA repertoire (level, charged) and intrinsic mRNA properties (mRNA localization, codons distribution along the coding region) need to be integrated to understand the differential gene expression during development, cell reprogramming, as well as identify underlying causes of misregulated genes in human diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent <break/>type</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Cell line(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">HEK293T</td><td valign="bottom">American Type Culture Collection</td><td valign="bottom">#CRL-11268</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Cell line(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">Hela</td><td valign="bottom">American Type Culture Collection</td><td valign="bottom">#CCL2</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Cell line(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">K562</td><td valign="bottom">American Type Culture Collection</td><td valign="bottom">#CRL-4000</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Cell line(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">RPE</td><td valign="bottom">American Type Culture Collection</td><td valign="bottom">#CCL-243, Lot #62995945</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="bottom">ORFome library</td><td valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="bottom">TRC3 ORF Puromycin Arrayed Glycerol Library</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="bottom">North2South Hybridization and Detection Kit</td><td valign="bottom">ThermoFisher</td><td valign="bottom">Cat#17097</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="bottom">SLAMseq Kinetics Kit</td><td valign="bottom">Lexogen</td><td valign="bottom">Cat#061.24</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="bottom">R for analysis and plot</td><td valign="bottom">version 3.5.1</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Tissue culture</title><p>293T, HeLa and RPE cells were cultured with DMEM media, supplied with 10% FBS.

The 96 well format ORFome library was pool together using an automatic robot. First in 20 bins were created based in ORF size, then those 20 were pooled in five groups, grown, DNA maxi-preparation done. After quantification, the five groups were mixed into a single cocktail. The ORFome cocktail was transfected with lentivirus vector: Pax2 and VSV-G into 293 T cells for virus packing. Media containing virus were filtered and ultracentrifuged to enrich virus for infection. 293 T cells and k562 cells were infected and selected with puromycin for a week, at the concentration of 293T(2 μg/ml), K562(0.75 μg/ml). Then, cells were treated with Actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) at six-well plate and samples were collected in duplicate every hour 0–6 hr for RNA-seq. Specific oligos were used to target the surrounding barcode region of ORFome to generate library and sequenced, we tested different PCR cycles to amply the library and finally used 15 cycles. The ORFome reads were trimmed using cutadapt 1.16; the resulting trimmed reads were mapped to the ORF-ome barcodes using salmon 0.9.1. To calculate mRNA stability, transcripts were selected with the Bioconductor zFPKM package, a cut-off of zFPKM &gt; −3 was applied. The decay rate was estimated using a linear model according to the integrated rate law for a first-order reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>SLAM-seq</title><p>SLAMseq Kinetics Kit - Catabolic Kinetics Module) from Lexogen was performed. Basically, k562 cells were feed with 100 uM 4sU for 24 hr, fresh media containing s4U was changed every 3 hr. For chasing, old media are removed and cells were washed with PBS three times before adding media without s4U, but 10 mM UTP instead, samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6 hr in triplicates for RNA extract and IAA treatment. All the operations were done in red light source to protect 4sU from crosslink. QuantSeq 3’mRNA-seq library were generated and sequenced, by PCR 12 cycles for library amplification based on the protocol. The SLAM-seq data was processed with the slam dunk pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/t-neumann/slamdunk">https://github.com/t-neumann/slamdunk</ext-link> 0.3.3.)

(1) As expected, the majority of sequenced reads come from the 3’UTR. (2) From all possible nucleotide transitions across the transcriptome, T-to-C changes were only significant in cells treated with s<sup>4</sup>U (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). (3) The rate of T-to-C transitions decrease with time after washing out the s<sup>4</sup>U from the medium, consistent with labeled (‘old’) mRNA being replaced with new mRNA (unlabeled) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). (4) We observed a strong correlation between mRNA levels calculated with regular RNA-seq (CPM) and Quant-seq (length-independent) as well as between technical replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). (5) The s<sup>4</sup>U incorporation does not affect global mRNA abundance when compared to untreated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). (6) The mRNA half-life we get from SLAM-seq highly correlates with the published mRNA half life from TimeLapse-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>).

They conclude that the speed of ribosome elongation along a transcript inversely correlates the susceptibility of that transcript to decay and degradation – and that a major contributor to ribosome speed is codon identity (and corresponding tRNA abundance). This agrees with relationships between codon optimality and mRNA degradation that have been observed in many other organisms.

You ought to more strongly support the connection between CSC and half-life beyond tRNA abundance since that correlation is weak, and that perhaps you could perform some of the analyses in Forrest et al. paper to test alternative models for the CSC-half-life connection.</p><p>Your conclusion is expected but has not been shown before and therefore might have turned out differently. Because if this we believe that the paper should be published as &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; paper?</p><p>I include the full reviews of the referees because they are very thoughtful and informative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>A connection between the codon composition of an mRNA's coding sequence and the half-life of the corresponding transcript has recently been observed in several organisms, including yeast, zebrafish, and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Similar effects appear to not yet have been published in mammalian cells (a 2018 review (PMID: 29018283) claims that such an effect has been observed in &quot;human, mouse and rat cell lines&quot; but cites only unpublished observation). Using a variety of experimental approaches, Wu et al. demonstrate that codon content and mRNA stability are correlated in several human cell lines.</p><p>The authors globally measure the half-life of mRNAs by performing a time course of RNAseq after shutting off new transcription with actinomycin D treatment. They produce qualitatively similar measurements without incurring potential secondary effects from global transcriptional shutoff using a recently developed metabolic labeling approach. They also measure half-lives of a synthetic library of transcripts in which a large set of endogenous ORFs are inserted between the same 5' and 3' UTRs. Calculating the correlation between the frequency with which each codon occurs in a transcript and that transcript's measured half-life in each experimental approach allows the authors to quantify the effect of that codon on mRNA stability (the codon stability coefficient, or CSC). They observe largely consistent CSC values for each codon across 293T, HeLa, RPE, and K5262 cells and across the three approaches used.</p><p>To confirm that transcript stability is directly influenced by translation of different codon types (i.e. that this correlation does not simply reflect co-evolution between codon usage and other transcript features influencing stability), the authors follow up by measuring the relatively stability of various reporters in which coding sequences enriched or depleted in &quot;optimal&quot; codons have been placed downstream of fluorescent reporter, separated by a P2A skipping sequence. This allows mRNA abundance to be read out directly by qPCR or indirectly by abundance of the fluorescent protein. Their results support the claim that translation of particular codons can directly stabilize or destabilize transcript. They also demonstrate a positive but weak correlation between CSC and the abundance of each codon's cognate tRNAs from recently published sequencing-based measurements.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>The most striking feature of the original observation that codon identity affected transcript stability in yeast was that stabilizing codons consisted almost entirely of codons that had been independently annotated as optimal based on genomic tRNA copy number and codon-anticodon base pairing. While the concept of codon optimality is more complex in human than in yeast, the manuscript is light on analysis of the features that codons observed to stabilize or destabilize transcripts have in common. Understanding such features would help to evaluate different models for how stabilization/destabilization is mechanistically achieved. While the correlations between CSC and tRNA abundance/charged ratio in Figure 3G and H are a step in this direction, these results seem overstated in the text. The authors claim that &quot;our results suggest that the 'tRNA ready to go' availability (Rak et al., 2018) largely determines codon-mediated regulation on mRNA stability&quot; (emphasis ours) and that &quot;non-optimal codons are decoded by lowly expressed tRNAs, and optimal codon by highly expressed tRNAs&quot;. Neither of these statements are well supported by the data, in which it seems clear that tRNA abundance explains at most a small fraction of the variance in CSC and that there are many low-tRNA-abundance codons with high CSC and vice versa. Interpretation of Figure 3G and H would be helped by a scatter plot showing how consistent the Hydro-seq and TGIRT-seq estimates of tRNA abundance are with each other. (The fact that the extreme outlier point at 10^1 in the TGIRT-seq scatter plot is not an outlier in the Hydro-seq data suggests at least some inconsistency). How strong are Pearson (as opposed to the reported Spearman rank) correlations for 3G and H? (The use of Spearman is reasonable since there is no reason to expect a linear relationship, but the data does not visually suggest a coherent non-linear but monotonic relationship.) How do measured CSC values compare to codon optimality as estimated by relative frequency of usage in the transcriptome or in a subset of highly expressed housekeeping genes?</p><p>Global measurements of mRNA half-lives by metabolic labeling and sequencing have recently been published in K562s (PMID 29355846) and in mouse embryonic stem cells (PMID 28945705). The manuscript would also be strengthened by both confirming that CSC values inferred from the published K562 data agree with the author's data and by evaluating whether the effect is observed in mouse cells as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this study, Wu et al. attempt to decipher the contribution of codon optimality and related properties to the stability of transcripts in human cells. The basic thesis is that speed of ribosome elongation along a transcript inversely correlates with (and perhaps mediates?) the susceptibility of that transcript to decay and degradation – and that a major contributor to ribosome speed is codon identity (and corresponding tRNA abundance). This is consistent with relationships between codon optimality and mRNA degradation that have been observed in many other systems.</p><p>To support their model, the authors generate datasets measuring RNA stability using three orthogonal sequencing methods, including sequencing post transcriptional shutdown (via ActD), sequencing after a s4U pulse-chase (SLAM-seq), and sequencing of a pool of human ORFs in a lentiviral system with (nearly) invariant 5' and 3' UTRs. Their observations broadly support the hypothesis that codon identity contributes to transcript stability. This has been reported previously, both in yeast (Presnyak et al., 2015) and in human cells (Forrest et al., 2018), but the authors' comprehensive datasets make this a valuable study. In addition, the array of reporters that the authors have constructed (including the synonymous/non-syn; 1 nt frameshift and the mini genes) are valuable tools to study the contributions of codons towards translation, and the results support the broad thrust of the authors work. Their observation that codon dependent effects are not dependent on and possibly causal for or orthogonal to polyA tail length is also intriguing.</p><p>Major concern:</p><p>There is an almost identical dataset and analysis that was recently reported, which is not cited or discussed (Forrest et al., 2018). Forrest et al. perform almost identical analysis to Wu et al. Figure 3G, H using the same preexisting data – but come to opposite conclusions. Wu et al. conclude that based on Figure 3G, H with correlations of ~0.3 that &quot;tRNA levels.… correlates with 293T CSCs&quot;, while Forrest et al. conclude based on correlations of ~0.3 are &quot;not nearly as robust as that seen in yeast; thus, other aspects of codon identity could be at play.&quot; Forrest et al. goes on to demonstrate that the driver of this transcript instability is the amino acid identity, that there are certain amino acids (mostly hydrophobic ones) that are inefficient in forming peptide bonds, and this (along with the tRNA abundance and codon optimality) leads to the alterations in ribosomal speed – but Wu et al. conclude that amino acids play no role. It seems to this reviewer that it is important for Wu et al. to discuss the conclusions in Forrest et al., especially when the same data are used to derive different conclusions. Forrest et al. is currently a preprint but it is freely available and the conclusions are highly related – sometimes even involving the same previously published datasets – so it should be discussed.</p><p>Other concerns:</p><p>1) It is this reviewer's understanding that the ORFeome library used by the authors was generated with invariant 5' and 3' UTRs (Yang et al., 2011). However, the authors indicate that the library has unique barcodes in the 3' UTR, which enables them to perform specific PCR across the barcodes, sidestepping the problem of distinguishing the ORfeome derived reads from endogenous genes during sequencing. This reviewer was unable to find a Materials and methods section describing this barcoded library (if the authors have generated one, and a reference if not). The Materials and methods section for sequencing library prep should be elaborated upon.</p><p>2) Furthermore, the authors refer to the ORFeome library as having &quot;common promoter, 5' and 3' UTRs&quot; but if the 3' UTRs have ORF-specific barcodes then they are not common to all library members. How can the authors be sure that including barcodes in the 3' UTR does not affect mRNA stability?</p><p>3) It is unclear why the authors attribute the narrow distribution in mRNA levels of the ORFeome to sharing a strong promoter as opposed to having fewer regulatory elements in their untranslated regions – or some combination thereof.</p><p>4) The approaches used to generate sequencing libraries in this work (QuantSeq and SLAM-seq and the ORFeome barcoding sequencing) all generate libraries with much lower diversity than standard RNA-seq (since they just sequence the very 3' end of molecules or a barcode region). Because of this, PCR duplicates become more of an issue. How many cycles of PCR were performed? How were PCR duplicates handled?</p><p>Forrest, Megan E., Ashrut Narula, Thomas J Sweet, Daniel Arango, Gavin Hanson, James Ellis, Shalini Oberdoerffer, Jeff Coller, and Olivia S Rissland. 2018.

Their comments have helped to strengthen as well as clarify our conclusions. For that we are grateful to them.</p><p>Originally, we did not comment on the bioRxiv preprint (Forrest et al., 2018), since it was not peer-reviewed and therefore, we were unsure how to discuss the conclusions drawn in a preprint. However, based on the reviewer’s suggestion we have analyzed and compared their data with our data. This analysis is presented in the new Figure 3—figure supplement 1. Based on this analysis in the revised manuscript we have explained in more detail why we conclude that in general amino acids are not playing a central role in mRNA stability in human. However, as we have indicated in the original manuscript, some amino acids might influence mRNA stability (e.g Histidine or Serine, Figure 3 and Figure 6). I have briefly outlined below the major points to ease the review process.</p><p>First, we find that the CSC scores of Forrest et al., 2018 preprint highly correlates with our CSC scores, suggesting there are no measurable technical differences between these studies (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). Second, Forrest et al., 2018 preprint proposed that “amino acid identity are the major determinants of mRNA stability in human”. In fact based on our codon optimality studies in zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic>, we first proposed the idea that amino acids can potentially affect mRNA stability (Bazzini, EMBO, 2016). Therefore, it was natural for us to ask whether a similar relationship between amino acids and mRNA stability also exists in human. Therefore using the parameters we have previously used (Bazzini, EMBO, 2016) and which is also used by Forrest et al., 2018 preprint, we calculated the amino acid stabilization coefficient (ASC), as the Pearson correlation coefficient between mRNA stability and amino acid occurrence (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). Similar to the Forrest et al., 2018, we also observed that in human cells amino acids composition correlates with mRNA stability and therefore, amino acids can “potentially” be defined as optimal or non-optimal. However, it is crucial to realize that the ASC (amino acids correlation with mRNA stability) is strongly affected by the usage of each synonymous codon. And in both studies find in human (different from zebrafish or <italic>Xenopus</italic>), there are several amino acids (e.g Leucine, Isoleucine, Cysteine, Glutamic acid, Arginine, Asparagine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tyrosine, Valine) that are encoded by optimal and non-optimal codons in most of the profiles (Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). And therefore, the potential amino acid optimality will be dominated by the optimality of the most commonly used codon. For example, for Leucine and Isoleucine, we and Forrest et al., 2018 observed positive ASC scores when all the synonymous codons were used for the calculation, and therefore one could conclude that Leucine and Isoleucine are optimal amino acids (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). However, as we show in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B when the most abundant codon is not used in the calculation, then the conclusion about the optimality of both amino acids would be the opposite, both amino acids would be defined as Non-optimal amino acids. Therefore, we think that further analysis or conclusions related to intrinsic properties of the amino acids (polar, hydrophobic, etc) cannot be done, because the results will be dominated by the most abundant codon rather than by the amino-acid. The conclusion that amino acids are NOT generally playing a central role in mRNA stability is further supported by two independent observations; first, that synonymous mutations affect mRNAs stability (Figure 3) and second, using our mini-gene reporters we validate that particular amino acids were encoded by optimal and non-optimal codons (Figure 3).</p><p>However, there are few amino acids such as Histidine or Serine (Figure 3A), where all the synonymous codons tend to share the same optimality trend (in our and in the Forrest et al., 2018 profiles, Figure 3—figure supplement 1B) and so, the ASC scores are not strongly affected after removing the most used codon (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). Moreover, for Histidine, we validated that both synonymous codons were non-optimal using mini-genes reporters (Figure 3). We have clarified these issues in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the second issue about the weak correlations between tRNA level and CSC scores, we understand the reviewers’ concerns. While we observed significant correlations between the CSC scores and tRNA level measured by two independent methods, nonetheless the correlations are weak. Moreover, based on the suggestion of reviewer 1, we have assessed the correlation between tRNA level measured by two techniques (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). The correlation is weak for technical methods indicating that measuring tRNA levels is technically challenging. Following reviewers’ suggestion and based on our new analysis in the revised manuscript we have indicated that relationship between tRNA level and codon optimality is significant but weak and would require further investigation in future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Your conclusion is expected but has not been shown before and therefore might have turned out differently.

The CSC scores do not present strong correlation with codon usage (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C), from usage frequency of the genome, of the transcriptome (each gene with the weight of mRNA level) and of the top 500 highly expressed genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Global measurements of mRNA half-lives by metabolic labeling and sequencing have recently been published in K562s (PMID 29355846) and in mouse embryonic stem cells (PMID 28945705). The manuscript would also be strengthened by both confirming that CSC values inferred from the published K562 data agree with the author's data and by evaluating whether the effect is observed in mouse cells as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the reviewer’s comment we have analyzed both datasets and we agree that strengthen our conclusions.</p><p>We observed strong correlation between mRNA half-lives calculated with TimeLapse-seq method (Schofield et al., 2018) and our SLAM-seq, both in K562 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1H). Second, we calculated the CSC scores using the mRNA half-lives from TimeLapse-seq (Schofield et al., 2018) and observed strong correlation with our CSC scores (Figure 1—figure supplement 1I).</p><p>Finally, we also calculated the CSC scores based on the mouse embryonic stem cells half-lives SLAM-seq profiles (Herzog et al., 2017) and observed strong correlation between the mouse and human CSC scores (Figure 1—figure supplement 1I), indicating a similar codon optimality code in mouse embryonic stem cells.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Major concern:</p><p>There is an almost identical dataset and analysis that was recently reported, which is not cited or discussed (Forrest et al., 2018). […] It seems to this reviewer that it is important for Wu et al. to discuss the conclusions in Forrest et al., especially when the same data are used to derive different conclusions. Forrest et al. is currently a preprint but it is freely available and the conclusions are highly related – sometimes even involving the same previously published datasets – so it should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our comments about the Forrest et al., 2018 preprint above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other concerns:</p><p>1) It is this reviewer's understanding that the ORFeome library used by the authors was generated with invariant 5' and 3' UTRs (Yang et al., 2011). However, the authors indicate that the library has unique barcodes in the 3' UTR, which enables them to perform specific PCR across the barcodes, sidestepping the problem of distinguishing the ORfeome derived reads from endogenous genes during sequencing. This reviewer was unable to find a Material and methods section describing this barcoded library (if the authors have generated one, and a reference if not). The Materials and methods section for sequencing library prep should be elaborated upon.</p></disp-quote><p>We ordered the TRC3 ORF Puromycin Arrayed Glycerol Library (Σ-Aldrich), with the barcode for each ORFome mRNA already cloned. We added it in the Materials and method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Furthermore, the authors refer to the ORFeome library as having &quot;common promoter, 5' and 3' UTRs&quot; but if the 3' UTRs have ORF-specific barcodes then they are not common to all library members. How can the authors be sure that including barcodes in the 3' UTR does not affect mRNA stability?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we cannot exclude the possibility that some barcodes might affect stability (both ways), however there is no relation between barcodes and mRNAs. The barcodes represent less than 1.6% of the nucleotides in the mRNA library. Moreover, we have calculated the decay profile from more than ten thousand mRNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is unclear why the authors attribute the narrow distribution in mRNA levels of the ORFeome to sharing a strong promoter as opposed to having fewer regulatory elements in their untranslated regions – or some combination thereof.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Yes, it is likely a combinatorial effect of promoter, 5’UTR and 3’UTR. We have revised this part in the text to avoid any misunderstanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The approaches used to generate sequencing libraries in this work (QuantSeq and SLAM-seq and the ORFeome barcoding sequencing) all generate libraries with much lower diversity than standard RNA-seq (since they just sequence the very 3' end of molecules or a barcode region). Because of this, PCR duplicates become more of an issue. How many cycles of PCR were performed? How were PCR duplicates handled?</p></disp-quote><p>For ORFome, we have PCR 10, 15 and 20 cycles. With 15 cycles we started seeing a band, then we generated 8 reactions with the exact same condition and pooled them together. For the SLAM-seq, we follow the QuantSeq protocol and do 12 cycle for the PCR.</p></body></sub-article></article>
