These cells develop from precursor cells called neuroblasts. Each neuroblast can produce many cells, and it is likely that cells that develop from the same neuroblast work together in the adult brain in the same neural circuit. How the adult cells develop into their final form plays an important role in creating a neural circuit, but this process is not fully understood.</p><p>In many animals, the complexity of their brain makes it difficult to follow how each individual neuroblast develops. However, all of the neuroblasts in the relatively simple brain of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> have been identified. Furthermore, the genes responsible for establishing the initial identity of each neuroblast in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain are known. These genes may also determine which adult neurons develop from the neuroblast, and when each type of neuron is produced. However, the extent to which a single gene can influence the identity of neurons is unclear.</p><p>Sen et al. focused on two types of neuroblasts, each of which, although found next to each other in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, produces neurons for different neural circuits. One of the neuroblasts generates the olfactory neurons responsible for detecting smells; the other innervates the ‘central complex’ that has a number of roles, including controlling the fly's movements. A gene called <italic>orthodenticle</italic> is expressed by the central complex neuroblast, but not by the olfactory neuroblast, and helps to separate the two neural circuits into different regions of the fly brain.</p><p>Sen et al. found that deleting the <italic>orthodenticle</italic> gene from the central complex neuroblast causes it to develop into olfactory neurons instead of central complex neurons. Tests showed that the modified neurons are completely transformed; they not only work like olfactory neurons, but they also have the same structure and molecular properties. Sen et al. have therefore demonstrated that it is possible to drastically alter the circuitry of the fruit fly brain by changing how one gene is expressed in one neuroblast. This suggests that new neural circuits can form relatively easily, and so could help us to understand how different brain structures and neural circuits evolved.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04407.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04407.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neuroblast lineage</kwd><kwd>central complex</kwd><kwd>olfactory projection neuron</kwd><kwd>functional imaging</kwd><kwd>orthodenticle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001405</institution-id><institution>Tata Insitute of Fundamental research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Centre for Biological Sciences</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>VijayRaghavan</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001703</institution-id><institution>École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Indo-Swiss Bilateral Research Initiative</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reichert</surname><given-names>Heinrich</given-names></name><name><surname>VijayRaghavan</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A 140607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reichert</surname><given-names>Heinrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK092640</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jing W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000522</institution-id><institution>Company of Biologists</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sen</surname><given-names>Sonia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002491</institution-id><institution>Bristol-Myers Squibb</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sen</surname><given-names>Sonia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JC Bose Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>VijayRaghavan</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Large-scale changes in the brain's functional circuitry can be brought about by simple changes in gene expression in neural stem cells during development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals display a wide repertoire of complex and adaptable behaviours executed by equally complex nervous systems. Understanding how the vast number of diverse cell types is assembled into functional neural circuits in complex brains during development is a major challenge. Studies of lineage tracing and circuit mapping reveal that heterogeneous pools of neural progenitors sequentially generate series of neuronal progeny, and that such lineally related neurons with shared developmental histories often share functional connectivity in the brain. In consequence, neural lineages can be considered to form neuroanatomical units of projection that represent the developmental basis of the functional circuitry of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pearson and Doe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cardona et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pereanu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Custo Greig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Franco and Muller, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kohwi and Doe, 2013</xref>).</p><p>This is exemplified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> where the tens of thousands of neurons that comprise the adult brain are generated during development by a set of approximately 100 pairs of individually identifiable neural stem cells called neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Truman and Bate, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Urbach et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Urbach and Technau, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Technau et al., 2006</xref>). Each neuroblast gives rise to a specific, invariant lineage of post-mitotic neural cells in a highly stereotyped manner and in many cases, lineally related neurons share functional connectivity and many neuroanatomical features such as innervation of common neuropiles in the brain and common axon tract projection patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pereanu and Hartenstein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ito et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lovick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). Examples of this are the four neuroblast lineages that give rise to the intrinsic cells of the mushroom body, a neuropile compartment involved in learning and memory, or the five neuroblast lineages that innervate the antennal lobe, the primary olfactory processing centre in the fly brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ito and Hotta, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ito et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stocker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jefferis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Das et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chou et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, neuroblast lineages are considered to form neuroanatomical units of projection that represent the developmental basis of the functional macrocircuitry of the fly brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pereanu and Hartenstein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cardona et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lovick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wong et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Comparable principles are manifested in the developing cerebral cortex of vertebrates, which consists of diverse neurons organized into six distinct layers, each of which is laid in place sequentially during development. Neural progenitors in the cortex are known to be multipotent, capable of generating neurons that populate each of the layers. Lineage tracing experiments in mice suggest that lineally related neurons occupy columns spanning across the layers of the cerebral cortex, as proposed in the ‘radial unit hypothesis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rakic, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ohtsuki et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, lineally related neurons also show a propensity to interconnect and have functional similarity, for example, similar orientation preferences in the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ohtsuki et al., 2012</xref>). Thus in vertebrates as in invertebrates, developmental history and lineage relationships govern the assembly of functional circuits.</p><p>In order to understand how lineally specified circuits develop in the brain, it is critical to understand the molecular mechanisms that confer unique identities to neural progenitors and their lineages. Studies on the molecular genetics of brain development indicate that neural progenitors emerge from the embryonic neuroectoderm where unique spatial information represented by unique combinations of gene expression specifies unique identities to the progenitors. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the embryonic neuroectoderm becomes spatially regionalized due to the action of embryonic patterning genes, which define the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral body axes. Their combined expression creates a Cartesian coordinate-like gene expression system in the neuroectoderm, resulting in unique domains of expression of developmental control genes along the neuroectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Skeath and Thor, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Urbach and Technau, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Technau et al., 2006</xref>). Changes in the combinatorial expression pattern of these genes in specific domains can lead to changes in the identities of the neuroblasts that delaminate from the neuroectoderm during embryogenesis (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deshpande et al., 2001</xref>). The process of spatial regionalization of the embryonic neuroectoderm is very similar in vertebrates. Homologous embryonic patterning genes result in unique domains of combinatorial gene expression along the vertebrate neuroectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reichert and Simeone, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lichtneckert and Reichert, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reichert, 2009</xref>). Thus, in both vertebrates and invertebrates, the cells of the neuroectoderm acquire unique spatial information in the form of a combinatorial code of gene expression, which is conferred by embryonic patterning genes. It is noteworthy that neural progenitors also use temporal information (typically a series of sequentially expressed transcription factors) to generate neuronal diversity within lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pearson and Doe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lin and Lee, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kohwi and Doe, 2013</xref>). While spatial cues convert a homogenous pool of progenitors into heterogeneous populations, temporal cues result in the ordered production of different neural subtypes from each progenitor.</p><p>Given that spatial information in the neuroectoderm, in the form of embryonic patterning genes, imparts heterogeneity to neural progenitor populations, it is likely that these genes might also act as intrinsic determinants in the progenitor to give lineages their unique identities and hence determine their place in neural circuitry. This implies that spatially encoded intrinsic factors determine the identity of the progenitor and, as a consequence, the unique circuit features of its neural lineage. According to this, removal or addition of one or more of these genes could lead to a change in neuroblast identity resulting in transformation of the neuronal lineage and the lineal circuitry that derives from it. However, the extent to which individual transcription factors can contribute to this specification of neuroblast identity is not well understood.</p><p>In order to test this, it is important to be able to uniquely identify individual neural progenitors and their lineages in the brain. The complexity of the vertebrate brain makes it difficult to conduct such an analysis at the resolution of single progenitors and single lineages. However, each of the neuroblasts in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain has been identified and their lineages characterized in the larval and adult brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ito et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lovick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, each of these neuroblasts has also been characterized by the expression of a specific combination of spatial genes, which could act as cell intrinsic determinants in the specification of unique neuroblast identity and hence control lineage-specific neuronal cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Skeath and Thor, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Urbach and Technau, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Technau et al., 2006</xref>). This allows an investigation of the role of putative intrinsic determinants by changing their expression in identified stem cells and assessing its effect at the lineage level in an otherwise normal brain.</p><p>Here, we focus on two identified neuroblast lineages in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, LALv1 and ALad1, which develop in close spatial proximity to each other in the larval brain but become spatially segregated in the adult brain. While the ALad1 neuroblast generates olfactory projection interneurons that innervate the antennal lobe, the LALv1 neuroblast generates wide-field interneurons that innervate the central complex. We show that <italic>orthodenticle</italic> (<italic>otd</italic>), an embryonic patterning gene involved in specifying the anterior-most regions of the neuroectoderm and embryonic brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lichtneckert and Reichert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reichert and Bello, 2010</xref>), is expressed during development in the LALv1 neuroblast lineage but not in the ALad1 neuroblast lineage. Remarkably, loss of <italic>otd</italic> from the LALv1 neuroblast results in a complete transformation in the identity of the neurons that derive from this lineage. The <italic>otd</italic> null LALv1 neurons transform into antennal lobe projection interneurons similar to the ALad1 lineage, and this transformation includes a complete change in the neuroanatomy of the neurons, a change in their molecular properties as well as in their functional connectivity. This remarkably complete respecification of a neuroblast lineage upon the mutation of a single gene in the brain demonstrates that intrinsic determinants acting in the neuroblast during development specify the identity of its neural progeny and the macrocircuitry that these progeny establish. This large-scale modification of functional circuits in the brain by a single transcription factor in a single stem cell is unprecedented and reveals a surprising capacity for novel neural circuit formation in the developing brain, which may provide a paradigm for large-scale evolutionary modification of brain connectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development, morphogenesis, and differential expression of Otd in two identified central brain neuroblast lineages, LALv1 and ALad1</title><p>We focused our analysis on two identified neuroblast lineages referred to as LALv1 and ALad1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pereanu and Hartenstein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lovick et al., 2013</xref>) (see ‘Materials and methods’ for lineage nomenclature).

In these experiments, in which we used the <italic>OK371-Gal4</italic> and <italic>Per-Gal4</italic> driver lines to label the MARCM clones, we obtained a total of seven wild-type single cell clones and 11 <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> single cell clones. Although we have not dated the birth of these clones precisely (matched the time of clone generation), the wild-type single cell clones that we obtained in our experiments were very similar to those described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2009a</xref>). Six of these single cell wild-type clones consisted of neurons that innervated both the lateral accessory lobe as well as one of the noduli of the central complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and one clone only innervated the lateral accessory lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). All of the 11 <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> single cell clones we recovered also displayed a similar neuroanatomy. Their cell bodies were located ventral to the antennal lobe, their axons coursed through the loVM and LEp tracts and they all innervated the lateral accessory lobe and one of the noduli of the central complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). Thus, loss of <italic>otd</italic> function from the postmitotic neurons did not result in any gross defects in the neuroanatomy of these neurons. It is however possible, that there are fine-scale changes in the arborisation of these neurons within the lateral accessory lobe and the central complex that we were unable to identify. It is also possible that <italic>otd</italic> function is required in the GMC for the targeting of the postmitotic neurons (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, in our experiments, we never obtained two cell GMC clones in order to be able to address this possibility.</p><p>We then asked if <italic>otd</italic> might be required in the neuroblast of the LALv1 lineage for its proper development.

To investigate this, we first characterized the axon tract of the wild-type LALv1 lineage, which is readily identifiable in the adult brain based on Neuroglian immunolabelling patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pereanu et al., 2010</xref>). In wild-type brains, Neuroglian immunolabelling shows the loVM tract (cyan arrow, left hemisphere in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>) and the characteristic LEp tract of the LALv1 lineage, which projects around the antennal lobes and towards the central complex (cyan arrowhead, left hemisphere in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>).

For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, unique spatial information imparts heterogeneity to the neuroblast pool and then temporal cues acting in the neuroblasts generate further diversity. In this way diverse neuronal subtypes are produced by the neuroblast lineages, which consequently create the diverse functional macrocircuitry of the brain. In addition, the neuroblasts in the central brain of <italic>Drosophila</italic> are characterized by the expression of a specific combination of cell intrinsic determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Urbach and Technau, 2003a</xref>) that are thought to act in the specification of unique neuroblast identity and hence control lineage-specific neuronal cell fate.</p><p>In this study, we show that such intrinsic determinants present in the neuroblast are essential for the proper specification of the entire lineage that derives from the neuroblast. Our data demonstrate that a remarkable rewiring of the functional macrocircuitry of the brain occurs due to the manipulation of one intrinsic factor, <italic>otd</italic>, acting in an identified neuroblast during development. This transformation affects molecular properties, anatomical projection patterns (dendritic and axonal), and functional inputs in all of the neurons in the lineage (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>) such that a central complex lineage is transformed into a functional olfactory projection neuron lineage.

The observation that the neuroblasts of the central complex and antennal lobe lineages develop in such close spatial proximity to each other during early development suggests that these two neuroblasts may experience similar spatial cues as they develop on the neuroectoderm. If this is the case, then by manipulating a single differentially expressed factor, <italic>otd</italic>, we might have been able to uncover the underlying similarity in the intrinsic spatial code between the two neuroblast lineages. Importantly, this neuroblast-specific transformation of lineage identity resulted in an alteration of the brain's circuitry such that an entire neuroanatomical unit of projection to the central complex was lacking while a novel and functional ectopic unit of projection was added to the antennal lobe.</p><p>Implicit in these findings are the notions of ‘coded’ and ‘soft’ properties of circuit assembly. On the one hand, the neuroanatomical and molecular transformation described above demonstrates that circuitry in the brain is ‘hard-wired’ or ‘coded’ by the spatially encoded intrinsic factors—the presence or absence of <italic>otd</italic> from the central complex neuroblast determines the identity of the resultant neurons. On the other hand, the resulting functional transformation suggests that circuit assembly involves substantial ‘soft-wiring’—the olfactory sensory neurons and interneurons indigenous to the antennal lobe are able to make functional connections with the extraneous transformed <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> LALv1 neurons, which they are normally not ‘hard-wired’ to connect with. Thus, while genetically encoded properties might ‘lock’ lineages into particular circuit states (central complex or antennal lobe) it is their ‘soft’ properties (developmental plasticity) that allow circuits to functionally incorporate changes as dramatic as extraneous neurons. As both these wiring strategies operate simultaneously in the brain, it bestows upon the brain the huge potential of evolvability of functional circuits.</p><p>Many interesting questions emerge as a result of our findings. How does the developmental plasticity of a functional circuit support these large-scale rearrangements? Do developing circuits acquire a propensity for exuberant connectivities, or do they try and maintain a homeostasis in their connections and therefore make compensatory changes in the number of synapses with their normal partners? It has been shown in some cases that neuronal activity can mediate such ‘soft’ properties of synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tripodi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Singh et al., 2010</xref>). It will be interesting to test if this is also the case for the transformed neurons and the olfactory circuit. Finally, do all parts of the brain display such striking developmental plasticity such that they can be remodelled to this extent and incorporate extraneous neurons into existing circuitry?</p><p>The ability to change the functional macrocircuitry of the brain through changes in the expression of a single transcription factor in a single neuroblast lineage may provide a simple paradigm for large-scale modification of brain connectivity during evolution. The <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>transformed LALv1 lineage functionally integrates into the antennal lobe circuitry and participates in olfactory information processing. This suggests that a functional rewiring of the olfactory circuitry can occur due to the addition of an entire neuroblast lineage to the normal olfactory circuit. In more general terms, this type of lineage-specific rewiring might fuel the evolutionary modification of neural circuitry in the brain. It provides an elegant and simple solution to the evolution of complex circuitry in that a ‘microevolutionary’ molecular change (changing the expression of one gene in one cell) can have ‘macroevolutionary’ consequences on the brain's circuitry (changing an entire macrocircuit or an information processing module). This simple strategy suggests that large-scale changes in the brain's wiring do not need to come about through many minor, sequentially accumulating changes at the cellular level. Instead, large-scale wiring changes can occur in response to remarkably simple changes in gene expression in single cells. In this context, our data may have provided evidence for the mechanistic ease with which circuitry in the brain can evolve.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Lineage nomenclature</title><p>The brain lineages have been named by various groups in the past.

The antennal nerves were cut from the base of the antennae. The brain preparation was then pinned down on a Sylgard-coated petri dish with AHL saline containing 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The antennal nerve was stimulated electrically with a glass suction electrode, at 1 ms in duration, 10 V in amplitude and 100 Hz in frequency (S48 Grass stimulator).

The agarose gel was removed from the antennae and a piece of Kimwipes was used to dry the antennae. A glass coverslip was placed on top of the brain preparation for imaging. Odour delivery was controlled by solenoid valves described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Root et al., 2008</xref>). Odour vapour was obtained by placing a filter paper containing 10 μl of an odorant in a 100-ml bottle. Mixing an air stream with an odour stream at different flow ratios was used to deliver odorants at a specific concentration. Isoamyl acetate and ethyl butyrate were delivered at 1% (odorant at 10 ml/min and air at 990 ml/min), whereas 3-heptanol and 3-octanol were delivered at 2.5% saturated vapor pressure. Each odorant was applied for a duration of 2 s. Images were acquired for 20 s at a rate of 4 frames/s and a resolution of 128 × 128 pixels. At the end of each experiment, an image stack was collected at a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels for glomerulus identification. The data were analyzed and plotted using Igor Pro 6.2 (Wavemetrics). The peak response of stimulation (ΔF/F) was shown as mean ± S.E.M.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We dedicate this work to the memory of our late friend and colleague Veronica Rodrigues (1953–2010).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of a genetic manipulation, consisting in removing or ectopically expressing the gene orthodenticle (otd), which resulted in the fate transformation of a neural lineage in the Drosophila brain. The authors show convincingly that manipulating otd at the stage of the stem cell (neuroblast) determines the fate of the lineage; loss of otd in a lineage that normally innervates the central complex (LALv1) results in the transformation of its neurons into a lineage that normally develops at a close by position, associated with the antennal lobe). The data are clearly presented and documented. The findings are of great significance for the field. They underline the early global function of transcription factors in fate specification. They also shed light on the interplay between intrinsic (“hard wired”) factors and plasticity; for example, otd-mutant axons adopting the antennal projection fate are able to branch and properly innervate the antennal lobe, even though they start out at a different location (the location of the LALv1 lineage).</p><p>Substantial concerns:</p><p>1) The interpretations depend on the ability to recognize the same lineage after it has been profoundly transformed.

We have now reorganized the manuscript so as to first mention the different Gal4 drivers used (see paragraph 4 under the sub heading, ‘Development, morphogenesis and differential expression of Otd in two identified central brain neuroblast lineages, LALv1 and ALad1’). We have also taken care to mention the Gal4 drivers used for each of the experiments when we describe them.

The authors should have recovered many ALv1 clones in their experiments. It is important to know how they distinguished ALv1 clones from the transformed LALv1</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this potential complication. The GH146 driver labels only about 6-10 cells of the ALv1 lineage. These neurons are indeed antennal lobe projection interneurons, however, their neuroanatomy is very different from the <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> LALv1 lineage. The entry point of the axons of these two lineages into the antennal lobe is diametrically opposite to each other; while the <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> LALv1 lineage enters the lobe medially, ALv1 (as well as the <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> ALv1) enters it laterally (see asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 1A,B</xref>). Most strikingly, their axons exit the lobe towards the protocerebrum using different tracts; while the <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> LALv1 lineage uses the medial antennal lobe tract, the ALv1 (as well as the <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> ALv1) use the mediolateral antennal lobe tract (see arrow in Author response 1A,B). Both these tracts are visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 A-C</xref>. Finally, while the <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> LALv1 lineage first innervates the calyx of the mushroom body and then the lateral horn, the GH146-labelled neurons of ALv1 (as well as the <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> ALv1) largely innervate only the lateral horn (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 1A,B</xref>). We have brought out these points in the main text as well. Please see paragraph 3 under the subheading, <italic>‘</italic>Determining the lineage identity of the transformed neurons’ (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><p>The ALv1 lineage does not express Otd and, as expected, we do not see any gross defects in any of the <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> ALv1 clones we have recovered (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 1</xref>). Moreover, although we have recovered the <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> LALv1 lineage along with other neuroblast clones of the antennal lobe including the ALv1 lineage, we frequently recover it with no other clones in the brain. In these clones, we observe no splitting of the cell cluster and the mutant lineage never uses the mediolateral antennal lobe tract.</p><p>Given these data we conclude that the <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> LALv1 lineage and the <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> ALv1 lineage have two distinct clonal origins (are two distinct neuroblast lineages) and are not a result of splitting of the <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> LALv1 lineage.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>WT (A) and <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> (B) ALv1 lineage.

We have reorganized the text and added an entire new results section under the sub heading, ‘Determining the lineage identity of the transformed neurons’ in which we systematically list out three different ways by which it is possible to infer correspondence between the LALv1 and the transformed LALv1 neurons. 1) The appearance of an extra antennal lobe lineage (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). 2) The loss of the LEp tract (we have shown the confocal sections instead of the 3D reconstruction; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). 3) The use of a molecular marker, Acj6 that allows the unambiguous identification of the LALv1 lineage in both the WT and mutant conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>We have also attempted to trace the <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> LALv1 lineage into the larval brain. In these experiments we recovered <italic>GH146-Gal4</italic> labelled <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> LALv1 clones, however these clones were largely indistinguishable from the ALad1 lineage (except for the loss of Otd immunolabelling corresponding to the larval LALv1 lineage). This is because in the larval brain, the cell bodies of LALv1 and ALad1 lie closely apposed to each other and when the LALv1 lineage is transformed, they also share similar trajectories. However, in a rare clone, the <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> LALv1 lineage retained a few projections into the loVM tract, allowing us to unambiguously identify it as the LALv1 lineage. In this brain preparation we observed that the <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> LALv1 lineage sent a majority of its projections via the medial antennal lobe tract (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Author response image 2</xref>), confirming that the <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> LALv1 lineage indeed transforms to an ALad1 neuroblast lineage like fate.<fig id="fig14" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>Note the larval <italic>otd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> LALv1 lineage on the right hemisphere, which shows a loss of Otd immunolabelling in B.
