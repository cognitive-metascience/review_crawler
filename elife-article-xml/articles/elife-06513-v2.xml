developmental changes in brain-state dynamics during general anesthesia. We used multi-electrode EEG, analyzed with multitaper spectral methods and video recording of body movement to characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity in 36 infants 0–6 months old when awake, and during maintenance of and emergence from sevoflurane general anesthesia. During maintenance: (1) slow-delta oscillations were present in all ages; (2) theta and alpha oscillations emerged around 4 months; (3) unlike adults, all infants lacked frontal alpha predominance and coherence. Alpha power was greatest during maintenance, compared to awake and emergence in infants at 4–6 months. During emergence, theta and alpha power decreased with decreasing sevoflurane concentration in infants at 4–6 months. These EEG dynamic differences are likely due to developmental factors including regional differences in synaptogenesis, glucose metabolism, and myelination across the cortex. We demonstrate the need to apply age-adjusted analytic approaches to develop neurophysiologic-based strategies for pediatric anesthetic state monitoring.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06513.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06513.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06513.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every year about 200,000 infants in the United States are given general anesthesia during their first year of life. Though anesthesia is essential to control pain during surgery and other medical procedures on infants, it involves some risks. There are some controversial studies suggesting that repeated anesthetics early in life may impact how the brain develops, but other studies have been reassuring and found no such effects. To reduce the risks, doctors carefully monitor infants' blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and oxygen levels while they are receiving anesthesia.</p><p>Electroencephalograms (EEGs) have proven to be a useful tool for monitoring the brain activity of adults undergoing anesthesia, but studies have found EEG-based monitoring to be unreliable in infants under anesthesia. A more reliable method of monitoring the brains of infants during anesthesia is needed. Anesthesiologists nevertheless need to better understand how the infant's brain works under general anesthesia, and novel EEG techniques hold promise for monitoring brain well-being and for adjusting anesthetic dosing in infants of different ages.</p><p>Differences in the way infants' brains respond to anesthesia may explain why current EEG-based monitoring methods developed for adults don't work as well in infants as in adults. Now, Cornelissen, Kim et al. have used a new EEG-based approach to demonstrate that as infants' brains develop, their responses to anesthesia change. The experiments involved 36 infants aged up to six months old who were going through routine surgical procedures. The brain activity of the infants was recorded using EEG—via electrodes placed on their scalps—when they were awake, during anesthesia, and as they recovered afterwards. The infants were videoed at the same time. Comparing the video with the EEG recordings allowed the brain activity of the infants to be matched up with their state of consciousness.</p><p>Cornelissen, Kim et al. detected slow waves of brain activity across the entire scalp of infants who are under six months old and under anesthesia. Infants who are older than about four months old also display some faster brain waves, which decreased in power as the infants emerged from anesthesia. However, none of the infants has the same pattern seen in adults—where faster waves appear near the front of the brain. These findings may help scientists develop more reliable ways to monitor infants' brains during anesthesia.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06513.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06513.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>anesthesia</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>EEG</kwd><kwd>sevoflurane</kwd><kwd>infant</kwd><kwd>alpha</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006824</institution-id><institution>Sara Page Mayo Endowment for Pediatric Pain Research and Treatment</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cornelissen</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Berde</surname><given-names>Charles B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006823</institution-id><institution>Boston Children's Hospital (BCH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cornelissen</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Berde</surname><given-names>Charles B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM104948; DP2-OD006454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Seong-Eun</given-names></name><name><surname>Purdon</surname><given-names>Patrick L</given-names></name><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Emery N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005294</institution-id><institution>Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Purdon</surname><given-names>Patrick L</given-names></name><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Emery N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Alpha EEG oscillations emerge at 4 months of age during sevoflurane general anesthesia, and unlike in adults, have a widespread spatial distribution that likely reflects differences in brain development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the United States, 200,000 children a year receive general anesthesia during the first year of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rabbitts et al., 2010</xref>). Anesthetics have profound effects on all physiological systems. As a consequence, since the mid-1980s, anesthesia caregivers have been required to monitor blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and oxygen saturation along with anesthetic gas and oxygen delivery for all patients receiving general anesthesia. The states of general anesthesia and sedation are produced by the anesthetics acting in the brain and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ching and Brown, 2014</xref>). However, brain monitoring using electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived indices is used to only a limited extent in adults, rarely in children, and essentially not at all in infants. These EEG-derived indices, which been developed in adults can give inaccurate indications of anesthetic states in infants and younger children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davidson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Constant and Sabourdin, 2012</xref>). The lack of principled strategies for monitoring the brains of infants and children receiving anesthesia care is especially troubling in view of growing concern about anesthetic toxicity to the developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McCann and Soriano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jevtovic-Todorovic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A plausible inference to be drawn from the few available EEG studies of children under general anesthesia is that the inaccuracy of EEG-derived indices in pediatric practice is likely due to differences between children and adults in their brain responses to the anesthetics. A consensus has not been achieved on what these differences are because the available pediatric investigations have studied a limited set of anesthetics and frequently used EEG montages with few electrodes; different analysis methods have been used in different studies; multi-electrode recordings available in children have not been analyzed in function of age; and dose-titration experiments commonly conducted in adults cannot for ethical reasons be conducted in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davidson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McKeever et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sury et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>For adults, characterizing the anesthetic response of the brain under general anesthesia and sedation is an active research field in which EEG, intracranial recordings, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography are being used to study spatio-temporal changes in brain activity for different anesthetics and for different doses of the same anesthetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feshchenko et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boveroux et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breshears et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mhuircheartaigh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cimenser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martuzzi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lewis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ní Mhuircheartaigh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Purdon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akeju et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vizuete et al., 2014</xref>). For example, a significant EEG pattern observed in adults under propofol general anesthesia and anesthesia maintained by an ether-derived anesthetic is incoherent slow oscillations across the entire head and strongly coherent alpha oscillations across only the front of the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Purdon et al., 2013</xref>). Modeling studies suggest that the alpha oscillations are thalamo-cortical in origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vijayan et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, it is now appreciated that different anesthetics have different EEG signatures that are readily visible in the unprocessed EEG and its spectrogram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Purdon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akeju et al., 2014b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2014c</xref>). These EEG signatures can be related to the altered arousal states the anesthetics produce and to the mechanisms through which the drugs are believed to act at specific receptors in specific brain circuits.</p><p>These neurophysiological studies in adults have led to the idea of using the unprocessed EEG and its spectrogram as an alternative to using EEG-derived indices to monitor the brain states of adults receiving general anesthesia or sedation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Use of the unprocessed EEG and its spectrogram to develop a neurophysiological-based paradigm tailored to pediatric practices for monitoring anesthetic state requires studying in children the spatio-temporal dynamics of brain responses to anesthetics. To begin to address this key knowledge gap, we used multi-electrode EEG recordings to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of brain activity in infants 0–6 months of age when awake, and during maintenance of and emergence from sevoflurane general anesthesia administered for routine surgical care.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Continuous multichannel EEG recordings were collected during the awake state, Maintenance Of a Surgical State of Anesthesia (MOSSA), and emergence from sevoflurane general anesthesia in 36 infants aged 0–6 months postnatal age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Davidson and colleagues monitored 8 leads of EEG in 17 infants, 0–6 months of age, who received either sevoflurane or propofol general anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davidson et al., 2008</xref>). These infants were part of a study cohort that ranged in age from 9 days to 12 years. While total spectral power—limited to 2–20 Hz—did not differ between the anesthetized state and emergence, the EEG traces of the infants during emergence showed bursts of electrical activity interspersed with periods of low-amplitude activity. In contrast, the 21 children aged 2–10 years showed a significant increase in SEF90 and a significant decrease in total frontal EEG power during emergence. Lo and colleagues studied emergence by monitoring 128 leads of EEG in children 22 days to 3.6 years who received either sevoflurane or isoflurane anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lo et al., 2009</xref>). These investigators reported differences between the spatial EEG patterns of the two agents.

They analyzed changes in 90% spectral edge frequency (SEF90), burst suppression ratio (BSR), relative beta ratio (RBR), and approximate entropy (ApEn) to assess changes in brain activity during emergence. They found that infants less than 6 months had little to no change in EEG parameters during emergence, whereas the infants 6 months and older showed the greatest changes in the EEG parameters, which were an increase in the SEF90, decrease in the BSR, increase in the RBR, and decrease in ApEn. The infants in the range of 3–5 month old marked the transition between no EEG changes on emergence to highly visible changes on emergence. Sury and colleagues studied 20 infants at 1 week to 10 months of age during emergence from sevoflurane general anesthesia using a 4-lead EEG montage to analyze spectral power between 1 and 28 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sury et al., 2014</xref>).

We report for the first time detailed spatio-temporal analyses of infant 33-lead EEGs with Laplacian referencing using spectra (analyzed from 0.1–30 Hz), spectrograms, coherograms, and global coherence computed by multitaper spectral analysis methods. These methods, which are known to have several important optimality properties, have been used successfully to characterize the EEG dynamics of adults receiving general anesthesia and sedation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cimenser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ní Mhuircheartaigh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Purdon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akeju et al., 2014b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2014c</xref>).

Studies of propofol have shown that these alpha oscillations are strongly coherent across the front of the head during unconsciousness, whereas the slow oscillations are not coherent anywhere across the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lewis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Purdon et al., 2013</xref>). With return of consciousness, the frontal alpha power disappears, and posterior alpha reappears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Purdon et al., 2013</xref>). Because we did not record EEG in the infants continuously and then administer sevoflurane in a gradual escalating and a gradual deescalating manner, our study could not assess anteriorization. During MOSSA, we see a small, but significant, increase in frontal alpha power when compared to occipital power in infants 4–6 months, which suggests this feature of anesthetic-induced consciousness emerges in early life. Nevertheless, our findings demonstrate that the spatio-temporal dynamics of the anesthetized states of 0- to 3-month-old and 4- to 6-month-old infants differ appreciably from each other and from those of adults.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanisms for alpha, slow, and delta oscillations</title><p>Recent modeling studies of propofol offer insights into the possible origins of these differences. These studies suggest that the frontal EEG alpha oscillations likely represent oscillatory activity between the cortex and thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ching et al., 2010</xref>). Other modeling work suggests that anteriorization is due to different effects of propofol on thalamic nuclei that project to occipital areas compared to thalamic nuclei that project to areas of the pre-frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vijayan et al., 2013</xref>). Propofol disrupts the normal, depolarized alpha oscillations in posterior-projecting thalamic nuclei whereas it induces, hyperpolarized alpha oscillations in frontal-projecting thalamic nuclei. The differential effect appears to be due primarily to propofol's inhibition of subset of posterior-projecting neurons with hyperpolarizing activating I<sub>h</sub> currents that typically produce alpha oscillations at resting membrane voltages above 60 millivolts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vijayan et al., 2013</xref>). The slow and delta oscillations during general anesthesia are consistent with anesthetic-induced decreases in major excitatory brainstem inputs to the cortex. GABAergic anesthetic likely produce these effects by acting at the GABAergic synapses arising from inhibitory neurons in the pre-optic area of the hypothalamus that project onto each of the major arousal nuclei in the midbrain and upper pons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2011</xref>). Both the alpha, slow and delta oscillations likely reflect disruption of thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical processing required to maintain consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ching et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Purdon et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The model predictions for the frontal predominance of alpha oscillations await experimental verification. However, the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology underlying the putative mechanism for alpha oscillations suggest that the thalamocortical connections required to produce the alpha oscillations are absent in infants 0–3 months old yet, present in infants 4–6 months old. The putative mechanism for frontal predominance of alpha power suggests that the differential thalamic connectivity required to produce this phenomenon is not present in infants 6 months of age or younger.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Brain development as a source of changes in EEG dynamics with age</title><p>Developmental changes in the brain are the obvious mechanisms to explain the changes in EEG dynamics that occur with age. Gross brain development occurs in a caudal to rostral direction, with myelination of the medulla, pons, and thalamus starting within the first few postnatal weeks and frontal cortex myelination starting around postnatal months 3–4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brody et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kinney et al., 1988</xref>). In addition, there is significant synaptogenesis, neuronal differentiation, and pruning, along with changes in GABAergic neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huttenlocher and Dabholkar, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hensch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tau and Peterson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dehorter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Catts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Semple et al., 2013</xref>). Distinct regional differences in the rate of synaptogenesis, glucose metabolism, and myelination across the cortex occur between subcortical and cortical regions, and between different regions of the cortex during the first 12 postnatal months in human infants. For example, in the visual cortex, there is a rapid burst of synapse formation between 3 and 4 months, and the maximum density is reached between 8 and 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huttenlocher et al., 1982</xref>). Synaptogenesis starts at the same time in the pre-frontal cortex, but the density of synapses increases much more slowly and does not peak until after the first 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson, 2001</xref>). Additionally, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies show that between 0 and 3 months postnatal age, glucose uptake is highest in the occipital parietal, and temporal cortices; and by 6–8 months, glucose uptake extends to the frontal cortex appearing with higher cortical function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chugani and Phelps, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chugani et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kinnala et al., 1996</xref>). A key role in brain development is played by the subplate neurons, the first neurons generated in the cerebral cortex, which guide formation of thalamocortical connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kanold and Luhmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kostović and Judas, 2010</xref>). The subplate cells form the first functional connections and are a must for relaying early oscillatory activity in the developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kanold and Luhmann, 2010</xref>). To the extent that the alpha oscillations in the anesthetized brain are postulated to be produced by thalamocortical circuits, the appearance of the alpha oscillations at 4 months of age may suggest that an important developmental milestone has been reached in the processes guided by the subplate neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Study limitations and constraints</title><p>The conduct of research in children carries with it all the ethical obligations of adult research along with the additional obligation of not exposing children to risks beyond those associated with their routine medical care. As a consequence, observational studies of children receiving general anesthesia or sedation as part of routine diagnostic or therapeutic care are and will continue to be the principal approach to studying the neurophysiology of general anesthesia in children. It is crucial to plan carefully these studies and their subsequent analyses in order to maximize the information learned on this important topic. Anesthetic management was only standardized in our study to the extent that the staff at Boston Children's Hospital uses similar practices. The specific anesthetic management in each case was carried out by the attending anesthesiologist. Given the strength of the findings we report, a more systematic protocol would likely provide more evidence for our findings.</p><p>Because administration of general anesthesia is a high-risk human study, dose-titration protocols that are common in adults for studying controlled induction and emergence cannot be conducted in children. Therefore, we conducted our dose–response analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>), like those reported in previous studies, by observing changes in end-tidal sevoflurane concentration during emergence instead of by recording EEG while systematically changing the anesthetic dose during induction. In place of formal behavioral assessments of consciousness, which would not be feasible in children, we used movement recorded on video as an approximate behavioral marker of emergence from general anesthesia. The advantage of using body movement as a measure of emergence is that it is well-defined in children, and video recordings of body movement can be time-locked to the EEG recording for quantitative analysis. Relating onset of emergence to changes in respiration and heart rate, as well as blood pressure, also reflect effects of anesthesia but in a more complex manner being dependent on drug administration and clinical state of the patient. Similar to what we observed in adults, we found concentration- and behavior-dependent reductions in alpha and theta power during emergence in 4- to 6-month-old infants. Unlike in adults, we did not observe any relationship between slow/delta power and anesthetic concentration or behavior. The differences in slow/delta oscillation dynamics between these infants and adults may be attributable to a number of factors, including mechanistic differences the two groups, low signal-to-noise in the slow/delta band due to patient movement, and the possibility that the infants remained sedated or unconscious despite recovering movement immediately following surgery. Our comparisons between the awake state, MOSSA and emergence indicate that state-specific EEG spectral properties begin to emerge at 4–6 months of age. They demonstrate the challenges faced when using EEG measures to evaluate anesthetic depth in younger infants (0–3 months). Our findings can be strengthened by studying sevoflurane general anesthesia in children across the entire pediatric age spectrum, and by conducting similar studies of other the anesthetics, for example, propofol, dexmedetomidine, and isoflurane, commonly used in children.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Clinical implications and future directions</title><p>In summary, we have shown that infants 0–6 months of age have markedly different EEG patterns from each other and from adults under general anesthesia. These differences are likely due to differences in structural and functional aspects of cortico-cortical and thalamocortical connectivity, and help explain why EEG-based indices provide inaccurate measures of anesthetic states in children, especially during the first three months of life. We introduced the use of multitaper spectral methods in the analysis of pediatric EEG recordings to facilitate comparisons with adult analyses. We provide spectrograms to show how these brain dynamics appear on available EEG monitors.</p><p>The design of strategies to track the brain states of children receiving general anesthesia and sedation has not received the attention that this topic has received in adults. Systems neuroscience research that takes account of brain development will be required to accurately define anesthetic states for the entire pediatric age spectrum and to devise principled neurophysiological-based strategies for anesthetic dosing in older infants (&gt;3 months) and children. Moreover, until the question of whether anesthetics are toxic to the developing brain is answered, design of neurophysiological-based definitions of anesthetic states and design of neurophysiological-based brain monitoring strategies offer the most prudent approaches to mitigating anesthetic risk in this vulnerable population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design</title><p>The objective of this observational study was to evaluate the effect of postnatal age on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during sevoflurane general anesthesia in infants 0–6 months old.

The coherence between channel i and j is given by<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> is the cross-spectrum of i, jth electrode and <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the spectrum of ith electrode at frequency <italic>f</italic> and time <italic>t</italic>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Jody Culham, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Main revisions needed:</p><p>All three reviewers found the study interesting and important; however, there are several issues that must be addressed in a revision. The key changes required are summarized in the numbered points below. In addition specific comments from Reviewer #2 are also appended to provide additional detail.</p><p>1) One expert reviewer brought up a number of important concerns about the brain states of infants during different stages. Specifically, the revision should address the validity of using movement as a proxy for emergence, the possibility of sleep during emergence, and the lack of data from the pre-anesthesia states. See Reviewer #2's detailed points below.</p><p>2) The possibility that anesthetic variances could explain the data should be explicitly discussed. This includes explicit statistics to determine whether the weights and durations of anesthesia in the two age groups differed significantly. See Reviewer #2's detailed points below.</p><p>3) More statistical comparisons of the putative differences are needed. See Reviewer #2's detailed points below.</p><p>4) One reviewer suggests one area that can be addressed in the Discussion is the role, if any, of the developmental change in the grey/white matter ratios that have been documented in infant MRI studies. This may provide a clinically measurable structural basis for the neurophysiological changes observed with sevoflurane anesthesia in this report.</p><p>5) The authors should reconsider the framing of the conclusions of the paper, although there were some conflicting views about this.</p><p>One main suggestion, which came up during the initial manuscript consultation amongst <italic>eLife</italic> editors was the need to make it clearer what the relevance/implications of the results are not just for clinical practice but for understanding brain development. <italic>eLife</italic> is a biological sciences journal so we are looking for papers that advance our understanding of the underlying biology. There is some interesting discussion about possible reasons for the differential effects of anesthesia in younger infants, older infants and adults. However, this is somewhat underplayed in the manuscript as it stands. For example, the Abstract says, “these differences in EEG dynamics are likely due to brain development”, but doesn't unpack why these are interesting.</p><p>That said, given some of the concerns raised by reviewers, we do not want to push you to draw stronger conclusions than the data warrant, particularly if some of the differences may relate to potential confounds such as anesthesia levels. One reviewer also wonders if the conclusions in the final sentence of the Abstract are too strong. See Reviewer #2's detailed points below (regarding the Abstract).</p><p><italic>Detailed comments from Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>This is a really interesting study that is challenging to perform and timely in terms of the results generated and their relevance. I am generally enthusiastic about this paper, but more work is required to be convinced by the authors' main interpretation and explanation of their results. Namely, that the developing brain is the most likely explanation for their convincing and well analysed EEG results showing clear differences during surgical anaesthesia between 0-3 and 4-6 month old babies. I describe below in more detail this issue alongside minor other concerns.</p><p>1) Discussion, first paragraph. Please expand on the discussion of the flaws in using only this behavioural measure (see more below). Is it possible to relate any other measure (respiration/heart rate change) to these crude movement behavioural measures so that we can be more sure that the movement as measured relates to something that additional suggests true emergence/awake-like state (see below for more on this and complexity of sleep stages).</p><p>2) In the second paragraph of the subsection headed “Studies of EEG dynamics of infant brain under general anesthesia”. Is this finding better explained by &lt;3 month-old babies being more likely to enter a sleep stage during emergence? The authors admit this is possible later in the manuscript. This confound needs more discussion and to be offered as a viable additional explanation perhaps.</p><p>3) In the subsection headed “Studies of EEG dynamics in adults under general anesthesia”. The lack of pre-anaesthetised baseline data is key. While understandably a complex environment, presumably the electrodes were already in place and so I am unclear why these data were not taken prior to induction of anaesthesia? How can you relate movement to ‘awake’ EEG if you don't know what genuine awake EEG looks like in these different age groups? These data are needed surely to make sense of anaesthetised states—possibly it's the relative EEG changes from fully awake to anaesthetised in each baby that are as relevant as the between ages changes during ‘assumed anaesthetic dose/state’?</p><p>4) In the subsection headed “Anesthetic Management”. Where the methods are described we begin to unravel some of the major confounds here. These need to be brought earlier into the Introduction and Results and explanation of findings. They are buried here. Please include the anaesthetic data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and provide statistics. Clearly there are many differences here—understandable, as routine clinical care was performed and this is an opportunistic uncontrolled study, but as such the authors must alert the readership to the likelihood that anaesthetic variances might largely explain their data. As written, this information is not highlighted or discussed and the reader is very strongly led to believe this is all due to the very interesting developmental changes. I don't doubt that there is a profound developmental influence, but we need to be convinced these other factors are not relevant. Firstly, propofol was used for some babies but not others. We do not know whether this was evenly distributed between the two age groups or not. Please detail. There are differences in duration and amount of anaesthetic used between age groups, but again we're not told whether this was significantly different for the two age groups. These factors alone will confound the EEG signals; therefore, please confirm whether they are significantly different or not—hopefully not and then we can be more convinced by their developmental explanation.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. While frontal-occipital power is not different there does appear to be more power in the slow waves in the temporal regions; is this significant?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Again, temporal lobes ‘look’ different but we're not given any statistical comparisons. I wonder whether the likely developing insula cortex within the temporal lobes might be relevant here?</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. Can we segregate body movements into those with eyes open/closed or whether concomitant with being obviously awake, etc? No information is given about this crude measure, its variance and therefore whether there were systematic differences in the age groups. For example, can we eliminate the question regarding whether babies were still predominately asleep in 0-3 month group even with body movements compared to the 4-6 month olds? Also, what does the body movement do to the quality of EEG recordings and were any body movements of the head? More detail is needed considering this was the single behavioural anchor used to determine emergence and to time-lock the EEG analysis to.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. We need statistics here. There is a large weight difference and differences in length of anaesthesia, which means the brains of younger babies were loaded with more anaesthetic and this will impact emergence. Was this a significant difference? More details needed about the reasons for surgery—any brain/spinal cord related? Please also include from Methods into this table the dose/duration details regarding all anaesthetic agents used with statistics.</p><p>9) Abstract: I don't think you can make such a strong conclusion at this stage and based upon your conclusion. You might live to regret stating such a limiting statement regarding the current likelihood that EEG indices could be used. Arguably they might provide excellent measures once you know (and can factor in) the neurophysiological state of brain from which they derive. Please alter the final sentence.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06513.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) One expert reviewer brought up a number of important concerns about the brain states of infants during different stages.

Postmortem studies show that significant myelination occurs postnatally and proceeds in a posterior-to-anterior fashion. Myelination begins in the pons and cerebellar peduncles, and by 3 months has extended to the optic radiation and splenium of the corpus callosum. At around 8-12 months of age, the white matter associated with the frontal parietal and occipital lobes becomes apparent. The emergence of frontal alpha activity at around 3 to 4 months postnatal ages likely parallels the regional changes in cortico-cortical and thalamocortical maturation. Please see the subsection “Brain development as a source of changes in EEG dynamics with age” in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>5) The authors should reconsider the framing of the conclusions of the paper, although there were some conflicting views about this</italic>.</p><p><italic>One main suggestion, which came up during the initial manuscript consultation amongst</italic> eLife <italic>editors was the need to make it clearer what the relevance/implications of the results are not just for clinical practice but for understanding brain development.</italic> eLife <italic>is a biological sciences journal so we are looking for papers that advance our understanding of the underlying biology.

In studies of adult volunteers, response to verbal command is often used; this is not feasible for infants. The advantage of using gross movement as a measure of emergence is that it is well-defined in infants and children (e.g. Bould et al., 2011 Pediatric Anesthesia; McCann et al., 2002; Pediatric Anesthesia; Davidson et al., 2001 Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia). Onset of movement relates to the anesthetic state, namely the ability of general anesthetics to suppress movement. Respiration, heart rate and blood pressure also reflect effects of anesthesia but in a more complex and derivative manner. Each of these parameters can be influenced by anesthetic state, but also can be influenced by a number of factors summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Author response table 1</xref> below.

We show that mean HR over 1 min period immediately prior to first visible body movement was 145 bpm (SD: 23) and significantly increased during first body movement [Mean HR: 150 bpm (SD: 25.3); p=0.0018, paired Student’s t-test; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Author response table 2</xref>]. Non-invasive blood pressure was taken every 5mins using an automated pressure cuff. The low sampling rate meant that blood pressure measurements were taken before and after first body movement within time fame of +/- 5 mins. Therefore, not all subjects had a blood pressure sample taken at both 1 min prior to- and at 1 min after first visible body movement; this parameter could not be included in the analysis.</p><p>We have edited the Discussion section “Study Limitations and Constraints” to include the following: “In place of formal behavioral assessments of consciousness, which would not be feasible in children […] also reflect effects of anesthesia but in a more complex manner being dependent on drug administration and clinical state of the patient. ”</p><p><italic>2) In the second paragraph of the subsection headed “Studies of EEG dynamics of infant brain under general anesthesia”. Is this finding better explained by &lt;3 month-old babies being more likely to enter a sleep stage during emergence? The authors admit this is possible later in the manuscript. This confound needs more discussion and to be offered as a viable additional explanation perhaps</italic>.</p><p>We used onset of behavioral movement as a surrogate marker for onset of emergence, and this has been used with other behavioral measures such as crying (or attempting to cry), gagging on an endotracheal tube, eye opening and looking around to describe awakening in neonates and infants (Bould et al., 2011 Pediatric Anesthesia). All infants included in the emergence analysis required extubation. The standard anesthetic practice to extubate uses one of two ways: (1) “Awake with movement”, meaning with body movement, coughing, and return of some reflex activity, or (2) “Deep”, meaning with spontaneous breathing, but in a deeper plane of anesthesia, specifically without coughing. For &gt;90% of infant anesthetics at Boston Children’s Hospital, awake extubation is preferred, although anesthesiologists differ in the degree of responsiveness required prior to extubation. It is plausible that some infants may remain sedated or unconscious despite recovering movement immediately following surgery. Nevertheless, our comparisons of the EEG properties between arousal states indicate striking similarities between the awake state and emergence in infants 0 to 3 months (as well as between the awake state and MOSSA). The implications of these findings demonstrate the challenges faced when using surface EEG measures to evaluate anesthetic depth in very young infants.</p><p><italic>3) In the subsection headed “Studies of EEG dynamics in adults under general anesthesia”. The lack of pre-anaesthetised baseline data is key. While understandably a complex environment, presumably the electrodes were already in place and so I am unclear why these data were not taken prior to induction of anaesthesia? How can you relate movement to ‘awake’ EEG if you don't know what genuine awake EEG looks like in these different age groups? These data are needed surely to make sense of anaesthetised states—possibly it's the relative EEG changes from fully awake to anaesthetised in each baby that are as relevant as the between ages changes during ‘assumed anaesthetic dose/state’</italic>?</p><p>Collecting “awake pre-anesthesia” EEG data from infants is technically and logistically very challenging. Ideal recording conditions require the infant to be relaxed i.e. well fed, lying still, and in a cot. These conditions help avoid EEG signal contamination from muscle and movement, and external electrical noise. Most infants in the preoperative holding area were hungry (having abstained from feeding at least 4-6 hours prior to surgery per anesthesiologist requirement for an “empty stomach” to reduce the risk of tracheal aspiration of gastric contents). They were easily agitated and consequently episodically physically active during the Awake EEG recordings. Those infants who required comforting were often held in a parent’s arms; this also generated external electrical noise.</p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we now provide awake- state data analysis in the revised report. For the reasons listed above, we made extensive effort to identify good artifact-free preoperative epochs, and used 11-second samples of artifact-free EEG data for the awake-state analysis. Awake-state data were evaluated in each group to identify age-dependent differences, and compared to 11-second samples of MOSSA data to identify sevoflurane general anesthesia dependent differences.</p><p>Our findings show that slow and delta activity are the prominent frequencies during the awake state at all ages. There were no discernable changes in power between the awake state and MOSSA in infants aged 0 to 3 months. However, increased theta (&gt;6Hz) and alpha were shown during the MOSSA state compared to the awake-state in infants 4 to 6 months of age. These findings suggest that the emergence of alpha activity is age-dependent, and a marker of anesthetic induced unconsciousness in infants 4 to 6 months.</p><p>The Methods section is now edited to reflect the inclusion of awake- state data. The results include an additional section detailing the awake-state data analysis with comparisons to the “MOSSA” data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) In the subsection headed “Anesthetic Management”. Where the methods are described we begin to unravel some of the major confounds here. These need to be brought earlier into the Introduction and Results and explanation of findings. They are buried here. Please include the anaesthetic data in</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref> <italic>and provide statistics. Clearly there are many differences here—understandable, as routine clinical care was performed and this is an opportunistic uncontrolled study, but as such the authors must alert the readership to the likelihood that anaesthetic variances might largely explain their data. As written, this information is not highlighted or discussed and the reader is very strongly led to believe this is all due to the very interesting developmental changes. I don't doubt that there is a profound developmental influence, but we need to be convinced these other factors are not relevant. Firstly, propofol was used for some babies but not others. We do not know whether this was evenly distributed between the two age groups or not. Please detail. There are differences in duration and amount of anaesthetic used between age groups, but again we're not told whether this was significantly different for the two age groups. These factors alone will confound the EEG signals; therefore, please confirm whether they are significantly different or not—hopefully not and then we can be more convinced by their developmental explanation</italic>.</p><p>We have edited <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> to include the requested information. This includes: (1) detail from the methods i.e. end-tidal sevoflurane concentration during MOSSA epochs; (2) general anesthetic management i.e. number of subjects given propofol, duration of anesthetic exposure; and (3) statistical comparisons. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> also cross-references to a supplementary table detailing individual infants’ demographics, clinical characteristics and anesthetic management.</p><p>The findings related to this study are possibly confounded by differences in anesthetic depth among individuals during MOSSA. For example, the addition of propofol to the anesthetic or increase in end-tidal sevoflurane concentration can potentially alter the depth of anesthesia as well as the characteristics of the EEG spectra.</p><p>End-tidal sevoflurane concentration requirements during MOSSA were significantly lower in the 0-3 month infants compared to the 4-6 month infants (p=0.002, Mann-Whitney U-test; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We performed a secondary analysis to control for potential dose effects by comparing EEG spectra during MOSSA at identical end- tidal sevoflurane concentrations of 1.8% across infants. At this lighter concentration (compared to MOSSA), the patterns of EEG activity observed were also seen during MOSSA suggesting the observed differences between the two groups were not likely due to a dose effect. We have edited the Results section (see EEG features during MOSSA) as follows:</p><p>“End-tidal sevoflurane requirements during MOSSA were significantly lower in infants 0 to 3 months compared to infants 4 to 6 months of age (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, we performed a secondary analysis to control for potential dose effects by comparing EEG spectra during MOSSA at identical end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations of 1.8% across infants. We chose 1.8% end-tidal sevoflurane because all of the infants received this concentration for at least 30s during surgery, and did not exhibit body movement or reflex activity at this plane of anesthesia suggesting a behavioral state comparable to MOSSA. At 1.8% end-tidal sevoflurane, frontal group-median spectrograms at F7 show slow and delta power was dominant over other frequencies in both age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Higher frequency oscillations in the theta and alpha range were more prominent in infants 4 to 6 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4– figure supplement 1C-G</xref>). The patterns of EEG activity observed during MOSSA were also seen during lighter planes of MOSSA at 1.8% end-tidal sevoflurane suggesting that the observed differences between the two groups are not likely due to a dose effect.”</p><p>We found no significant differences in the distribution of propofol administration between age groups (0-3M, 27.3%, 4- 6M, 42.1%; Fisher’s exact test, p=0.08; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). There were no differences in the duration of anesthetic exposure between age groups (p=0.18, Mann-Whitney U test). Collectively, these findings indicate that although a lower dose of anesthetic was required to maintain a surgical state of anesthesia in the younger infants, the differences seen between the groups are less likely to reflect deeper levels of anesthesia and more likely to be age-dependent.</p><p><italic>5)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>. While frontal-occipital power is not different there does appear to be more power in the slow waves in the temporal regions; is this significant</italic>?</p><p>We evaluated spectral power at the temporal regions and along the midline areas.

These findings that midline activity is compromised of significantly lower power compared to temporal regions are likely due to heterogeneity of skull thickness or bone conductance, and physical changes in the brain.<fig id="fig14" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06513.026</object-id><label>Author response image 2</label><caption><p>Midline EEG spectral power is lower compared to temporal regions during MOSSA in all infants.Temporal (T7) electrode comparisons are shown for (A-E) vs. frontal midline (FPz); (F-J ), vertex (Cz); (K-P), occipital midline (Oz); and (Q- U) lateral temporal area (T8).

The cranial bones are un-fused at birth, separated by fontanels and sutures for several postnatal months to accommodate the rapid growth of the brain. The fontanels are located at the midline junctions of bregma and lamda, and have a thinner zone in the skull; where the skull is thinner, it is more conductive. It is plausible that a high signal to noise ratio is obtained over these regions and contributes to these spatial differences in power.</p><p><italic>6)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref><italic>.

We speculate that the predominance of lower frequency activity seen reflects less cortico-cortical generator activity, and more thalamocortical generator activity (Michelle de Haan, Infant EEG and Event-Related Potentials, Psychology Press, 2013). Future studies using complementary techniques are needed for accurate source localization (i.e. with high density EEG electrode arrays) and evaluation of the origin of deeper cortical and subcortical signals (i.e. fMRI, PET).</p><p><italic>7)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10"><italic>Figure 10</italic></xref><italic>. Can we segregate body movements into those with eyes open/closed or whether concomitant with being obviously awake, etc? No information is given about this crude measure, its variance and therefore whether there were systematic differences in the age groups. For example, can we eliminate the question regarding whether babies were still predominately asleep in 0-3 month group even with body movements compared to the 4-6 month olds? Also, what does the body movement do to the quality of EEG recordings and were any body movements of the head? More detail is needed considering this was the single behavioural anchor used to determine emergence and to time-lock the EEG analysis to</italic>.</p><p>Please see our response to Point 2 above. The EEG power spectra in infants 0-3 months during MOSSA is comparable to that of emergence, as well as the awake state.

We need statistics here. There is a large weight difference and differences in length of anaesthesia, which means the brains of younger babies were loaded with more anaesthetic and this will impact emergence. Was this a significant difference? More details needed about the reasons for surgery—any brain/spinal cord related? Please also include from Methods into this table the dose/duration details regarding all anaesthetic agents used with statistics</italic>.</p><p>The patterns of uptake of inhalation anesthetics depend on time course of inhaled concentrations, alveolar ventilation, cardiac output and blood to gas and gas to oil partitioning. In steady-state, for an insoluble anesthetic such as sevoflurane, brain partial pressure is close to inspired partial pressure, with little dependence on body weight or brain weight. The anesthetic concentration was titrated by the anesthesiologist based on clinical considerations that we did not control. Nevertheless, the difference in mean end -tidal sevoflurane concentration between infants 0 to 3 months, and 4 to 6 months was small (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Previous studies of MAC for sevoflurane in infants showed a very slight age-dependence, with newborns and very young infants tending towards slightly lower MAC values compared to infants around 4 to 6 months of age. We have provided statistical information on the demographics and duration of anesthesia in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> of the revised article. We show there were no differences in the duration of anesthetic exposure between the age groups (p=0.18, Mann-Whitney U test).</p><p><italic>9) Abstract: I don't think you can make such a strong conclusion at this stage and based upon your conclusion.
