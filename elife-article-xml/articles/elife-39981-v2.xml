This study addresses these questions for the first time using two different SCA1 mouse models. We found that differentially regulated genes in the inferior olive segregated into several biological pathways. Comparison of the inferior olive and cerebellum demonstrates that vulnerable tissues in SCA1 are not uniform in their gene expression changes, and express largely discrete but some commonly enriched biological pathways. Importantly, we also found that brain-region-specific differences occur early in disease initiation and progression, and they are shared across the two mouse models of SCA1.

Why specific brain regions are affected and others remain unscathed is a key question in the field. In order to answer this question, the innate differences and similarities in affected tissues must first be established. Studies in a diverse subset of neurodegenerative disorders have begun using large-scale transcriptomics and proteomics to assess brain region-dependent molecular alterations. For example, a large RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) study conducted across brain regions and peripheral tissues in Huntington’s disease (HD) mouse models identified gene clusters related to transcription, chromatin factors, and mitochondria that appear to be specific to the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Langfelder et al., 2016</xref>). The same study also found glia-related genes that were significantly enriched in the striatum and cortex, as well as other tissues thought to be less affected in HD, such as the cerebellum and brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Langfelder et al., 2016</xref>). In Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), regional variability in transcriptional changes were observed early in disease progression, but the similarities between tissues increased as animals aged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landel et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, a recent study in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) identified brain region-dependent variability in gene expression changes prior to the onset of motor phenotypes despite modest transcriptional alterations in brain regions that remain largely unscathed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Toonen et al., 2018</xref>). Collectively, this suggests that a subset of gene clusters spans affected tissues regardless of the degree of tissue vulnerability, while other genes may be enriched in discrete affected tissues. Disease progression may also play a role in dictating the degree of overlap between two affected tissues, with a higher degree of variability between tissues early on in disease.</p><p>Mouse models for neurodegenerative disorders can be utilized to query the underlying differences and similarities in affected tissues, including the models generated for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). SCA1 is a fatal late-onset neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by impaired motor coordination and balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Globas et al., 2008</xref>). Atrophy and loss of Purkinje cells (PCs) in the cerebellum and cell death in the inferior olive have been identified in postmortem human tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koeppen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koeppen et al., 2013</xref>). Many of these behavioral and pathological traits have been faithfully recaptured in both a transgenic, and a knockin, mouse model for SCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burright et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Watase et al., 2002</xref>). Both SCA1 models demonstrate motor incoordination and PC pathology, and develop hallmark nuclear inclusions in PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burright et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Watase et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>SCA1 is caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the ATAXIN-1 (ATXN1) protein, which is involved in gene regulation, including transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Orr et al., 1993</xref>). Transcriptional regulators, including Capicua, SMRT, and RORa/Tip-60, have been shown to interact with ATXN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fryer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gehrking et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Serra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsai et al., 2004</xref>). Since ATXN1 functions as a transcriptional regulator, several previous studies have investigated how polyQ-expanded ATXN1 can impact the normal transcriptional signature of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crespo-Barreto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cvetanovic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gatchel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingram et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Serra et al., 2004</xref>). These studies have identified that various biological pathways, including glutamate signaling, calcium signaling, and long-term depression, are enriched in this tissue at different time-points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crespo-Barreto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gatchel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingram et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Serra et al., 2004</xref>). Despite the prevalence of transcriptomic data collected from the SCA1 cerebellum, other affected regions, such as the inferior olive, have remained largely unstudied.</p><p>The cerebellum and inferior olive are intricately connected. Neurons of the inferior olive, a collection of subnuclei in the rostral medulla, send climbing fibers to innervate PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bengtsson and Hesslow, 2006</xref>). PC axons, in turn, synapse onto deep cerebellar nuclei, which send efferent fibers to various brain regions including the inferior olive. Previous studies have found inferior olive cell loss in postmortem SCA1 human tissue, as well as changes in climbing fiber synaptic density on PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koeppen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuo et al., 2017</xref>). This coincides with data from the transgenic mouse model expressing polyQ-expanded human ATXN1 (ATXN1-82Q) in PCs under the control of the <italic>Pcp2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burright et al., 1995</xref>). These mice exhibit aberrant climbing fiber pruning on PC soma and dendrites, a reduction in the responsiveness of PCs to climbing fibers, and alterations in climbing fiber arborization and extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duvick et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ebner et al., 2013</xref>). Previous work has indicated that localization of ATXN1-82Q to the PC nucleus is associated with alterations in climbing fiber-PC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ebner et al., 2013</xref>). However, this does not exclude the possibility that affected inferior olive neurons may also influence the degree of climbing fiber synapses on PCs. Other neurodegenerative disorders, including SCA7, 14, and 23, as well as Essential Tremor, have aberrant climbing fiber innervation on PC soma and dendrites, indicating that this observation is not isolated to SCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smeets and Verbeek, 2016</xref>). Though the inferior olive is affected in SCA1, the precise role of the inferior olive in the manifestation of SCA1 clinical phenotypes is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duvick et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ebner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koeppen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuo et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the molecular basis of inferior olive alterations in SCA1 is unknown.</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to investigate molecular and pathological signatures of the inferior olive in SCA1 mouse models, and further identify similarities and differences in the gene expression profile between the inferior olive and cerebellum, two highly affected tissues in SCA1. We used two SCA1 mouse models, knockin and PC-specific transgenic, which express polyQ-expanded ATXN1 in different cell types and tissues, but faithfully recapture many aspects of the behavioral and pathological phenotypes associated with SCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burright et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Watase et al., 2002</xref>). Comparison of transcriptomics data from these two mouse models allowed for the dissection of how polyQ-expanded ATXN1 influences gene expression changes when it is preferentially expressed in specific cell-types and tissues. We found that differentially regulated genes in the inferior olive segregated into several unique biological pathways. Particularly, the defense response appears largely unique to the SCA1 inferior olive across SCA1 mouse models. We also found that there are common, and distinct, enriched biological pathways between the SCA1 cerebellum and inferior olive.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design towards understanding the molecular basis of pathogenesis underlying tissue susceptibility in SCA1</title><p>A key question in the field is whether the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis in SCA1 affected tissues are similar or distinct. This led us to conduct a thorough comparison of transcriptional changes in the inferior olive and cerebellum using two different SCA1 mouse models, knockin (KI) and transgenic (Tg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Two independent time-points were analyzed. The first time-point selected for analysis was 5 weeks of age, which coincides with the earliest time-point of rotarod impairment in both mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Watase et al., 2002</xref>). The second time-point chosen was 12 weeks of age, to assess early disease progression. The 12 week time-point also coincides with the initiation of significant thinning of the molecular layer in ATXN1-82Q Tg mice, but precedes gross PC loss.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39981.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustrating the cross-tissue and cross-model comparisons conducted to identify common and unique molecular alterations across SCA1 affected tissues.</title><p>Transcriptomics data from <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI inferior olive and cerebellum were first analyzed individually (1-2) before comparing the two tissues (3).

To determine the extent of the similarities, we conducted a more thorough comparison between the two time-points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>).

Due to the increasing evidence that there are underlying differences in tissue-specific cell populations and responses to external stimuli, it is necessary to begin examining all affected and sparred tissues in neurodegenerative conditions to determine their underlying similarities and differences, which remain unknown. Identifying commonalities between tissues will provide insight into potential therapeutic targets, while elucidating discrepancies between tissues will provide a more thorough understanding of how disease uniquely affects each tissue. Further, previous work has highlighted that different mouse models created to study specific neurodegenerative diseases have somewhat different molecular alterations, sometimes making it difficult to discern a common mechanism driving pathological and clinical phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hargis and Blalock, 2017</xref>). We addressed these questions for the first time in a SCA1 context by 1) identifying underlying molecular alterations that occur in the inferior olive, 2) assessing how these molecular alterations change during early SCA1 disease progression, 3) highlighting prevalent similar and unique biological pathways in two affected SCA1 tissues, and 4) conducting a cross-model comparison between two SCA1 mouse modes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39981.048</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary of biological and molecular pathway enrichment across SCA1 mouse models in each brain region over time.</title><p>Differentially regulated genes in the 5 week old inferior olive and cerebellum from both SCA1 mouse models are associated with specific biological and molecular pathways, a subset of which are listed.

This suggests that some, but not a significant amount, of Defense Response-related genes are significantly different in the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI and ATXN1-82Q Tg inferior olive at 5 weeks of age. However, by 12 weeks of age, both the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI and ATXN1-82Q Tg inferior olive differentially regulated gene lists are made up of a substantial portion of defense response, or immune-related, genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The biological and pathological significance of the defense response in the SCA1 inferior olive will require further examination to determine whether this is a component of a pathological pathway or protective response. One interesting finding in this study is that although the defense response was a top significantly enriched pathway in the inferior olive of two distinct SCA1 models, the genes differentially regulated in these models do not strongly overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). For example, ISGs such as the retinoic acid-inducible genes (RIG-1) like receptors <italic>Ddx58</italic> (RIG-1) and <italic>Ifih1</italic> (MDA5) are significantly up-regulated in the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI inferior olive, but do not change in the ATXN1-82Q Tg inferior olive. Due to the fundamental difference in the expression of polyQ-expanded mutant ATXN1 protein in the inferior olive between the two different SCA1 models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A and B</xref>), the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to the increased defense response will be different.</p><p>Enrichment for defense response-related genes in the 12 week old ATXN1-82Q Tg inferior olive is particularly striking given that ATXN1-82Q is not detectable at the mRNA and protein level in this tissue compared to the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Further, polyQ-expanded ATXN1 would only be expressed in neurons if it is expressed below detectable levels since the expression of ATXN1-82Q is driven by the <italic>Pcp2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burright et al., 1995</xref>). Therefore, the large number of defense response-related genes, especially those expressed at higher levels in glia cells, suggest that some non-cell autonomous effects on transcription are occurring in ATXN1-82Q Tg inferior olive. Interestingly, potential upstream regulators identified with IPA did not indicate that Irf7 was a significant regulatory factor in the ATXN1-82Q Tg mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary File 5</xref>). This further enhances our prediction that polyQ-expanded mutant Atxn1 may directly influence the Irf7 activity in a cell-autonomous manner in glia cells in the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI inferior olive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). While alterations in glia-expressed genes appear to be a major component of the inferior olive transcriptome, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of these gene expression alterations are occurring in other cell-types in the inferior olive. One alternative explanation for the gene expression changes in the ATXN1-82Q Tg inferior olive is dysfunction and pathology of cerebellar PCs having a retrograde effect on the inferior olive.</p><p>Our results suggest that gene expression changes are dynamic between 5 and 12 weeks of age in the inferior olive of both mouse models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

These genes were typically up-regulated at 5 weeks of age, but were down-regulated at 12 weeks of age, and this was consistent across both SCA1 mouse models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This is in comparison to the cerebellar time-point comparison, which found that the majority of overlapping genes remained consistently either down-regulated or up-regulated over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Whether this switch in gene expression regulation is tied to disease onset and progression, pathological cerebellar input, or other mechanisms is unknown.</p><p>One caveat of the present study is the few number of differentially regulated genes identified in the 5 week old <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Previous reports from a 4 week and 7 week time-point microarray study identified more genes significantly altered in this brain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crespo-Barreto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gatchel et al., 2008</xref>). After extending our p-value to include nominally significant genes p &lt; 0.01, we found significant overlap between our dataset with the previously published datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This suggests that animal variability, differences in animal housing, and potentially our stringent FDR p-value &lt; 0.05 cut-off ultimately led to a small number of genes differentially regulated at 5 weeks of age. Despite this, our current findings in the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI and ATXN1-82Q Tg cerebellum are consistent with previously published reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gatchel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingram et al., 2016</xref>). In the Ingram et al. study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingram et al., 2016</xref>) investigating cerebellar molecular alterations in ATXN1-82Q Tg mice that correlate with disease progression, the 10 hub genes that correlate with disease progression in PCs were also significantly down-regulated in our 5 and 12 week datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; GEO accession 122099). In addition, <italic>Cck</italic> and <italic>Col18a1</italic> were down-regulated in our 5 and 12 week datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4E</xref>), which match the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingram et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>There was a marked difference in the biological functions associated with the differentially expressed genes in both the 12 week old <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI and ATXN1-82Q Tg inferior olive and cerebellum comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). The defense response was consistently enriched in the inferior olive relative to the cerebellum across SCA1 mouse models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). The lack of significantly enriched defense response-related pathways in the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI and ATXN1-82Q Tg cerebellum is particularly striking given that a previous study found increased gliosis in the cerebellum around this time-point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cvetanovic et al., 2015</xref>). Further, our transcriptomics data found a significant decrease in <italic>Gfap</italic> expression in the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), which is consistent with a recently published report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edamakanti et al., 2018</xref>). This may indicate that protein levels and mRNA expression do not coincide in some instances. It is also possible that defense response-related genes are enriched among activated glia in the SCA1 cerebellum, however, those differentially regulated genes may be lost due to sequencing in bulk cerebellar lysates. There is significant up-regulation for some components of the defense response, including ISGs in the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), and compliment cascade factors in the ATXN1-82Q Tg cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), however, the relatively small number of genes associated with the defense response that are differentially regulated within the cerebella suggests that it is not a major feature of the SCA1 cerebellar transcriptome.</p><p>Enrichment for Cic binding sites within the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI and ATXN1-82Q Tg cerebellum down-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">3</xref>) is consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fryer et al., 2011</xref>), indicating that the presence of polyQ-expanded ATXN1 acts synergistically with Cic to further repress transcriptional activity. While there was a degree of enrichment for Cic binding sites among the up-regulated <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI and down-regulated ATXN1-82Q Tg inferior olive genes, it was not the most significantly over-represented potential transcriptional regulator at the 12 week time-point (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary File 5</xref>). While we cannot rule out the role of Cic-Atxn1 interactions on regulating molecular alterations in the inferior olive, other transcriptional regulators, such as Irf7 and Esr1, may be regulating a proportion of the differentially regulated genes in the inferior olive in the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI and ATXN1-82Q Tg mouse models.</p><p>The two SCA1 mouse cerebellar datasets had significant enrichment for similar biological functions, which initially suggested to us that similar genes may be altered in these two mouse models despite the mouse model differences in polyQ-expansion, cell-type expression, expression level of polyQ-expanded ATXN1, human vs. mouse protein, or genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burright et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Watase et al., 2002</xref>). While a proportion of genes did overlap between these two mouse models, we observed a difference in the directionality of gene expression changes across the models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). A similar observation can be found in SCA2 transgenic and KI mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Halbach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pflieger et al., 2017</xref>). The majority of the commonly dysregulated genes were up-regulated in the ATXN1-82Q Tg mouse cerebellum and down-regulated in the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), and contained genes associated with nervous system development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The disparity in significant gene expression directionality in these two models may be due to the cell-type-specific expression of polyQ-expanded ATXN1. The PC-specific expression of ATXN1-82Q, and its effect on PC function, may lead to up-regulation of a subset of non-neuronal genes. However, cell-type appropriate expression of polyQ-expanded Atxn1 in <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI cerebellum may lead to alterations in similar genes via cell-type specific intrinsic mechanisms. Despite the discrepancy in the directionality of the differentially expressed genes, previous studies show that the two mouse models exhibit similar behavioral and pathological phenotypes. Both models manifest motor coordination deficits at approximately 5 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Watase et al., 2002</xref>). Molecular layer thinning is obvious at 12 weeks in the ATXN1-82Q Tg mouse model, but occurs at a later time-point in the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duvick et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Watase et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Variability in gene expression in the brain across multiple inbred mouse strains has previously been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nadler et al., 2006</xref>). The two SCA1 mouse models analyzed in the present study were maintained on different mouse genetic backgrounds. The <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI mice are maintained on a C57BL/6J background, while the ATXN1-82Q Tg are kept on a pure FVB/NJ background. Therefore, the genetic interaction between polyQ-expanded ATXN1 and the mouse genetic background should be considered. In addition, the two SCA1 mouse models utilize either the mouse or human homologue of polyQ-expanded ATXN1. The amino acid sequence similarity between the mouse and human ATXN1 is 89% when excluding the polyQ-tract. While this indicates a high degree of sequence similarity, how the sequence differences influence subsequent gene expression changes is unknown.</p><p>In summary, our work shows for the first time that there are specific biological pathways enriched in a less studied SCA1 affected tissue, the inferior olive. Further, there are intrinsic molecular differences between two affected tissues in SCA1, and biological pathways that are largely brain-region-specific are conserved across SCA1 mouse models, regardless of the expression of polyQ-expanded ATXN1. The commonalities between affected tissues indicate that a subset of molecular changes may be useful as disease biomarkers in SCA1.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/><break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, or strain <break/>background (<italic>Mus</italic> <break/><italic>musculus</italic>, C57BL/6J)</td><td><italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI</td><td>PMID:12086639</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:2429435">MGI:2429435</ext-link>, backcrossed in house on C57BL/6J background</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, or strain <break/>background (<italic>Mus</italic> <break/><italic>musculus,</italic> FVB/NJ)</td><td>ATXN1-82Q Tg</td><td>PMID:7553854</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:2447854">MGI:2447854</ext-link> <break/>backcrossed in house on FVB/NJ background</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, or strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus</italic> <break/><italic>musculus</italic>, <break/>C57BL/6J)</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>The Jackson Lab</td><td>Stock: 000664</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, or <break/>strain background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus,</italic> <break/>FVB/NJ)</td><td>FVB/NJ</td><td>The Jackson Lab</td><td>Stock: 001800</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>BV2</td><td>A kind gift from Dr. Katerina Akassoglou (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2007</xref>)</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0182">CVCL_0182</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected <break/>construct</td><td>human Flag-ATXN1 82Q</td><td>A kind gift from Dr. Huda Zoghbi</td><td>Addgene Plasmid #33237</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected <break/>construct</td><td>mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1+</td><td>Invitrogen (ThermoFisher Scientific)</td><td>Cat. #

Enrichment analysis was conducted using NIH DAVID 6.8 using the GO_TERM FAT and KEGG annotations, with measurable genes detected in our RNA-sequencing experiments serving as the reference background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2009b</xref>). NIH DAVID functional annotation clustering parameters included a minimum of five initial group and final group membership, which preferentially produces larger group sizes. Cluster names on the bar graphs were named based on the most significantly enriched biological pathway in the cluster, unless otherwise specified. The rationale for using the FAT annotations was that it contains a filtered version of the GOTERM ALL category, which includes all GO annotations from level 1 (least specific) to level 5 (most specific). All enriched GO annotations with a FDR p-value cut-off of 0.05 and a minimum of 5 genes in each cluster were included in the analysis. For the 5 week old <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI cerebellum, a nominal p-value &lt; 0.01 was used for enrichment analysis cut-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Networks were visualized using EnrichmentMap in Cytoscape v3.5.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Merico et al., 2010</xref>). GO annotations that did not relate to neuronal function (for example, terms related to muscle function), were excluded from the EnrichmentMap. Edge width corresponds with the correlation coefficient between nodes, and the similarity cutoff overlap coefficient was set to 0.8. This strict coefficient cutoff allowed for the formation of clusters of nodes with similar GO annotations. Qiagen’s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Spring Release 2018) was utilized to identify enriched canonical pathways predicated to be activated or inhibited. Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values were used for identifying enriched pathways. For analyzing upstream regulators, the following parameters were utilized: an activation z-score of absolute value (2+), p-value overlap of 0.01, depth of 2 and breadth of 5, and only direct relationships were included. Heatmaps were generated using normalized read counts and the package ‘gplots’ in R v3.3.3. Prism v7 was used for generating barplots of RNA-seq read counts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunofluorescence staining</title><p>Mice were anesthetized before intracardial perfusion with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were extracted and fixed overnight in 4% PFA before incubation in 20% and 30% sucrose gradient. Samples were frozen in OCT compound (VWR, 4583) and sliced in 30 µm sections on a cryostat. Sections were washed in PBS and PBS with 0.1% Triton-X before incubation in 5% normal goat serum (Jackson Labs 005-000-121) at room temperature. Primary antibody incubation was carried out at 4°C with the following antibodies: mouse anti-Calbindin, rabbit anti-Iba1, and chicken anti-Gfap. Sections were washed before incubation in secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse Alexa488, goat anti-rabbit Alexa568, and goat anti-chicken Alexa555. Sections were mounted and coverslipped with DAPI. Fluorescent images were scanned on a Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope. Three brain slices were imaged and quantified for each mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell counting and fluorescence intensity</title><p>ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) was used for all image processing. To measure the fluorescence intensity for Gfap-positive staining, the inferior olive was traced based on calbindin-positive staining, and the area in μm was measured and mean fluorescence intensity measured. To count the total number of Iba1-positive cells, ‘analyze particle’ was used and manually checked by a blinded individual to ensure Iba1-positive staining co-localized with DAPI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Inferior olive and cerebella were homogenized in buffer (0.5% NP-40, 0.5% Triton-X, 0.1% SDS, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 180 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and Roche complete protease inhibitor cocktail). Samples were then sonicated to ensure breakdown of protein aggregates before rotation at 4°C for 10 min and centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4°C. Supernatant was quantified using a BCA assay (ThermoFisher 23225) and protein from each sample was added to a 8% Tris-HCl gel for western blotting. For <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI inferior olive and cerebellum, 70 μg and 20 μg of protein were added per lane, respectively. For ATXN1-82Q Tg inferior olive and cerebellum, 10 μg of protein was added per lane. Protein was transferred onto 0.42 μm nitrocellulose, and blotted with primary antibodies rabbit anti-Atxn1 11750 (a kind gift from Dr. Huda Zoghbi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Servadio et al., 1995</xref>), and mouse anti-Gapdh. Nitrocellulose was washed before incubation in secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse, incubated in chemiluminescence substrate (Perkin Elmer NEL103E001) and developed on a Konica SRX-101A tabletop X-ray film processor.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.

Importantly, this is the first characterization of the transcriptional signature of the inferior olive, which is a vulnerable brain region in SCA. These analyses reveal substantial overlap but also some differences in transcriptomic changes between knock-in and transgenic models, as may be expected. More importantly, these analyses found brain region-specific differences that are shared between the two distinct models of SCA1, suggesting different mechanisms of degeneration at work in the inferior olive and cerebellum. Interestingly, changes in genes representing the &quot;defense response&quot; are prominent in the inferior olive, appearing to reflect non-neural changes due to activation of glia. This work enriches our understanding of two commonly used models of SCA1 and provides valuable novel insights into the mechanisms that may contribute to regional neurodegeneration in SCA more generally.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not clear why a 12-week time point was chosen for analysis – a time point when both lines examined here are symptomatic. Ideally, a time point should be chosen that precedes behavioral and major morphological changes since cell loss may distort the transcriptional signatures. We ask the authors to consider adding analysis of an earlier, presymptomatic time point to assess which transcriptional changes are occurring first and the trajectory of the changes. Perhaps the 12-week time point was selected to correspond to prior published results (e.g. Ingram et al., 2016). It would be helpful for the authors to discuss the current findings in the context of previously published results.</p><p>2) The statement that &quot;common behavioral and pathological phenotypes of the two mouse models may be due to dysregulation of a common subset of genes, and not entirely based on the gene expression directionality&quot; is highly speculative and not supported by much data.

First, the onset of transcriptional changes in the inferior olive are unknown, and an intermediate time-point was initially chosen to determine if gene expression changes are occurring in the inferior olive. Second, substantial cell-loss has not been reported in the cerebellum in both the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI and ATXN1-82Q Tg mouse models, and no obvious cellular changes were reported in the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI inferior olive outside of nuclear inclusion formation at an 18 week time-point (Watase et al., 2002). These observations suggested to us that RNA-seq analysis at 12 weeks was plausible without the consideration of distorted transcriptional alterations due to substantial cell loss. Third, previously published RNA-seq and microarrays in both mouse models have used the 12 week intermediate time-point, which would allow for potential comparison between our results and those previously published.</p><p>In consideration of the reviewer's suggestion of adding an earlier, pre-symptomatic time point to our analysis, we have added RNA-sequencing results from the <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup> </italic>KI and ATXN1-82Q Tg inferior olive and cerebellum at 5 weeks of age. This time-point coincides with the earliest reported onset of or prior to motor phenotypes in these mouse models (Clark et al., 1997; Watase et al., 2002). Bioinformatic analysis of the individual brain regions and mouse models, as well as the cross-tissue comparison were conducted on the 5 week data-set. Further, the commonalities and differences between the 5 week and 12 week datasets within each brain region were assessed. We believe that the addition of the 5 week time-point contributes substantially to our initial manuscript, and solidifies the findings that there are brain region-specific molecular alterations in SCA1.</p><p>Data pertaining to the 5 week <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI and ATXN1-82Q Tg inferior olive and cerebellum analysis can be found in the following figures: Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 4; Figure 3—figure supplements 1-4; Figure 4—figure supplement 1; Figure 5—figure supplements 1 and 3; Figure 6—figure supplements 1, 3, and 4.</p><p>The addition of the 5 week time-points led to a substantial revision of the text, however, the main findings from the 5 week time-points can be found in the Results section.</p><p>The incorporation of the 5 week time-point generated 13 additional Supplementary Data tables (Supplementary Data 1-3, 6, 8, 11-12, 14-15, 18-19, 21, and 24). To reduce the number of Supplementary Data tables, we have removed Supplementary Data tables found in the original manuscript that contained differentially regulated gene lists from each brain region. The justification for this is that the differentially regulated gene lists can be easily accessed in our processed data text files found on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO accession number: 122099).</p><p>In consideration of the reviewer's comment about discussing our current findings in the context of previously published works, we have added this to the Discussion section. Briefly, our ATXN1-82Q Tg cerebellum datasets have consistent findings with those from a previous publication (Ingram et al., 2016). From that study, the 10 hub genes identified in the magenta module, which was significantly associated with ataxia, were also significantly down-regulated in our 5 and 12 week datasets. In addition, <italic>Cck</italic> and <italic>Col18a1</italic> were down-regulated in our 5 and 12 week datasets, which match the previous report (Ingram et al., 2016). In addition, our 5 and 12 week old <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI cerebellum dataset overlaps with microarray findings from a previous study analyzing 4 week old and 9-12 week old <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup></italic> KI mice (Gatchel et al., 2008; Crespo-Baretto et al., 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The statement that &quot;common behavioral and pathological phenotypes of the two mouse models may be due to dysregulation of a common subset of genes, and not entirely based on the gene expression directionality&quot; is highly speculative and not supported by much data. This conclusion should be tempered or supported by more experimental evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this statement is speculative and extrapolated from our data without much supporting evidence. In order to address this comment, we have removed this concept from the Discussion section. The Results section was re-assessed, and we feel that this concept does not appear in this portion of the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
