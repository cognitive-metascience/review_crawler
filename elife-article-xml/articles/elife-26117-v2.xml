Because flies exhibit saccadic visual behaviors and their compound eyes have relatively few ommatidia (sampling points), their photoreceptors would be expected to generate blurry and coarse retinal images of the world. Here we demonstrate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> see the world far better than predicted from the classic theories. By using electrophysiological, optical and behavioral assays, we found that R1-R6 photoreceptors’ encoding capacity <italic>in time</italic> is maximized to fast high-contrast bursts, which resemble their light input during saccadic behaviors. Whilst <italic>over space</italic>, R1-R6s resolve moving objects at saccadic speeds beyond the predicted motion-blur-limit. Our results show how refractory phototransduction and rapid photomechanical photoreceptor contractions jointly sharpen retinal images of moving objects <italic>in space-time</italic>, enabling hyperacute vision, and explain how such microsaccadic information sampling exceeds the compound eyes’ optical limits. These discoveries elucidate how acuity depends upon photoreceptor function and eye movements.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26117.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Fruit flies have five eyes: two large compound eyes which support vision, plus three smaller single lens eyes which are used for navigation. Each compound eye monitors 180° of space and consists of roughly 750 units, each containing eight light-sensitive cells called photoreceptors. This relatively wide spacing of photoreceptors is thought to limit the sharpness, or acuity, of vision in fruit flies. The area of the human retina (the light-sensitive surface at back of our eyes) that generates our sharpest vision contains photoreceptors that are 500 times more densely packed.</p><p>Despite their differing designs, human and fruit fly eyes work via the same general principles. If we, or a fruit fly, were to hold our gaze completely steady, the world would gradually fade from view as the eye adapted to the unchanging visual stimulus. To ensure this does not happen, animals continuously make rapid, automatic eye movements called microsaccades. These refresh the image on the retina and prevent it from fading. Yet it is not known why do they not also cause blurred vision.</p><p>Standard accounts of vision assume that the retina and the brain perform most of the information processing required, with photoreceptors simply detecting how much light enters the eye. However, Juusola, Dau, Song et al. now challenge this idea by showing that photoreceptors are specially adapted to detect the fluctuating patterns of light that enter the eye as a result of microsaccades. Moreover, fruit fly eyes resolve small moving objects far better than would be predicted based on the spacing of their photoreceptors.</p><p>The discovery that photoreceptors are well adapted to deal with eye movements changes our understanding of insect vision. The findings also disprove the 100-year-old dogma that the spacing of photoreceptors limits the sharpness of vision in compound eyes. Further studies are required to determine whether photoreceptors in the retinas of other animals, including humans, have similar properties.</p></abstract><kwd-group

spacing, which provides the grain of the retinal image. To resolve two stationary objects, at least three photoreceptors are needed for detecting the intensity difference in between. To resolve two moving objects is harder, as vision becomes further limited by each photoreceptor’s finite integration time and receptive field size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Srinivasan and Bernard, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Juusola and French, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Land, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, animals - from insects to man - view the world by using saccades, fast movements, which direct their eyes to the surroundings, and fixation intervals between the saccades, during which gaze is held near stationary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Land, 1999</xref>). Because of photoreceptors’ slow integration-time, saccades should blur image details and these are thought to be sampled when gaze is stabilized. Thus, information would be captured during fixations whilst during saccades animals would be effectively blind. This viewpoint, however, ignores fast photoreceptor adaptation, which causes perceptual fading during fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ditchburn and Ginsborg, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Riggs and Ratliff, 1952</xref>), reducing visual information and possibly rendering perception to mean light only. Therefore, to maximize information and acuity, it is plausible that evolution has optimized photoreceptor function in respect to visual behaviors and needs.</p><p>We have now devised a suite of new experimental and theoretical methods to study this question both in time and over space in <italic>Drosophila</italic> R1-R6 photoreceptors. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> compound eyes are composed of ~750 seemingly regular lens-capped modules called ommatidia, which should provide the fly a panoramic visual field of low optical resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barlow, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Land, 1997</xref>). Each ommatidium contains eight photoreceptor cells (R1-R8), pointing to seven different directions. The ultraviolet and blue-green-sensitive outer photoreceptors, R1-R6, initiate the motion vision pathway, whilst the central R7 and R8, which lie on top of each other, detect different colors from one direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Wardill et al., 2012</xref>). Owing to the eye’s neural superposition principle, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6, each from a separate neighboring ommatidium, also point to the same direction. By pooling their output for synaptic transmission, the photoreceptor spacing (spatial resolution) effectively matches the ommatidium spacing (average interommatidial angle, Δφ = 4.5<sup>o</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Götz, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Land, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Gonzalez-Bellido et al., 2011</xref>) but the signal-to-noise ratio of the transmitted image could improve by √6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Ruyter van Steveninck and Laughlin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib209">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here we show how evolution has improved <italic>Drosophila</italic> vision beyond these classic ideas, suggesting that light information sampling in R1-R6 photoreceptors is tuned to saccadic behavior.</p><p>Our intracellular recordings reveal that R1-R6s capture 2-to-4-times more information in time than previous maximum estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Juusola and Hardie, 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Song and Juusola, 2014</xref>) when responding to high-contrast bursts (periods of rapid light changes followed by quiescent periods) that resemble light input from natural scenes generated by saccadic viewing. Biophysically-realistic model simulations suggest that this improvement largely results from interspersed ‘fixation’ intervals, which allow photoreceptors to sample more information from phasic light changes by relieving them from refractoriness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Song and Juusola, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Juusola et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, over space, our intracellular recordings, high-speed microscopy and modeling further reveal how photomechanical photoreceptor contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Hardie and Franze, 2012</xref>) work together with refractory sampling to improve spatial acuity. We discover that by actively modulating light input and photoreceptor output, these processes reduce motion blur during saccades and adaptation during gaze fixation, which otherwise could fade vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ditchburn and Ginsborg, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Riggs and Ratliff, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Land, 1997</xref>). The resulting phasic responses sharpen retinal images by highlighting the times when visual objects cross a photoreceptor’s receptive field, thereby encoding space in time (see also: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahissar and Arieli, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Donner and Hemilä, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Rucci et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Kuang et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Kuang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Franceschini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">Viollet, 2014</xref>). Thus, neither saccades nor fixations blind the flies, but together improve vision.</p><p>Incorporation of this novel opto-mechano-electric mechanism into our ‘microsaccadic sampling’-model predicts that <italic>Drosophila</italic> can see &gt;4 fold finer details than their eyes’ spatial sampling limit – a prediction directly confirmed by optomotor behavior experiments. By demonstrating how fly photoreceptors’ fast microsaccadic information sampling provides hyperacute vision of moving images, these results change our understanding of insect vision, whilst showing an important relationship between eye movements and visual acuity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>These results establish that <italic>Drosophila</italic> exploit image motion (through eye movements) to see spatial details, down to hyperacute resolution. A fly’s visual acuity is limited by how well its photoreceptors resolve different photon rate changes, and their receptive field sizes.

Thus, the mean emitted photon rate and light information at the source was lower for the bursts and higher for the GWNs (the signal-to-noise ratio of the observable world increases with brightening illumination; e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig5">Appendix 2—figures 5D and H</xref>). However, in very bright stimulation, the global mean light intensity (over the experiment) becomes less critical for good vision as the eye self-regulates its own input more. Photons galore are lost to intracellular pupil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Howard et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Song and Juusola, 2014</xref>) and refractory microvilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Song et al., 2012</xref>), which reduce quantum efficiency. Although a R1-R6’s receptive field could be bombarded by 10<sup>6</sup>–10<sup>9</sup> photons/s (in daylight), due to the dramatic drop in quantum efficiency, the photoreceptor could only count up ∼80,000–800,000 quantum bumps/s (Appendix 2). Therefore, the stimulus contrast and bandwidth, which drive the dynamic quantum bump rate changes, summing up the photoreceptor output, are confounded with changes in mean intensity. And, as such, this stimulus design, by containing four different BGs, makes it difficult to see the exact contributions of contrast, bandwidth and mean in controlling the responses.</p><p>Information theoretical analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) indicated that the response differences largely reflected differences in their quantum bump counts. The maximum signal power spectra to bursty stimuli could be up to ~6,000 times larger than that of the noise, which was effectively stimulus-invariant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Because the noise power spectrum largely represents the average quantum bump’s frequency composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib204">Wong et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Juusola and Hardie, 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Song and Juusola, 2014</xref>), the bumps adapted to a similar size. Here, given the brightness of the stimuli, the bumps had light-adapted close to their minimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Juusola and Hardie, 2001a</xref>). Thereby, the larger responses simply comprised more bumps. Moreover, with Poisson light statistics, the response precision - how well it estimated photon flux changes - should increase with the square root of bump count until saturation; when more microvilli remained refractory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Song and Juusola, 2014</xref>). Accordingly, signaling performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>) increased both with the stimulus bandwidth (left) and contrast (right), until these became too fast to follow.

First, apart from the responses to 20 Hz high-contrast bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, red trace), the responses to all the other stimuli had broadly Gaussian signal and noise distributions, obeying the Shannon formula’s major assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Shannon, 1948</xref>). Second, our previous tests in comparing the Shannon formula to triple extrapolation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Juusola and de Polavieja, 2003</xref>), which is directly derived from Shannon’s information theory, have shown that for sufficiently large sets of data both these methods provide similar estimates even for this type of highly non-Gaussian responses (~5–20% maximal differences) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Song and Juusola, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dau et al., 2016</xref>). And, indeed, new tests using additional recordings to longer stimulus repetitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) indicated the same. Thus here, the Shannon formula should provide a sufficiently accurate information estimate also for the 20 Hz high-contrast burst responses, making this evaluation fair (see Appendix 2).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Simulations reveal network contribution</title><p>These findings were largely replicated by stochastic simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).

However, in marked contrast, the model predictions failed to resolve the double-fast dots, instead blurring into one broad response in both adapting states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>; blue vs. black bars, respectively). The predictions for the fast dots were also poorer than the measured responses. Thus, a photoreceptor’s real resolving power was significantly better and less affected by motion blur than predicted by classic theory (Appendix 6).</p><p>We next asked whether this better-than-expected resolving power resulted from synaptic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib209">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Freifeld et al., 2013</xref>) by using <italic>hdc<sup>JK910</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, red traces), in which photoreceptors lacked their neurotransmitter, histamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Burg et al., 1993</xref>) (Appendixes 4–6). Because <italic>hdc<sup>JK910</sup></italic> R1-R6s cannot transmit information to their post-synaptic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dau et al., 2016</xref>) (LMCs, which initiate the motion detection pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Joesch et al., 2010</xref>), and the amacrine cells), neither could these photoreceptors receive any light-driven interneuron feedback modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dau et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, if the synaptic interactions improved the wild-type output to the moving dots, then <italic>hdc<sup>JK910</sup></italic> R1-R6s, which lacked these interactions, should show diminished resolvability. But this was never observed. Instead, we found that <italic>hdc<sup>JK910</sup></italic> R1-R6s resolved the dots at least equally well as the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, red). Thus, high acuity did not result from synaptic inputs but was intrinsic to photoreceptors.</p><p>We also calculated Δρ needed to explain the spatial acuity of the recordings. The example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) is from a R1-R6, which had the narrowest light-adapted receptive field (Δρ = 5.73<sup>o</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Its response resolved the two fast-moving dots with a 40.5% dip. However, the Volterra model prediction, using its receptive field, only resolved the dots with a 12.5% dip (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In fact, for 41.0% resolvability, its Δρ would need to narrow to 3.70<sup>o</sup> (from 5.73<sup>o</sup>). Thus, for the prediction to match the recording, the receptive field would have to narrow at least by one-third. Because the required (predicted) acceptance angles of R1-R6s were always much narrower (≤ 4<sup>o</sup>) than the actual measurements (∆ρ<sub>dark</sub> = 9.47 and ∆ρ<sub>light</sub> = 7.70; see above), measurement bias cannot explain this disparity.</p><p>We further discovered that R1-R6 recordings often showed phasic directional selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), with the responses rising and decaying faster to back-to-front than to front-to-back moving dots. We asked whether these lag-time differences originated from asymmetric photomechanical photoreceptor contractions. Namely, atomic-force microscopy has revealed minute (&lt;275 nm) vertical movements on the surface of dissected <italic>Drosophila</italic> eyes, generated by contraction of individual microvilli as PIP<sub>2</sub> is hydrolyzed from the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Hardie and Franze, 2012</xref>). Here, we reasoned that if the ommatidium lenses were effectively fixed and R1-R8s levered to the retinal matrix, the contractions (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) might be larger in situ, moving and shaping the photoreceptors’ receptive fields along some preferred direction. Such mechanical feedback could then reduce light input to R1-R8s, making it more transient and directional.</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-26117-video2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26117.028</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> R1-R8s in dissociated ommatidia contract photomechanically</title><p>Wild-type and <italic>trp</italic>/<italic>trpl</italic>-mutant R1-R8 photoreceptors contract photomechanically to light flashes.

Consequently, the fast rhabdomere movements, whilst still ~3 times slower than their voltage responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, wine), adapted photoreceptors photomechanically by shifting their receptive fields by 0.5–4.0<sup>o</sup>, away from directly pointing to the light source.</p><p>Video footage at different eye locations indicated that light-activated rhabdomeres moved in back-to-front direction along the eye’s equatorial (anterior-posterior) plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, red; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>), with little up-down components (black). Therefore, as each ommatidium lens inverts projected images, the photoreceptors’ receptive fields should follow front-to-back image motion. This global motion direction, which corresponds to a forward locomoting fly’s dominant horizontal optic flow field, most probably explains the phasic directional selectivity we found to opposing image motions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>; Appendix 8). Thus, the responses to back-to-front moving dots were faster because the dots entered and exited each contracting photoreceptor's front-to-back moving receptive field earlier; whereas the dots moving in the opposite direction stayed slightly longer inside each receptive field.</p><media id="video3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-26117-video3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26117.031</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> R1-R8 photoreceptors contract photomechanically <italic>in vivo</italic>, moving back-to-front inside each observed ommatidium</title><p>We utilized the optical cornea-neutralization technique with antidromic deep-red (740 or 785 nm peak) illumination to observe deep pseudopupils (photoreceptor rhabdomeres that align with the observer’s viewing axis) in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye.

Our results indicate that the dynamic interplay between saccades and gaze fixation is important for both the maintenance and enhancement of vision already at the photoreceptor level. This interplay, which is commonly observed in locomoting <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Geurten et al., 2014</xref>), makes light input to photoreceptors bursty.</p><p>We showed that high-contrast bursts, which resemble light input during a fly’s saccadic behaviors, maximize photoreceptors’ information capture in time, and provided evidence that such encoding involves four interlinked mechanisms. Light input is first regulated by two processes inside photoreceptors: slower screening pigment migration (intracellular pupil, 1–10 s) and much faster photomechanical rhabdomere contractions (0.01–1 s). These modulations have low noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), enabling refractory photon sampling by microvilli to enhance information intake in phasic stimulus components. Finally, asymmetric synaptic inputs from the network differentiate individual R1-R6 outputs. Remarkably, over space, these mechanisms further sharpen neural resolvability by ~4 fold below the theoretical limit of the compound eye optics, providing hyperacute vision. Further analyses imply that these mechanisms with systematic rhabdomere size variations combat aliasing (Appendixes 2 and 5).</p><p>Thus, with microsaccadic sampling, a fly’s behavioral decisions govern its visual information/acuity trade-off. To see the finest image details it should scan the world slowly, which probably happens during normal gaze fixation. But gaze fixation cannot be too slow; otherwise, adaptation would fade vision. Conversely, by locomoting faster, in a saccadic or bursty fashion, visual information capture in time is increased (see also: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Juusola and de Polavieja, 2003</xref>), while surprisingly little spatial details about its surroundings would be lost.</p><p>This viewing strategy corresponds well with the recent human psychophysics results and modeling of ganglion cell firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Rucci and Victor, 2015</xref>), which indicate that microsaccades and ocular drift in the foveal region of the retina actively enhance perception of spatial details (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Rucci <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Poletti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Rucci and Victor, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, here our findings further imply that, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the extraction of phasic stimulus features, which characterize object boundaries and line elements in visual scenes, already starts during sampling and integration of visual information in the microvilli, at the first processing stage (rather than later on in the retinal network or in the brain).</p><p>Our results make a general prediction about the optimal viewing strategy for maximizing information capture from the world. Animals should fixate gaze on darker features, as this resensitizes photoreceptors by relieving their refractory sampling units (<italic>e.g.</italic> microvilli). And then, rapidly move gaze across to brighter image areas, as saccadic crossings over high-contrast boundaries enhance information intake by increasing photoreceptors’ sample (quantum bump) rate changes/time (Appendix 9).</p><p>Given the high occurrence of eye/head-saccades in animals with good vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Land, 1999</xref>), it seems plausible that their photoreceptors could also have adapted encoding dynamics to quicken response modulation, reducing motion blur.

The used test stimuli was based upon 5 different 2 s long Gaussian white-noise light intensity time series patterns (generated by Matlab’s randn-function), which had ‘flat’ power spectrum up to 20, 50, 100, 200, or 500 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), as low-pass filtered by MATLAB's filter toolbox, and the same peak-to-peak modulation (two units). These were then superimposed on four backgrounds: BG0 (0 units, dark), BG0.5 (0.5 units), BG1 (one unit) or BG1.5 (1.5 units, bright) on a linear intensity scale, giving altogether 20 unique stimulus patterns. As the two lowest backgrounds clipped downwards-modulation, prolonging dark intervals, the resulting stimuli ranged from high-contrast bursts (c = ΔI/I ~ 1.46 at BG0) to low-contrast Gaussian (c ~ 0.22 at BG1.5).</p><p>As further controls, we tested how well R1-R6 photoreceptors responded to dark contrast bursts of different bandwidths (Appendix 9) and to their bright counterparts.

Phototransduction occurs within a photoreceptor’s light-sensitive part, the rhabdomere, which contains 30,000 photon sampling units, microvilli (blue bristles). Each microvillus contains a full phototransduction cascade reactions, and can transduce single photon energies (green dots) into unitary responses, quantum bumps (QB or samples) of variable amplitudes. (<bold>A</bold>) In the first module, 30,000 microvilli sample incoming photons. The light input, as photons/s, is randomly distributed over them (each row of open circles indicate photons being absorbed by a single microvillus). (<bold>B</bold>) In the second module, the successfully absorbed photons in each microvillus are transduced into QBs (a row of unitary events). In each microvillus, the success of transducing a photon into a QB depends upon the refractoriness of its phototransduction reactions. This means that a microvillus cannot respond to the next photons until its phototransduction reactions have recovered from the previous photon absorption, which takes about 50–300 ms. The photons hitting a refractory microvillus cannot evoke QBs, but will be lost. (<bold>C</bold>) In the third module, QBs from all the microvilli then integrate the dynamic macroscopic LIC. Conversely, the light input (green trace) can be reconstructed by adding up all the photons distributed across the 30,000 microvilli.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-26117-app1-fig1-v2"/></fig></sec><sec id="s7-3"><title>Main framework</title><p>We used our previously published biophysical <italic>Drosophila</italic> R1-R6 model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Song and Juusola, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Juusola et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Song et al., 2016</xref>) to simulate voltage responses to time series of light intensities.

Conversely, this further means that by knowing the number of microvilli and their average QB waveform, latency distribution, and refractory period distributions, we can closely predict a fly photoreceptor’s macroscopic response to any given light intensity time series stimulus (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). The same model can then be applied to estimate how well the real photoreceptor output resolves moving objects (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8G–I and</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref><bold>; Appendix 8</bold> gives the details of this approach).</p></sec><sec id="s7-4-2"><title>Deterministic empirical fly photoreceptor models</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Fit parameters to specific stimulus sets</p></list-item><list-item><p>Predict less accurately responses to new stimuli of different input statistics (to which the models have not been tuned to before)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cannot provide deep mechanistic understanding of how photoreceptors sample light information</p></list-item></list><p>In the conventional empirical ‘black-box’ approaches, the photoreceptor models’ filters, such as linear and nonlinear kernels, and static nonlinearities are adjusted to minimize the difference between the recorded responses and the model output to a specific stimulus set (light condition) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">French et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Juusola et al., 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Juusola and French, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Friederich et al., 2009</xref>).

Explicitly, the models lack intrinsic structural information of how quantum bump dynamics and microvilli refractoriness must differ during different stimuli. For example, Volterra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">French et al., 1993</xref>) kernels estimated for Gaussian white-noise stimulation will predict less accurately responses to bursty light inputs. This is because during bursty light stimulation the fly photoreceptors’ quantal information sampling dynamics rapidly adapt to a different regime, where their microvilli (sampling units) are less refractory. Hence, the real photoreceptors now integrate macroscopic responses from larger sample (QB) rate changes of enhanced rise and decay dynamics. To appropriately approximate these new dynamics, the empirical models would need to generate new kernels of different temporal profiles, which is impossible without retuning the model parameters. Accordingly, without the biophysical knowledge being implemented in their mathematical structure, the classic dynamic photoreceptor models fail to predict how well the real photoreceptors resolve moving objects (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, Appendix 6 and Appendix 8).</p></sec></sec></boxed-text></sec></app><app id="appendix-2"><title>Appendix 2 </title><sec id="s8" sec-type="appendix"><title>Information maximization by photomechanical adaptations and connectivity</title><boxed-text><sec id="s8-1"><title>Overview</title><p>This appendix describes how the ‘stochastic adaptive visual information sampling’-theory (Appendix 1) predicts and explains the roles of R1-R6 photoreceptors’ photomechanical adaptations and network connections in information maximization at different stimulus conditions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>.</p><p>In this appendix:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We test the hypotheses that photomechanical adaptations (intracellular pupil and rhabdomere contractions; see Appendix 7) and network connections in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye contribute importantly to optimizing the capture and representation of visual information.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We first estimate through simulations how a R1-R6 photoreceptor’s intracellular pupil and rhabdomere contractions are jointly optimized for maximal information sampling by its 30,000 microvilli.

Notice that the optimal light intensity is the same for the different bandwidth (20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 Hz) stimuli within one BG. But for each BG (BG0, BG0.5, BG1 and BG1.5) this optimum is different. For example, for BG0, which results in bursty (high-contrast) stimulation, the optimal light intensity level is ~8×10<sup>5</sup> photons/s.

In other words, if the photomechanical screening mechanisms set the light input intensity for maximal information capture, as is our hypothesis, then these light intensity values should also closely approximate the actual photon absorption changes that drive phototransduction in the real experiments (as recorded intracellularly from wild-type R1-R6 photoreceptors, which have the normal pupil mechanism and photomechanical rhabdomere contractility; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Because GWN lacks long dark contrasts, refractory microvilli have fewer chances to recover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Song and Juusola, 2014</xref>). Consequently, photoreceptor output to GWN begins to show signs of saturation at lower light intensity levels. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig3">Appendix 2—figure 3E</xref> shows responses to 100 Hz bandwidth GWN with the mean intensity of 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> (blue) or 8 × 10<sup>5</sup> (black) effective photons/s, respectively. Both responses are about the same size, but the one to the brighter stimulation carries less high-frequency modulation. As more microvilli become refractory, smaller sample rate changes (modulation) map light changes into macroscopic responses. (How refractoriness dynamically modulates bump counts and macroscopic response waveforms was analyzed in detail recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Song and Juusola, 2014</xref>), and thus is not repeated here). Hence, the response to the brighter GWN (black/grey) has lower and narrower signal-to-noise ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig3">Appendix 2—figure 3F</xref>) over the frequency range than the responses to the 8-times less bright GWN (blue).

But to minimize their impact on encoding GWN, the photomechanical screening needs to be more restrictive, letting in less light. With brightening 100 Hz GWN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig3">Appendix 2—figure 3H</xref>), the model’s information transfer rate first steeply increases until its peak (<italic>R<sub>max</sub></italic> = 369 ± 15 bits/s; marked by a circle) at 10<sup>5</sup> photons/s, and then swiftly declines as progressively more microvilli become refractory and fewer samples are being produced. The corresponding transfer rate estimate for 8 × 10<sup>5</sup> photons/s GWN is 249 ± 17 bits/s (square). Notice, however, that although these results quantify the optimal photon absorption rate for generating maximally informative responses to GWN, such performance is far from the models’ estimated information capacity of 631 bits/s (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig3">Appendix 2—figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s8-6"><title>Simulations’ maximal information transfer largely match those of recordings</title><p>We next compare the maximum information transfer rate estimates (squares) of the model simulations to those of corresponding <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings (circles) for all BG0 (bursts) and BG1 (GWN) stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig4">Appendix 2—figure 4</xref>).

This is because the signal and noise components of the input and output may deviate from the expected Gaussian by different amounts. Even though we used systematically the same amount of data for both estimates (20 × 2,000 data points), in the cases where light distribution is skewed (bursty stimuli) but the photoreceptor output is more Gaussian, it is possible that Shannon’s equation would underestimate input but not (or less so) output information, causing us to overestimate efficiency.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Small data chunks limit analyses. In the past, we have compared information transfer rate estimates, as obtained by Shannon’s equation to those estimated through the triple extrapolation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Juusola and de Polavieja, 2003</xref>), which is directly derived from Shannon’s information theory. For ergodic data of different distributions, and when appropriately applied, both methods provided similar estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Juusola and de Polavieja, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Song and Juusola, 2014</xref>). However, the triple extrapolation method works best with large sets of data; preferably containing ≥30 responses to the same stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Juusola and de Polavieja, 2003</xref>). In the current study, because of the practical limitations (to map a photoreceptor’s whole encoding space within a reasonable time), all the selected recordings and simulations consisted responses to 20 stimulus repetitions. This data size was deemed insufficient for an accurate estimate comparison between the two methods and was not done here. In the analyses, to provide fair comparison between simulations and recordings in all tested conditions, all the data chunks (for the recordings, simulations and stimuli) were exactly the same size (20 × 2,000 points) and they were processed systematically in the same way (apart from the two exceptions we discuss next). Therefore, the data-size bias should be under control and the results comparable within these limits.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Implementation of Shannon’s equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6">Equation A2.1</xref>) in digital computers typically requires windowing of the data chunks (for signal and noise) before calculating their power spectra though Fast Fourier Transfer (FFT). Windowing combats spectral leakage (smearing), but this affects especially low-frequency signals, in which information content is low. So this trade-off can be considered reasonable, and its effect on most performance estimates is marginal. But here as the input and output information transfer is calculated separately, windowing affects more 20 Hz GWN light input than its corresponding photoreceptor output. This is because windowing clips lower frequency power from 20 Hz GWN input, whereas in the simulated and real voltage responses much of this power is nonlinearly translated (through adaptation) to higher frequencies, including those over 20 Hz. The simulated light input, of course, carries no information on frequencies &gt; 20 Hz, but now it has also lost in windowing some of its low-frequency modulation, which the photoreceptors could translate into high-frequency voltage modulation (note, photomechanical phase enhancement can further contribute to this nonlinearity, see Appendix 3). For the two lowest intensity levels only, we judge that because of this methodological bias, the efficiency estimates for the 20 Hz GWN input-output data became unrealistic by a small margin of 10–40 bits/s, implying that <italic>R<sub>output</sub></italic> &gt; <italic>R<sub>input</sub></italic>. Therefore, for data to these two stimuli only, we applied box-car windowing (instead of the normal Blackman-Harris type), to retain its low frequency information content, and so to reduce this bias.</p></list-item></list><p>Because of all these possible error and bias sources, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptor’s encoding efficiency (<italic>η</italic>) estimates given in this publication must be considered as upper bounds. Nonetheless, for real photoreceptors, it is realistic to expect their maxima to approach 100%, and in some cells (likely R6s) be beyond, for the tested low-frequency stimuli (20 Hz). This is because of the extra information from the network, which is missing from the simulated mean photon absorption estimates. (Note that in the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, the light source emits at each moment 100–10,000-times more photons than what can be absorbed by the tested photoreceptor.

We found that about 50% of photoreceptors, in which receptive fields were scanned more than once (8/18 wild-type and 8/16 mutant cells), displayed similar retinal movements in the range of 1–3.5<sup>o</sup>. Moreover, these movements occurred in both front-to-back and back-to-front directions, validating that they were not equipment related artefacts; for example, not caused by gravitational drift in the 25 light-point stimulus array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig2">Appendix 4—figure 2</xref>).</p><p>It has been suggested that recordings from damaged fly photoreceptors may result in (i) extraordinarily wide acceptance angles, (ii) diminishing sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib203">Wilson, 1975</xref>), or (iii) markedly asymmetrical receptive fields, attributed to artificial electrical coupling between neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Smakman and Stavenga, 1987</xref>).

Their characteristics in the dark- and moderately light-adapted states, and after prolonged light stimulation, were compared to test the hypothesis that spatial information summation in the lamina contributes to <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptor function. We found that the dark-adapted wild-type R1-R6s show wider receptive fields. But in steady illlumination, the two photoreceptor groups’ ∆ρ-estimates adapted similarly.</p><p>Could the difference between the dark-adapted wild-type and <italic>hdc<sup>JK910</sup></italic> receptive field widths result from recording artefacts? It is well known that LMCs’ hyperpolarizing intracellular responses to light pulses depolarize the surrounding extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Shaw, 1975</xref>), seen as the on-transient in the electroretinogram (ERG) recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Heisenberg, 1971</xref>). Theoretically, these signals could be picked up by recording microelectrodes, adding artificial components to the intracellularly measured <italic>V<sub>n</sub></italic>, and so making wild-type photoreceptors’ receptive fields appear wider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Hardie et al., 1981</xref>). However, we can essentially rule out this notion because the Gaussian functions, which quantified the actual recordings, were fitted to their real flank amplitudes rather than to zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig5">Appendix 4—figure 5</xref>). Consequently, any extra DC component would not affect the resulting ∆ρ-estimates. Furthermore, our past comparative study, which included different synaptic mutant flies, failed to find clear signs for ERG contamination in high-quality intracellular wild-type photoreceptor recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib209">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>). Whereas by lacking neurotransmitter histamine, <italic>hdc<sup>JK910</sup></italic> LMCs cannot respond to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Burg et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Melzig et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Melzig et al., 1998</xref>), and thus <italic>hdc<sup>JK910</sup></italic> photoreceptor recordings cannot be ERG contaminated. Hence, we conclude that ERG signals could only have marginal contribution to our results at most.</p><p>In fact, the dark-adapted photoreceptors’ ∆ρ-estimates constituted the most reliable data in this appendix, with the largest number of samples (n<sub>wild-type</sub> = 19, n<sub>hdc</sub> = 18 cells) obtained through consistent recording protocols. In every experiment, the receptive field assessment in the dark-adapted state was strictly the first examination, following the standard stimulus centering procedure. This minimized any potential downgrade in the recording quality or variation in the stimulation history. Notably, our estimate of WT <italic>Drosophila</italic> R1-R6 photoreceptors’ average receptive field half-width in the dark-adapted state, ∆ρ = 9.47 ± 0.36° (n = 19 cells; see <bold><italic>Method 3</italic></bold>, above), is reasonably similar to the previous estimate of 8.23 ± 0.54° (n = 11 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Gonzalez-Bellido et al., 2011</xref>), which was obtained through a less stationary recording apparatus/method with more assumptions (see <bold><italic>Method 2</italic></bold>, above).</p><p>The dominant factors determining a fly photoreceptor’s receptive field are optical, waveguide properties and, particularly for the chosen measurement method, the phototransduction characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Snyder, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Land, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">Stavenga, 2003b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">2003a</xref>). For blowflies, it has been shown that the receptive field shape can be largely derived from the optical structure dimensions with the waveguide theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Smakman et al., 1984</xref>). Given the <italic>hdc<sup>JK910</sup></italic> mutants’ seemingly normal ommatidial and rhabdomere optics, as seen <italic>in vivo</italic> (Appendix 7) and under electron microscopy (Appendix 5; R1-R6 rhabdomere diameters, <italic>d</italic>, were ~96% of the wild-type), and their wild-type like photoreceptor voltage/intensity relations to brief light pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dau et al., 2016</xref>), it is reasonable to expect that their ∆ρ-estimates would be close to wild-type. This should especially be true in light-adaptation, which is predicted to make photoreceptor output more independent of its neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atick, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib182">van Hateren, 1992c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib181">1992b</xref>). And indeed, we found ∆ρ-estimates of the light-adapted wild-type and <italic>hdc<sup>JK910</sup></italic> photoreceptors alike. But because of this conformity, the 10.9% difference between their dark-adapted acceptance angles requires an additional explanation. Although at the flanks this difference increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), it still may seem rather small when compared to the measured cell-to-cell variation within each genotype, with the respective maxima being 66% and 88% wider than the minima, and its statistical significance becomes less with fewer samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Nevertheless, the finding is conceptually important as it supports an expansion in the classic spatial vision paradigm; from the optical constraints to spatial information summation in the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib170">Stöckl et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The dark-adapted wild-type photoreceptors’ wider receptive fields are consistent with what we know about how synaptic inputs are channeled from lamina interneurons to R1-R6 axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Meinertzhagen and O'Neil, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Sinakevitch and Strausfeld, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib209">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib210">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abou Tayoun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Rivera-Alba et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the corresponding narrower receptive fields of mutant photoreceptors seem most sensibly attributed to the missing excitatory feedback modulation from their interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib209">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Nikolaev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib210">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dau et al., 2016</xref>). As shown by intracellular recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib209">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dau et al., 2016</xref>), feedforward and feedback signals dynamically contribute to photoreceptor and interneuron outputs <italic>in vivo</italic>. When the probability of light saturation is low, the stronger synaptic transmission in both pathways helps to amplify their response amplitudes.</p><p>Therefore, taken together with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dubs et al.

Theoretically, when a point-object moves uniformly across an array of photoreceptors, each cell would produce a similar response. But these responses would be displaced in time, <italic>t</italic>, which it takes for the object to travel between two adjacent cells’ receptive field centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Srinivasan and Bernard, 1975</xref>). Thus, the response of the whole array, as a collective neural representation of the moving point-object, would be a travelling pattern with a mirrored waveform. Mathematically, this can be extrapolated from a single photoreceptor’s response. We now apply this classic approach to simplify the questions about neural images of moving point-objects and compare its predictions to R1-R6s’ spatiotemporal responses.</p><p>First, we consider the problem of neural latency compensation in motion perception. This is related to the flash-lag effects observed in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Krekelberg and Lappe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Nijhawan, 2002</xref>). Due to the inevitable phototransduction delays, every sighted animal should encounter this problem and <italic>Drosophila</italic> is not an exception. At 19°C, its photoreceptors’ voltage responses rise ~10 ms from the light flash and peak 15–30 ms later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Juusola and Hardie, 2001b</xref>). Given that a fly’s saccadic turning speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Fry et al., 2003</xref>) in flight can exceed 1000 <sup>o</sup>/s, such delays need compensating by network computations. Otherwise, neural images of its surroundings could lag behind their actual positions by more than 25<sup>o</sup>, making fast and accurate visual behaviors seemingly infeasible.</p><p>Such compensations have been shown to occur early on in vertebrate eyes. In the tiger salamander and rabbit retina, ganglion cells’ firing rates lag behind flashing but not moving bars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berry et al., 1999</xref>). Whether similar processing happens in insect eyes is unknown. By analyzing <italic>Calliphora</italic>, wild-type <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>hdc<sup>JK910</sup></italic> R1-R6 output to a point-object crossing their receptive fields, we find their time-to-peak values broadly similar to those evoked by light flashes. Therefore, these lag times are not, or at most weakly, compensated by the signal spread between photoreceptors.</p><p>Second, we examine whether R1-R6 output to point-object motion displays directional preference, as suggested by the asymmetric synaptic feedback to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Meinertzhagen and O'Neil, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Rivera-Alba et al., 2011</xref>). While both L1 and L2 monopolar cells mediate a major neural pathway in the lamina, L2s show richer connectivity. Only L2 projects feedback to R1-R6 and have reciprocal connections with L4, which in turn connects to L4s of the neighboring neural cartridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Braitenberg and Debbage, 1974</xref>), providing further feedback to photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Meinertzhagen and O'Neil, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Rivera-Alba et al., 2011</xref>). We find that whilst the photoreceptors’ peak responses show no clear directional preference, their rise and delay time courses to front-to-back and back-to-front moving point-objects often differ significantly. Although it is still possible that these differences may in part be augmented by the asymmetric network feedback, we show in <bold>Appendixes 7–8</bold> that they actually originate from photomechanical R1-R8 contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Hardie and Franze, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Third, we investigate whether network regulation affects R1-R6 cell’s spatiotemporal acuity. By using the classic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Srinivasan and Bernard, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Juusola and French, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Land, 1997</xref>), we estimate the theoretical blur effects and the eye’s ability to resolve bright dots moving at certain speeds. Furthermore, we apply the Volterra series, a widely used ‘black-box’ modeling method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Marmarelis and McCann, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eckert and Bishop, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Gemperlein and McCann, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Juusola et al., 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Korenberg et al., 1998</xref>), to simulate wild-type and <italic>hdc<sup>JK910</sup></italic> R1-R6 output to these point-objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Juusola et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Niven et al., 2004</xref>). Remarkably, the simulations make it clear that these models cannot predict the recordings accurately (see Appendix 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8G–I</xref>).</p><p>Spatiotemporal resolution of the eye is thought to be determined by two components with special characteristics: the static spatial resolution of light input, as channeled through the optics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Srinivasan and Bernard, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Hornstein et al., 2000</xref>), and the temporal response dynamics of photoreceptors. These characteristics are further influenced by the photoreceptors’ adaptation state and synaptic feedback. The classic approaches suggest that because wild-type R1-R6s’ acceptance angles (∆ρ) are 10.9% wider than those of <italic>hdc<sup>JK910</sup></italic> but their response dynamics are similar (see Appendix 4), they should produce blurrier images (of wider spatial half-width, <italic>S</italic>). Moreover, as <italic>hdc<sup>JK910</sup></italic> R1-R6s lack synaptic feedback modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dau et al., 2016</xref>), their predicted higher acuity should reflect differences in spatiotemporal photon sampling dynamics. Our recordings show, however, that both wild-type and <italic>hdc<sup>JK910</sup></italic> R1-R6s resolve moving dots at least twice as well what the classic theory predicts, and that any resolvability difference between these cells largely disappears against a lit background. Thus, in dim conditions, lateral summation within the network may sensitize R1-R6 output by trading-off acuity, whereas in bright conditions more independent photoreceptor output sharpens neural images. Nonetheless, the classic theory cannot account for these dynamics, as it greatly overestimates the effect of motion blur on photoreceptor output.</p><p>We later demonstrate in <bold>Appendixes 7–8</bold> how and why the model simulations (of this appendix) differ from the corresponding recordings. Essentially, this is because the classic theoretical approaches do not incorporate two interlinked biophysical mechanisms that are critical for high acuity. (<bold>i</bold>) Rapid photomechanical photoreceptor contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Hardie and Franze, 2012</xref>) accentuate light input dynamically by shifting (front-to-back) and narrowing the cell’s receptive field as moving bright point-objects enter in its view. While (<bold>ii</bold>) stochastic refractory photon sampling by microvilli accentuates the temporal dynamics in R1-R6 output. These mechanisms work together to improve the acuity and resolvability of moving objects far beyond the predictions of the classic models.</p></sec><sec id="s12-3"><title>Moving visual stimuli</title><p>The 25 light-point array and LEDs pads, which we used for creating images of moving objects and providing ambient illumination, respectively, are described in Appendix 4.

The model simulations, and hence its underlying classic theory, always predicted lower resolvability than what we saw in the actual recordings. Further investigations (<bold>Appendixes 7–8</bold>) revealed that this discrepancy reflected the missing biophysical mechanisms of the empirical black-box models (see Appendix 1). Specifically, the used photoreceptor models lacked: (<bold>i</bold>) the photomechanical rhabdomere movements, which shift and narrow a R1-R6’s receptive fields, and (<bold>ii</bold>) the refractory sampling, which allows many microvilli (after the first dot) to recover from refractoriness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Song and Juusola, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Juusola et al., 2015</xref>) to respond to the second dot.

We found that both wild-type and <italic>hdc<sup>JK910</sup></italic> photoreceptors resolved moving dots nearly equally well, and significantly better than the corresponding deterministic simulations. These findings demonstrate that the classic dynamic photoreceptor models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Srinivasan and Bernard, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Juusola and French, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Land, 1997</xref>), which lack knowledge about the underlying phototransduction biophysics and photomechanics, grossly underestimate the spatiotemporal resolution of the real cells.</p><p>Animals counter self-motion blur effects by moving their eyes. This compensates for head and body movements by keeping the neural image position near stationary as long as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Land, 1999</xref>). Interestingly here, a fly photoreceptor’s response to two moving point-objects represents an opposite case where image motion, in fact, improves acuity. In the classic theory, to resolve two stationary objects, at least three photoreceptors are required so that the intensity difference in between can be detected. Because <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptors’ interommatidial angles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Land, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Gonzalez-Bellido et al., 2011</xref>) vary from 3.4<sup>o</sup> to 9.0<sup>o</sup> and their average acceptance angle is ~9.5<sup>o</sup> (Appendix 4), its eye should not resolve two point-objects 6.8<sup>o</sup> apart. Nevertheless, responses of single photoreceptors, during even very fast (saccadic-speed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Geurten et al., 2014</xref>) movements, show large enough dips (in their temporal dynamics) to indicate that the objects are resolved neurally. In the classic theory instead, the outputs of several adjacent photoreceptors had to be processed together to distinguish two moving point-objects from one stationary object, in which brightness changes over time. This example highlights the inseparability of spatiotemporal information processing and acuity.</p><p>The unique advantages of the present study were the bespoke equipment and stimulus paradigm. These allowed high-quality photoreceptor recordings with precisely controlled moving point-objects stimulation. Therefore, we could directly test and compare the theoretically predicted relationship between the neural image resolution and the object speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Srinivasan and Bernard, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Juusola and French, 1997</xref>) to the experimental data. However, the equipment also had limitations to be improved in future research. Wider object speed range is necessary, especially for testing insect eyes with fast responses. Owing to the long transient time, each light-point now required 2 ms switching period. Consequently, the minimum travelling time was 50 ms and the object speed limit in <italic>Calliphora</italic> experiments was 334 <sup>o</sup>/s, which is far slower than observed during the flies’ saccadic flight behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Schilstra and Hateren, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hateren and Schilstra, 1999</xref>) (2,000–4,000 <sup>o</sup>/s).

Because these movements have fast onset and light intensity-dependency, which are similar to those of the R1-R6 photoreceptors’ intracellular voltage responses to comparable stimuli, they must result from individual photoreceptors’ photomechanical contractions; see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Hardie and Franze, 2012</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>We show that <italic>trp</italic>/<italic>trpl</italic>-mutant photoreceptors, which have normal phototransduction reactions but lack the light-gated ion channels, also contract to light.

Because the ommatidium lens inverts images, R1-R8 photoreceptors’ receptive fields move in the opposite direction - front-to-back after light and back-to-front after darkness. Therefore, when front-to-back moving bright dots cross the eyes, the photoreceptors’ receptive fields move along.

We further show that specific cone- and pigment-cells inside each ommatidium form an aperture, which is connected to the rhabdomere tips. During light stimulation, this aperture moves laterally with the rhabdomeres but only half as much (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). And since the ommatidium lens remains practically immobile, the light beam falling upon the rhabdomeres is shaped dynamically.

Nevertheless, while elementary optics makes it clear why a horizontal rhabdomere motion must move a R1-R6’s receptive field in the opposite way, it is harder to see what physical mechanisms could narrow it.

If, on the other hand, a R1-R6’s RF was asymmetrical - say, profoundly skewed towards the front of the eye, then its response to the front-to-back moving dot might, in fact, rise earlier, or there could be little difference between the responses. Thus, it is the mathematical relationship between the scale of RF asymmetricity and the scale of the rhabdomere back-to-front movement, which ultimately sets whether a front-to-back or back-to-front stimulus would win. Notice also that dynamic photomechanical rhabdomere movements and eye muscle activity make RF recordings difficult to perform, and consequently, experimental inaccuracies and limitations can influence the results. Thus, some of the natural variations in the recordings may result from imprecise stimulation control. For example, imperfect positioning of a 25 light-point stimulus array - either off-center of a cell’s receptive field or if not aligned perfectly parallel in respect to the eye’s back-to-front axis - could bias a recording (more about this variation and the cell numbers in Appendix 6).</p><fig id="app8fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26117.097</object-id><label>Appendix 8—figure 4.</label><caption><title>The new hypothesis predicts and the recordings show that R1-R6 output rises and decays earlier to a back-to-front moving bright dot than to a front-to-back moving dot of equal velocity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A classic model with (i) a symmetrical receptive field and (ii) an immobile rhabdomere leads to identical (iii) light inputs and virtually identical (iv) photoreceptor outputs (minute differences result from stochastic photon sampling), respectively, for the dots moving in the opposite directions.

This memory accentuates certain stimulus features relative to others so that a R1-R6 samples information from different inter-dot-distance/speed-combinations differently. Ultimately, it could well be that the real R1-R6s’ refractory photon sampling statistics are adapted (through their visual lifestyle) to the statistics of moving high-resolution natural images.

Because this difference depends upon the rotation speed, it could be used for signaling changes in the fly’s heading direction or to improve visual navigation. For example, when flying across more homogenous surroundings, such as an open field with few distinctive visual landmarks, the central brain could use saccadic turns to recalibrate the fly’s head-direction in its internal world map near instantaneously; matching the intended direction to the new direction, as pointed by the global phase difference between the left and right eye signals.</p><fig id="app8fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26117.101</object-id><label>Appendix 8—figure 8.</label><caption><title>During a left saccade, signals from the left-eye lead the signals from the right-eye.</title><p>Because incoming light, in both the left and right eyes, contracts their rhabdomeres in the back-to-front direction, photoreceptors can transmit information about the field rotation or the fly’s orientation changes to the brain.

(<bold>A</bold>) During the left saccade, the flow field facing the left eye moves back-to-front (red arrow) across its photoreceptors’ receptive fields (i).

This is because bright stimulation (&gt;10<sup>6</sup> photons/s) contains too much light to be transduced by 30,000 microvilli into quantum bumps, and R1-R6s actively screen off excess photons to maximize information in their voltage output.

Notably, the responses to the opposite but equal positive and negative contrast bursts carried effectively equal information contents, underscoring the importance of contrast invariance at the primary visual encoding stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Juusola, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Juusola et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, given the fast speed of adaptation (microvilli refractoriness and dynamic quantum bump size modulation) and its photomechanical counterbalancing (<bold>Appendixes 2, 7</bold>), the sensitivity of neighboring photoreceptors across the eyes can differ greatly at any one moment, depending upon whether they face dark or bright contrasts. This realization also implies that when a fly moves its gaze in saccades, the dark and bright spatial contrast differences in the world should be automatically translated into large temporal contrast changes between the neighboring retinotopic image pixels (neuro-ommatidia).

In all these cases, the hyperpolarizing responses resolved the two dots, generating two troughs separated by a peak, but these responses were considerably smaller than those to the corresponding bright dots.

Remarkably, the extraction of phasic stimulus features, which characterize object boundaries and line elements in visual scenes, already starts during sampling and integration of visual information in the microvilli, at the first visual processing stage. The darker periods in stimuli relieve the effects of microvilli refractoriness, enabling greater sensitivity: more and slightly larger samples (quantum bumps) can be generated transiently to the next light change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

The panorama could be rotated around its vertical axis by a servomotor. Outside, the diffuse cylinder faced a surrounding ring-shaped light-tube (special full-band: 350–900 nm) that provided uniform illumination on the panorama. The light intensity during the panoramic motion stimulation, although bright, was always less (0.5–1.5 log-intensity units) than the direct stimuli used in the intracellular recordings (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s17-3"><title>Open-loop experiments</title><p>Inside the flight simulator, a flying fly saw a continuous (360<sup>o</sup>) stripe-scene (black-and-white bars) of predetermined spectral and spatial resolution, which was free of motion artefacts, flashing or aliasing.

This eight-second stimulus was repeated 10–25 times and each trial, together with the fly’s coincident yaw torque responses, was sampled at 1 kHz and stored in a PC’s hard-drive for later analysis, using custom-written software (Biosyst) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Juusola and Hardie, 2001a</xref>). Presumably to stabilize gaze, flies tend to follow the scene rotations, generating yaw torque responses (optomotor responses to right or left), the strength of which is believed to reflect the strength of their motion perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Götz, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Heisenberg and Buchner, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Wardill et al., 2012</xref>).

To verify that air flow, or some hidden features in the stimulus panorama, was not affecting optomotor responses, we used the white diffuser cylinder alone, which showed no clear contrast to human eye, as the control stimulus.

The optomotor responses of individual flies to the same repeated field rotations vary in strength and repeatability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but their visual performance to different spatial resolution stripe scenes is clearly different. These differences can be quantified by measuring the mean torque response of a single fly to stimulus repetitions and by averaging the mean responses of the many flies of the same stripe scene resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1B</xref>; here 9). This reduces noise and non-systematic (arbitrary) trends of single experiments, revealing the underlying response strength and optomotor behavior characteristics. These population responses are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> for a straightforward comparison.</p><p>In open-loop experiments, a fly’s torque response returns gradually to baseline after the optomotor stimulus stops, but this can take seconds (varying with individual flies). Accordingly, in our experiments, which contain only brief 2-s-long inter-stimulus-intervals, the torque responses typically recover only fractionally (10–70%) during these still periods toward the baseline. Therefore, for comparing the optomotor behavior different stripe scene resolutions, we used the maximum range (or peak-to-peak) of the torque response, evoked by the combined leftward and rightward field rotation stimulus. The maximum range and variability in the torque responses to the same optomotor stimulus are shown with controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>, respectively.</p><p>Markedly, the optomotor responses to hyperacute stripe-scenes were not caused by aliasing. This is because perceptual aliasing (such as the wagon-wheel effect or Moiré patterns), if induced by the rotating hyperacute scenes, would have been perceived as slowed down image rotation, eventually reversing to the opposite direction (the reverse rotation effect). And thus, if the tested flies had seen such motion patterns, they would have consequently followed them slower and rotated against the real scene rotation direction. Such optomotor behavior was never observed in our experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s17-4"><title>Why did the previous behavioral studies not find hyperacute vision?</title><p>In 1976, Buhner probed <italic>Drosophila</italic>’s visual acuity by stimulating the upper frontal part in one of its eyes with small local moving grating patterns (covering about 50 ommatidia) while a fly walked on track-ball (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buchner, 1976</xref>).

Both reviewers appreciated the depth with which the paper tackled a number of important issues. The work in the paper has an opportunity both to make an important point about the relation between eye movements and visual acuity and to become a reference on a number of issues about fly vision. To reach these dual goals, however, the work in the paper needs to be presented more clearly. Several options emerged from discussions among the editors and reviewers, including splitting the work in the paper into two related papers, with the intention that they would appear back-to-back, or revising the paper to into account suggestions in the individual reviews (below). Most important in considering the revisions is to target the paper or papers to a broad audience and to deliver the message in a way that is broadly accessible. These and some other points are elaborated below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is a difficult paper to evaluate. I am not an expert on insect vision, but struggled more than I should have to follow the main arguments. I will leave detailed comments for the more expert reviewers, and focus primarily on accessibility. The paper contains several interesting ideas. Unfortunately, the data and analysis supporting these ideas is sufficiently spread out that it is very hard to follow and evaluate. I also felt that some of the essential aspects of the paper were not developed sufficiently.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Stimulus manipulations in experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>The results illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> are interpreted in terms of changes in stimuluscontrast, &quot;burstiness&quot; and temporal frequency. But the mean light level is also changing substantially, which confounds interpretation of these experiments. Either a clear explanation for why the mean is not important needs to be given or the data needs to be interpreted with this in mind.</p><p>2) Hyperacuity introduced late and not clearly connected to sampling.</p><p>The focus of the paper, from the title, is on visual acuity. Yet the underlying data only starts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. This is part of a more general issue of the number of ideas packed into the paper, and the difficulty as a reader in keeping track of the key points. This is exacerbated because the relation between the key ideas is not clear (e.g. how the sampling and signal to noise experiments from the first figures relate to the acuity experiments at the end of results). I appreciate the comprehensiveness of the paper, but worry that few readers will make it through.</p><p>3) Information and coding efficiency calculations.</p><p>The description of the coding efficiency measurements is quite spread out in the paper. Parts of it are in Results, Materials and methods and in the Appendices. Further, the measure is introduced (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) before the relevant calculations are described. In addition to these issues about presentation, the calculations assume Gaussian signals and noise (i.e. for Equation 1 to hold). This is clearly not the case. Is the non-Gaussian nature of the signal (and possibly noise) an issue and if so how much is it likely to bias the information calculations and efficiency measures?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and sampling of inputs via natural movements.</p><p>The differences between the intensities sampled for saccades and a linear sampling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> are quite small. It is hard to know how much importance to place on such small differences.</p><p>5) Speed tuning of behavior.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> makes clear predictions about the speed dependence of spatial resolution. The behavioral experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> would be enhanced greatly if these predictions were tested; if there are reasons that this is difficult, a discussion of why would be helpful.</p><p>6) Appendices and supplementary material.</p><p>There is a good deal of information central to the paper in the Appendices. It is unclear how much of this repeats previous papers and how much is new. I did not have time to evaluate the appendices. Is it possible to reduce them substantially in length by referencing out pieces?</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Understanding the inputs to a sensory system is fundamental to any quantitative of neural processing. The fruit fly visual system has fundamentally enlightened our understanding both of invertebrate phototransduction mechanisms and, more recently, has provided a number of important insights into neural computation. However, despite an extensive body of work spanning more than 50 years, Juusola and colleagues convincingly demonstrate that a property of the system as fundamental as acuity has been incompletely understood.</p><p>In this monumental work, Juusola and colleagues systematically measure and model photoreceptor responses to light across a wide range of viewing conditions and substantially extend our understanding. More specifically, by quantitatively modeling and measuring a combination of electrical signals and rhadomere movements, combined with behavior, the authors demonstrate that the fly retina offers a much high acuity view of the world than previous appreciated, and that the saccadic structure of fly movements may play a central role in enhancing acuity, a finding that runs contrary to accepted intuition.</p><p>This work is substantial, spanning 48 figures and more than 200 pages, making it both challenging to grasp in its entirety, and certain to emerge as the go-to reference standard in this field. I am therefore strongly supportive of its publication. I have only a small number of conceptual points where I believe the authors overstate the implications of their case, which I believe can be readily addressed by changes to the text. These issues are as follows:</p><p>1) The role of network connections to &quot;add&quot; information. In multiple places in the text, the authors refer to the ability of network connections to add information (for example, in the discussion of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> &quot;extra network information…is mostly at high burst frequencies&quot; and &quot;the real R1-R6 cells receive extra information from their neighbors&quot;). The stimuli the authors use to make this point are spatially homogenous; as a result, the only possible role that lateral synaptic connections can possibly play in enhancing the SNR/infomax of the system is through additional averaging of independent photoreceptor estimates of photon count. If this is correct, please make this point more transparent in the text. If this is incorrect, please explain how the network can provide additional information. Is it also correct to infer that if the lateral connections are really enhancing infomax/bitrate of photoreceptors, these lateral synaptic connections must contribute substantially little noise themselves? Can the authors comment on this from their data? In the same vein, the authors note that inputs from R7 and R8 would also contribute additional information. However, while this is true for R8, it is unlikely to be true for R7 under the conditions used by the authors (in which the white LED used is unlikely to have a significant UV component to drive R7).</p><p>2) As far as I can tell, the authors have no evidence to support the role for network connection asymmetries to produce differences in response in photoreceptors to motion in different directions. And despite the striking connectivity of L2 and L4, which has inspired a number of different functional models over the last 40 years, none of these models have received strong experimental support. Therefore please truncate this discussion in Appendix 6.</p><p>3) I am also unclear of the evidence in support of the phasic differences in inputs from the two eyes having information relevant to &quot;measuring directional changes in the visual space, in respect to its head direction&quot; (Figure 46). That is, while I agree that the photoreceptor movement should produce such a phase lag to rotational stimuli, I don't see a circumstance in which this lag would add any new information to the representation of the direction of movement that isn't already available from monocular inputs. Either articulate a circumstance under which detecting this phase delay would provide useful, unique information, or reduce the speculation.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> – It appears that the authors examined responses to only six different natural scenes. How were these samples chosen? How representative are they of the image statistics in the van Hateren database? I could imagine how scenes with different spatial structure (particularly lower spatial frequency structure) would tend to bring contrast features into ideal sampling range at different turn velocities (notwithstanding the ability of saccades to make sampling shorter). Does this either match any existing data on saccade statistics, or make any predictions for future studies?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Microsaccadic sampling of moving image information provides <italic>Drosophila</italic> hyperacute vision&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Both reviewers felt the paper had improved. At the same time, several issues remain and we cannot reach a final decision until those are taken care of. In discussion, both reviewers felt these issues were important.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is a rereview of a paper about coding of naturalistic inputs by fly photoreceptors. The paper has improved in revision, but several substantial issues remain. These and some smaller points follow:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> stimulus.</p><p>The new paragraph added on line 161 did not really answer the concern about whether changes in information rate could be attributed to contrast and burstiness, or whether the (changing) mean also should be considered. The argument in that paragraph is certainly reasonable, but is suggestive rather than a real test of the issue. It seems to me that the stimulus design confounds changes in mean and contrast – and acknowledging that and the resulting difficulty in knowing what controls the responses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> would be quite helpful.</p><p>Information calculations.</p><p>I still have two concerns about the information calculations. First, testing for gaussian-distributed amplitudes for signal and noise is not a good test of whether the distributions are actually gaussian, since that also requires randomness of the phases of the different frequency components (e.g. a perfectly deterministic and periodic stimulus could have a gaussian amplitude distribution). Second, the argument that the Shannon formula is reasonable for highly non-gaussian responses cites previous work which, at least to my understanding, relies on extrapolation to obtain good estimates of information rates. It is not clear if that procedure was followed here, and if not whether the past work can be used to validate the current approach.</p><p>Histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>.</p><p>I asked previously about the small differences between the linear and saccadic walk distributions in this figure.

I am not an expert on insect vision, but struggled more than I should have to follow the main arguments. I will leave detailed comments for the more expert reviewers, and focus primarily on accessibility. The paper contains several interesting ideas. Unfortunately, the data and analysis supporting these ideas is sufficiently spread out that it is very hard to follow and evaluate. I also felt that some of the essential aspects of the paper were not developed sufficiently.</italic> </p><p>To make it easier for a reader to follow the arguments and to obtain a new integrated viewpoint of saccadic information sampling, we now briefly introduce its key discoveries in the beginning of the Results section, and indicate where these are explained in detail. The reviewer’s concern that some essential aspects were not developed sufficiently is addressed in our following responses to each raised point.</p><p><italic>Major points:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Stimulus manipulations in experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</italic></p><p><italic>The results illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> are interpreted in terms of changes in stimuluscontrast, &quot;burstiness&quot; and temporal frequency. But the mean light level is also changing substantially, which confounds interpretation of these experiments. Either a clear explanation for why the mean is not important needs to be given or the data needs to be interpreted with this in mind.</italic> </p><p>Our response: we have now added a new paragraph to make this point clearer:</p><p>“Notably, whilst all the stimuli were very bright, the largest responses (to bursts) were induced at the dimmest background (BG0, darkness) and the smallest responses (to GWN) at the brightest background (BG1.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). […] More important for good vision are the stimulus contrast and bandwidth, which drive the dynamic quantum bump rate changes, summing up the photoreceptor output.”</p><p><italic>2) Hyperacuity introduced late and not clearly connected to sampling.</italic></p><p><italic>The focus of the paper, from the title, is on visual acuity. Yet the underlying data only starts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. This is part of a more general issue of the number of ideas packed into the paper, and the difficulty as a reader in keeping track of the key points. This is exacerbated because the relation between the key ideas is not clear (e.g. how the sampling and signal to noise experiments from the first figures relate to the acuity experiments at the end of results). I appreciate the comprehensiveness of the paper, but worry that few readers will make it through.</italic> </p><p>We have made many changes/additions/edits to link the key ideas better.</p><p>· The paper has new title: “Seeing through moving eyes – microsaccadic information sampling provides <italic>Drosophila</italic> hyperacute vision”.</p><p>· To make it easier to understand the paper’s various results and to obtain a new integrated viewpoint of saccadic information sampling, the Abstract ends now:” These discoveries elucidate how acuity depends upon photoreceptor function and eye movements.”</p><p>· We now also spell out the value of this study (Introduction, the last sentence), highlighting its dual contributions to the field:” By demonstrating how fly photoreceptors’ fast microsaccadic information sampling provides hyperacute vision, these results change our understanding of insect vision, whilst showing an important relationship between eye movements and visual acuity.”</p><p>· And perhaps most importantly, we now briefly introduce and link its main results in a new results summary.</p><p><italic>3) Information and coding efficiency calculations.</italic></p><p><italic>The description of the coding efficiency measurements is quite spread out in the paper. Parts of it are in Results, Materials and methods and in the Appendices. Further, the measure is introduced (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) before the relevant calculations are described. In addition to these issues about presentation, the calculations assume Gaussian signals and noise (i.e. for Equation 1 to hold). This is clearly not the case. Is the non-Gaussian nature of the signal (and possibly noise) an issue and if so how much is it likely to bias the information calculations and efficiency measures?</italic> </p><p>To address this concern, we have added a new paragraph:</p><p>“There are two reasons why these information rate estimates, which were calculated from equal-sized datasets by the Shannon formula (Eq. 1, Material and Methods), should be robust and largely bias-free. […] Thus here, the Shannon formula should provide a sufficiently accurate information estimate also for the 20 Hz high-contrast burst responses, making this evaluation fair (see Appendix 2).”</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and sampling of inputs via natural movements.</italic></p><p><italic>The differences between the intensities sampled for saccades and a linear sampling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> are quite small. It is hard to know how much importance to place on such small differences.</italic> </p><p>In Appendix 3, Figure 18—figure supplement 1, we compare six examples of such differences from six different naturalistic images. Each one shows similar behaviour, indicating that these differences are both consistent and predictable for saccadic viewing.</p><p><italic>5) Speed tuning of behavior.</italic></p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> makes clear predictions about the speed dependence of spatial resolution. The behavioral experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> would be enhanced greatly if these predictions were tested; if there are reasons that this is difficult, a discussion of why would be helpful.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this useful suggestion, which made <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> stronger. We performed new experiments and added new subfigures D-F to show this data. We now write: “Moreover, when a fine-grained (3.9o) panoramic image was rotated faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>), the response declined as predicted (cf. two dots 4<sup>o</sup> apart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). This result is consistent with photoreceptor output setting the perceptual limit for vision and demonstrates that <italic>Drosophila</italic> see hyperacute details even at saccadic speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10D-F</xref>).”</p><p><italic>6) Appendices and supplementary material.</italic></p><p><italic>There is a good deal of information central to the paper in the Appendices. It is unclear how much of this repeats previous papers and how much is new. I did not have time to evaluate the appendices. Is it possible to reduce them substantially in length by referencing out pieces?</italic> </p><p>We believe this would make our paper less accessible, as each Appendix is very carefully constructed to clearly explain the new concepts and methods of this study. However, we have edited the Appendixes carefully to further increase their clarity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>1) The role of network connections to &quot;add&quot; information. In multiple places in the text, the authors refer to the ability of network connections to add information (for example, in the discussion of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> &quot;extra network information…is mostly at high burst frequencies&quot; and &quot;the real R1-R6 cells receive extra information from their neighbors&quot;). The stimuli the authors use to make this point are spatially homogenous; as a result, the only possible role that lateral synaptic connections can possibly play in enhancing the SNR/infomax of the system is through additional averaging of independent photoreceptor estimates of photon count. If this is correct, please make this point more transparent in the text. If this is incorrect, please explain how the network can provide additional information. Is it also correct to infer that if the lateral connections are really enhancing infomax/bitrate of photoreceptors, these lateral synaptic connections must contribute substantially little noise themselves? Can the authors comment on this from their data? In the same vein, the authors note that inputs from R7 and R8 would also contribute additional information. However, while this is true for R8, it is unlikely to be true for R7 under the conditions used by the authors (in which the white LED used is unlikely to have a significant UV component to drive R7).</italic> </p><p>These clarifying points are now integrated in the corresponding paragraph.</p><p>“In other words, since our stimuli (from a white LED) were spatially homogenous, these synaptic feedbacks should be able to enhance the system’s signal-to-noise by averaging the photoreceptors’ independent photon count estimates from the same visual area, reducing noise (Zheng et al., 2006; Juusola and Song, 2017).”</p><p>”And yet whilst R7s also share gap-junctions with R6s (Shaw et al., 1989), our stimuli contained little UV component to drive them.”</p><p><italic>2) As far as I can tell, the authors have no evidence to support the role for network connection asymmetries to produce differences in response in photoreceptors to motion in different directions. And despite the striking connectivity of L2 and L4, which has inspired a number of different functional models over the last 40 years, none of these models have received strong experimental support. Therefore please truncate this discussion in Appendix 6.</italic> </p><p>This is now truncated as suggested. See the new reduced discussion in Appendix 6.</p><p><italic>3) I am also unclear of the evidence in support of the phasic differences in inputs from the two eyes having information relevant to &quot;measuring directional changes in the visual space, in respect to its head direction&quot; (Figure 46). That is, while I agree that the photoreceptor movement should produce such a phase lag to rotational stimuli, I don't see a circumstance in which this lag would add any new information to the representation of the direction of movement that isn't already available from monocular inputs. Either articulate a circumstance under which detecting this phase delay would provide useful, unique information, or reduce the speculation.</italic> </p><p>We have now extended this point. Appendix 8:</p><p>“The microsaccadic sampling-hypothesis predicts that image rotation causes a phasic difference in photoreceptor outputs between the left and the right eye, with the signals always arriving slightly faster from the eye, towards which the fly rotates. Because this difference depends upon the rotation speed, it could be used for signaling changes in the fly’s heading direction or to improve visual navigation. For example, when flying across more homogenous surroundings, such as an open field with few distinctive visual landmarks, the central brain could use saccadic turns to recalibrate the fly’s head-direction in its internal world map near instantaneously; matching the intended direction to the new direction, as pointed by the global phase difference between the left and right eye signals.”</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> – It appears that the authors examined responses to only six different natural scenes. How were these samples chosen? How representative are they of the image statistics in the van Hateren database? I could imagine how scenes with different spatial structure (particularly lower spatial frequency structure) would tend to bring contrast features into ideal sampling range at different turn velocities (notwithstanding the ability of saccades to make sampling shorter). Does this either match any existing data on saccade statistics, or make any predictions for future studies?</italic></p><p>We have added small text sections in Appendix 3 to address these useful points.</p><p>“These natural scenes were arbitrarily chosen from Google image search results, and we do not know how representative their image statistics are, for example, in respect to the van Hateren database (van Hateren, 1997a).”</p><p>“Finally, we note that it is possible that in scenes with different spatial structure (particularly lower spatial frequency structure), flies would use different turn velocities to bring contrast features into ideal sampling range (irrespective of saccades making sampling shorter). Future studies need to explore whether such a match with saccade statistics exists.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is a rereview of a paper about coding of naturalistic inputs by fly photoreceptors.

[…] And, as such, this stimulus design, by containing four different BGs, makes it difficult to see the exact contributions of contrast, bandwidth and mean in controlling the responses.”</p><p><italic>Information calculations.</italic></p><p><italic>I still have two concerns about the information calculations. First, testing for gaussian-distributed amplitudes for signal and noise is not a good test of whether the distributions are actually gaussian, since that also requires randomness of the phases of the different frequency components (e.g. a perfectly deterministic and periodic stimulus could have a gaussian amplitude distribution).

Post-generation, we tested that these inputs were spectrally white and had Gaussian distributions. Furthermore, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) we have reconfirmed that apart from the 20 Hz burst stimulus, the evoked photoreceptor signals and noises were Gaussian or very close to that. Since we had already provided the corresponding raw datasets to <italic>eLife</italic> (now in Dryad repository), we felt that there was no real need to produce extra graphs of these distributions. Finally, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) we made some longer recordings to 20 Hz bursts (having 40 stimulus repetitions, with the last 30 used in the analyses). Analysing these responses both with the Shannon method and the triple extrapolation method, which does not have Gaussian signal and noise assumptions, gives similar information rates over a broad range of reliable parameter values (in agreement with our earlier studies), endorsing the current approach and supporting the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> results. This new data/analyses are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> (see below). We have further added a new sentence in the given paragraph: “And, indeed, new tests using additional recordings to longer stimulus repetitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) indicated the same.”</p><p>· We added a brief description of the triple extrapolation in the Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>Histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>.</italic></p><p><italic>I asked previously about the small differences between the linear and saccadic walk distributions in this figure.

These differences are highly significant, as indicated by the peak-value and kurtosis differences of the corresponding histograms. Saccadic walks (all data: 6 six panoramic images x 15 horizontal line scans) Peak<sub>sac</sub> = 4478.66 ± 1424.55 vs linear walks Peak<sub>lin</sub> = 3379.98 ± 1753.44 counts (mean ± SD, p = 1.4195 x 10<sup>-32</sup>, pair-wise t-test).
