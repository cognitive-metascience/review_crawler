RAS proteins concentrate in the plasma membrane via lipid-tethers and hypervariable region side-chain interactions in distinct nano-domains. However, little is known about RAS membrane dynamics and the details of RAS activation of downstream signaling. Here, we characterize RAS in live human and mouse cells using single-molecule-tracking methods and estimate RAS mobility parameters. KRAS4b exhibits confined mobility with three diffusive states distinct from the other RAS isoforms (KRAS4a, NRAS, and HRAS); and although most of the amino acid differences between RAS isoforms lie within the hypervariable region, the additional confinement of KRAS4b is largely determined by the protein’s globular domain. To understand the altered mobility of an oncogenic KRAS4b, we used complementary experimental and molecular dynamics simulation approaches to reveal a detailed mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RAS diffusion</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>single molecule tracking</kwd><kwd>atomistic simulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH Contract HHSN261200800001E</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>De</given-names></name><name><surname>Gudla</surname><given-names>Prabhakar R</given-names></name><name><surname>Columbus</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name><name><surname>Worthy</surname><given-names>Karen</given-names></name><name><surname>Rigby</surname><given-names>Megan</given-names></name><name><surname>Mukhopadhyay</surname><given-names>Suman</given-names></name><name><surname>Powell</surname><given-names>Katie</given-names></name><name><surname>Burgan</surname><given-names>William</given-names></name><name><surname>Wall</surname><given-names>Vanessa</given-names></name><name><surname>Esposito</surname><given-names>Dominic</given-names></name><name><surname>Simanshu</surname><given-names>Dhirendra</given-names></name><name><surname>Nissley</surname><given-names>Dwight V</given-names></name><name><surname>Turbyville</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yue</given-names></name><name><surname>Lightstone</surname><given-names>Felice C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Compared to other isoforms of RAS, KRAS4b has unique membrane diffusion behavior related to its biology, and the two major domains of the protein both contribute to this diffusion behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RAS is an oncoprotein that functions as a molecular switch at the apex of a signaling network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stephen et al., 2014</xref>) regulating cell differentiation and sustaining cell proliferation, survival, and migration. In oncogenic mutants, this molecular switch mechanism is damaged, and RAS becomes constitutively active—or locked in a GTP-loaded state. In this active state, RAS is in a conformation that favors interaction with several effectors, including RAF, a serine/threonine kinase that, when complexed with RAS at the membrane, phosphorylates its substrate MEK and initiates the mitogenic-activated protein kinase signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moodie et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Van Aelst et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Warne et al., 1993</xref>). RAS biology is characterized by its dynamic association with the plasma membrane. The protein’s lateral mobility, nanoclustering of both RAS and lipid species, and interactions between specific lipid species and amino acid residues in the C-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) are all necessary for its function; however, precisely how this is regulated, and in what order events occur has not been fully characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Murakoshi et al., 2004</xref>)((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lommerse et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>RAS proteins associate with the plasma membrane (PM) through the HVR. These 22 to 23 amino acids mediate interactions with the lipid bilayer and contain key residues that are post-translationally modified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahearn et al., 2012</xref>). All RAS isoforms contain a C-terminal cysteine residue that is farnesylated and carboxymethylated. HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS4a isoforms contain one or two additional cysteine residues that can be reversibly palmitoylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In contrast to the other isoforms, KRAS4b is not palmitoylated, but contains a series of six adjacent charged lysine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). These lysines carry positive charges at a neutral pHand favor electrostatic interactions with anionic lipids, present in cellular membranes enriched with phosphatidylserine and other negatively charged lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahearn et al., 2012</xref>). These electrostatic interactions facilitate lipid-based partitioning and sorting of KRAS4b into the disordered domain of membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HMM and MSD analysis results of KRAS4b and isoforms in HeLa and MEF cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Illustration of combinations of fusion proteins between hypervariable region (HVR) and G-domain of RAS isoforms with HaloTag that were expressed in HeLa and RAS-less MEF cells. (<bold>b</bold>) Hidden Markov modeling (HMM) using vbSPT of single molecule tracking (SMT) measurements showed different mobile patterns and was described with three and two diffusive states for KRAS4b and HRAS, respectively.

The physical and chemical properties of the lipids, proteins, and associated actin cytoskeleton create a multi-tiered, hierarchical 2D structure where molecules diffuse between compartments with length scales on the order of hundreds of nanometers and encounter subdomains with smaller dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kusumi et al., 2012</xref>). Diffusing molecules such as RAS traverse these hierarchical, non-equilibrated environments, which create highly transitory, reversible and dynamic subdomains. Using single molecule FRET experiments, Marakoski and colleagues showed that the mobility of membrane-bound KRAS and HRAS was reduced upon growth factor stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Murakoshi et al., 2004</xref>). This suggests that activated or oncogenic RAS molecules become more confined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lommerse et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Murakoshi et al., 2004</xref>). These investigators have proposed models where oncogenic and activated RAS associate in signaling complexes, perhaps in association with scaffolding molecules and the actin cytoskeleton.</p><p>In this study, we use single molecule tracking to detect the mobility of RAS in living cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Using advanced optical microscopy and image analysis techniques combined with engineered cell lines expressing a variety of constructs, we characterize and dissect the relative contributions of the G-domain and the HVR region of KRAS4b to its mobility and compare it to the mobility of other RAS isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We observed that KRAS4b has more confined diffusion in the cell membrane compared to other RAS isoforms, and a unique mobility pattern that is best fit by a three-component model composed of fast, intermediate, and relatively immobile states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). By assembling a data set with thousands of trajectories from each cell, we observe transitions between these states; and consequently, we can quantify the probabilities that single molecules of RAS will change states. Intriguingly, we observe that these transitions follow a pattern that is suggestive of a molecular assembly process. We hypothesize that these states are dependent on both GTP-bound G-domain interactions and electrostatic interactions of KRAS4b’s unique, highly charged HVR. To develop a molecularly detailed understanding, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to probe the relative contributions of these domains. The results of these simulations are well correlated to our experimental results and provided further testable hypotheses that we explore in cell experiments. We propose a model where on tethering to the membrane via its farnesyl tail, KRAS4b molecules explore the membrane lipid environment in a fast-moving state. While exploring the membrane environment, negatively charged lipids cluster around the lysines in the HVR of KRAS4b forming a nanodomain. When KRAS4b molecules are GTP-loaded within these nanoclusters, KRAS4b can interact with effectors and transition to slower moving states where it can further assemble with effectors and lipids to form a relatively immobile and confined complex competent to signal downstream.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KRAS4b diffusion in live cells is characterized by a 3-state hidden Markov model</title><p>To measure KRAS4b diffusion in living cells, we used total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF), an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera which supports fast frame acquisition and high sensitivity, and bright organic dyes covalently linked to HaloTagged RAS molecules (for clarity, all molecules studied by single molecule tracking in this set up were HaloTagged, and so the HaloTagged nomenclature will be omitted in the rest of the results section), to visualize single molecules of KRAS4b in the plasma membrane at a 10 ms frame rate. Bright and photostable dyes allowed us to observe single molecules of RAS for up to seconds at a time. We used the Variational Bayes for Single Particle Tracking (vbSPT) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Persson et al., 2013</xref>), based on a hidden Markov model (HMM), to analyze the heterogeneous mobility of RAS molecules in the plasma membrane, and we identified a three-state model for KRAS4b diffusion in live cell membranes. We observed this behavior in HeLa cells, three different KRAS mutant cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells that only express one isoform of human RAS at a time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref>) In all cells tested, KRAS4b molecules show three different diffusion components. To test whether this three-component system and associated diffusion rates were dependent on RAS density, we developed a DOX-inducible KARS4b cell line to be able to control expression levels.

between states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Persson et al., 2013</xref>), which reflects how frequently KRAS4b switches between its subdiffusive states under the influence of membrane dynamics. The transition probability [Δt<sup>−1</sup>] between states for KRAS4b revealed that a direct conversion from a fast diffusing state to the slowest state, or <italic>vice versa</italic>, is over 10 times less likely than <italic>via</italic> the intermediate state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Since KRAS4b molecules must traverse an intermediate state, it implies that KRAS4b diffusion and the mobility changes it undergoes are part of an ordered process on the PM, although whether this represents an assembly or oligomerization process or whether KRAS4b itself is modifying the lipid environment is not known. Interestingly, in comparison to KRAS4b, the fraction of slow moving KRAS4a and NRAS molecules decreased markedly in cells overexpressing these isoforms and becomes lower for HRAS. For HRAS and NRAS we used a two-state diffusion model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1b, d and f</xref>) since the occupancy of the slowest diffusing species in the three-state models was less than 5%, and we believe this to be negligible background signal. Taken together, this data suggests that KRAS4b has unique diffusion characteristics in cells.</p><p>To evaluate whether the tagged RAS molecules are indeed functional we took advantage of the RAS-dependent MEF system. These cells are dependent on MAP kinase signaling for proliferation, and it is only through the re-introduction of an isoform of RAS, or through the introduction of a constitutively active form of proteins in the MAP kinase pathway, such as BRAF V600E, that the cells will re-enter the cell division cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drosten et al., 2010</xref>). This is an ideal system for evaluating the ability of specific proteins to restore the MAP kinase signaling required for their proliferation. To verify that the RAS molecules measured on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane in living cells are functionally competent, we integrated HaloTag-RAS fusion constructs in the genomic DNA of MEFs that are devoid of endogenous KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS molecules by viral transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). After transduction, we observed that the MEFs were rescued from their quiescence state and reentered the proliferation cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drosten et al., 2010</xref>). Using imaging, we observed, furthermore, that the tagged KRAS4b molecules can localize correctly to the plasma membrane. Finally, we found that the levels of pAKT, pMEK and pERK are at levels comparable to WT MEF cells as measured in western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the HaloTag fusion proteins are functional, properly localized, and sufficient to restore the appropriate signaling in the cells.</p><p>To further confirm that the overexpression of the fusion constructs is not causing any artifactual membrane association, we introduced a point mutation at the terminal cysteine residue to serine (C185S) that would stop the post-translational farnesylation of KRAS4b required for membrane association. This modification prevents stable membrane association in HeLa cells, as observed by a significant reduction in residence time at the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>). We recorded transient flashes of KRAS4b C185S molecules on the PM as opposed to longer, trackable trajectories in the wildtype protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>KRAS4b diffusion shows anomalous, confined diffusion by Mean Squared Displacement analysis</title><p>To further evaluate the unique diffusion properties of KRAS4b, we used Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) analysis to characterize the diffusion behaviors of RAS molecules in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Matysik and Kraut, 2014</xref>). In MSD plots, the curvature of the graph indicates the extent of confinement of the molecules as they diffuse in the plasma membrane—the more bent the curve, the greater the confinement. We analyzed each isoform of RAS molecule to see whether diffusion behavior reflects the heterogeneity in RAS membrane association and subdomain preferences, as we might predict based on the differential post-translational lipid modifications across all these isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In the line graphs of the four different RAS species, KRAS4b, KRAS4a, NRAS and HRAS, in HeLa and isoform-specific MEF cells, respectively, we see clear differences in the diffusion behavior of KRAS4b compared to the other isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–f</xref>). Our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and e</xref>) shows that KRAS4b has the highest level of confinement (anomalous diffusion), whereas HRAS was the least confined. Interestingly, KRAS4a and NRAS, both with one palmitoylation site, are intermediate to HRAS and KRAS4b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and e</xref>). To assess the generalizability of KRAS4b diffusion behavior, we overexpressed and evaluated KRAS4bG12D mobility in various cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), such as pancreatic cancer lines harboring endogenous mutant KRAS4bG12D, a ductal epithelial cell line, and importantly, in MEF cell lines that are devoid of any endogenous RAS protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), and in all cases, we observed similar diffusion behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The higher confinement in mobility is exclusively experienced by full length KRAS4b</title><p>Recruitment and association of RAS molecules with the PM requires the HVR, and it is in this region of the protein that the amino acid sequence differs between isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Notably, we determined that the KRAS4b HVR, when expressed as a truncation mutant without the G-domain, shows free mobility in contrast to the full-length protein, which shows confinement.

We see a linear and significant increase in the fast component diffusion rate as the positive charge density on the HVR is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> gives the sequence and charge states of the mutated HVRs), and the charge reversal mutant 4bHVR-5EA has the highest mobility in the fast state (~1.2 µm<sup>2</sup>/s).

In addition to an increase in its fast component diffusion rate, 4bHVR-5Ea shows a shorter residence time on the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>), suggesting impeded membrane association. The 5Ea mutant also exhibits a lower probability of transitioning from the fast to slow diffusion states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). The wild type 4bHVR (WT HVR) construct is fully able to associate with the membrane and has the lowest mobility (corresponding to the fast component of the full-length protein).

Since 4bHVR-5EA and 4bHVR-5EB have the same total negative charge (−1.1 CC), we attribute their differential membrane association to lysine 184 next to the C terminal (KTKC) and hypothesize that this lysine and the farnesyl group together may be key for KRAS membrane association. In fact, in Dharmaiah et al, the cocrystal structure of KRAS4b and its chaperone PDEδ, shows that K184 forms multiple hydrogen bonds with the main chain in PDEδ, stabilizing the interaction with the chaperone. Consistent with our results, reversal of the charge on K184 would be expected to disrupt this interaction and could disrupt KRAS4b transport to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dharmaiah et al., 2016</xref>). The alanine mutants 4bHVR-5A and 4bHVR-3A retain net positive charges (3.9 and 5.9 CC, respectively) and can associate with the membrane but also with higher mobility than the wild type HVR (8.9 CC).</p><p>Since we show that the mobility of the fast component is sensitive to the charge carried by the lysine residues in the HVR, we hypothesized that the free diffusion of RAS in the plasma membrane is driven by electrostatic interactions with negatively charged phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine. We tested this supposition with molecular dynamics simulations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> shows a series of snapshots from the atomistic MD simulation (using a CHARMM36 Force Field) of the various HVR mutants and the WT HVR in association with a simple membrane (POPC: POPS, 80:20).

An MSD versus time plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) shows the levels of confinement for the different species when transiently expressed in HeLa cells. Consistent with a model that confinement is in part due to assembly with effectors, we found that the activated Q61R RAS molecule is the most confined in mobility, while the Q61R/Y40C double mutant is the least confined in mobility among the three species. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref> shows the mobility of the four types of KRAS molecules with their respective state occupancy fractions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>.

In contrast, Q61R/Y40C, a switch one mutant impaired in its ability to bind its effector RAF, shows a significantly higher fast component fraction and smaller slower component fractions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>). These findings indicate that the confinement level of KRAS4b is related to the activity of RAS; specifically, GTP-loaded oncogenic KRAS4b is in a conformation that favors interaction with effectors, and therefore these molecules are more likely to be found in signaling complexes. We infer that the increase state occupancy of Q61R mutants in the slow state indicates that KRAS4b signaling complexes are relatively immobile.

One distinct feature of all RAS isoforms lies in the sequence specificity of their HVRs, which may influence where in the plasma membrane RAS molecules associate or may itself influence the assembly of lipid domains through the recruitment of lipids into nanoclusters. RAS shows a high degree of lateral mobility in the PM, and the PM is heterogenous and contains distinct lipid domains that may influence RAS and cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kusumi et al., 2012</xref>). Understanding how these dynamics are associated with RAS activity, and whether RAS plays a role in regulating these interactions, is a key focus of this work. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the unique diffusion characteristics of KRAS4b are due to features of the full-length protein, and that these features lead to unique interactions with the PM and to an assembly process of the signaling complex.</p><p>KRAS4b shows mobility characterized by three states: a fast, intermediate and slow diffusion rate. The transition probabilities show that the transition between slow and fast states is rare; specifically, the transitions occur through the intermediate state. In light of these findings, we propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>) in which the fast state represents RAS molecules that are not complexed with effector molecules and are diffusing with lipid molecules, and in which the two slower states represent different points in the assembly process—the intermediate state representing slowing, partially complexed, RAS molecules, and the slow state representing fully assembled RAS molecules in a signaling complex (that might be highly constrained by unique structural features in the plasma membrane such as a actin corral as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kusumi et al., 2012</xref>). In support of our model, we can control the fractional occupancy of these states by either serum starving KRAS4b-dependent MEFS, which increases the fast state occupancy, or stimulating starved cells with serum, which increases the number of molecules transitioning to the intermediate and slow states. This along with the mutational analysis we collected in HeLa cells, is strong evidence that transition to the slower states of KRAS4b is dependent on G-domain interactions.</p><p>We used simulations of KRAS4b and the 4bHVR in defined lipid environments to observe in atomistic detail the correlation of amino acid and lipid interactions and distance measurements and compared them to our experimental data. Computer simulations predict that the positive charges on the HVR recruit negatively charged lipids and bring the HVR into closer proximity to lipids in the membrane. Correspondingly, in experiments if we neutralize or reverse the positive charges in the HVR, we see increasing diffusion rates in the fast component, suggesting that the recruitment of negatively charged lipids is responsible for the fast component’s diffusion rate (0.97 µm<sup>2</sup>/s ± 0.03). Although we do not directly observe the recruitment of negatively charged lipid molecules around the HVR in experimental data (as this is beyond our imaging capabilities), the atomistic MD simulations clearly show this to be the case.</p><p>Furthermore, the MSD data gives direct information about KRAS4b mobility and allows us to characterize the qualitative features of RAS diffusion; specifically, the extent to which the molecules show diffusion patterns of free, anomalous, or more constrained diffusion. Using MSD analysis (without any modeling assumptions), we show that KRAS4b shows distinctively confined diffusion behavior compared to the other isoforms or truncation mutants. For membrane-associated molecules, such as lipids and proteins, anomalous diffusion is thought to be caused by molecular crowding, or confinement to specific subdomains in the lipid bilayer. However, we demonstrate that the confinement of KRAS4b is dependent on the G-domain, since the truncated mutant HaloTag-4bHVR shows almost free diffusion. We suspected that growth factor driven signaling followed by molecular assembly among effector and KRAS4b, and other proteins might be responsible for slowing down the molecular diffusion. Indeed, serum-starved MEF cells expressing the full-length protein, show reduced confinement. When we rescue cells with complete, serum containing media, the KRAS4b molecules change their diffusion behavior and become more confined, as indicated by the bend in the MSD plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Furthermore, oncogenic KRAS4b-Q61R, which is constitutively loaded with GTP, shows more confined behavior than KRAS4b molecules that express a mutation in the switch one binding domain (Y40C), which abrogates RAF engagement with RAS. Therefore, effector binding, and signaling in the cells plays a role in confinement of KRAS4b molecules. Finally, we extended the study using atomistic molecular simulations where we show that specific residues in the G-domain form transient contacts with lipids in the membrane. In follow-up biological experiments, we mutated these residues in KRAS4b to be HRAS-like and NRAS-like, and we saw less confined diffusion for these RAS molecules.</p><p>It is important to note that diffusion in the membrane is not linearly dependent on the size of the diffusing species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Saffman and Delbrück, 1975</xref>); however, these findings suggest that it is both protein-protein and lipid-G-domain interactions that are influencing KRAS4b mobility in ways that are distinct from other isoforms of RAS. We propose in our model that the positive charges on the 4bHVR recruit and cluster negatively charged lipids around RAS molecules (mutation of the HVR lysines leads to a higher diffusion rate, suggesting that these lipid associations contribute to the fast diffusion component), and subsequent G-domain interactions with both effectors and lipids lead to an ordered, stepwise assembly process where KRAS4b molecules are increasingly confined to smaller nanodomains in the formation of a signaling complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>).</p><p>Our study clarifies several unresolved issues in the field. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Murakoshi et al.

Consistent with our observations, both studies found that these trajectories were suppressed or immobilized upon activation of the RAS molecule. Although these studies elegantly demonstrate that activation of RAS molecules with GTP loading or oncogenic activation changes diffusion properties, we were able to extend these observations and show differences between isoforms and provide further insight to identify both G-domain and HVR contributions to this mobility pattern.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhou et al.

Using a combination of electron microscopy, spatial mapping, and atomistic simulations, their study suggests that HVR interactions are not just electrostatic in nature, but that specific amino acid side chains direct which types of lipids will cluster in the plasma membrane, and that this may have implications in downstream signaling events. Our studies complement these observations by revealing the dynamics of KRAS4b and that mutations in HVR lysines change the diffusion behavior, indicating that the assembly of signaling complexes may be dependent on the nature of the lipid clusters forming around the HVR side chains. We add an additional level of detail, showing by atomistic molecular dynamic simulations that G-domain residues are forming transitory contacts with lipid, and that mutation in these residues affect diffusion behavior. Interestingly, when we convert these G-domain residues of KRAS4b to mimic HRAS and NRAS, the diffusion properties of the molecule show less KRAS4b-like confined behavior.</p><p>In summary, we show that the diffusion of KRAS4b in the PM is best explained by a three-state model in which a slow (immobile) state involves G-domain interactions with both the PM and effector engagement. Although we did not focus our efforts on characterizing them, the other RAS isoforms clearly undergo different mechanisms of dynamic interaction with the plasma membrane, as indicated by both their relative lack of confinement (MSD) and fewer states (vbSPT). Our findings strongly suggest that the KRAS4b-plasma membrane interaction plays an important role in regulating RAS signaling through a stepwise and ordered process that gives rise to a specific transition path with different diffusion properties. Furthermore, our study has implications for understanding the interaction of proteins with the plasma membrane, and the active processes involved in assembly of a signaling complex that involves both protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein constructs</title><p>HaloTag fusion proteins of RAS family members and hypervariable regions (HVRs) were generated using combinatorial Multisite Gateway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wall et al., 2014</xref>).

Cells were rendered RAS-less by culturing in complete media supplemented with 600 nM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 14 days to activate translocation of the estrogen receptor (ER)-fused Cre to the nucleus for removal of the endogenous (floxed) <italic>Kras</italic> genes resulting in G1 arrest. Cell proliferation was ‘rescued’ by transduction with lentivirus produced by the RAS Reagent Core of the RAS Initiative containing the RAS mutant of interest tagged with HaloTag. Briefly, tamoxifen-treated cells were seeded into six-well plates and incubated overnight at a density that yielded 60–70% confluency at the time of transduction.

A Tokai hit stage incubator (Tokai Hit Co, Ltd, Japan) was used to provide 5% CO<sub>2</sub> while maintain the temperature at 37°C for live cells. Labeled molecules (with JF646/JF549 dyes) associated with membrane were illuminated under TIRF mode. The JF549 dye was excited with the 561 nm laser which is one of the four laser lines from the Agilent laser module of the Nikon N-STORM system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sergé et al., 2008</xref>), the JF646 dye was excited with the 647 nm laser line. The output laser beam was coupled into the Nikon TIRF box through a single mode fiber and focused into the back focal plane of the objective to form a parallel beam for wide field operation. The TIRF illumination was achieved by changing the illumination angle through the Nikon TIRF box controlled by the Nikon software (NIS- Elements AR 4.4). Fluorescent signals from each molecule were recorded with a thermoelectric-cooled EMCCD camera with 16 µm pixel size, (iXon Ultra DU-897, Andor Technologies, USA). Single molecule tracking was implemented by time-lapse imaging of the molecules under continuous illumination at 10 ms exposure for a total of up to 3000 frames with zero delay time between frames. At this frame rate, membrane-bound molecules appear as transient, diffraction-limited fluorescence spots.

The authors demonstrate that KRas4b properties differ from other Ras-like molecules and that the diffusion can be assigned to three different states. It is proposed that the rapidly diffusing KRas4b corresponds to free KRas4b and that the two slowly diffusing populations correspond to KRas4b assembled into signaling complexes. In general, the data presented support the conclusions. However, there are a number of issues that should be addressed:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Discussion section largely reiterates the findings and only briefly mentions the 'new model' depicted in Figure 6C (and mentioned in the Abstract). It is difficult to see how the data in this paper provides evidence for this sequence of events. For example, in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion it is stated that the 4bHVR domain recruits and clusters negatively charged lipids (in the free diffusion state) but such an induced lipid cluster would have an impact on KRAS4b diffusion (not observed experimentally). It is also not clear why GTP loading of wt KRAS4b should only occur in the intermediate and slow diffusion states but that's need to result in the step-wised assembly process of Figure 6C. The data shown does not formally exclude that the binding of the effector proteins results in slow(er) diffusion. Indeed, Figure 6C does not distinguish between the fast and slow diffusing states of RAS4b when that is what the paper focuses on.</p><p>2) It is intriguing that the confinement behavior of KRAS4b is caused mainly by the G-domain and not the electrostatic interaction facilitated by the hypervariable region (HVR) and inversely, that the fast diffusion is only regulated by the charged residues in the HVR. Can the MD simulation give insights into the importance of the position of the lysine (i.e. 4bHVR-5EA versus 4bHVR-5EB)? Moreover, these mutational data require a comparison of the effects of these mutations on the biological signaling properties of KRas4b. Do the authors rely on published data for this comparison – if so, these data should be cited and discussed. If not, this data should be provided in this study.</p><p>3) Please confirm that data in Figure 5C is a 3-state model (obtained from the vbSPT analysis)? [Is only Figure 3 analyzed as a 2-state model?]. Please also provide details of the statistical analysis. If we understood the figure correctly, the only significant difference in Figure 5D is in the occupancy of the fast and intermediate diffusing states between 4B-Q61R and 4B-Y40C-A61R (while there is no significant difference to 4B-WT). If that is correct, we don't understand the authors' statement that the Q61R mutant has 'significantly more molecules in the slow-moving component' or the GTP-loading statement at the end of the Introduction.</p><p>4) Statistical analysis such as two-way ANOVA is required to describe the significant differences. This is a serious problem throughout the study.</p><p>5) The HeLa cell tracking data were obtained using Fugene-transfected cells. Most likely this led to highly variable levels of KRas4b expression in these cells. This is not addressed in the study. Did the level of expression affect the observed diffusion properties of KRas4b?</p><p>6) Figure 2. It was stated that &quot;MSD analysis of single molecule trajectories in living cells showed that the 4b-ESR mutant (H-like: D126E/T127S/K128R) had less confinement (Figure 2C)&quot; in the manuscript. However, it is unclear whether there is a significant difference. The authors described &quot;vbSPT analysis showed that its fast-moving component increased, and its slow-moving components decreased (Figure 2D)&quot; but no statistical analysis is shown.</p><p>7) Figure 5. It is unclear why the authors used the Y40C, Q61R double mutant to test the Y40C effect. The authors need to provide a rationale and/or test the Y40C mutant.</p><p>8) Supplementary figure 1. It was stated &quot;Finally, we found that the levels of pAKT, pMEK and pERK are at levels comparable to WT MEF cells as measured in Western blots (Supplementary Figure 1A).&quot; This refers to Supplementary Figure 1D. Wild type MEF and KRas fl/fl need to be included as controls.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47654.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Discussion section largely reiterates the findings and only briefly mentions the 'new model' depicted in Figure 6C (and mentioned in the Abstract).

Decreasing or reversing the positive charge on the HVR increases the diffusion rate. Specifically, while we do get tethering and observable diffusion when we mutate the lysines (and either decrease or reverse the charge density on the HVR), the diffusion becomes faster as the positive charge density decreases or is reversed. We infer that the fast diffusion component in wild type RAS is dependent on lipid clustering.</p><p>– Though we do not directly observe the recruitment of negatively charged lipid molecules around the HVR in experimental data (as this is beyond our imaging capabilities), the atomistic MD simulations clearly show this to be the case. The simulation also shows (Figure 4) that mutations in the lysine residues increases the distance of the HVR from the plasma membrane (there are less protein-lipid contacts), and these data are well correlated with our single molecule tracking data with these same mutations in Halo-4bHVR constructs.</p><p>– There is a statistically significant difference in Figure 5 in the confinement of KRAS4b-Q61R (which is highly resistant to GTP hydrolysis, and therefore we can assume is fully GTP loaded) and the KRAS4b-Q61R-Y40C mutant. The Y40C mutant is unable to engage with the effector, and so, the loss of accumulation in the intermediate state is an indication that increasing confinement is correlated with signaling.</p><p>We edited the manuscript for clarity to make sure that we are addressing the reviewer’s concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is intriguing that the confinement behavior of KRAS4b is caused mainly by the G-domain and not the electrostatic interaction facilitated by the hypervariable region (HVR) and inversely, that the fast diffusion is only regulated by the charged residues in the HVR.

Do the authors rely on published data for this comparison – if so, these data should be cited and discussed. If not, this data should be provided in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We hypothesize that the 4bHVR-5EB is not able to bind to the chaperone PDE-Δ; and therefore, is not transported to the plasma membrane as efficiently (Dharmaiah et al., 2016). As seen in Figure 3B, there are few trajectories for this mutant, and in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, there is poor membrane localization. We cite the following publications ((Terrell et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2017) showing that signaling is indeed impacted by mutations in the HVR. Our data support an interpretation that lipid sorting by the HVR is required for proper assembly with the effectors upon GTP loading. The increased density of the negatively charged lipid around RAS may recruit other RAS molecules, and even effectors. However, we do not have direct evidence of this. Future work using two-color simultaneous imaging and tracking may be able to shed light on these interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please confirm that data in Figure 5C is a 3-state model (obtained from the vbSPT analysis)? [Is only Figure 3 analyzed as a 2-state model?]. Please also provide details of the statistical analysis.

If that is correct, we don't understand the authors' statement that the Q61R mutant has 'significantly more molecules in the slow-moving component' or the GTP-loading statement at the end of the Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>Because over-fitting data is a danger when using the vbSPT HMM method, we use the following approach to test the validity of the number of states.</p><p>– We have observed a background level of immobile single molecules in our videos. We do not feel that we can filter these out and exclude them from the analysis, because they are still diffusing, albeit at a slow rate. However, based on many experiments, we believe these molecules to be artifacts of the experimental set up: perhaps molecules that are trapped between the glass and the cell membrane interface, or fluorophores that have attached non-specifically to cell structures.</p><p>– When we do vbSPT HMM analysis and observe the fractional occupancy of the slow state that includes these immobile molecules to be very low (&lt;5%), and we observe in the corresponding MSD analysis that the plot is relatively straight and unconfined, we feel confident that these trajectories are better fit by a two-state model.</p><p>– We have gone in the other direction with our data and fit to four-state models. In this case, we see that the values of the diffusion rates reported for the slower states are too close together to be an accurate reflection of the underlying data—the models over-fit the data.</p><p>– The most salient point to be made is that KRAS4b diffusion is distinct from the other RAS isoforms, both when we look by MSD and vbSPT. We see KRAS4b molecules behaving with greater confinement, suggesting that these molecules are exploring a structurally distinct region of the cell membrane, and that these molecules are interacting with lipids and effectors in a way that is distinct from the other isoforms. We do not study the assembly process of the other isoforms; this is a topic for future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Statistical analysis such as two-way ANOVA is required to describe the significant differences. This is a serious problem throughout the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted Student-T Tests on the data throughout the study, and appropriately labelled the figures, and clarified statements of significance in the manuscript. We provide a table for all the pairwise comparisons (Supplementary file 1: Statistics). This statistical test was chosen in order to focus on the portion of the MSD plots that shows the behavior of the longer trajectories. Specifically, it is in the longer trajectories that the behavior of confinement vs. more free diffusion is observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The HeLa cell tracking data were obtained using Fugene-transfected cells. Most likely this led to highly variable levels of KRas4b expression in these cells. This is not addressed in the study. Did the level of expression affect the observed diffusion properties of KRas4b?</p></disp-quote><p>We generated a DOX inducible, Halo-KRAS4b HeLa cell line to test the effect of density on diffusion. As seen in Figure 1—figure supplement 3D, increasing density of KRAS4b does not have an appreciable effect on diffusion rates, or the fractional occupancy of KRAS4b in these states.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 2. It was stated that &quot;MSD analysis of single molecule trajectories in living cells showed that the 4b-ESR mutant (H-like: D126E/T127S/K128R) had less confinement (Figure 2C)&quot; in the manuscript. However, it is unclear whether there is a significant difference. The authors described &quot;vbSPT analysis showed that its fast-moving component increased, and its slow-moving components decreased (Figure 2D)&quot; but no statistical analysis is shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We see a statistical difference between 4b-GNK and KRAS4b and indicate this in the Figure 2C. The difference between 4b-ESR and KRAS4b is not statistically significant, however, it clearly shows a trend towards less constrained diffusion (one of the three experiments conducted for this mutant on different days showed unusual variability compared to the other two days. This introduced more error into the analysis, as can be seen by the error bars.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 5. It is unclear why the authors used the Y40C, Q61R double mutant to test the Y40C effect. The authors need to provide a rationale and/or test the Y40C mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We include data for both mutants and made the changes in the text and Figure 5. We used the Q61R mutant to show the effect of GTP loading.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Supplementary figure 1.
