regulator of cell growth and proliferation, in neurons it regulates synaptic transmission, which is thought to be a major mechanism through which altered mTOR signaling leads to neurological disease. Although previous studies have delineated postsynaptic roles for mTOR, whether it regulates presynaptic function is largely unknown. Moreover, the mTOR kinase operates in two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, suggesting that mTOR’s role in synaptic transmission may be complex-specific. To better understand their roles in synaptic transmission, we genetically inactivated mTORC1 or mTORC2 in cultured mouse glutamatergic hippocampal neurons. Inactivation of either complex reduced neuron growth and evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs), however, the effects of mTORC1 on eEPSCs were postsynaptic and the effects of mTORC2 were presynaptic. Despite postsynaptic inhibition of evoked release, mTORC1 inactivation enhanced spontaneous vesicle fusion and replenishment, suggesting that mTORC1 and mTORC2 differentially modulate postsynaptic responsiveness and presynaptic release to optimize glutamatergic synaptic transmission.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mTOR signaling</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle release</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00NS087095</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weston</surname><given-names>Matthew C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS110945</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weston</surname><given-names>Matthew C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 103498</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weston</surname><given-names>Matthew C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The crucial regulator of brain function, mTOR, signals through distinct macromolecular complexes to control how synaptic vesicles are released from the presynaptic terminal.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling network is an evolutionarily conserved group of interacting proteins centered around the ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase mTOR. In a variety of species and cell types, mTOR signaling regulates fundamental cell biological processes such as cell growth, survival, and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). In the nervous system, however, mTOR signaling plays a more specific role in neuronal communication by tuning the strength of synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niere et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sperow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weston et al., 2014</xref>). This regulation of synaptic strength by mTOR is thought to be necessary for learning and memory, setting E-I balance, and maintaining synaptic homeostasis. Furthermore, variants in several genes in the mTOR signaling network cause neurological diseases including epilepsy and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crino, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lipton and Sahin, 2014</xref>), and increasing evidence suggests that dysregulation of synaptic transmission is a key feature of these diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zoghbi and Bear, 2012</xref>).</p><p>A broad distinction in the organization of the mTOR signaling network is that the mTOR kinase operates in two multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hay and Sonenberg, 2004</xref>). Both the substrates of mTOR and the downstream cellular processes it affects are different depending on its association with mTORC1 or mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wullschleger et al., 2006</xref>). Biochemically, mTORC1 and mTORC2 are distinguished by their protein composition. Although they both contain mTOR and other components such as Deptor and mLST8, Raptor is a protein that is unique to mTORC1 and is essential to its function, whereas Rictor is unique to mTORC2 and essential to its function. Pharmacologically, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and its derivatives are more effective at inhibiting mTORC1 than mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kang et al., 2013</xref>), but this distinction is lessened with longer exposure and at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sarbassov et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated changes in postsynaptic function by manipulating mTOR signaling either pharmacologically or genetically. Because of the link between mTOR, protein synthesis, and long-term synaptic plasticity, several studies have shown the necessity for intact mTORC1 and mTORC2 function in long-term potentiation and long-term depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stoica et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tang et al., 2002</xref>). At the molecular level, mTOR signaling and its downstream targets are known to regulate AMPA receptor expression and synapse number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). More recently, postsynaptic loss of mTORC1 was shown to reduce evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (eEPSC) amplitudes onto Purkinje neurons, but mTORC2 loss did not, suggesting specific roles for the two complexes in the regulation of synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angliker et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite progress in delineating the regulation of postsynaptic function by mTOR, the role of mTOR in presynaptic function, and more specifically synaptic vesicle (SV) release, is largely unexplored. Studies at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction and in rat hippocampal neurons have shown that postsynaptic mTORC1 activity provides a retrograde signal that enhances the readily releasable pool (RRP) of SVs in response to a reduction in postsynaptic glutamate receptor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Henry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Penney et al., 2012</xref>), and another study found that a high dose of rapamycin (3 µm) depleted dopaminergic SVs from presynaptic terminals in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>), but none of these studies examined SV release itself. Interestingly, several recent studies have uncovered roles for IGF-1 receptor signaling, protein synthesis, and cholesterol biosynthesis in regulating the balance of spontaneous and evoked SV release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gazit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scarnati et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wasser et al., 2007</xref>). Because these processes are up- and downstream of mTOR, this raises the possibility that mTOR may act as a hub to regulate different modes of SV fusion.</p><p>To assess the pre- and postsynaptic function of each mTOR complex in glutamatergic synaptic transmission, we inactivated mTORC1 signaling by conditionally deleting Raptor, or mTORC2 signaling by conditionally deleting Rictor, postmitotically in primary neuron cultures from mouse hippocampus. We then performed morphological and whole-cell patch-clamp analysis of synaptic and membrane properties of glutamatergic neurons. Our results showed that both mTOR complexes were necessary to support normal neuron growth and evoked excitatory synaptic transmission. Despite these similarities, the effects of mTORC1 on evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs) were postsynaptic, via reductions in synapse number, whereas mTORC2 regulated the presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of evoked SV release. Furthermore, although the mechanism through which mTORC1 inactivation decreased eEPSCs was postsynaptic, it also increased spontaneous SV release and SV pool replenishment, which are thought to be presynaptic processes. Overall, each mTOR complex affected distinct modes of SV release: mTORC1 inactivation enhanced modes with low rates of SV fusion, such as spontaneous release, and mTORC2 inactivation impaired modes with high rates of SV fusion, such as action potential-evoked release. Thus, via differential activation of these two complexes, the mTOR pathway is ideally poised to respond to external cues and make fine adjustments to glutamatergic synaptic transmission to maintain normal neural network function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inactivation of mTORC1 or mTORC2 in neurons, via <italic>Raptor</italic> or <italic>Rictor</italic> deletion, causes distinct effects on downstream mTOR signaling</title><p>To investigate the effects of mTORC1 or mTORC2 inactivation on neurons, we cultured primary hippocampal neurons isolated from P0-P1 <italic>Raptor</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> or <italic>Rictor</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> mice on astrocytes isolated from P0-P1 wild-type mice. At the time of plating, we transduced the neurons with adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) expressing either an mCherry-Cre fusion protein or mCherry alone, both driven by the SYN promoter, to generate knockout (Raptor-KO or Rictor-KO) or control (Raptor-Con or Rictor-Con) neurons, respectively. Western blot analyses of protein lysates isolated after 12 days in vitro (DIV) showed significant reductions in both Raptor and Rictor protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which, given the presence of wild-type astrocytes in the culture, indicated a high efficiency of gene deletion.</p><p>To assess the effects of Raptor and Rictor loss on mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity in neurons, we performed quantitative immunofluorescence analysis for phospho-S6 (S240/244) (pS6), an indicator of mTORC1 activity, and phospho-Akt (S473) (pAkt), an indicator of mTORC2 activity. In Raptor-KO neurons, the mean fluorescence intensity of the pS6 signal was decreased relative to Raptor-Con neurons (Con: 1.00 ± 0.05, Rap-KO: 0.25 ± 0.03, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A<sub>1-3</sub></xref>), verifying a reduction in mTORC1 activity. The pAkt signal was, however, increased in Raptor-KO neurons relative to Raptor-Con neurons (Con: 1.00 ± 0.05, Rap-KO: 1.31 ± 0.06, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B<sub>1-3</sub></xref>), likely due to release of the negative feedback loop from mTORC1 to insulin receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Reilly et al., 2006</xref>). Rictor-KO neurons showed reduced levels of pAkt immunofluorescence relative to Rictor-Con neurons (Con: 1.00 ± 0.03, Ric-KO: 0.56 ± 0.02, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E<sub>1-3</sub></xref>), as expected because the S473 residue on Akt is a known target of mTORC2. pS6 levels were also reduced in Rictor-KO neurons compared with those of Rictor-Con neurons (Con: 1.00 ± 0.05, Ric-KO: 0.55 ± 0.03, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F<sub>1-3</sub></xref>), likely because reduced Akt phosphorylation dampens signaling through the Akt-Tsc-mTORC1 axis.

To assess alterations in neuron size, we measured neuronal soma area in the cultures following deletion of <italic>Raptor</italic> and <italic>Rictor</italic>. For Raptor-KO and Rictor-KO neurons, soma areas were reduced by almost 20% compared with those of their respective controls (Con: 180 ± 8 µm<sup>2</sup>, Rap-KO: 146 ± 6 µm<sup>2</sup>, p=0.007; Con: 151 ± 5 µm<sup>2</sup>, Ric-KO: 126 ± 4 µm<sup>2</sup>, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and G</xref>).</p><p>Previously, mTORC1 and mTORC2 were also shown to regulate dendritic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Urbanska et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, we visualized dendrites in single-neuron cultures, where they can be well-resolved by immunostaining with an antibody against MAP2. We reconstructed the dendritic tree of each neuron and found that total dendritic length was reduced by both mTORC1 inactivation (Con: 1260 ± 116 µm, Rap-KO: 747 ± 70 µm, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and mTORC2 inactivation (Con: 1035 ± 76 µm, Ric-KO: 815 ± 78 µm, p=0.043; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These data verify that a reduction in mTORC1 or mTORC2 activity is sufficient to decrease neuronal soma area and dendritic length, which agrees with two previous studies comparing the effects of mTORC1 and mTORC2 inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angliker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Urbanska et al., 2012</xref>), and confirm that both mTOR complexes are required for proper neuronal morphology.</p><p>The decreases in soma size and dendritic length predict that the passive membrane properties of Raptor-KO and Rictor-KO neurons are altered.

First, to test for changes in quantal size, we recorded miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) and measured their amplitude and decay time constants, properties that are primarily dictated by postsynaptic ionotropic receptor levels and/or activity. Raptor-KO significantly decreased the mEPSC amplitude (Con: 27.8 ± 1.9 pA, Rap-KO: 21.5 ± 1.4 pA, p=0.006; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B<sub>1,2</sub></xref>), but did not affect the decay time (Con: 3.48 ± 0.14 ms, Rap-KO: 3.40 ± 0.13 ms, p=0.68; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B<sub>3</sub></xref>), when compared with those of Raptor-Con neurons.

The integral of the transient current during sucrose application represents the total charge contained in the RRP (RRP<sub>suc</sub>), and the total number of vesicles in the RRP can then be calculated by dividing the total charge by the average charge of the miniature events from each neuron. We found that RRP<sub>suc</sub> in glutamatergic Raptor-KO neurons was decreased by almost 60% compared with that of Raptor-Con neurons (Con: 767 ± 127 pC, Rap-KO: 337 ± 53 pC, p=0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C<sub>1,2</sub></xref>).

We found that the number of glutamatergic synapses per neuron was decreased by approximately 40% due to Raptor loss (Con: 721 ± 106 synapses/neuron, Rap-KO: 430 ± 65 synapses/neuron, p=0.02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D<sub>1,2</sub></xref>). However, based on the mean values for the RRP<sub>suc</sub> and number of synapses, we estimated similar numbers of fusion-competent SVs per synapse in Raptor-Con neurons (9.91 SVs/synapse) and Raptor-KO neurons (8.52 SVs/synapse).

We tested this in three ways.

In this mode of SV release, Raptor-KO neurons did not show an elevated rate of fusion (Con: 1.15 ± 0.32 s<sup>−1</sup>, Rap-KO: 1.23 ± 0.32 s<sup>−1</sup>, p=0.87; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C<sub>1, 2</sub></xref>), but Rictor-KO neurons did show a significantly lower rate of fusion (Con: 2.21 ± 0.48 s<sup>−1</sup>, Ric-KO: 1.19 ± 0.24 s<sup>−1</sup>, p=0.037; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D<sub>1, 2</sub></xref>), relative to those of their respective controls.</p><p>Finally, to summarize the effects of mTORC1 and mTORC2 inactivation on SV release rates over the range of conditions tested, we plotted the relative changes in rate constants for each of the conditions from lowest to highest rates, plus sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, the data indicate that mTORC1 inhibition elevates rate constants for SV fusion under conditions in which the rate is relatively low, but does not affect the rate of fusion when it is high. In contrast, mTORC2 inhibition impairs SV fusion over a wider range of rates, but the effect is more pronounced when rates of SV fusion are high.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Both the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes have been shown to regulate important processes such as learning and memory, the response to drugs of abuse, and the development of epilepsy and autism via changes in synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hou and Klann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mazei-Robison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stoica et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tang et al., 2002</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying the complex-specific changes in synaptic function are largely unknown. Using genetic mouse models to specifically inactivate mTORC1 or mTORC2, and neuronal culture systems to isolate effects, we show here that both complexes are necessary to support normal neuron growth. Previous studies investigating the specific roles of mTORC1 versus mTORC2 in neurons found that inhibiting either complex via shRNA knockdown of <italic>Raptor</italic> or <italic>Rictor</italic> mRNA in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Urbanska et al., 2012</xref>), or genetic deletion of <italic>Raptor</italic> or <italic>Rictor</italic> in Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angliker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thomanetz et al., 2013</xref>), reduced somatic and dendritic growth. In agreement with these studies, we found reductions in neuronal soma size and dendritic length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and corresponding changes in passive membrane properties (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), in both Raptor-KO and Rictor-KO neurons, verifying the general role of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 as regulators of neuron growth.</p><p>Because of the high level of crosstalk between the two mTOR-containing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xie and Proud, 2014</xref>), and because of their similar effects on gross neuronal morphology, it is somewhat surprising that their effects on synaptic transmission are non-overlapping and, in some cases, opposite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although inactivation of either complex strongly reduced eEPSC amplitude, we found that the physiological mechanisms underlying these reductions were different, with mTORC1 inhibition reducing eEPSC size via postsynaptic mechanisms and mTORC2 inactivation reducing it through presynaptic mechanisms. Furthermore, we found that mTORC1 inhibition simultaneously increased spontaneous and asynchronous SV release, whereas mTORC2 inhibition decreased evoked and asynchronous SV release. Thus, the roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in regulating synaptic transmission are non-overlapping and dissociable from their more general control of neuron growth. Previous studies have shown that synaptic plasticity changes caused by mTOR hyperactivation (PTEN loss) precede large-scale morphological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sperow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takeuchi et al., 2013</xref>), supporting the idea that synaptic transmission and neuron morphology are independently regulated by mTOR.</p><p>Raptor-KO decreased evoked glutamatergic synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and postsynaptic Raptor-KO was sufficient to cause this decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, reductions in both the mEPSC amplitude and number of synapses accompanied this decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Previous studies showed that mTOR inhibition by rapamycin treatment reduces the number of AMPA receptors at the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2006</xref>), the number of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Weston et al., 2012</xref>), and the number of SVs per synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, mTOR hyperactivation increases mEPSC amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>), AMPA receptor number, and spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Williams et al., 2015</xref>), and these effects are blocked by rapamycin. Thus, integrating our findings on specific mTORC1 inactivation with these previous findings, several lines of evidence now indicate that mTORC1 acts via a postsynaptic mechanism to bidirectionally regulate evoked glutamatergic synaptic strength.</p><p>In contrast to mTORC1 inactivation, mTORC2 inactivation affected presynaptic parameters, including <italic>P<sub>vr</sub></italic>, peak evoked SV release rate, and paired pulse ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and was localized at the presynaptic terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> dose-response curve showed a significant right-shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that the major mechanism through which mTORC2 inactivation reduces eEPSC strength and presynaptic function is by impairing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of SV release. Although neurophysiological deficits have been previously reported in Rictor-KO animals, presynaptic function was not specifically assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dadalko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thomanetz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, our data establish mTORC2 as a potent regulator of presynaptic function and suggest that at least some of the previously reported effects of Rictor loss on synaptic transmission are due to presynaptic deficits.</p><p>The different effects following mTORC1 and mTORC2 inactivation on post- and presynaptic function leads to the question of what downstream targets of each complex mediate these changes. Of the molecules downstream of mTORC1, 4E-BP, which is inhibited by active mTORC1, is most strongly linked to regulation of synaptic function. In particular, 4E-BP regulates synaptic transmission via its translational repression of the AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ran et al., 2013</xref>), and postsynaptic 4E-BP has been shown to play a role in retrograde or trans-synaptic regulation of presynaptic release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kauwe et al., 2016</xref>); thus, the effects of Raptor loss could reflect a combination of these effects. Alternatively, a previous study found inhibition of protein synthesis with anisomycin increased the rate of spontaneous SV release and replenishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scarnati et al., 2018</xref>), effects that we also observed in Raptor-KO neurons. It is therefore possible that the regulation of these parameters by mTORC1 is an indirect effect of a reduction in protein synthesis.</p><p>Regarding the presynaptic effects of mTORC2, Akt and PKC isoforms are the most well studied substrates. Although Akt has been suggested to play a role in SV endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smillie and Cousin, 2012</xref>), multiple PKC isoforms are targets of mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikenoue et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thomanetz et al., 2013</xref>). Genetic deletion of PKCβ and PKCγ has been shown to block the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent increase in the RRP and release probability caused by tetanic stimulation at the calyx of Held (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fioravante et al., 2011</xref>), and pharmacological inhibition of PKC blocks the increase in asynchronous release caused by phorbol esters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang and Mennerick, 2010</xref>). PKC has also been shown to phosphorylate Munc-18 to regulate its interaction with syntaxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujita et al., 1996</xref>), as well as modulate the actin cytoskeleton in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angliker and Rüegg, 2013</xref>). Therefore, the effects of Rictor loss on presynaptic neurotransmission may be caused by lack of PKC activity in these neurons.</p><p>Although mTORC1 inactivation decreased evoked strength via postsynaptic mechanisms, it increased the rate of spontaneous and asynchronous release. Because these release rate constants reflect the likelihood of an individual SV to fuse in a given circumstance, they likely reflect a change in the presynaptic terminal. An open question, however, is whether it is reduced mTORC1 activity in the presynapse that causes this change, or whether mTORC1 inactivation in the postsynapse provides a retrograde signal to the presynaptic terminal to alter SV release. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, 4eBP translationally represses the synaptic protein Complexin to regulate neurotransmitter release at the presynapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mahoney et al., 2016</xref>), however, it is not known if this mechanism is conserved, or if it occurs downstream of the mTOR pathway, in mammals. Another mTORC1 target, SREBP1, regulates cholesterol biosynthesis, and cholesterol depletion has been shown to decrease evoked neurotransmission and enhance spontaneous transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wasser et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that this pathway may mediate the effects on presynaptic release in Raptor-KO neurons. However, as mentioned above, there is evidence that postsynaptic mTOR can signal retrogradely to enhance the RRP and presynaptic release in response to a reduction in postsynaptic glutamate receptor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Henry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Penney et al., 2012</xref>), providing proof of principle that mTOR can signal across the synapse. In these studies, mTORC1 <italic>activation</italic> signals to increase the RRP, whereas we found that mTORC1 <italic>inactivation</italic> decreases the RRP, and concomitantly increases the spontaneous and asynchronous SV fusion rates. It is possible that mTORC1 regulates additional trans-synaptic signals that regulate spontaneous and asynchronous release, or that the effect on these release modes is merely compensatory downstream of the reduced evoked transmission, but we think the latter scenario is unlikely because 12 hr rapamycin treatment increased spontaneous release, but does not reduce evoked release or synapse number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Weston et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study found that mTORC1 activity regulates the balance of STX1A to STX1B expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niere et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Niere and Raab-Graham, 2017</xref>), which, if it occurs at the presynapse, could affect the balance of SV release modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mishima et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, future studies must establish the pre- or postsynaptic locus of the effect of mTORC1 activity on SV release.</p><p>One caveat to our findings is that we used the RRP as defined by application of hypertonic sucrose to calculate the rate constants for spontaneous and asynchronous SV fusion. Our analysis assumes that evoked, spontaneous, and asynchronous release all draw from this pool of vesicles. Although there is good evidence to support this assumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ryan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schneggenburger and Rosenmund, 2015</xref>), it is possible that molecularly distinct SV pools are not all released by sucrose application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chamberland and Tóth, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fredj and Burrone, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sara et al., 2005</xref>). If true, this may change our specific conclusion that the rate constant of SV fusion changes to the conclusion that the vesicle pools that support evoked, spontaneous, and asynchronous release are differentially affected by the reduction in synapse number caused by Raptor loss. Thus, although our data cannot conclusively distinguish between these two possibilities, the finding that mTORC1 inactivation enhances asynchronous release after a single stimulation but not after 10 Hz stimulation suggests that it is the SV fusion rate that is affected. We speculate that the differential regulation of SV release modes is due to either the alteration of the sensitivity of SV fusion to calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nosyreva and Kavalali, 2010</xref>), or an alteration in the influx of calcium under different conditions, which has been shown to differentially regulate spontaneous and evoked release in response to loss of Presenilin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pratt et al., 2011</xref>). The fact that we found no changes in the sucrose-evoked SV release rate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">(Figure 7</xref>), which is thought to be calcium-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</xref>), supports the idea that the changes caused by Raptor loss are calcium-dependent.</p><p>Several recent studies have highlighted instances in which spontaneous and evoked release are independently modified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramirez and Kavalali, 2011</xref>). It is noteworthy that these examples include blockade of IGF-1 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gazit et al., 2016</xref>), inhibition of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scarnati et al., 2018</xref>), and reduction of cholesterol levels in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wasser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zamir and Charlton, 2006</xref>), as these are all factors that either feed into mTORC1 activity or are modulated by mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peterson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). Because mTORC1 is considered a ‘hub’ that integrates multiple extra- and intracellular cues to control anabolism in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim and Guan, 2019</xref>), it is uniquely positioned to coordinate a synaptic response to metabolic changes. Our findings add to a growing body of literature demonstrating that the metabolic state of neurons can signal to synapses to adjust the balance of spontaneous and evoked release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gazit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scarnati et al., 2018</xref>), and identify a novel role for the mTOR signaling network in maintaining this balance. Furthermore, our data broaden the idea of differential regulation of evoked versus spontaneous release by showing that asynchronous release is also affected. Thus, metabolic changes are not mediating a ‘competition’ or specific ratio between spontaneous and evoked SV release, but instead inducing a shift in the way that synapses respond to different levels of activity, including inactivity.</p><p>Variants in at least 10 genes in the mTOR signaling network, including <italic>MTOR</italic>, are known to cause epilepsy, autism, and intellectual disability. Although all of these variants are believed to increase signaling through mTORC1, some have been shown to increase mTORC2 signaling (e.g. <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>PIK3CA, and MTOR</italic>), whereas others decrease mTORC2 signaling (e.g. <italic>TSC1</italic>, <italic>TSC2</italic>, and <italic>DEPDC5</italic>). Our data suggest that differential activity levels of the two complexes in disease states would lead to distinct synaptic alterations. Accordingly, previous studies have shown that <italic>Pten</italic> loss and <italic>Tsc1</italic> loss cause different synaptic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bateup et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Williams et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these data suggest that complex specific targeting may be necessary to restore normal synaptic function in neurological diseases involving mTOR hyperactivation. Moreover, future studies are needed to further clarify the contributions of each mTOR complex to these neurological diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent <italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td>Raptor-cKO mice</td><td>The Jackson Laboratories</td><td>Jackson Labs stock: 013188</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td>Rictor-cKO mice</td><td>The Jackson Laboratories</td><td>Jackson Labs stock: 020649</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>The Jackson Laboratories</td><td>Jackson Labs stock: 000664</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>AAV8-SYN-mCherry-Cre</td><td>UNC Vector Core</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>AAV8-SYN-mCherry</td><td>UNC Vector Core</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>AAV9-Syn-Chronos-GFP</td><td>UNC Vector Core</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit monoclonal anti-Raptor</td><td>Cell Signaling</td><td>Cat #2280 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_561245">AB_561245</ext-link></td><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit monoclonal anti-Rictor</td><td>Cell Signaling</td><td>Cat #2114 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2179963">AB_2179963</ext-link></td><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-MAP2</td><td>Synaptic Systems</td><td>Cat #188 011</td><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit polyclonal anti-VGLUT1</td><td>Synaptic Systems</td><td>Cat #135 302</td><td>(1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>guinea pig polyclonal anti-VGLUT1</td><td>Synaptic Systems</td><td>Cat #135 304</td><td>(1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-pAkt (S473)</td><td>Cell Signaling</td><td>Cat # 9271 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2315049">AB_2315049</ext-link></td><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit monoclonal anti-pS6 (S240/244)</td><td>Cell Signaling</td><td>Cat # 5364 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB10694233">AB10694233</ext-link></td><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>rapamycin</td><td>Cayman</td><td>Item # 13346</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Kynurenic acid</td><td>Tocris</td><td>Cat. #0223</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Bicuculline <break/>Methiodide</td><td>Tocris</td><td>Cat. #2503</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Tetrodotoxin</td><td>Enzo</td><td>BML-NA120-0001</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>pClamp</td><td>Molecular devices</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011323">SCR_011323</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Axograph X</td><td>Axograph</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014284">SCR_014284</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>SPSS</td><td>SPSS</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002865">SCR_002865</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Prism</td><td>Graphpad</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>FIJI</td><td>NIH</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Intellicount</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29218324">29218324</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Matlab</td><td>Mathworks</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and cell culture</title><p>Animal housing and use were in compliance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Vermont.

The following primary antibodies in blocking solution were then applied to the neurons at 4°C overnight: MAP2 (mouse monoclonal, 1:1000 dilution, Synaptic Systems, Cat# 188 011, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2147096">AB_2147096</ext-link>), phospho-S6 Ribosomal Protein Ser240/244 (rabbit monoclonal, 1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, Cat# 5364, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10694233">AB_10694233</ext-link>), phospho-AKT Ser473 (rabbit monoclonal, 1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, Cat# 4060, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2315049">AB_2315049</ext-link>), VGLUT1 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:5000 dilution, Synaptic Systems, Cat # 135 302, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_887877">AB_887877</ext-link>), or VGLUT1 (guinea pig polyclonal, 1:5000 dilution, Synaptic Systems, Cat # 135 304). Following primary antibody application, cells were washed three times in PBS and then incubated in the following Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes) for 1 hr at room temperature: goat anti-mouse 488 (1:1000, Cat <bold>#</bold> A-11017, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_143160">AB_143160</ext-link>) and goat anti-rabbit 647 (1:1000, Cat# A-21244, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_141663">AB_141663</ext-link>). Cells were then mounted to slides with Prolong Gold Antifade (Life Technologies) and allowed to cure for 24 hr.</p><p>Images (1024 × 1024 pixels) for pS6 and pAKT expression analysis were obtained using a DeltaVision Restoration Microscopy System (Applied Precision/GE Life Sciences) with an inverted Olympus IX70 microscope with a 20 × oil objective, SoftWoRx software, and a CoolSNAP-HQ charge-coupled device digital camera (Photometrics). Image exposure times and settings were kept the same between groups in a culture and were optimized to ensure that there were no saturated pixels. Images were acquired in stacks of 8–12 planes at 0.5 μm depth intervals and then deconvolved. Stacks were processed using Fiji software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) to create maximum intensity projections. Image background was subtracted using the rolling ball method with a radius of 100 µm. To analyze levels of mTOR effectors, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around the cell body using the MAP2 channel, and then the mean fluorescence intensity and cell body area were measured for pS6 and pAKT for each neuron imaged. Because the absolute values of the fluorescence intensity varied between cultures, the values were normalized to the mean value of the control neurons for each culture.</p><p>For dendritic length, glutamatergic terminal number analysis, and pAkt-VGLUT1 colocalization, primary neuron cultures on astrocyte microislands were generated and fixed as described above. Images (1024 × 1024 pixels) were obtained using a C2 confocal microscopy system (Nikon) with a 40x oil objective. Images were acquired using equal exposure times between groups in stacks of 4–6 images at 2.0 μm depth intervals and then randomized and renamed to blind analysis. Maximum intensity projections were created using Fiji software. Total dendritic length was obtained by tracing MAP2 expression using the NeuronJ plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meijering et al., 2004</xref>). VGLUT puncta number were calculated using Intellicount software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fantuzzo et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Whole-cell recordings were performed with patch-clamp amplifiers (MultiClamp 700B amplifier; Molecular Devices) under the control of Clampex 10.3 or 10.5 (Molecular Devices, pClamp, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011323">SCR_011323</ext-link>). Data were acquired at 10 kHz and low-pass filtered at 6 kHz. The series resistance was compensated at 70%, and only cells with series resistances maintained at less than 15 MΩ and stable holding currents of less than 400 pA were analyzed. The pipette resistance was between 2 and 4 MΩ. Standard extracellular solution contained the following (in mM): 140 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.3, 305 mOsm). Internal solution contained the following: 136 mM K-gluconate, 17.8 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 0.6 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM ATP, 0.3 mM GTP, 12 mM creatine phosphate, and 50 U/ml phosphocreatine kinase. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–23°C). Whole-cell recordings were performed on neurons from control and mutant groups in parallel on the same day (day 12–14 in vitro) and in two of the cultures from each genotype the experimenter was blinded to treatment condition.</p><p>For voltage-clamp experiments, neurons were held at −70 mV unless noted. Action potential (AP)-evoked EPSCs were triggered by a 2 ms somatic depolarization to 0 mV. The shape of the evoked response and the effect of receptor antagonists [3 mM kynurenic acid (KYN, Tocris Bioscience) or 20 μM bicuculline (BIC, Tocris Bioscience)] were analyzed to verify the glutamatergic or GABAergic identities of the neurons. Neurons were stimulated at 0.2 Hz in standard external solution to measure basal-evoked synaptic responses. Electrophysiology data were analyzed offline with AxoGraph X software (AxoGraph Scientific, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014284">SCR_014284</ext-link>). To determine the number of releasable SVs onto each neuron, we measured the charge transfer of the transient synaptic current induced by a 5 s application of hypertonic sucrose solution directly onto the neuron and then divided the sucrose charge by the charge of the average miniature event onto the same neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</xref>).</p><p>For current-clamp experiments, the resting membrane potential was measured and then current was injected to achieve a resting membrane potential of −70 mV. KYN was applied to block synaptic responses. Input resistance and membrane time constant were calculated from the steady state and charging transient, respectively, of voltage responses to 0.5 s, 20 pA hyperpolarizing current steps. Membrane capacitance was calculated by dividing the time constant by the input resistance. AP were evoked with 0.5 s, 20 pA depolarizing current steps. AP threshold was defined as the membrane potential at the inflection point of the rising phase of the AP. AP amplitude was defined as the difference in membrane potential between the AP peak and threshold. The membrane potential values were not corrected for the liquid junction potential.</p><p>For optogenetic stimulation experiments, pairs of Cre-expressing and control neurons were voltage clamped and held at −60 mV, which was the empirically determined reversal potential for GABAergic responses. Light pulses (5 ms at 5% power) were applied via a X-Cite 120 LED (Excelitas) triggered by a TTL output from the digitizer and controlled by Clampex. The light was passed through a Brightline 4050B filter (Semrock) and the 20x objective of the microscope to activate the afferents of a small number of Chronos-expressing neurons onto the recorded neurons.</p><p>For eEPSC measurements in varying Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, EPSCs from hippocampal neurons were measured in extracellular solution containing 0.5 mM, 2 mM, 4 mM, or 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in a randomized order. Responses were also measured in standard external solution (2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) between treatments and cells with a greater than 20% shift in the standard solution ePESC amplitude were not used. The responses were normalized to the response in 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and fit with the Hill equation in Prism 8 (GraphPad Prism, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>) to create the dose-response curve and obtain the EC<sub>50</sub> and Hill coefficient.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Miniature event detection</title><p>Miniature synaptic potentials were recorded for 70–90 s in 500 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX, Enzo Life Sciences) to block AP-evoked release. Data were filtered at 1 kHz and analyzed using template-based miniature event detection algorithms implemented in the AxoGraph X. The threshold for detection was set at three times the baseline SD from a template of 0.5 ms rise time and 3 ms decay. For each neuron, 3 mM KYN was applied as a negative control to detect false positive events. If the frequency of false positives exceeded 0.25 the frequency of total positives, the neuron was discarded. If rate was lower than 0.25, the amplitude and frequency of false positives were subtracted from the total to obtain the rate and frequency of true positives.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Synaptic vesicle release rate analysis</title><p>The rate constant for vesicle fusion (k) was calculated for each neuron and each mode of vesicle release with the first order reaction equation r = k [A], where r = the observed vesicle release rate (SVs/s) and A = the number of SVs in the RRP. For spontaneous release, the observed vesicle release rate was the mEPSC frequency. For the peak rate of evoked SV release, at least 10 EPSCs were collected per neuron, baselined to the 5 ms period immediately preceding the stimulation, filtered at 1 kHz and deconvolved with the waveform of the mean mEPSC from that neuron using a custom algorithm implemented in Axograph X to give the SV release rate waveform. The deconvolved EPSC waveform was then integrated and the maximum slope over a 1 ms time bin was considered the peak rate of SV release. For the spontaneous release rate after 10 Hz stimulation, the vesicle release rate was the mean mEPSC frequency over 10 s beginning 100 ms after the last stimulation in the train. For asynchronous release, the vesicle release rate was calculated by fitting a single exponential to the fast component of the EPSC decay, subtracting the fast component from the total, and then dividing the charge transfer of the remaining response by the charge of the average mEPSC for each neuron. For asynchronous release during 10 Hz stimulation, the vesicle release rate was calculated by baselining the first EPSC in the train, fitting a single exponential to the fast component of the EPSC decay of the last EPSC in the train, subtracting the fast component from the total, and then dividing the charge transfer of the remaining response by the charge of the average mEPSC for each neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang and Mennerick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otsu et al., 2004</xref>). To account for depletion of the pool during the train, A was estimated by multiplying the number of SVs in the RRP times the ratio of the charge of the last EPSC to the charge of the first EPSC in the train. Although we note that this may underestimate the amount of depletion due to an increase in release probability during the train.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Experimental design and statistical analysis</title><p>KaleidaGraph 4.5 (Synergy Software) and Prism 7 (GraphPad Prism, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>) were used to create graphs. To test for statistical significance, we used generalized estimating equations (GEE) in SPSS (24.0 Chicago, III (IBM, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002865">SCR_002865</ext-link>), which allows for within-subject correlations and the specification of the most appropriate distribution for the data. All data distributions were assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Datasets that were significantly different from the normal distribution (p&lt;0.05) were fit with models using the gamma distribution and a log link. Normal datasets were fit with models using a linear distribution and identity link. We used the model-based estimator for the covariance matrix and an exchangeable structure for the working correlation matrix. Goodness of fit was determined using the corrected quasi likelihood under independence model criterion and by the visual assessment of residuals. Because neurons and animals from the same culture are not independent measurements, culture was used as the subject variable, and animals and neurons were considered within-subject measurements. All values reported in the text are estimated marginal means + / - standard error. Sample sizes for microisland culture analysis were estimated based on our previous results from the effects of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Weston et al., 2012</xref>). To determine our sample size for the experiments using paired recording and optogenetic excitation, we performed a power analysis in G*Power 3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faul et al., 2009</xref>) based on the effect size of the EPSC amplitude measurements in the single-neuron cultures and calculated the number of pairs we needed to record from to detect a difference with 80% power at α = 0.05 in each group if the effect on EPSC amplitude were purely postsynaptic.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH/NINDS grants NS087095 and NS110945, and the COBRE Neuroscience award P30 103498.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers agreed that your study was performed to a high standard and clearly documented diverse but specific functions of mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes in synaptic transmission. That said, they also identified critical weaknesses that need to be addressed in a revision.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>mTOR kinase signaling is important for neuronal growth regulation and neuronal network integrity, as demonstrated by neurological disorders associated with disruption in proper mTOR signaling. Previous work indicated that mTOR interference regulates various aspects of neuronal function and morphology, and may cause the neurological dysfunction through impaired synaptic functions. The mTOR kinase exists in two complexes, and the main focus of this manuscript is to examine a putative differential impact of mTORC1 and -2 complexes in synaptic transmission of central mammalian neurons. The authors use clever genetic deletion mTOR subcomplex components Raptor and Rictor. While previous studies showed that either complex is required for proper formation of dendritic structure, here the detailed functional and morphological analysis allowed the authors to unambiguously demonstrate that the two complexes perform partially overlapping and also quite distinct functions at the pre- and post synapse. This finding that Rictor/mTOR complexes predominantly act on presynaptic processes, while Raptor/mTOR predominately postsynaptic was quite surprising and has impact in understanding the differential roles of the mTOR kinase complexes in regulating synaptic strength in neuronal networks. The results are extensive in its depth of synaptic mechanisms (evoked, spontaneous release, synchronous vs asynchronous etc) and the outcome is quite clear, and proper statistical procedures were used. The controls are also adequate, and fully supporting the authors conclusion.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Given the divergent roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in regulating synaptic transmission, it is important to know whether there is any specificity to the subcellular localization of Raptor and Rictor. Is Raptor enriched postsynaptically and Rictor enriched presynaptically?</p><p>2) As discussed by the authors, a role for mTORC1 in regulating postsynaptic function is not particularly novel. Thus, the novel findings in the manuscript are that mTORC2 appears to be acting primarily to regulate presynaptic function. This finding is especially important because negative regulators upstream of mTOR are implicated in disorders of the brain. However, there are no experiments designed to determine how mTORC2 is regulating presynaptic function. We think it is important for the authors to show in at least one of their presynaptic measures a potential mechanism that can explain the effects of Rictor reduction.</p><p>3) Figure 1.

So, instead of directly localizing Raptor or Rictor at the synapse, we relied on levels of their downstream targets. Indeed, a previous publication (Tang et al, 2002) had shown that a well-known mTORC1 target, 4EBP, is localized at the postsynapse. We therefore performed new immunostaining experiments to show that the mTORC2 target pAkt is localized at the presynapse, and that this signal is significantly reduced in Rictor-KO neurons. The results of these experiments are now presented in a new Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As discussed by the authors, a role for mTORC1 in regulating postsynaptic function is not particularly novel.

Because one of the minor points raised was the evidence for a change in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependency of release, we decided to address this by testing whether mTORC2 inactivation alters the eEPSC-Ca<sup>2+</sup> dose-response curve. We found that the EC50 for Ca<sup>2+</sup> was significantly greater in Rictor-KO neurons, suggesting that the mechanism underlying the effect of mTORC2 inactivation on SV release is due to altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity. The results of these experiments are now presented in a new Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1. Methods for verifying KO are rather indirect. Please provide a direct validation of the KO.</p></disp-quote><p>In our original submission, we relied on three indirect results as evidence that <italic>Raptor</italic> and <italic>Rictor</italic> were conditionally deleted in our neurons: expected reductions in the levels of known targets, expected reductions in soma size, and in dendritic outgrowth. The reasons we relied on this indirect approach were that available antibodies for Raptor and Rictor proteins gave a very poor, non-specific immunofluorescent signal, and we expected that the presence of WT astrocytes that express normal levels of Raptor and Rictor in our preparation would confound a bulk approach (e.g. PCR or Western blot analysis of lysates). We believe that these three measurements together provide strong evidence that we are efficiently deleting <italic>Raptor</italic> and <italic>Rictor</italic> from our cells, however, we recognize the value in providing a more direct measurement of their loss. In response to the comments we again attempted to optimize available antibodies for immunofluorescence, but failed to observe a specific signal. As an alternative approach, we plated a higher density of neurons on WT astrocytes and performed Western blot analysis. The experiments showed significant reductions in both Raptor and Rictor protein levels. Given the ratio of astrocytes to neurons in the culture and the efficiency of viral transduction (approx. 80%), this indicates a very high efficiency of recombination in transduced neurons. The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
