In the Brassicaceae, self-incompatibility (SI) is a spectacular example of a diversified allelic series in which numerous highly diverged receptor-ligand combinations are segregating in natural populations. However, the evolutionary mechanisms by which new SI specificities arise have remained elusive. Using in planta ancestral protein reconstruction, we demonstrate that two allelic variants segregating as distinct receptor-ligand combinations diverged through an asymmetrical process whereby one variant has retained the same recognition specificity as their (now extinct) putative ancestor, while the other has functionally diverged and now represents a novel specificity no longer recognized by the ancestor. Examination of the structural determinants of the shift in binding specificity suggests that qualitative rather than quantitative changes of the interaction are an important source of evolutionary novelty in this highly diversified receptor-ligand system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>self-incompatibility</kwd><kwd>ancestral protein resurrection</kwd><kwd>evolutionary novelty</kwd><kwd>receptor-ligand interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Novel project grant #648321</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castric</surname><given-names>Vincent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In-planta ancestral protein resurrection of the female determinant of self-incompatibility specificity in <italic>Arabidopsis halleri</italic> demonstrates that two allelic variants currently segregating as distinct receptor-ligand combinations diverged through an asymmetrical process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A central goal of biology is to understand the evolutionary forces and molecular processes by which new traits and functions emerge in living organisms. A major challenge toward this goal is that many cellular processes rely on interactions between molecular partners (protein-protein interactions or regulatory interactions between for example transcription factors and their binding sites; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Courtier-Orgogozo et al., 2019</xref>) rather than on the action of individual components in isolation. At present, the overall structure of protein-protein or regulatory interaction networks is just starting to be understood at the genome level in a handful of model organisms, and a general understanding of how the diversification of these networks led to the emergence of new biological functions in distinct lineages is crucially lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nooren and Thornton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreani and Guerois, 2014</xref>). In two-component genetic systems, specificity of the interaction can be very tight such as for example in receptor-ligand interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laub and Goulian, 2007</xref>) or bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aakre et al., 2015</xref>). In these systems, the emergence of novel traits involves evolutionary modification of the interacting partners, leading to potential disruption of the interaction or to detrimental cross-talk, at least transiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Plach et al., 2017</xref>). A central aspect of the diversification process therefore concerns the functional nature of the evolutionary intermediate. Two main scenarios have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aakre et al., 2015</xref>). The first scenario posits that a functional change results from introduction of a mutation that first modifies one of the two partners, initially disrupting the functional interaction and leading to a non-functional intermediate. If fitness of this non-functional intermediate is not impaired too drastically, it may remain in the population until a compensatory mutation hits the second partner and rescues the interaction in a modified state, resulting in the novel function. An alternative scenario though, is that the first mutation may broaden rather than inactivate specificity of one of the two interacting partners, transiently releasing constraint on the other before specificity of the first partner becomes restricted again, thus maintaining functionality of the system all along the process. Distinguishing between these two scenarios requires functional characterization of the ancestral evolutionary intermediates, which has been achieved in a very limited number of biological cases such as bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aakre et al., 2015</xref>), acquisition of cortisol specificity of the mammalian glucocorticoid receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bridgham et al., 2009</xref>) or mammalian retinoic acid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gutierrez-Mazariegos et al., 2016</xref>). The scenario of a promiscuous intermediate seems to have received better support, but whether this is a truly general pattern remains to be determined. A major limitation is that detailed population genetic models taking into account how natural selection is acting on variants of the two genes given their specific biological function are lacking for most genetic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aakre et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aharoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloom and Arnold, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bridgham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matsumura and Ellington, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sayou et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Self-incompatibility (SI) in flowering plants is a prime biological system to investigate how functional diversification can proceed between two molecular partners over the course of evolution. SI has evolved as a strategy to prevent selfing and enforce outcrossing, thereby avoiding the deleterious effects of inbreeding depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nettancourt, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kitashiba and Nasrallah, 2014</xref>). In <italic>Brassicaceae</italic>, SI is genetically controlled by a single multiallelic non-recombining locus called the S-locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nettancourt, 1977</xref>). This locus encodes two highly polymorphic self-recognition determinant proteins: the female cell-surface ‘receptor’ S-LOCUS RECEPTOR KINASE (SRK) is expressed in stigmatic papillae cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takasaki et al., 2000</xref>) and the male ‘ligand’ S-LOCUS CYSTEIN RICH PROTEIN (SCR) is displayed at the pollen surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schopfer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takayama et al., 2000</xref>). The SI response consists in pollen rejection by the pistil and is induced by allele-specific interaction between the SRK and SCR proteins when encoded by the same haplotype (S-haplotype, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kachroo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nasrallah and Nasrallah, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Takayama et al., 2001</xref>). These two interacting proteins exhibit a high degree of sequence variability and a large number of these highly diverged allelic variants segregate in natural populations of SI species (several dozens to nearly two hundred, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castric and Vekemans, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lawrence, 2000</xref>). This large allelic diversity of receptor-ligand combinations must have arisen through repeated diversification events, but the molecular process and evolutionary scenario involved in the diversification of an ancestral haplotype into distinct descendant specificities are still unresolved.</p><p>Three evolutionary scenarios for emergence of new self-incompatibility specificities have been proposed so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Charlesworth et al., 2005</xref>). The ‘compensatory mutation’ scenario posits that diversification proceeds through self-compatible intermediates that is following transient disruption of the receptor-ligand interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gervais et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Uyenoyama et al., 2001</xref>). Population genetic analysis confirmed that S-allele diversification is indeed possible through this scenario, but only under some combinations of model parameters (high inbreeding depression, high rate of self-pollination and low number of co-segregating S-alleles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gervais et al., 2011</xref>). Under these restrictive conditions, the ancestral recognition specificity can be maintained in the long run along with the derived specificity, effectively resulting in allelic diversification. A second scenario was presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chookajorn et al. (2004)</xref>, who proposed that diversification results from the progressive reinforcement of SRK/SCR recognition capacity among slight functional variants of <italic>SCR</italic> and <italic>SRK</italic> that might segregate within the population. At the limit of the very low level of intra-allelic polymorphism observed in natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castric et al., 2010</xref>) this model bears similarity to the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gervais et al. (2011)</xref>, who also predicted the maintenance of an ancestral recognition specificity unchanged and the evolution of a new divergent specificity, except it assumes no SC intermediate. However, the progressive reinforcement process proposed by this model may rather result in the production of two descendant allelic specificities that are both functionally distinct from their ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). A third scenario was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matton et al. (1999)</xref> and involves a dual-specificity intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This scenario was criticized on population genetics grounds because such a dual-specificity haplotype would recognize and reject more potential mates for reproduction than its progenitor haplotype resulting in lower reproductive success, and should therefore be disfavoured by natural selection and quickly eliminated from the populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Charlesworth, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Uyenoyama and Newbigin, 2000</xref>). A main unanswered question is whether functional specificities remain stable over time or are subject to frequent turnover. Detailed theoretical analysis of the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gervais et al. (2011)</xref> showed that under a large portion of the parameter space, the introduced self-compatible intermediate is predicted to exclude its functional ancestor from the population. Secondary introduction of the compensatory mutation then effectively results in turnover of recognition specificities along allelic lines rather than in diversification per se. A turnover of recognition specificities may therefore be expected along each allelic lineage, rather than their long-term maintenance over evolutionary times. A similar process could also be occurring according to the progressive reinforcement model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chookajorn et al. (2004)</xref>. Overall, while the large allelic diversity at the S-locus is one of the most striking features of this system, the evolutionary scenario and molecular route by which new S-alleles arise remain largely unknown. An essential limitation in the field is the crucial absence of direct experimental approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To conclusively evaluate these models we used ancestral sequence reconstruction of S-haplotypes that are currently segregating in the plant <italic>Arabidopsis halleri</italic>. Ancestral sequence reconstruction is a new approach to 'resurrect' ancestral biological systems, whereby the sequence of an ancestral gene or allele is determined through phylogenetic analyses, then synthesized de novo and its functional properties (in terms of <italic>e.g.</italic> biochemical activity, conformation or binding capacity) are compared to those of its contemporary descendants.

We used the structural model of the interaction complex formed by SCR and SRK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma et al., 2016</xref>) to compare cognate and non cognate complexes in terms of number and nature of atomic contacts and predict how the ancestral receptor is expected to interact with either SCR03 or SCR28. As previously demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma et al. (2016)</xref>, SCR binding induces homodimerization of the extracellular domain of SRK (eSRK, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), forming eSRK:SCR heterotetramers composed of two SCR molecules bound to two SRK molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). The switch in recognition specificity occurred along the branch leading to <italic>SRK28</italic>, and therefore must involve some of the 29 amino acid differences along this branch. In contrast, the 31 amino acid differences that accumulated along the branch leading to <italic>SRK03</italic> have not fully altered the recognition specificity. Overall, we find a slightly higher number of atomic contacts between the SCR and SRK molecules in the SRK03-SCR03 cognate complex (1543 contacts over 91 and 62 distinct SRK and SCR amino acids respectively) than in the SRK28-SCR28 cognate complex (1395 contacts over 89 and 57 distinct SRK and SCR amino acids respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As already noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma et al.

Specifically, the SRK03/SCR28 and SRK28/SCR03 non-cognate complexes were predicted to establish a total of 1546 and 1328 contacts, respectively, between atoms of their SCR and SRK molecules, very close to the 1543 and 1395 predicted contacts for the SRK03/SCR03 and SRK28/SCR28 cognate complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). They were also not characterized by any obvious steric clashes that would prevent the proper docking of SCR and SRK. Hence, the overall stability of the complex does not seem to be the primary determinant of recognition specificity. Consequently, the specificity of the interaction must be a function of some qualitative features rather than of the quantitative strength of the interaction.</p><p>While the majority of amino acids retained unchanged atomic contacts in cognate vs. non-cognate interactions, using a 5% threshold we identified six amino acid positions of the eSRK protein that displayed important differences in terms of contacts they establish with SCR in the cognate <italic>vs.</italic> the non-cognate complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C, E and F</xref>). Four of these amino acid positions also displayed very contrasted interactions in the S03 vs. the S28 complexes (residues S201, R220, R279, W296, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and D</xref>). For instance, the R residue at position 279 of SRK establishes three times more contacts with SCR in the SRK03/SCR03 than in the SRK28/SCR28 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These four residues are therefore prime candidates for the determination of binding specificity. Intriguingly, three of the six amino acids were identical between SRK03 and SRK28, and yet interacted in sharply different ways with their respective SCR ligands. For instance, while identical between the SRK03 and SRK28 sequences, residues W296 and R279 established three to four times more contacts in the S03 than in the S28 complex, and the R220 residue is involved in twice as many contacts in the S28 than in the S03 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

However, in most cases we remain far from a predictive understanding of how the specific evolutionary forces imposed on a given interacting pair of proteins at the molecular level translate into a given process of functional diversification. As a result, little is known about how diversification happens in nature, both in terms of whether some evolutionary pathways are preferentially followed over others and in terms of the molecular modifications involved. Here, we show that diversification of two S-alleles from their putative common ancestor proceeded through asymmetrical functional divergence, with one allele having largely retained its ancestral specificity and the other one having acquired a novel recognition specificity that was previously absent.</p><p>Overall, our results are thus compatible with the model of SI specificity diversification by compensatory mutation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gervais et al.

Ancestral reconstruction is based on probabilistic inference, and our results show that a single amino acid modification (I vs M at position 208) can entirely compromise the SI response. It is therefore possible that the putative ancestral receptor had a partly diminished capacity to elicit the SI reaction because of imperfect reconstruction. Alternatively, this partial response could be due to parallel changes to the SCR ligand, followed by amino acid substitutions occurring between SRKa and SRK03 to fine-tune the SRK03/SCR03 interaction.

In other words, a ligand is predicted to bind its non-cognate just as well as its cognate receptor, but it activates only the proper one by interacting with a different set of amino acid residues at the binding interface. This may point to a mechanism of allosteric activation, whereby changes in the set (rather than number) of amino acid contacts with the ligand lead to changes in the shape of the receptor. Allosteric activation is important in the context of protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kang et al., 2015</xref>) as well as of the binding of transcription factors to their DNA binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gronemeyer and Bourguet, 2009</xref>) and may be a general feature of molecular interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma et al., 2010</xref>). In our system, the allosteric activation model suggests that only a few amino acid residues determine recognition specificity. This can be tested by directly measuring binding affinities, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma et al. (2016)</xref>. It will be interesting to determine experimentally whether this conclusion extends to more diverged pairs of SCR-SRK alleles, whose interactions are more common in SI systems than those between highly similar alleles studied here, because this balanced polymorphism has been maintained over a very long evolutionary time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Phylogeny-based ancestral SRK resurrection</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Sequence collection</title><p>In order to reconstruct the ancestral sequence of the <italic>AhSRK28</italic> and <italic>AhSRK03</italic> SRK alleles, we first collected 17 full or partial sequences of the <italic>SRK</italic> first exon belonging to the haplogroup B/2.

interacting proteins, a female-expressed S-locus Receptor Kinase and a male-expressed ligand, S-Locus Cysteine-rich Protein (SCR). Pollen is rejected when SRK and SCR are encoded by the same haplotype. Highly diverged allelic variants segregate in natural populations, but how this allelic diversity arose from an ancestral haplotype is unresolved. The authors use ancestral reconstruction to investigate how different S haplotypes might have arisen – which is interesting in itself but also as a model for the general question of how genes diversify despite constraints due to specific interactions. A main strength of this work is that four plausible ancestral alleles are reconstructed (and replicated). They then tested 3 proposed models, by introducing various constructs of A. halleri SRK into <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Their results provide a convincing answer: favoring compensatory mutations and SC intermediates, and rejecting 2 other proposed models.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Asymmetrical diversification of the receptor-ligand interaction controlling self-incompatibility in Arabidopsis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Sheila McCormick as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor.

The authors use ancestral reconstruction to investigate S locus evolution – which is interesting in itself but also, as the authors explain, a model for the general question of how genes diversify despite constraints due to specific interactions. A key issue in such studies is the reliability of the reconstruction. However, four plausible ancestral alleles are reconstructed (and replicated), which is a strength.</p><p>There are 3 ideas in the field, and to test them the authors introduce various constructs of A. halleri SRK into <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Their results provide a convincing answer (i.e. they favor the one of compensatory mutations and SC intermediates (Gervais).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The experiments are easy to follow and the discussion is thoughtful, but could be shortened by removing unnecessary repeats. For instance, the first paragraph just repeats what has already been stated perfectly clearly. Discussion subsection “Asymmetrical structural and functional divergence” can also be shortened considerably, and these shortenings will help readers come to the most important questions that they will have in mind at this point – i.e., which of the models outlined in the Introduction are excluded. Given the value of the work, it is worthwhile to make the text as clear as possible.</p><p>This section needs slight revision, to something like the following: &quot;Overall, our results thus unambiguously reject two previously proposed models of SI specificity diversification. The model of gradual divergence of pairwise SRK-SCR affinities along lineages (Chookajorn et al., 2004) is rejected because it predicts that both descendent alleles would have been functionally distinct from the ancestor. The model of promiscuous dual-specificity intermediates (Matton et al., 1999) is also rejected, because Uyenoyama and Newbigin, 2000, have shown that a dual-specificity haplotype can be maintained in the population only in the absence of the ancestral specificity, while we show here that the ancestral specificity (S03) remained present. In contrast, the remaining scenario (in which diversification proceeds through transient self-compatible intermediates; Gervais et al., 2011; Uyenoyama et al., 2001) is compatible with our observation of long-term maintenance of functional specificities&quot;.</p><p>Please consider stating putative ancestral throughout or &quot;ancestral&quot;, as you only surmise that this could be the scenario. Similarly, the terms &quot;resurrected&quot; and &quot;now extinct&quot; are suppositions.</p><p>In later experiments they analyze potential amino acid contacts in the synthesized SRKs and SCRs.
