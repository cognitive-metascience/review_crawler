We found that a thrombospondin-repeat containing sporozoite-specific protein named thrombospondin-releated protein 1 (TRP1) is important for oocyst egress and salivary gland invasion, and hence for the transmission of malaria. We imaged the release of sporozoites from oocysts in situ, which was preceded by active motility. Parasites lacking TRP1 failed to migrate within oocysts and did not egress, suggesting that TRP1 is a vital component of the events that precede intra-oocyst motility and subsequently sporozoite egress and salivary gland invasion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19157.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19157.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19157.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Malaria is caused by a parasite transmitted by certain types of mosquito. The parasite lives in different organs within its vertebrate animal and insect hosts and to cope with these different environments it has a complex life cycle with several highly specialized life stages. To move from an infected mosquito into vertebrates the parasite produces spore-like cells called sporozoites that are able to enter different tissues and move very fast. These cells develop inside parasite-made structures called oocysts, which form at the stomach wall of the mosquito. After emerging from the oocyst, sporozoites float through the mosquito’s circulatory system and eventually enter the salivary glands where they can be transmitted to vertebrates when the mosquito bites.</p><p>Efforts to develop malaria treatments and vaccines have focused on understanding the parasite’s life cycle and identifying ways to control or eradicate key stages. Most researchers focus on the stage where the parasite is living in the vertebrate and actively causing disease, while the events in the mosquito are less intensely investigated. While several parasite proteins have been shown to be important for the release of sporozoites from oocysts, the molecular events leading to this release have not yet been fully resolved.</p><p>Klug and Frischknecht used time-lapse microscopy to film the release of the sporozoites of a malaria parasite known as <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>. The experiments show that the sporozoites can leave oocysts in several different ways. Furthermore, Klug and Frischknecht identified a new parasite protein named TRP1 that is essential for the sporozoites to leave oocysts and invade the salivary glands. Sporozoites lacking TRP1 were not able to move and they were unable to leave the oocyst or invade the salivary glands.</p><p>Klug and Frischknecht propose a new working model of the molecular events that govern sporozoite release in which TRP1 is required for sporozoites to move prior to their exit from oocysts. In the future, using the same techniques to analyze genetically modified parasites will help to reveal more details about sporozoite release.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19157.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19157.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Plasmodium berghei</kwd><kwd>sporozoite</kwd><kwd>salivary gland</kwd><kwd>invasion</kwd><kwd>sporosome</kwd><kwd>TRAP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frischknecht</surname><given-names>Friedrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGY0071/2011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frischknecht</surname><given-names>Friedrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC StG 281719</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frischknecht</surname><given-names>Friedrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A surface protein triggers intra-oocyst motility of Plasmodium sporozoites to ensure parasite egress from oocysts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many parasites switch between multiple hosts in order to complete their life cycles. These host switches are often accompanied by population bottlenecks where just a few parasites are sufficient for infection. For <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, the causative agent of malaria, a host switch is followed by an expansion of the parasite population in both the insect and the vertebrate host. A single <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite that establishes itself in the mosquito gut is enough to form an extracellular oocyst, in which hundreds of sporozoites can develop to colonize the salivary gland and be injected back into the vertebrate host. In <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species that infect mammals, a single sporozoite that successfully enters a hepatocyte is enough to produce thousands of progeny red-blood-cell-invading merozoites that then cause a full infection. In order to progress to the next developmental stage, the fully formed parasites need to escape their respective host cell or the oocyst.</p><p>These different immediate environments — a red blood cell within the blood stream, a hepatocyte within the liver parenchyma and an oocyst underneath the basal lamina of the mosquito gut — suggest that the different parasite stages use a mixture of unique and conserved processes for egress. There is evidence from all three stages to show that the release of parasites is dependent on a common set of specific proteins encoded by the parasite, including different proteases especially of the SERA family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arisue et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roiko and Carruthers, 2009</xref>) but also other factors with no or unknown enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roiko and Carruthers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wirth and Pradel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Talman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ponzi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Koning-Ward et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ishino et al., 2009</xref>). Egress from blood cells and hepatocytes has been filmed in spectacular detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abkarian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sturm et al., 2006</xref>), and exflagellation of microgametes has been studied extensively by light and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sinden et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deligianni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wirth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). These movies show, for example, the rapid rupture of the red blood cell membrane upon release of merozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abkarian et al., 2011</xref>), as well as the perforation of the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) and the erythrocyte membrane to enable exflagellation of activated male gametocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sinden et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deligianni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wirth et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, intravital microscopy in mice revealed the formation of merozoite-containing vesicles, termed merosomes, that bud from the infected hepatocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sturm et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baer et al., 2007</xref>). By contrast, we have no live visual information about sporozoite egress from oocysts. Indeed, despite the adaptation of new dynamic imaging approaches in parasite biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frischknecht, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Niz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amino and Suzuki, 2014</xref>), the only evidence to show how sporozoites egress from oocysts are images from electron microscopy. These show that sporozoites can appear in holes within the oocyst wall and the basal lamina that surrounds the oocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Strome and Beaudoin, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meis et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sinden and Strong, 1978</xref>), but also suggest that oocysts could rupture to release many parasites simultaneoulsly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meis et al., 1992</xref>). Different species might use or prefer different ways to egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Orfano et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A number of proteins have been identified as essential for sporozoite egress from oocysts of the human malaria parasite <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and of the rodent model malaria parasite <italic>P. berghei</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Some of the parasite lines that lack these proteins cannot exit the oocysts but can still migrate when mechanically released from oocysts whereas others cannot. Curiously, parasites lacking the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) also fail to undergo productive motility and salivary gland invasion, yet they have no defect in egress from oocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sultan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Münter et al., 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, sporozoites that lack TRAP are still able to perform forms of unproductive movement, during which the parasite is attached at one focal spot to the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Münter et al., 2009</xref>), which might be sufficient to force egress from oocysts. However, the number of non-related proteins that function in egress, and the lack of any clear interaction between these proteins, suggests that even more proteins are involved in the egress of sporozoites from oocysts. It was recently shown that the TRAP-family member MTRAP, previously thought to be important for red blood cell invasion by merozoites, is crucial for the egress of gametocytes from host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kehrer et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bargieri et al., 2016</xref>). We rationalized that similar proteins might also play a role in oocyst egress and searched for distantly related TRAP-like proteins. This revealed an as yet uncharacterized protein that carries a single thrombospondin repeat, one of the two adhesive domains found in TRAP-family members. This thrombospondin-related protein 1, TRP1, also shared a transmembrane domain and a similar cytoplasmic tail with TRAP-family proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The generation of TRP1-deficient parasites revealed a function for TRP1 in sporozoite egress from oocysts. Upon filming sporozoite egress from oocysts in isolated midguts, we found that motility precedes egress and that sporozoites that lack TRP1 are not motile within oocysts. Intriguingly, isolated <italic>trp1(-)</italic> sporozoites can undergo motility, suggesting that TRP1 might play a role in activating sporozoite motility in vivo prior to egress from oocysts.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19157.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The thrombospondin-related protein 1 (TRP1) shares distinct domains with TRAP-family proteins, belongs to the family of TRAP-like proteins and is present in all <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TSR-containing proteins in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>.

id="s2-1"><title>TRP1 belongs to the family of TRAP-related proteins</title><p>Within the mosquito, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites display a repertoire of proteins that are important for egress from oocysts (SERA5, CSP, GAMA, SIAP-1, PCRMP3 and 4, and CCp2 and 3), motility (e.g. TRAP, MAEBL and S6) and salivary gland entry (e.g. TRAP and MAEBL). CSP in particular is interesting as it is essential for sporozoite formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ménard et al., 1997</xref>), as well as for efficient egress from oocysts once sporozoites have formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coppi et al., 2011</xref>) and also for sporozoite invasion of the salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coppi et al., 2011</xref>). While the structure of CSP's N-terminus is unknown, the α-thrombospondin repeat (αTSR) at the C-terminal end as well as the repeat region between the N- and the C-terminus have been solved by x-ray crystallography and NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doud et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Plassmeyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghasparian et al., 2006</xref>). The αTSR is especially interesting because this domain is believed to be involved in protein-protein interactions, as shown for the TSRs of thrombospondin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iruela-Arispe et al., 1999</xref>). Proteins containing TSRs are widespread among animals and protozoans and are mostly extracellular or secreted proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tucker, 2004</xref>). Also, at least one TSR is contained within all proteins of the TRAP-family, including MTRAP, which was recently found to be important for gametocyte egress from red blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kehrer et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bargieri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morahan et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In a search for uncharacterized TRAP-family-like TSR-containing proteins, we found a protein with unknown function in the rodent model parasite <italic>P. berghei</italic> (PBANKA_0707900). Because of the presence of a single TSR as a sole detectable domain, we will refer to this protein as thrombospondin-related protein 1 (TRP1).</p><p>The general domain composition of TRP1 shows many similarities to that of the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sultan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morahan et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The <italic>TRP1</italic> gene is intron-less, resides on chromosome 7 and encodes 896 amino acids. It can be found in all <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species and has a highly conserved core region that includes the TSR and the TMD (Figure 5A, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Both TRP1 and TRAP contain a signal peptide (SP), a TSR, a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, TRP1 lacks the penultimate tryptophan (W) that has been shown to be important for TRAP function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kappe et al., 1999</xref>) as well as the von Willebrandt factor like A-domain that is present at the N-terminus of TRAP and important for invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matuschewski et al., 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, not all of the TRAP-family proteins — CTRP, S6/TREP/UOS3, TLP and MTRAP — possess an A-domain, but they are unified by the conserved C-terminal tryptophan residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morahan et al., 2009</xref>). In comparison to that of TRAP, the N-terminal domain of TRP1 is less conserved and varies widely in length between different <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species (332 aa in <italic>P. vivax</italic>; 651 aa in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A similar observation was made for the CTD. Whereas the CTD domain of TRP1 contains 19 amino acids in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, it has a length of 97 amino acids in <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>. By contrast, the TSR of TRP1 is well conserved but has an unusual long insertion of 10 amino acids when compared to TSRs from other apicomplexan proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Clusters of acidic amino acids at the C-terminus have been shown to be important for TRAP function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kappe et al., 1999</xref>). However, the calculated isoelectric point (pI) of the CTD of TRP1 varied widely between homologues from different <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species and indicated no enrichment for acidic amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Due to the overall similarity to TRAP-family proteins, we grouped TRP1 together with TRAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thompson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Siddiqui et al., 2013</xref>), TRSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Labaied et al., 2007</xref>) and SSP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harupa et al., 2014</xref>) in the family of TRAP-related proteins that have a potential cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD) but lack the conserved tryptophan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Homologues of TRP1 can be found in all <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, but we could not identify homologues in other apicomplexans. However, homology predictions are difficult because TRP1 lacks a unique feature that allows unambiguous identification of protein homologues. As many TSR-containing proteins in other apicomplexan parasites are still uncharacterized, we cannot exclude the possibility that functional homologues exist outside of the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Oocysts lacking TRP1 develop normally but sporozoites fail to egress</title><p>To study the function of TRP1, we created the knockout lines <italic>trp1(-)</italic> and <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>trp1(-)</italic> is non-fluorescent, whereas in the <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> line, the <italic>trp1</italic> gene is replaced by the gene encoding the fluorescent protein mCherry. Expression of mCherry in <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> parasites was only observed in budding and completely sporulated oocysts up to hemolymph sporozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To see if the lack of <italic>trp1</italic> affects the development of oocysts, we counted the number of oocysts at different time points after infection of mosquitoes by <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> or the fluorescent control line <italic>fluo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klug et al., 2016</xref>), which expresses mCherry under control of the <italic>CSP</italic> promoter and GFP under control of the <italic>ef1α</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Oocyst numbers for the control decreased between day 12 and day 22, whereas the number of oocysts in infected <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> mosquitoes remained stable. To screen for morphological differences between <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> and the control line, oocysts at day 12 and day 22 were also imaged and classified into oocysts containing mature or budding sporozoites (sporulated) and oocysts that didn’t contain any sporozoite structures (unsporulated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This imaging showed that the percentage of <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> oocysts that had undergone or started sporogony (sporulated) was higher than the number of pre-mature (unsporulated) oocysts at both day 12 and day 22. While there was only a slight difference in this ratio between control and knockout on day 12, over 80% of the <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> oocysts were sporulated on day 22 compared with just 45% in the control line. As no morphological difference between sporulated knockout and control oocysts could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), we assumed that <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> sporozoites are fully developed but not able to egress. To study the infectivity of sporozoites lacking TRP1, we performed transmission experiments using either bites by infected mosquitoes or intravenous injections of 400,000–500,000 midgut sporozoites (Table 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, Figure 4—figure supplement 2). These experiments showed that mosquitoes infected with both knockout lines could not transmit the parasites to mice.

By contrast, mosquitoes that are infected with <italic>trp1(-)</italic> or <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> consistently showed high numbers of midgut sporozoites until 22 days post infection, while we observed only few sporozoites in the hemolymph and none in salivary glands (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To visualize this effect more clearly, we calculated the ratio of hemolymph sporozoites (HLS) to midgut sporozoites (MGS) and salivary gland sporozoites (SGS) to MGS. The ratio for SGS to MGS was zero for both <italic>trp1(-)</italic> lines, while the ratio for HLS to MGS was either zero (<italic>trp1(-)</italic>) or very low (<italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). We also generated two <italic>sera5(-)</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) that were used as control for a non-egressing strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aly and Matuschewski, 2005</xref>). Ratios of SGS to MGS and HLS to MGS for both strains gave similar results as for <italic>trp1(-)</italic> and <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). To investigate the cause of failure to egress, we performed motility assays of wild-type and <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> midgut and hemolymph sporozoites. Both wild-type and <italic>trp1(-)</italic> sporozoites derived from midguts were able to perform the typical circular gliding motility of sporozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vanderberg, 1974</xref>) but at very low rates (ca. 0.5–1% of the population) on day 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This fraction increased in hemolymph sporozoites to 10–20% of the population, and again, no significant difference between <italic>trp1(-)</italic> and wild-type sporozoites was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Interestingly the fraction of motile midgut sporozoites increased in the <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> line over time and reached a level comparable to that of wild-type hemolymph sporozoites at day 22 post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>).

We further constructed a parasite line in which GFP was C-terminally fused to TRP1, termed <italic>trp1-gfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This line showed no defect in sporozoite egress from oocysts but salivary glands contained consistently less sporozoites compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, we could only detect strong GFP fluorescence in the <italic>trp1-gfp</italic> line and weak GFP fluorescence in <italic>gfp-trp1∆N</italic> parasites, while all other lines were non-fluorescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast to <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> parasites, which express mCherry early during oocyst formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), GFP expression in <italic>gfp-trp1∆N</italic> parasites was only observed in oocysts with already matured sporozoites. This indicates that, beside the transcriptional regulation, TRP1 expression might also be post-transcriptionally regulated by the native 3’UTR, which is not present in <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> parasites. To test whether these lines transcribe the <italic>gfp</italic> and <italic>trp1</italic> genes as one transcript, we first performed RT-PCRs with cDNA generated from midgut sporozoites. We were able to amplify a <italic>gfp:trp1</italic> transcript in <italic>gfp-trp1comp</italic>, <italic>gfp-trp1∆N</italic> and <italic>gfp-trp1∆C</italic> sporozoites while no transcript could be detected in <italic>wt</italic>. In addition, we performed two RT-PCRs for <italic>trp1</italic> transcripts, amplifying sequences encoding the TSR and the N-terminus. While the PCR amplifying the TSR sequence gave a product in all lines including <italic>wt</italic>, a product for the N-terminal PCR was only observed in <italic>gfp-trp1comp, gfp-trp1∆C</italic> and <italic>wt</italic> parasites but, as expected, not in <italic>gfp-trp1∆N</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Finally, we performed Western blotting, which revealed only a short GFP-fusion protein as well as GFP for the C-terminally tagged full-length TRP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We could not detect full-length GFP-TRP1, suggesting that the protein is cleaved, and also failed to detect protein for the weakly GFP-expressing N-terminal deletion parasites.</p><p>Curiously, the C-terminal GFP-fusion protein of the full-length TRP1 localized strongly at the periphery of the oocyst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). By contrast, the GFP-fusion protein of the N-terminally deleted TRP1 did not show this localization and appeared to accumulate only within the sporozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Investigation of single sporozoites showed that the C-terminally tagged TRP1 localized at the periphery towards the rear end of the sporozoite, as well as within the sporozoite at the apical end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). By contrast, the GFP signal in the <italic>gfp-trp1∆N</italic> sporozoites localized to membranes within the parasite, presumably the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) as indicated by accumulations around the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). A parasite line expressing cytoplasmic GFP was used as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). By using anti-GFP antibodies in fixed sporozoites, we were not able to detect GFP-TRP1∆N on the sporozoite surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Comparison of the localizations of TRP1-GFP and GFP-TRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kehrer et al., 2016b</xref>) showed that the two proteins were localized differently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). While GFP-TRAP appears mostly localized to micronemes at the front end of the sporozoite, TRP1-GFP appears to localize in what might be a subset of micronemes or a different organelle that does not extend all the way to the front. These data together indicate that TRP1 is transported through the ER, is post-translationally processed and can accumulate at the periphery of the parasite on its rear end.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19157.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>TRP1-GFP localizes to the oocyst wall while GFP-TRP1ΔN accumulates in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Localization of TRP1-GFP in oocysts 11–14 days post infection.

To probe this in more detail, we established two new assays to image sporozoite egress from oocysts. These assays imaged extracted midguts placed either on microscope slides and pushed down by a coverslip or in a non-compacted setting in glass-bottom Petri-dishes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). Individual midguts were placed in insect medium (Grace’s medium, GibcoTM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and imaged either at high or low magnification for up to one hour. As expected, the frequency of egress events was low for both setups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). However, we were able to observe dozens of egress events. In one type of egress, mostly observed in the slide-coverslip setup, sporozoites were seen to be moving actively inside oocysts followed by egress from oocysts in a manner resembling the merosomes formed by late liver stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sturm et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baer et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). We thus termed these vesicle-like deformations of the cyst wall sporosomes. From a total of over 800 imaged oocysts, we observed active sporozoite motility in 5–6% and egress-like events in about 3% of the wild-type oocysts. The same type of events with similar frequencies were also observed at the 2015 and 2016 <italic>Biology of Parasitism</italic> courses at Woods Hole using mosquitoes from two different insectaries. All egress-like events were preceded by sporozoite motility. By contrast, we observed no egress-like events in the <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> line and also no actively moving sporozoites within oocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Although no egress could be observed in the knockout line, we were concerned that the pressure on the midguts induced by the overlaying cover slip might force sporozoite egress. Therefore, we performed the same assay in glass-bottom Petri-dishes, in which midguts were simply placed in medium with no lid. To this end, we used a fluorescent line (<italic>fluo</italic>) because imaging was performed with low magnification (10x) and egress events were only visible with fluorescence detection. In these experiments, we were able to observe motile sporozoites and their egress in the control at rates similar to those seen in the previous assay. Furthermore, we did not detect motility or egress in the TRP1 knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Videos 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>). In this assay, we observed a variety of events like rapid bursting of oocysts, sporozoites budding from oocysts and sporozoites moving inside oocysts or their surrounding tissue (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Videos 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">6</xref>). In parasites lacking the protease SERA5, we confirmed sporozoite motility within oocysts as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aly and Matuschewski, 2005</xref>) and did also not witness any egress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Videos 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">8</xref>).

The most striking was the apparent bursting of sporozoites and the apparent budding of sporozoites within vesicle-like deformations of the cyst wall that we termed sporosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">7</xref>). We imaged 547 control oocysts over a total of 16 hr and observed egress events in about 3% of these oocysts, suggesting a rate of 0.5–1 egress events per hour. At this rate, 50% of oocysts in a medium infected midgut (~100 oocysts) would be emptied in 2–3 days. These numbers suggest that the observed events might well reflect those occurring in vivo. Naturally, in vivo observations would be desirable but intravital imaging in mosquitoes is challenging due to the opaque nature of the chitinous exoskeleton. This can be partially overcome by blood feeding mosquitoes just before imaging; this causes the abdomen to inflate to such a degree that individual oocysts can be imaged by fluorescence microscopy. Yet, it is unclear whether a recent blood meal would influence egress. The application of fiber optic imaging could overcome this challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sum and Ward, 2009</xref>). In this methodology, a thin fiber is introduced into the mosquito and individual oocysts should be visible to the patient observer. However, the low rates of egress events would make imaging egress events in vivo a formidable challenge.</p><p>The observation of sporozoite budding into what appears to be membrane-delimited vesicles was both unexpected and curious, as the origin of the surrounding ‘membrane’ is not obvious. The plasma membrane of the ookinete develops into the plasma membrane of the developing oocyst, which in turn forms the plasma membrane of the sporozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vanderberg and Rhodin, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thathy et al., 2002</xref>). Hence, sporozoites differ from intracellular growing stages that are surrounded by a parasitophorous vacuole and a host cell plasma membrane: there should be no membrane around the formed sporozoites since they are only surrounded by the oocyst wall. Yet, the appearance of these sporosomes suggests that some form of delimiting ‘membrane’ is present. Earlier scanning EM images of infected midguts suggested that oocysts can bud off smaller cysts that were called satellites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Strome and Beaudoin, 1974</xref>). It is not clear how satellite formation can occur or how it is initiated, but these observations suggest that the oocyst wall might be not completely rigid and could show some level of elasticity. Hence part of the delimiting ‘membrane’ of the sporosomes could be derived simply from the oocyst wall and thus not be a lipid membrane but a thin sheet of oocyst wall material, similar to that which might surround sporozoites within satellites. As we only observed sporosome formation at midguts infected with wild-type parasites, it might well be that the oocyst wall is thinned by a succession of parasite-initiated proteolytic events, which are not initiated in <italic>trp1(-)</italic> or <italic>sera5(-)</italic> parasites. These events likely destabilize the wall in a way that enables sporozoites to egress via rupture or budding. Yet, EM imaging of sporulated <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> and wild-type oocysts showed no differences in the appearance of the oocyst wall. Even 24 days post infection, <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> oocysts showed little difference in morphology and no difference in oocyst wall thickness when compared to wild-type oocysts 12 days post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations could suggest that proteolytic degradation of the oocyst wall is not affected in oocysts lacking TRP1. Alternatively, proteolytic degradation might happen only shortly before or during egress and is therefore hard to observe by electron microscopy in wild-type oocysts. Clearly, in vivo imaging will be needed to confirm whether the different types of egress also occur in living mosquitoes. Nevertheless, our assays will allow a more quantitative description of sporozoite egress from oocysts as already shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> with the comparison between <italic>wt</italic>, <italic>trp1(-)</italic> and <italic>sera5(-)</italic> parasites.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>How could TRP1 interact with other proteins to mediate egress?</title><p>What role could TRP1 play during sporozoite egress from oocysts? Many TSR-containing proteins in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> have been studied and shown to have functions in gliding motility. The best example is TRAP, which is believed to interact with actin filaments below the plasma membrane to guide motility possibly by direct force transduction to the substrate. TRAP function is crucial as sporozoites that lack TRAP are not able to perform productive motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sultan et al., 1997</xref>) and are probably, as a consequence, also unable to invade the salivary glands and infect the mammalian host. Other proteins of the TRAP-family were shown to have similar functions. CTRP, for example, fulfills the same role as TRAP but in ookinetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dessens et al., 1999</xref>), and S6/TREP-deficient sporozoites have been shown to be less capable of gliding motility and invasion of salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steinbuechel and Matuschewski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Combe et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, TRAP-related proteins that lack the penultimate tryptophan in the cytoplasmic tail domain were also shown to support motility. The protein SSP3 is, for example, important for continuous movement of sporozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harupa et al., 2014</xref>). To accomplish these functions, TRAP-family proteins are localized at the plasma membrane. Therefore, it is likely that TRP1 is also at least partially secreted to the parasite surface, where it could initiate signaling from the outside as has been speculated recently to be the case for sporozoite surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kappe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Quadt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bane et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed surface proteomics of sporozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lindner et al., 2013</xref>) showed that TRP1, even if just at low amounts, can be detected on the outside of the sporozoite plasma membrane. Once on the surface, TRP1 could lead, for example, to sustained microneme secretion that would maintain or initiate gliding motility. Alternatively, it might play a role in motility by contributing to the disconnection of TRAP from actin filaments at the rear end, where the actin filament binding protein coronin was recently also shown to be localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bane et al., 2016</xref>). Although these functions remain highly speculative, in the absence of TRP1, there is no motility within oocysts and possibly reduced secretion. A scenario involving TRP1 in signal transduction is not at odds with the observation that isolated <italic>trp1(-)</italic> sporozoites can glide, as other surface proteins can probably also transduce or modulate signals. Also it appears that many diverse ligands can activate sporozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perschmann et al., 2011</xref>). Beside the direct interaction with ligands that make contact with the sporozoite surface, TRP1 could also assist in the correct trafficking and secretion of other proteins, as shown for MIC2 and the MIC2-associated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huynh et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Putative pathways that could trigger sporozoite egress from oocysts</title><p>Clearly, the processes and factors that lead to parasite egress from host cells in general and egress of sporozoites from oocysts in particular are still poorly understood. The factors that are known to date are the serine repeat antigen 5, SERA5 (previously named egress cysteine protease 1; ECP1), the GPI-anchored circumsporozoite protein, CSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aly and Matuschewski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tewari et al., 2002</xref>), the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> cysteine repeat modular proteins PCRMP3 and PCRMP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Douradinha et al., 2011</xref>) and the LCCL-domain-containing proteins PfCCp2 and PfCCp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pradel et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Sporozoites lacking SERA5, PCRMP3, PCRMP4, PfCCp2 and PfCCp3 fail to egress from oocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aly and Matuschewski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Douradinha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pradel et al., 2004</xref>), whereas parasites lacking CSP do not complete sporozoite formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ménard et al., 1997</xref>). The change of four basic amino acids into alanines within region II+ of CSP allowed normal sporozoite development but blocked egress from oocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). All six mutant parasites lines retained their capacity to migrate actively once sporozoites were mechanically released from oocysts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Another protein, the sporozoite invasion associated protein-1 (SIAP-1), possesses no recognizable structural or functional domains but has been identified as having a partial role in sporozoite egress. Parasites that lack SIAP-1 have a strongly reduced rate of sporozoites egressing from oocysts but are still able to enter into salivary glands in low numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Engelmann et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast to parasite lines that lack the previously mentioned proteins (SERA5, PCRMP 3 and 4, PfCCp 2 and 3) or parasite lines that contain specific mutations within CSP, SIAP-1 knockout sporozoites also fail to undergo efficient gliding motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Engelmann et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, the GPI-anchored micronemal antigen GAMA (previously named PSOP9) has been shown to be essential for egress from oocysts. Sporozoites that lack GAMA are also not able to perform gliding motility in vitro and within oocysts ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ecker et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, GAMA is expressed in all <italic>Plasmodium</italic> stages that contain micronemes and has been discussed as a potential vaccine candidate against blood stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hinds et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arumugam et al., 2011</xref>). This ubiquitous expression profile makes it unlikely that GAMA has a specific function in sporozoite egress from oocysts but suggests that it is important for egress and invasion in general. Therefore the egress defect of <italic>gama(-)</italic> sporozoites presumably causes a defect within the micronemes that has more or less impact dependent on the observed parasite stage. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that <italic>gama(-)</italic> ookinetes produce 78% fewer oocysts than wild-type ookinetes, indicating that the loss of GAMA has an effect prior to oocyst development.</p><p>We speculate that two different pathways, involving either intracellular or extracellular signals, might trigger the release of sporozoites from their oocyst. The intracellular pathway might require quorum sensing between the sporozoites of an oocyst that reponds to the presence or absence of a specific factor once sporulation is completed. This signal might be followed by secretion of micronemal and possibly exonemal proteins (e.g. SERA5) that induce both sporozoite motility and degradation of the oocyst wall. While continuous motility as well as inflow of extracellular factors might further enhance protein secretion, the oocyst envelope might become more and more fragile, leading eventually to sporozoite egress. The extracellular pathway might be initiated by the permeabilization of the oocyst wall, either by intracellular factors that are secreted after sporulation or by the breakdown of the oocyst wall that is not longer maintained once sporulation is completed. The inflow of extracellular factors might initiate the secretion process, which leads, as described for the intracellular pathway, to increased motility as well as breakdown of the oocyst wall and finally sporozoite egress. Independent of the pathway that triggers sporozoite egress, degradation of the oocyst wall is probably an interplay of multiple factors that do not lead to a uniform breakdown of the oocyst envelope but create focal weakenings that enable local release of sporozoites or budding of sporosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19157.031</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Potential model for sporozoite egress from oocysts.</title><p>Hypothetical model of a cascade of events that lead to sporozoite egress from oocysts.

While clearly speculative, this first model of a cascade of possible events linking secretion, motility and proteolysis can be challenged with future work that should aim to identify missing factors and to dissect their functional role and interplay in sporozoites' egress from oocysts. To this end, a combination of double-knockouts and our imaging assays will constitute crucial tools.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>TRP1 is probably trafficked through the ER</title><p>Parasites that lack proteins involved in gliding motility (TRAP and CPβ) do not enter into salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sultan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ganter et al., 2009</xref>) and decreased gliding motility (S6/TREP/UOS3, Coronin, CSP and PAT) often goes along with decreased salivary gland invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coppi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kehrer et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steinbuechel and Matuschewski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Combe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bane et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tewari et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mikolajczak et al., 2008</xref>). Hence parasites that lack proteins involved in both egress and motility are also impaired in salivary gland invasion and thus these proteins are essential for life cycle progression at two subsequent steps. In this context, TRP1 plays a unique role as it mediates egress but appears to have no role in gliding. Therefore, we assumed that sporozoites that lack a functional TRP1 would enter into salivary glands. Interestingly, we could detect hemolymph sporozoites in low numbers, especially at later time points in mosquitoes highly infected with <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> parasites. We assume that in these mosquitoes, some of the oocysts released sporozoites, probably due to mechanical stress or oocyst wall degradation due to an arrest in oocyst wall formation. The numbers of hemolymph sporozoites were with a few hundred to a few thousand sporozoites, high enough to expect at least a few hundred sporozoites in the salivary glands. However, this was never observed.</p><p>Observations similar to those made for the knockout lines <italic>trp1(-)</italic> and <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> were also made for the strains <italic>gfp-trp1∆N</italic> and <italic>gfp-trp1∆C. gfp-trp1∆C</italic> parasites tended to resemble the phenotype of both knockout lines, whereas <italic>gfp-trp1∆N</italic> parasites showed almost normal egress from oocysts but were not able to invade the salivary glands. These deficiencies can be explained differentially. The <italic>gfp-trp1∆C</italic> mutant lacks both the cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD) and the putative micronemal targeting signal F/Y/WXXΦ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Di Cristina et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhanot et al., 2003</xref>), which consists of an aromatic amino acid on position one and an hydrophobic amino acid (Φ) on position four. Micronemal proteins that lack this signal are directly targeted to the plasma membrane and secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Di Cristina et al., 2000</xref>). However, we are not able to distinguish if this is also true for <italic>gfp-trp1∆C</italic> parasites because we could not observe any GFP expression in this line. Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility that interactions with other proteins at the CTD are needed for TRP1 to be functional. Curiously, parasites carrying the full-length C-terminally tagged TRP1, albeit processed, showed no defect in their capacity to exit the oocysts, thus suggesting that an C-terminal GFP does not impair this TRP1 function. However, it did not completely complement salivary gland invasion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). This suggests that the C-terminus might function differently in oocyst exit and salivary gland entry.</p><p>In the <italic>gfp-trp1∆N</italic> mutant, the complete N-terminus of TRP1 is missing, which had a crucial effect on TRP1 function. Although <italic>gfp-trp1∆N</italic> sporozoites could not be detected in the salivary glands and were not transmitted by the bites of infected mosquitoes, this line showed an egress rate that was only slightly decreased compared to wild-type. This suggests that the C-terminal part of the protein is required for sporozoite egress from oocysts, whereas both C- and N-terminus are needed for salivary gland invasion. Interestingly, <italic>gfp-trp1∆N</italic> was the only N-terminally tagged parasite line that was fluorescent, and the GFP-TRP1∆N fusion protein could be visualized in oocysts and free sporozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). The tagged protein localized to membranes within the parasites, especially around the nucleus, which we believe is the location of the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER). This indicates that TRP1 has a signal peptide and enters the secretory pathway similar to micronemal proteins. However, a distinct GFP signal could be observed only in <italic>gfp-trp1∆N</italic> parasites but not in <italic>gfp-trp1∆C</italic>, <italic>gfp-trp1comp</italic> or <italic>gfp-trp1</italic> parasites. Interestingly, all of these lines transcribe a <italic>gfp:trp1</italic> fusion transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating that transcription takes place as predicted. This evidence, together with the observation that the N-terminus of TRP1 clearly varies in size and is less conserved between different <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and the fact that we observed only a very small TRP1-GFP fusion protein by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggests that post-translational processing of TRP1 takes place at the N-terminal end, as shown for MIC5 and M2AP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brydges et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harper et al., 2006</xref>), and probably also closer to the transmembrane domain. Therefore GFP might be cleaved off and rapidly degraded in <italic>gfp-trp1∆C</italic>, <italic>gfp-trp1</italic> and <italic>gfp-trp1comp</italic> parasites but not in <italic>gfp-trp1∆N</italic> parasites. Further mutants could be generated to investigate these possibilities and to investigate putative cleavage site(s). The low band detected by western blotting might also suggest that the TSR domain is lost. Whether this loss is functionally required would also constitute an interesting avenue of future research.</p><p>In conclusion, by imaging oocyst egress of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites at the mosquito midgut wall in situ, we were able to observe a variety of egress events indicating that release of sporozoites from oocysts occurs in different ways.

We used the Pb238 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deligianni et al., 2011</xref>) as template for all three complementation constructs. The vector contains the positive selection marker human <italic>dhfr</italic> controlled by the <italic>ef1α</italic> promoter and a <italic>dhfr</italic> terminator from <italic>P. berghei</italic>, as well as a <italic>gfp</italic> upstream of the selection cassette. The 5'UTR, which included the sequence encoding the signal peptide of <italic>trp1</italic> (989 bp), was amplified with the primers P610 and P611 and fused (by <italic>SacII</italic> and <italic>PshAI</italic>) with the <italic>gfp</italic> gene to tag <italic>trp1</italic> N-terminally. In a next step, the 3'UTR of <italic>trp1</italic> was amplified with the primers P608/P609 and cloned downstream of the selection cassette to enable integration by double crossover homologous recombination. This vector was named Pb238-PBANKA0707900-int. To generate the vector for complementation with full-length <italic>trp1</italic>, the coding sequence beginning after the signal peptide and the 3'UTR of <italic>trp1</italic> (3,643 bp) were amplified with the primers P612 and P616.

The PCR products were cloned into the Pb238-PBANKA0707900-int vector as described before. To tag TRP1 C-terminally with GFP, the C-terminal end (1,030 bp) of the <italic>trp1</italic> gene was amplified with the primers P1562 and P1597.

Using this method, only single blood stages were injected into 6–10 NMRI mice. Infected mice were bled once parasitemia reached 1–2%. The blood of infected mice was collected and parasites were either frozen as stocks or purified to isolate genomic DNA with the Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen Ltd) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klug et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Mosquito infection</title><p>For mosquito infections, mice were infected by intraperitoneal injection of frozen stocks (150–200 µL). Stocks were either completely injected or split for injection into two mice and parasites allowed to grow for 3–5 days. Infected mice were either directly fed to mosquitoes or bled and used for a fresh blood transfer of 20,000,000 parasites into two naïve mice. Parasites in mice that received infected blood were allowed to grow for further 3–4 days. To determine the number of male gametocytes, a drop of tail blood was placed on a microscope slide and incubated at room temperature for 10–12 min. If 1–2 exflagellation events per counting field (40x magnification) were observed, mice were anesthetized and fed to mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klug et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of oocyst and sporozoite development</title><p>To observe the development of oocysts, midguts of 20–30 mosquitoes were isolated at day 12 and day 22 post infection. Midguts were dissected in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fluorescent oocysts were manually counted using a stereomicroscope (SMZ1000, Nikon). To investigate the percentage of sporulated and unsporulated oocysts, midguts were also imaged at both time points. Dissected midguts were mounted with a drop of PBS on a microscopy slide and covered with a cover slip. Samples were sealed with paraffin and imaged with an Axiovert 200M (Zeiss) fluorescence microscope using a 63x (N.A. 1.3) objective. At each time point, images of 50–180 oocysts were taken and classified into oocysts that were in the process of budding or contained already mature sporozoites and oocysts that were pre-mature and didn’t contain any sporozoites. Experiments were performed in triplicate with different mosquito feedings. Sporozoites were isolated from the midguts, hemolymph and salivary glands of infected mosquitos at days 14, 17/18, 20 and 22 post infection. For each time point, midguts and salivary glands from at least 10 mosquitoes were dissected in PBS, crushed to release sporozoites and counted using a Neubauer counting chamber. To isolate hemolymph sporozoites, mosquitoes were cooled on ice and the last segment of the abdomen was cut with a syringe. Prepared mosquitoes were flushed by inserting a long drawn Pasteur pipette into the lateral side of the thorax and injected with RPMI (supplemented with 50,000 units/L penicillin and 50 mg/L streptomycin). The hemolymph was thus drained from the abdomen, collected on a piece of foil and transferred to a plastic reaction tube (Eppendorf). Hemolymph sporozoites were counted as previously described for midgut and salivary gland sporozoites. To image protein localization or the expression of fluorescent markers, infected salivary glands and midguts were dissected in RPMI and mounted on a microscope slide. Samples were sealed with paraffin and imaged with a spinning disc confocal microscope (Nikon Ti series) using a 60x objective (CFI Apo TIRF 60x H; NA 1.49).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Long-term imaging of infected midguts</title><p>Oocysts were either imaged on microscope slides or in glass-bottom Petri-dishes (MatTek corporation, USA).

Samples were covered with a cover slip, sealed with paraffin and screened for sporozoite movement within oocysts and egress events using an Axiovert 200M (Zeiss) fluorescence microscope with 63x magnification. Imaging in glass-bottom Petri-dishes was performed in the same way, but dishes were filled 10–15 min prior to dissection with 200 µL Grace's medium to allow adjustment to room temperature. Microscopy was performed with 10x magnification, therefore only the fluorescent knockout <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> and a fluorescent control line expressing mCherry under the <italic>CSP</italic> and eGFP under the <italic>ef1α</italic> promoter (<italic>fluo</italic>) were used.

Afterwards, 100 µL of purified sporozoites were mixed with 100 µL of RPMI containing 6% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (ROTH Ltd) and transferred into a 96-well plate with an optical bottom (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Nunc). Hemolymph sporozoites were isolated as described above and centrifuged for 5 min at 7,000 rpm (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Biofuge primo). The excess of supernatant was discarded, sporozoites were resuspended in 100 µL of RPMI and mixed in a 96-well plate with 100 µL of RPMI containing 6% BSA. Plates were spun for 3 min at 800 rpm (Heraeus Multifuge S1) and directly imaged using an Axiovert 200M (Zeiss) fluorescence microscope. Movies were recorded in differential interference contrast (DIC) with 25x magnification and one frame every 3 s. Analysis of movies was performed with the software ImageJ. Only sporozoites gliding in a circular manner for at least one circle over the time of five minutes were classified as moving.

Infected mosquitoes 17 days post infection were separated in the morning in cups of 10 each and starved for 6–8 hr. Four C57Bl/6 mice per experiment were anaesthetized using a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (87.5 mg/kg ketamine and 12.5 mg/kg xylazine). One anaesthetized mouse was put on each cup and mosquitoes were allowed to bite on the ventral side for approximately 20 min. Directly after the feeding or at the latest the next day, mosquitos that had taken a blood meal were dissected to determine sporozoite numbers within midguts. Salivary glands were not dissected because mosquitoes infected with <italic>trp1(-)</italic> or <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic> never contained salivary gland sporozoites. For sporozoite injections, midgut (MG) sporozoites were dissected from mosquitoes between day 12 to day 16 post infection. Infected midguts were stored in RPMI medium (containing 50,000 units/L penicillin and 50 mg/L streptomycin) and crushed with a pestle to release the sporozoites. Sporozoites were counted in a Neubauer counting chamber and afterwards diluted to the desired concentration per 100 µL (400,000–500,000 MG sporozoites). For each experiment, four C57Bl/6 mice were injected intravenously. Bitten and injected mice were probed for parasitemia from day 3 to day 10 after injection or exposure to mosquitoes. In addition, the survival of mice was monitored for 30 days post infection. The blood smears were stained in Giemsa solution (Merck) and counted using a light microscope (Zeiss) with a counting grid. The time difference between infection and observation of the first parasite within a blood smear was calculated as prepatency.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunofluorescence on midgut sporozoites</title><p>Infected midguts were dissected in PBS in a plastic reaction tube (Eppendorf).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Motility precedes egress of malaria parasites from oocysts&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Urszula Krzych as the Reviewing Editor and Richard Losick as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Catherine Braun-Breton (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. As you will see, among other things, we require a more precise demonstration of processing and cell surface localization of the Trp1 protein. It will help to know if you are prepared to perform the essential experiments, and if so, if you will be able to provide such analysis within a reasonable period of time.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors identified thrombospondin-related protein 1 as being crucial for egress from oocysts that develop in the midgut of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infected mosquitos. The results are based on the analysis of two different knockouts lines along with extensive characterization of sporozoite development, motility, ability to reach salivary glands, and mouse infectivity. The findings suggest that Trp1 is required for motility within oocysts as a prelude to egress and that sporozoites egress from oocysts by several different styles, including release of free sporozoites from a defined point(s) or release of encased sporozoites as a group. Although for the most part the work is thorough and the experiments well executed, there are substantial concerns expressed by the reviewers and these include additional data, expansion of the Discussion as well as some degree of toning down the importance of some aspects of the findings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The identification of two egress styles is novel, as is the imaging setup to video capture sporozoites egress from oocysts. However, a caution should be exercised about discussing sporosomes as &quot;structures&quot; rather than oocyst wall deformations due to a thinned wall pushed by motile sporozoites (like the plasma membrane deformation induced by motile intracellular <italic>Listeria</italic>). The fact that the N-term domain of Trp1 complemented the egress defect but not the salivary gland invasion deficiency is an interesting phenotype. A more precise localization of the wild type and mutant Trp1 proteins would help to explain/speculate on Trp1 biological roles. Such a study may involve immunoEM where your lab or a collaborator may be prepared to examine the cell surface disposition of Trp1.</p><p>2) The part of the Discussion regarding the new egress type should be rewritten to tone-it-down, unless the authors can document the so called sporosomes as clearly defined structures.</p><p>3) There is a lack of convincing evidence that Trp1 is on the sporozoites surface. Showing surface expression would support a model of Trp1 involvement in binding extracellular components or transmitting a signal.</p><p>4) Because only the <italic>trp1</italic> construct lacking the N-terminal domain of Trp1 is detected by GFP fluorescence, the authors propose that Trp1 is N-terminally processed. This might indeed be the case but other possibilities such a different intracellular location might also explain this observation: the fluorescence of GFP might indeed be altered and thus not detected in some intracellular compartments. The processing of Trp1 should thus be further documented by western-blot experiments.</p><p>5) Grater clarification of the sporozoite counts need to be include; the authors should separate midgut sporozoite counts (high numbers) from hemolymph and salivary glands (low numbers) and present for each localization in the different parasite lines.</p><p>6) The authors assume TRP1 traffics through the micronemes, yet no confirmatory data is shown.

If the authors have one or more of the previously described egress mutants in hand (SERA5, <italic>ccp2/ccp3, pcrmp3/pcrmp4</italic>, and <italic>psop9</italic>) then perhaps they can image them in the new assay to provide additional insight/distinctions.</p><p>8) The observation that motility precedes sporozoite egress requires a confirmatory data by yet another assay.</p><p>9) Please expand your Discussion and comment on other previously identified proteins required for sporozoite egress.</p><p>10) Also, please comment how is this mutant phenotype different from other sporozoite egress mutants that are motile when physically released from the oocyst.

We changed “structures” into “vesicle-like deformations of the cyst wall” (subsection “Synchronous activation of mature sporozoites is crucial for effective egress from oocysts” and subsection “Visualizing sporozoite egress: Bursting and budding within vesicle-like structures”, first paragraph), which is indeed a clearer message. In order to investigate the localization of TRP1 more precisely (and also to understand the processing of the protein better – see below) we generated a new parasite line that expresses a C-terminally GFP-tagged TRP1. Although this did not allow us to investigate directly the surface (the GFP-tag is presumably on the insight of the plasma membrane), we could reveal an intriguing polarized localization to the periphery (likely surface). TRP1 is localized mostly at the rear end of the parasite. Interestingly, another protein with such a clear polarized localization to the rear is the actin filament binding protein coronin (recently published by us in Plos Pathogens). Sporozoites lacking coronin have a problem with gliding motility and salivary gland invasion. As <italic>trp1(-)</italic> sporozoites also fail to enter into salivary glands, these proteins might somehow act in a similar way. We added the new data for TRP1-GFP into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> and the accompanying text in the Results (subsection “TRP1 is post-translationally processed”) and Discussion (subsection “TRP1 is likely trafficked through the ER”, second and third paragraphs). As to immuno EM we don’t hold the technique to high in esteem for sporozoites for various reasons, mostly because in our view it only has produced nice results for highly expressed proteins (e.g. CSP and TRAP), but TRP1 is clearly not among them. Nevertheless, we tried already early on to raise antibodies against TRP1 but failed in two attempts to get an antibody that was specific enough in Western blotting to be used in either immunofluorescence or EM analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 2</xref>). As the N-terminally tagged GFP is cleaved from the protein, we could not use an anti-GFP antibody to probe surface location as we initially hoped. The questions on where TRP1 is cleaved and by which enzyme clearly requires future research. Our also added data on <italic>sera5(-)</italic> parasites suggest that it is not this protease that processes TRP1 (see below).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19157.035</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>A peptide antibody designed against the TRP1 C- terminus does not recognize TRP1 by immunofluorescence and western blot.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence on permeabilized (Triton-X 100) midgut sporozoites of <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>trp1(-)mCh</italic>.

We further added cautionary adjectives such as “apparent” (in the first paragraph of the aforementioned subsection) and stated that this observation was “unexpected” (last paragraph) to hopefully clearly state that this observation is not written in stone.</p><p><italic>3) There is a lack of convincing evidence that Trp1 is on the sporozoites surface. Showing surface expression would support a model of Trp1 involvement in binding extracellular components or transmitting a signal.</italic></p><p>To address the localization of TRP1 in more detail we generated a new parasite line named <italic>trp1-gfp</italic> that expresses TRP1 fused C-terminally to GFP. Indeed <italic>trp1-gfp</italic> parasites showed a much stronger expression of GFP than all other lines and differed in the localization in oocysts and sporozoites significantly from <italic>gfp-trp1:ΔN</italic> parasites. To show the localization in more detail we included the three new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>. In sporozoites TRP1-GFP localized in a polarized fashion at the periphery, probably to the plasma membrane. However, we can’t tell from the images if TRP1 localizes to the inner membrane complex, within the inner membrane space of at the plasma membrane itself. We are also not able to address this question further, for example by immunofluorescence on unpermeabilized sporozoites, since we did not manage to raise an antibody against TRP1. Nevertheless, we think that the new data, together with recently published proteomics data (Lindner et al., Mol Cell Proteomics 2013) are a strong hint that TRP1 is a surface protein that could be involved in signaling processes. We also compared TRP1-GFP localization with that of GFP-TRAP, which revealed a distinct localization, although the signals partly overlap in the apical part, suggesting that TRP1 might be localized in a subset of micronemes or a different set of secretory vesicles.</p><p><italic>4) Because only the trp1 construct lacking the N-terminal domain of Trp1 is detected by GFP fluorescence, the authors propose that Trp1 is N-terminally processed. This might indeed be the case but other possibilities such a different intracellular location might also explain this observation: the fluorescence of GFP might indeed be altered and thus not detected in some intracellular compartments. The processing of Trp1 should thus be further documented by western-blot experiments.</italic></p><p>Thanks for this suggestion. We now included a western blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> showing that the molecular weight of TRP1 is significantly smaller than predicted. This suggests that not only the N-terminus is cleaved but also the TSR. Whether this is due to a single or multiple cleavage events should be addressed in future research.</p><p><italic>5) Grater clarification of the sporozoite counts need to be include; the authors should separate midgut sporozoite counts (high numbers) from hemolymph and salivary glands (low numbers) and present for each localization in the different parasite lines.</italic></p><p>Thanks also for these suggestions. We included <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> into the paper, where for all experiments the number of counted sporozoites in midguts, hemolymph and salivary glands are listed. Together with the new generated line <italic>trp1-gfp</italic> we added also additional images of oocysts and midgut sporozoites of the parasite line <italic>gfp-trp1ΔN</italic> shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) The authors assume TRP1 traffics through the micronemes, yet no confirmatory data is shown. Could co-stains be performed with a bona-fide microneme protein for reference?</italic></p><p>Having generated a new parasite line expressing C-terminally tagged TRP1, we compared TRP1-GFP localization with that of GFP-TRAP (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This revealed a distinct localization, although the signals partly overlap in the apical part, suggesting that TRP1 might be localized in a subset of micronemes or a different set of vesicles. Subsets of micronemes have indeed been found in <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites, which are much larger and hence amenable to super-resolution imaging (Kremer et al., Plos Path 2013). We also applied two different super-resolution imaging techniques on sporozoites with both Prof. Christoph Cremer (GSDM) and Prof. Stefan Hell (STED), but both did not allow us to distinguish between two neighboring micronemes. We currently aim at establishing proximity biotinylation methods for sporozoites, which will ultimately be helpful of biochemically distinguishing such populations. However, currently we only had success with gametocystes (Kehrer et al., Mol Cell Proteom 2016) and ookinetes (unpublished) but with sporozoites we still struggle with the amount of collected protein needed for analysis by mass spectrometry.</p><p><italic>7) Mutants for SERA5, ccp2/ccp3, pcrmp3/pcrmp4, and psop9 all fail to egress yet show</italic> in vitro <italic>motility, so this aspect of the trp1 mutant is not novel. If the authors have one or more of the previously described egress mutants in hand (SERA5, ccp2/ccp3, pcrmp3/pcrmp4, and psop9) then perhaps they can image them in the new assay to provide additional insight/distinctions.</italic></p><p>To address this comment we generated a fluorescent and a non-fluorescent SERA5 knockout line (<italic>sera5(-) fluo</italic> and <italic>sera5(-) non-fluo</italic>). Both lines were tested in the new assays and the generated data were included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. Futhermore the ratio of hemolymph and midgut sporozoites respectively salivary gland and midgut sporozoites were included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The sporozoite counts for both lines are also shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. Two videos (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Videos 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">8</xref>) showing intra-oocyst motility in <italic>sera5(-)</italic> oocysts at different magnifications were added. The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> was included to illustrate the generation of both SERA5 knockout strains. Considering that we could confirm (Aly and Matuschewski J. Ex. Med. 2005) intra-oocyst motility in <italic>sera5(-)</italic> parasites but did not see any such motility in <italic>trp1(-)</italic> parasites also suggests that SERA5 does not cleave TRP1 as in such a case both phenotypes should be equivalent.</p><p><italic>8) The observation that motility precedes sporozoite egress requires a confirmatory data by yet another assay.</italic></p><p>The best such assay would clearly be in vivoimaging, which we discuss at length to be currently not possible. As a “next-best assay”, however, we did include one more mutant that has the most striking phenotype of all currently available oocyst egress mutants in our analysis: <italic>sera5(-)</italic> sporozoites were confirmed to be motile in oocysts in both our assays but were not able to exit as previously reported (Aly and Matuschewksi, J. Ex. Med. 2005). Importantly we quantified this effect and found about 4-8 times as many oocysts that show intra-oocyst motility compared with <italic>wt</italic> parasites, depending on the assay used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This striking finding suggests strongly that movement precedes motility as now stated at the end of the Results section.</p><p><italic>9) Please expand your Discussion and comment on other previously identified proteins required for sporozoite egress.</italic></p><p>We expanded the discussion on GAMA (formerly named PSOP-9), which has multiple roles in addition to egress of sporozoites (subsection “Putative pathways that could trigger sporozoite egress from oocysts”, first paragraph). We also discuss every single protein revealed to date as being important in sporozoite egress from oocysts in a concise manner but did not expand further from the previous text. Expanding this part would in our view distract from the main flow of the Discussion and decrease readability. We hope that the reviewers will recognize that our paper includes several different transgenic lines and establishes new assay systems that allow (with the inclusion of the <italic>sera5(-)</italic> parasites) a quantitative comparison of sporozoite egress from oocysts for the first time. This leads for the first time to a suggestion of a cascade of events that might mediate sporozoite egress. We thus decided not to expand the discussion on individual proteins even more, especially as we cannot yet come to a final conclusion on the mechanisms at work.</p><p><italic>10) Also, please comment how is this mutant phenotype different from other sporozoite egress mutants that are motile when physically released from the oocyst. Although it may be difficult to provide conclusive answers as the mutants have not been imaged directly in this new assay, this point should at least be added to the Discussion.</italic></p><p>We include the statements “However, our assays will allow a more quantitative description of sporozoite egress from oocysts as already shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> with the comparison between <italic>wt, trp1(-)</italic> and <italic>sera5(-)</italic> parasites.” and “To this end a combination of double-knock outs and our imaging assays will provide crucial tools” in the Discussion. These were added, as we think that the generation of double mutant lines using the positive-negative selection marker <italic>hdhfr-yfcu</italic> or <italic>crispr/cas9</italic> in combination with our visual assays will ultimately lead the way forward to understand sporozoite egress from oocysts in more detail.</p></body></sub-article></article>
