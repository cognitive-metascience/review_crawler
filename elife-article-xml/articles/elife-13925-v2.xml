In PHR, head-direction cells are present before eye-opening, earliest detected in postnatal day (P)11 animals. Border cells have been recorded around eye-opening (P16), while grid cells do not obtain adult-like features until the fourth postnatal week. In view of these developmental time-lines, we aimed to explore when afferents originating in RSC arrive in PHR. To this end, we injected rats aged P0-P28 with anterograde tracers into RSC. First, we characterized the organization of RSC-PHR projections in postnatal rats and compared these results with data obtained in the adult. Second, we described the morphological development of axonal plexus in PHR. We conclude that the first arriving RSC-axons in PHR, present from P1 onwards, already show a topographical organization similar to that seen in adults, although the labeled plexus does not obtain adult-like densities until P12.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13925.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13925.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13925.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our ability to navigate critically depends on part of the brain called the parahippocampal region.

It consists of two functionally different networks, one of which, involved in spatial functions, comprises the presubiculum (PrS), parasubiculum (PaS), medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and postrhinal cortex (POR). The other important for object representation and processing of contextual information, comprising lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and perirhinal cortex (PER; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eichenbaum et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knierim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Witter et al., 2014</xref>). PrS, PaS, and MEC harbor cells representing an animal’s position (grid cells), direction (head direction cells), borders in the environment (border cells) and speed of the animal (speed cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fyhn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Solstad et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boccara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kropff et al., 2015</xref>). Even though a complete mechanistic understanding on how these spatial codes emerge is still lacking, it is believed that both intrinsic connectivity and extrinsic afferents are necessary to produce the receptive fields observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brandon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koenig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonnevie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Couey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Newman et al., 2014</xref>). One approach applied to identify the critical elements underlying the functioning of these cell types, has been to study the developmental aspects of PHR networks. The different spatially modulated neuron types in PHR emerge at different periods during development. Border cells and head-direction cells can both be observed at the end of the second- and beginning of the third postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bjerknes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjerknes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, adult-like grid cells in layer II of MEC first appear during the fourth postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Langston et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wills et al., 2010</xref>). The early presence of head-direction cells is apparently paralleled by a similarly early developed shared connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjerknes et al., 2015</xref>), while the late development of grid cells is paralleled by a corresponding late development of the relevant intrinsic connectivity in MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Langston et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Couey et al., 2013</xref>). Regarding main inputs, sparse connections between the hippocampal formation (HF) and PHR are present from birth, reaching adult-like morphological features during the second postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Reilly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Reilly et al., 2015</xref>). A similar developmental timeline has also been reported for functional connections from PrS/PaS to MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Canto et al., 2011</xref>). However, the timeline of development of cortical afferents to HF and PHR is still unknown.</p><p>One of the most prominent cortical inputs to PHR originates in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and spatially modulated cells have been found also in the latter cortical domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cho and Sharp, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sugar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander and Nitz, 2015</xref>). Lesions of RSC result in impairments in navigational tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vann et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, RSC in rodents is necessary for fear conditioning, both when context or complex multimodal stimuli are used as conditional stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keene and Bucci, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corcoran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cowansage et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>) and in rabbits RSC neurons are responsive to auditory cues when used as a CS in a memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gabriel et al., 1991</xref>), suggesting that RSC has a general role in memory processes. The effect of lesioning RSC on navigation and memory performance is surprisingly similar to that seen after lesions that inflict the HF-PHR. It has thus been postulated that interactions between RSC and HF-PHR are crucial for spatial processing. In the adult, RSC projections target preferentially POR, PrS, PaS, and MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones and Witter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sugar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kononenko and Witter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Czajkowski et al., 2013</xref>). In this paper, we aimed to ascertain the relevance of the RSC-PHR projection for the development of the functionally different neuron types in PHR. We hypothesized that if inputs from RSC are important for the development of head-direction- and/or border cells, these inputs should be present before eye-opening. Alternatively, if inputs from RSC are only important for the formation of stable grid cells, these inputs might develop after eye-opening, likely reaching adult-like morphology during the third and fourth week. We injected RSC of rats at different postnatal ages, ranging from postnatal day 0 to 28 (P0-P28), with anterograde tracers. Using retrograde tracing, we identified RSC neurons originating the developing PHR projections. The anterograde experimental material was used to analyze the organization of RSC-PHR projections in postnatal rats and to compare these results with data previously obtained in the adult. We further analyzed the development of axon morphology and densities of axonal plexus in PHR.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nomenclature</title><p>Several nomenclatures have been used to describe subdivisions of RSC. These nomenclatures mainly follow the same cytoarchitectonic- and histochemical criteria and are therefore directly comparable. For a summary and direct comparison of the different nomenclatures, we refer to a recent review on the RSC-HF-PHR connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sugar et al., 2011</xref>). In the current manuscript, we chose to use the nomenclature of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vogt (2004)</xref>. We defined the border between area (A)29 and A30 as the area where layer II changes from being very condensed in A29, to less condensed in A30. The rostral border of RSC, towards the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was defined as the area where layer II/III widens and where layer IV shifts from being clearly demarcated in RSC towards being more diffusely organized in ACC. The ventral border of RSC with PHR, more specifically with PrS, was defined by the appearance of a cell free lamina dissecans in PrS, not present in RSC. In adult rats, A29 can be further subdivided into three different cytoarchitectonic subdivisions; A29a, b and c, which are involved in different cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Groen et al., 2004</xref>). However, in the immature cortex, these cytoarchitectonic areas are not apparent. We therefore chose to define a continuous measure of the dorsoventral positions within RSC (see methods for details). This measure is indirectly related to the classical cytoarchitectonic subdivision since the classical borders of A29a, b and c follow approximately our continuous definition of the dorsoventral axis of RSC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Injection sites</title><p>To investigate the development of RSC projection patterns in PHR we aimed to inject anterograde tracers in different locations within RSC of differently aged pups. Of the 82 animals used in this study, 20 animals either did not survive surgery or no injection sites were observed in RSC. In the remaining 62 animals we obtained 113 injections in RSC. Eight of these injections only involved layers I and/or layers II-III and did not result in any labeled fibers in HF-PHR. These experiments were therefore excluded from further analyses. The remaining 105 injections all covered at least parts of layer V of RSC and involved different parts of RSC. We obtained one (n=21), two (n=31), three (n=6) or four (n=1) ipsilateral injections in RSC of each brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In our analyses, we regarded each of these injections as independent experiments. Most of the experiments (n=93) were performed in animals aged P15 or younger since other comparable corticocortical projections are developed before eye-opening and the functional cell types are present in HF-PHR at this age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Langston et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Reilly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bjerknes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Reilly et al., 2014</xref>). However, we also obtained injections in older pups (n=12) with a maximum age of P28.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13925.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Location of the center of injections.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The location of the center of each injection was normalized to a standard 3D atlas of the rat brain (Waxholm space; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Papp et al., 2014</xref>; See <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>). Lateral (A1), dorsal (A2) and para-caudal view (A3) of the 3D atlas brain with the center of each injection (colored spheres).

In accordance with previous studies in adults, we observed anterogradely labeled fibers in the striatum, anterior nuclei of the thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, parietal cortex and visual cortices and in the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Groen and Wyss, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones et al., 2005</xref>). However, a detailed assessment of these projections is outside the scope of this paper and here we will detail the projections to PHR. We observed anterogradely labeled fibers in layers I, III and V-VI of PrS (in all of the experiments included in the analyses, n=105), layers V-VI of PaS (n=90), layers V-VI of MEC (n=90), layers V-VI of medial LEC (n=14) and in all layers of posterior POR (n=75). In some cases, we also observed single fibers in layers I and/or III of MEC (n=34). Additionally, we observed few fibers (if present typically one or two fibers in an experiment) in the dorsal half of SUB (n=41) and/or in the dorsal CA fields (n=16). In contrast to previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burwell and Amaral, 1998b</xref>), we did not observe any labeled fibers in PER in any of our experiments. This includes the oldest aged pups (P27-28) and the adult cases, suggesting that this lack of perirhinal projections is not a developmental feature. It is thus obvious that all experiments shared RSC-PHR projection patterns, but there were also marked differences from case to case depending on the location of injection within RSC. This will be systematically described in the next sections.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Injections in rostral A30</title><p>Injections in the rostral half of A30 (n=23) all resulted in comparable patterns of labeling in PHR.

To systematically analyze this, we measured, in each experiment, the location of the labeled plexus in PHR. Thereafter, we produced normalized flatmaps of the location of the labeled plexus in each experiment (see methods for details). These flatmaps consisted of multiple bins spanning the dorsoventral and transverse axis of PHR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Each bin was assigned a value between 0 (black) and 1 (yellow) reflecting the density of labeled fibers in PHR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This approach allowed us to compare flatmaps across animals of different ages and pool flatmaps of groups of interest. For statistical analysis, we calculated the center of mass of the labeled fields and tested the relationships between this measure and the coordinates of the injection and the age of the animal.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13925.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Standardized representation of location of labeled axons in PHR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Extents of PrS, deep layers of PaS and deep layers of EC were measured in the horizontal plane (<bold>1;</bold> Nissl stained sections from case 18427, <bold>3;</bold> Nissl stained sections from case 18589). In every section, the extents of PrS, PaS, MEC and LEC along the transverse axis were measured. Based on the measurements of all sections in all brains (2 and 4) we binned the PHR along the dorsoventral and transverse axis and made an average representation of PHR (5; left: layers I and III of PrS (light blue), right: layers V-VI of PrS (light blue), PaS (dark blue), MEC (light green) and LEC (dark green).

The measurements were performed in every section containing a plexus. The bins between the boundaries of each plexus were given a value ranging from 1 to 3 reflecting weak to dense labeling respectively (color coded in 2, 1 = brown; 2 = orange; 3 = bright yellow). Bins outside the plexus boundaries were given the value 0 (black, no plexus). In experiments in which we observed single labeled axons or a sparse plexus, we measured the distance from each labeled axon to one of the borders of the field in which the plexus was located (3; case 18589; repeating patterns in top sections are artefacts due to stitching of digitized images). We inserted magenta labeled fibers and their respective positions on the flatmaps). We gave each bin in the flatmap a value corresponding to the number of labeled single axons (4; bins not containing any labeled fibers: black; bins with the highest number of labeled axons: bright yellow). For all flatmaps, the centers of mass for layers I and III in PrS, layers V-VI of PrS and PaS combined and layers V-VI of MEC and LEC combined were calculated (red dots).

Using the distribution patterns as represented in the flatmaps (see methods for details), we identified five clusters. However, the injection sites in RSC associated with each of the clusters were not clustered in RSC such that several of the injections associated with one cluster of distribution patterns partly overlapped with injection sites associated with other labeling clusters in PHR. None of the clusters of labeling in PHR was associated with distinct age groups of animals. We therefore concluded that RSC does not contain regions having distinct projection patterns to PHR, but more likely has a continuous topographical organization of projections to PHR. Therefore, we next assessed whether the labeling patterns in PHC changed systematically in relationship to the rostrocaudal and/or the dorsoventral position of the injections in RSC. For the analysis of the projection patterns, we initially subdivided the injections into two groups depending on whether the injections were located in A29 (n=50) or A30 (n=55). We also subdivided each of the two areas into four equally sized rostrocaudal regions; the rostral quarter of RSC (n=16), intermediate-rostral quarter of RSC (n=22), intermediate-caudal quarter of RSC (n=48) and caudal quarter of RSC (n=19).</p><p>To evaluate the projection patterns we analyzed the data in two different ways. First, we pooled the projection patterns of all experiments in each of the eight injection groups described above. We subsequently analyzed the 'mean' projection pattern of each group, as represented on flatmaps of PHR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, the pooled flatmaps are sensitive to the number of bins covered by the labeled axons in each experiment. Experiments in young animals with single labeled fibers in PHR or experiments with small injections resulting in few labeled axons in PHR will contribute fewer 'labeled bins' to the pooled flatmaps, and the pooled flatmaps might therefore be biased towards the experiments with many bins containing labeled axons. Therefore, we also calculated, for each experiment, the center of mass of the projections to respectively layers I and III of PrS, layers V-VI of PrS and PaS combined, and layers V-VI of MEC and LEC combined. The centers of mass served as a quantifiable measure of the location of the labeled axons in PHR, which is independent of the number of fibers labeled in each experiment.</p><p>After injections in the rostral part of A29 and A30, labeled fibers were only seen in the dorsal one-third of PHR. Labeling was mainly present in superficial and deep layers of PrS with approximately equal densities, while only a moderate number of labeled fibers was observed in deep layers of PaS and dorsomedial MEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Injections in the three more caudal subdivisions of A29 and A30 resulted in labeling in PHR at successively more ventral levels. Labeling was seen in layers I, III and V-VI of the dorsal half of PrS, in layers V-VI of the dorsal half of PaS and of the medial part of MEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). When comparing injections in A29 and A30, we did not see a systematic relationship between the placement of the injection and the dorsoventral distribution of the labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The results thus suggest that the rostrocaudal placement of injection in RSC is related to the dorsoventral location of the labeled plexus in PrS, PaS, and MEC.</p><p>Multiple regressions confirmed a relationship between the rostrocaudal placement of the injection and the dorsoventral location of the center of mass of the labeled axon terminals. More rostrally placed injections resulted in centers of mass of the labeled plexus that were located more dorsally in layers I and III of PrS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>, β=−0.201, 95% confidence interval (CI) [−0.290, −0.111], t<sub>99</sub>=−4.452, p&lt;0.001).

The dorsoventral placement of the injection showed a weaker, but significant relationship with the dorsoventral location of the centers of mass of the labeling since more ventrally placed injections in RSC had centers of mass located more ventral in PHR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>, β=0.089, 95% CI [0.008, 0.171], t<sub>85</sub>=2.181, p=0.032). There were no significant interaction effects of rostrocaudal-by-dorsoventral placement of the injection. Based on these data we conclude that the rostrocaudal position of injections in RSC determined the dorsoventral location of the labeled plexus in PrS, PaS and MEC.</p><p>We subsequently analyzed whether the location of the injection site influenced the transverse position of the labeled axons in the identified PHR subdivisions. A visual analysis of the plotted centers of mass and the pooled flatmaps showed that in layers I and III of PrS the labeling was generally located distally in case of injections in A30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). After injections in A29, proximal PrS was also covered by labeled fibers. This suggested that the dorsoventral position of the injection in RSC is related to the transverse position of the labeled fibers in PHR. This suggestion was substantiated through multiple regression analysis, showing that following ventral injections, the centers of mass of the labeled plexus in layers I and III of PrS were significantly more proximal compared to those following injections in dorsal RSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>; β=0.392, 95% CI [0.267, 0.518], t<sub>99</sub>=6.200, p&lt;0.001).

There was no significant interaction effect of rostrocaudal-by-dorsoventral placement of the injection.</p><p>In layers V-VI of PrS and PaS, the centers of mass were located significantly more proximal after injections in ventral RSC compared to injections in dorsal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>; β=0.292, 95% CI [0.192, 0.392], t<sub>99</sub>=5.780, p&lt;0.001). The rostrocaudal placement of the injection did show a weaker, but significant relationship with the proximodistal location of the labeled fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>, (β=0.107, 95% CI [0.009, 0.205], t<sub>99</sub>=2.164, p=0.033); injections in caudal RSC had centers of mass located more distal in PrS layers V-VI, compared to what was seen following injections in rostral RSC. Additionally, we observed a significant rostrocaudal-by-dorsoventral placement of injection interaction effect, since injections located more dorsal and more caudal had centers of mass in significantly more distal parts of layers V and VI of PrS and PaS (β=1.039, 95% CI [0.529, 1.548], t<sub>99</sub>=4.049, p&lt;0.001).</p><p>The dense and extensive labeling in layers V-VI of MEC was clearly seen in case of injections in A29, while a more restricted area, medially in MEC, was covered after injections in A30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Multiple regression analysis confirmed that the centers of mass of the terminating axons were located more lateral after injections in ventral RSC compared to after injections in dorsal RSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>; β=−0.121, 95% CI [−0.222, −0.020], t<sub>85</sub>=−2.378, p=0.020). However, the rostrocaudal placement of the injection had no significant relationship with the mediolateral location of the labeled fibers (β=−0.048, 95% CI [−0.150, 0.054], t=−0.937, p=0.351). There was no significant interaction effect of rostrocaudal-by-dorsoventral placement of the injection.</p><p>The overall analysis thus supported the conclusion that the dorsoventral position of the injection in RSC determines the transverse position of the labeled fibers in PrS, PaS, and MEC. By plotting each of the transverse coordinates of the centers of mass against the dorsoventral coordinate of the injection we did not observe any discrete 'jumps' (data not shown). This suggests that the topographical organization of projections from RSC to PHR is not organized into discrete projection patterns from each of A30 or A29 or its subdivisions a, b or c, but rather is organized as a continuous dorsoventral gradient, similar to what has been reported for the adult situation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Projection patterns in different age groups</title><p>Next, we aimed to investigate how the topographical organization of the projections developed during the postnatal period. We binned the experiments in three age groups, aged P1-P6 (n=33), P7-P13 (n=52), and injections in animals older than P14 (n=20). The labelling patterns from all experiments in each of these age groups were in general similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, All areas). In all age groups, layers I, III and V-VI of dorsal PrS, layers V-VI of dorsal PaS, and layers V-VI of medial MEC were labeled following injections in RSC. Additionally, for all age groups, the dorsal PrS was the most commonly labeled part of PHR. The distribution of labeling was comparable between all age groups.</p><p>We subsequently refined this analysis to study differences between rostral and caudal RSC with respect to labeling patterns in PHR. We plotted the centers of mass of the labeled projections observed after injections in the rostral half (n=10, 1<sup>st</sup> week; n=32, 2<sup>nd</sup> week; n=5, 3<sup>rd</sup> week and older) and caudal half of RSC (n=23 1<sup>st</sup> week, n=30 2<sup>nd</sup> week, n=15 3<sup>rd</sup> week and older; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The overall patterns across the age groups were similar and resembled the data including all injections in each subgroup. After injections in the rostral half of RSC, the labeling patterns in all age groups were limited to layers I, III and V-VI of dorsal PrS, layers V-VI of dorsal PaS and layers V-VI of MEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> R). However, in MEC, animals aged younger than a week had a tendency to only display labeled fibers in the most dorsomedial part while older animals also displayed labeled fibers in more lateral and ventral parts of MEC.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13925.023</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Development of topographies.</title><p>The position of the centers of mass of the labelling in layers I and III of PrS, layers V-VI of PrS and PaS and layers V-VI of MEC and LEC is plotted (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Each dot is color coded with respect to the rostrocaudal (<bold>A</bold>) or dorsoventral position (<bold>B</bold>) of the injections in RSC (rostral half; blue, caudal half; red, A29; yellow, A30; green).

We plotted the centers of mass of the labeling after injections in A30 (n=9 1<sup>st</sup> week, n=31 2<sup>nd</sup> week, n=15 3<sup>rd</sup> week and older) and A29 (n=24 1<sup>st</sup> week, n=21 2<sup>nd</sup> week, n=5 3<sup>rd</sup> week and older, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Following injections in A30 in all age groups, the labeled plexus were located in layers I, III and V-VI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> A30). In animals aged younger than a week, a tendency for less dense labeling was seen in ventral PHR compared to the older age groups. After injections in A29, all age groups showed comparable labeling patterns. In PrS layers I, III, and V-VI, the terminating axons in all age groups were located more proximally compared to the projection patterns seen after injections in A30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> A29). Similar to injections in A30, in animals aged younger than a week, A29 injections resulted in less labeling in ventral levels of PHR. This effect was most obvious in MEC.</p><p>After injections in caudal A29 and A30, the labeling patterns were in general similar across all age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Injections in caudal RSC resulted in preferred labeling in more ventral parts of PHR compared to injections in rostral RSC.</p><p>A descriptive assessment of the projection patterns thus suggested that the different age groups had comparable patterns of labeling. The topography along the transverse axis of PrS and PaS seen after A29 and A30 injections was observed already during the first postnatal week. In addition, in all age groups, caudal injections resulted in more extensive labeling in ventral PHR compared to rostral injections. However, injections in younger animals tended to have less labeled fibers in ventral PHR. To investigate this phenomenon more carefully, we plotted the coordinates of the centers of mass of the axonal labeling as a function of age and the location of the injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This analysis indicated that already from the earliest postnatal ages, the position of the centers of mass are organized as described above. Already at the earliest ages, we observed that different rostrocaudal levels of RSC project to different dorsoventral levels of PrS and PaS.

To check if animals aged younger than a week had less labeled fibers in ventral PHR compared to older animals, we converted the continuous age variable to a discrete variable were animals aged younger and older than a week were considered as two different groups. However the age groups were not significantly related to the location of the center of mass (lowest p-value=0.221).

Analyses of the cases individually, suggested that the organization of the projection pattern as we described in young animals was also present in adult animals. After injections in A30, a dense fiber plexus was observed distally in layers I and III of dorsal PrS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Additional labeled fibers were observed in layers V-VI of distal PrS, PaS and medially in MEC, comparable to the projection pattern we observed after injections in A30 of pups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Compared to injections in A30, injections in A29 resulted in labeled fibers more proximally in PrS and more laterally in MEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This topographical organization seems to be graded, since the injection located at the border between A29 and A30 displayed labeled fibers in a mediolateral position between the dorsally- and ventrally injected cases (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> with A and B respectively). Compared to rostrally placed injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>), we observed that caudally placed injections displayed more labeled axons in ventral PrS and MEC, and the area receiving the densest projection in both PrS and MEC was shifted more ventrally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

We conclude that the postnatal RSC projects densely to all layers of PrS and posterior POR and deep layers of PaS and MEC and weakly to deep layers of LEC and to SUB. Our retrograde experiments showed that the origin of these projections were neurons located in superficial parts of layer V of RSC. These findings are in accordance with previous work in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wyss and Van Groen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shibata, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burwell and Amaral, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones and Witter, 2007</xref>). Additionally, we report that the RSC projections to PrS, PaS and EC are topographically organized similarly already in the youngest postnatal rats and in adult rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The notion that rostral RSC only projects to dorsal PHR, while caudal RSC projects to additional more ventral parts of PHR is in accordance with previous work in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wyss and Van Groen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shibata, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones and Witter, 2007</xref>). Second, dorsal RSC (A30) projects preferentially to distal PrS, PaS and medial MEC, while more ventral parts of RSC (A29) project significantly more to proximal PrS and more lateral parts of MEC.

The PrS to MEC projection is topographically organized such that distal PrS projects to medial MEC, while proximal PrS projects to more lateral parts of MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shipley, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Honda and Ishizuka, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, these partner domains in PrS and MEC are selectively innervated by different areas of SUB along its transverse axis such that distal SUB projects to distal PrS and medial MEC, while more proximal parts of SUB, with the exclusion of the very proximal part, project to proximal PrS and more lateral MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Witter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Reilly et al., 2013</xref>). This indicates the existence of a connectional route linking A30, medial MEC, distal SUB and distal PrS to each other. A parallel route links A29 with more lateral MEC, more proximal SUB and proximal PrS. Although no clear transverse gradients in spatial modulation have been reported in MEC, electrophysiological properties of neurons show a transverse gradient, indicative that more medially positioned grid cells might be more precisely spatially tuned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Canto and Witter, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, neurons in distal SUB are more spatially modulated compared to those in proximal SUB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sharp and Green, 1994</xref>). All observations thus point to a differentiation of A29 and A30 where A30 is connected preferentially to more spatially modulated neurons in medial MEC and distal SUB compared to A29 which is more connected to neurons in lateral MEC and more proximal SUB.</p><p>Additional cortical and subcortical connections are in line with this proposed differentiation between both areas of RSC. The projections to anterior cingulate cortex are differentially organized for A29 and A30 and while A30 is connected to visual area A17 and A18b, A29 is only connected to A18b. With respect to thalamic connections, A29 is connected to the anterodorsal and anteroventral nuclei while A30 preferentially connects with the anteromedial nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Groen and Wyss, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shibata, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Groen and Wyss, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones et al., 2005</xref>). Taken together, these connectional differences are in line with reported functional differences between the two areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Groen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vann and Aggleton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pothuizen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pothuizen et al., 2010</xref>). Such a functional differentiation between A29 and A30 could thus possibly result in functional differences along the transverse axes of PrS, PaS and MEC.</p><p>During the postnatal period we observed an overall increase in the density of labeled axonal branches in all PHR subregions. Even though we did not perform a formal quantification of the number of labeled fibers in PHR, we only observed single unbranching fibers in animals aged P1-2. During the first postnatal week, the number of axons generally increased, and the fibers displayed several branching points towards the end of the first postnatal week. The first terminal plexus with adult-like densities were observed in P12 animals. Even though several other factors, such as tracer type and the number of layer V RSC neurons involved in the injection also had an impact on the number of fibers observed in each experiment, we are confident that the most important predictor of labeled fiber density was the age of the animal. Interestingly, the time window of increased density of RSC afferents in PHR is paralleled by several anatomical and physiological changes in PHR. EC afferents originating in PaS and PrS become functional from P8 and mature gradually until they are fully adult-like around P14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Canto et al., 2011</xref>). Similar developmental timescales have also been reported for the functional development of intralaminar projections within EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">O'Reilly et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our temporal analysis revealed that RSC axons destined for PHR migrate directly into their area of termination and thereafter keeps their position constant while the number of axonal branches and the total axonal spread increases gradually until they reach adult-like plexus features. This observation is supported by our center of mass analyses of the early perinatal RSC to PHR projections, showing that projections originating in different parts of RSC show a striking terminal topography already during the first postnatal week.</p><p>Head-direction cells and border cells are all present in PHR when electrodes are lowered into the brain during the second postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bjerknes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjerknes et al., 2015</xref>), while grid cells mature during the third and fourth postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Langston et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wills et al., 2010</xref>). Even though no published experiments have investigated whether border cells and head-direction cells are present before the second postnatal week, our data indicate that the topographical organization of RSC terminals in PHR is present before spatially modulated neurons are present in PHR and that adult-like axonal densities can be observed approximately at the same time-point as the first border cells and head-direction cells are observed in PHR. This conclusion is comparable to what has been observed for intrinsic HF-PHR connectivity which is also topographically organized already at early postnatal periods, demonstrating increased plexus densities for intrinsic HF-PHR projections during ongoing development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fricke and Cowan, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borrell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Reilly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Reilly et al., 2014</xref>). It is also comparable to what has been reported in several other developing brain systems. For instance, for thalamocortical projections in the visual system of both monkeys, cats and ferrets, the first arriving axons in the visual cortex already show a topographical organization into ocular dominance columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Horton and Hocking, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crowley and Katz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crair et al., 2001</xref>). Similarly, the rat ventral posterior thalamic nucleus issue projections to the somatosensory cortex in which the first arriving axons target distinct areas later forming a defined barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Catalano et al., 1996</xref>). Sensory inputs to the olfactory bulb are present long before neurons display a receptive field. Moreover, the development of these inputs is independent of activity in sensory receptors, which suggests that the development of topographies in the olfactory bulb is experience independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2000</xref>). The same conclusion apparently holds for the projections from RSC to PHR, These findings are different from what has been reported for the retinogeniculate projection in several species. In this projection, there is an overshoot of axonal terminals, which are initially diffuse and later pruned into an adult-like topography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rakic, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Linden et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shatz, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Godement et al., 1984</xref>). These differences might imply that distinct molecular- or activity based principles governs the axonal termination patterns in different neural projections.</p><p>The results presented in this study thus lead us to conclude that the topographical organization of PHR connectivity is present when the first RSC axons arrive in PHR. The densities of the terminal plexus appear to develop gradually without any clear signs of pruning, though it remains to be determined whether connectional reorganization occurs at the synaptic level during development. The first plexus with adult-like densities can be observed around P12 which is around the time when the first spatially modulated neurons in PHR have been observed (P11), but before eye-opening and before the animals starts to navigate (around P15) and thus before adult like grid cells are observed in PHR (after P25; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Langston et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wills et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bjerknes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjerknes et al., 2015</xref>). These findings suggest that RSC afferents might be important for the development of head-direction and border cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Surgeries and perfusion</title><p>Eighty two female and male Long Evans rats aged between P0 and P28 were used in this study.

Animals were placed in an induction chamber and fully anesthetized before they were moved to a stereotaxic frame. The head was fixed using a neonatal mask and mouthpiece (model 973-B; Kopf, Tujunga, CA) and zygoma ear cups (model 921; Kopf). Animals older than P18 were mounted in a small-sized adult mask and the head was fixed with blunted ear bars. Before incision, the skin was disinfected with 2% iodine in 65% ethanol, and a local analgesic bupivacain (0.2 ml per 100 g bodyweight of a 0.5 mg/ml solution; Marcain, Astra Zeneca, London, UK) was injected subcutaneously at the place of incision. The skin was opened with a small-sized and sharp tipped scissor. After incision, the mouthpiece and ear cups were adjusted so that bregma and lambda were aligned horizontally. Before injecting, bone over the place of injection and over the posterior extreme of the sagittal sinus was removed. The exact place of injection was measured using the junction of the transverse- and sagittal sinus as a reference for the anteroposterior coordinate, the lateral edge of the midsagital sinus as a reference for the mediolateral coordinate and the level of the dura as a reference for the dorsoventral coordinate. Before injection, the dura was punctured, and glass micropipettes with an outer diameter of 20–25 μm were lowered into the brain (30–0044, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA; pulled with a PP-830 puller, Narishige, Japan).

Animals were also administered carprofen during surgery as a post-surgery analgesic (1 ml per 100 g bodyweight of a 0.5 mg/ml solution; Rimadyl, Pfizer, New York, NY). After surgery, the incision was sutured and the pups were allowed to recover under a heating lamp.

When the liver turned pale the perfusion solution was changed to a 4% solution of freshly depolymerized paraformaldehyde in PB (pH 7.4). In case of P0-P2 animals, 0.1% glutaraldehyde was added to the fixative. The brain was removed from the skull and postfixed overnight at 4°C in the same fixative. Twenty-four hours after perfusion, the brains were transferred to PB containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; VWR, Radnor, PA) and 20% glycerol (VWR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Tissue processing</title><p>Brains were cut with a freezing microtome (HM-430 Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) in 40 or 50 µm thick horizontal sections. Depending on the age of the animal sections were collected in four to six equally spaced series. One of the series was mounted directly on superfrost slides (10149870, Thermo Scientific). The remaining series of sections were collected in vials containing 2% DMSO and 20% glycerol in PB and stored at -20°C until further usage. The mounted series was Nissl-stained by first dehydrating the sections in increasing ethanol solutions (50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 100%, 100%) followed by two minutes in xylene (VWR) to clear the sections. Thereafter, the sections were rehydrated in decreasing ethanol solutions (opposite order as the dehydration protocol) and placed in cresyl violet solution for two to six minutes. Subsequently, the sections were rinsed quickly in water and placed in 50% ethanol containing acetic acid to differentiate the staining. The sections were dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylene and finally coverslipped with Entellan (107961, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Visualization of anterograde tracers</title><p>In case of brains with BDA injections, one series of sections was rinsed three times for 10 min in PB and then three times for 10 min in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris)-buffered saline (50 mM Tris (Merck) and 150 mM NaCl in H<sub>2</sub>O) containing 2% Triton X-100 (TBS-Tx; Merck, pH 8.0). In experiments were multiple tracers were injected, the sections were incubated with Alexa-conjugated streptavidin (Alexa-405 S32351, Alexa-488, S11223; Alexa-546, S11225; Alexa-633, S21375, Invitrogen) in a 1:200 solution with TBS-Tx overnight at 4°C. In experiments were BDA was the only tracer injected in the brain, sections were incubated for 90 min in TBS-Tx with avidin-biotin-peroxidase (Vectastain Standard PK-4000 ABC kit; Vector, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequently, sections were rinsed three times for 10 min in TBS-Tx and two times for 5 min in Tris-HCl (50 mM Tris in H<sub>2</sub>O, pH adjusted to 7.6 by adding HCl) and incubated for approximately 15 min in a diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB)–peroxidase solution containing 5 mg DAB (D5905, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 3.3 µl H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (H1009, Sigma-Aldrich) in 10 ml Tris-HCl. Irrespective of whether the incubations were carried out with Alexa-conjugated streptavidin or DAB, the sections were rinsed two times for 5 min in Tris-HCl, and subsequently mounted on glass slides from a 0.2% gelatin solution in Tris-HCl. After overnight drying, they were cleared in toluene and coverslipped with Entellan (Merck).</p><p>Sections were inspected with fluorescence illumination at the appropriate excitation wavelength or conventional brightfield illumination (Zeiss Axio Imager M1/2). Digital images of successful injections and anterogradely labeled plexus in HF-PHR were obtained using a slide scanner equipped for either brightfield or fluorescent imaging (Zeiss Mirax Midi; objective 20X; NA 0.8). For illustrative purposes, images of labeled cells and Nissl stained tissue were exported using Panoramic Viewer software (3DHistech, Budapest, Hungary) and processed in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator (CS6, Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Assessments of experiments</title><p>After the sections were digitized, we aimed to obtain, for each experiment, realistic estimates of the location of the anterogradely labeled axons in PHR and of the locations of the injections in RSC. To achieve this, we first produced an average flatmap of PHR based on measurements of each PHR subdivision in all animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Second, we measured the location of labeled fibers within PHR and represented the position of the labeled fibers on the average flatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Third, we plotted the injections in a reference atlas brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In order to create an average flatmap, we produced individual flatmaps of all animals. To this end, we delineated all subdivisions within PHR using cytoarchitectonic differences between the different subdivisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boccara et al., 2015</xref>). Borders were established in fluorescent- or DAB-stained sections overlaid with the neighboring Nissl-stained section. In all sections, we measured (using Panoramic Viewer software, 3DHistech, Budapest, Hungary) the extent, along the transverse axis, of subdivisions containing labeled RSC axons, i.e. superficial layers of PrS, deep layers of PrS, deep layers of PaS, deep layers of MEC and deep layers of LEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A1–4</xref>). The transverse measurements where obtained from all sections of all brains, stored in excel files and the data were further processed using MatLab software (R2015b, MathWorks, Natick, MA).</p><p>We next aimed to make one average flatmap, constituting of square bins, representing the mean 'shape' of PHR across all brains. Since brains of animals of different ages have different sizes, we first converted the absolute measurements into normalized values. For this, we divided each measurement by the maximum measured extent of the respective subdivision for the particular animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C1</xref>). Next, we binned the dorsoventral axis of each PHR subdivision in 29 equally sized bins, since the maximum number of sections containing PHR in a single series was 29. Subsequently, we calculated the mean of the normalized transverse measurements, across all animals, for each of the 29 dorsoventral levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C2</xref>). This procedure was repeated for each subdivision. To obtain bins each representing a square area of the brain, we first calculated the ratio between the total dorsoventral extent of PHR and the maximum measured extent along the transverse axis of each animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C1</xref>). Thereafter, we calculated the mean of these ratios across all animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C2</xref>). Next, the 29 normalized transverse measurements were divided by the mean of the dorsoventral extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C3</xref>). This procedure was repeated for each subdivision. This procedure thus resulted in, for each subdivision, 29 dorsoventral levels with different transverse extents, expressed as a value relative to the dorsoventral length of PHR. The transverse extents were subsequently turned into square bins (calculated as the average extent along the transverse axis x 29 and rounded to the nearest integer, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C4</xref>) so that each subdivision could be represented as a flatmap containing 29 rows of bins with a variable amount of square bins in each row (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Location of labeled fibers</title><p>We represented the location of labeled axons in PHR for each experiment within the average flatmap in two ways. In experiments where a dense labeled plexus was present, the distances between the boundaries of the plexus and the borders of the respective PHR subdivisions were measured along the transverse axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B1</xref>). We did this for each section containing a labeled plexus. The density of labeling in each plexus in each section was subsequently given a value from 1–3 depending on a subjective evaluation. The densest plexus in each experiment was given a value of '3', while weaker plexus were valued '1' or '2' depending on the density relative to the densest plexus observed in the experiment. Alternatively, in experiments in which we observed only single labeled axons or a sparsely labeled plexus, the transverse measurements were obtained as follows. In PrS, the distance from each labeled axon to the proximal border of PrS was measured, while in deep layers of PaS the distance from each labeled axon to the distal border of PaS was measured. In deep layers of MEC and LEC, the distance from each labeled axon to the medial border of the respective subdivision was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B3</xref>). In cases of missing or damaged sections, we estimated the putative projection pattern in the section by using the average projection pattern of the sections directly above and below.</p><p>To identify the bin(s) in the average flatmap representing the location of labeled fibers, their absolute position, as established above, was normalized within its respective area. In cases where we observed a dense plexus, each bin was given the value corresponding to what was described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B2</xref>). In cases where we measured the location of labeled fibers, each bin was given a value equal to the numbers of labeled axons present in the location represented by the respective bin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B4</xref>). All bins not containing any labeled axons or located outside the labeled plexus were given the value 0.</p><p>To be able to directly compare or pool flatmaps representing either single fibers or dense plexus, we normalized the values of all bins in each experiment to the maximum valued bin in the respective experiment, resulting in bins in each experiment with values ranging between 0, representing no plexus or fibers, or 1, representing the bin with the densest labeling. To compare different sources of variability for the projection patterns, we organized the flatmaps into different groups of interest. For each group, we summed the values of bins representing the same location in all flatmaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B5</xref>). Finally, we normalized the 'summed' flatmap to the bin with the highest value, similar to the procedure described above. In flatmaps representing projection patterns of several subgroups, normalized flatmaps were summed, so that each subgroup had similar impact on the summed flatmap. For illustrative purposes, the flatmaps of individual experiments or groups of experiments were plotted using MatLab.</p><p>In all experiments, we calculated the coordinates for the 'center of mass' of the projections along the transverse and dorsoventral axis for respectively layers I and III of PrS, layers V-VI of PrS and PaS combined and for the combined layers V-VI of MEC and LEC. The center of mass-values of the axonal plexus were used for statistical analyses. In scatter plots of center of mass-values, we defined the extremes of the color scale as ± 2 standard deviations from the mean value. All values between these extremes were plotted using a linear color scale while more extreme values were thresholded to the extreme colors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Location of injections</title><p>Since brains of different ages have different sizes, we aimed to normalize the position of the injections. In adult rats, RSC can be subdivided into four different cytoarchitectonic subdivisions A30 and A29a, b and c. In the adult brain, these four subdivisions are positioned along the dorsoventral extend of RSC. In the immature cortex, only the cytoarchitectonic border between A29 and A30 is clearly identifiable. We therefore chose to define the dorsoventral location of the injections in A29 and A30 as a continuous coordinate. This measure is thus indirectly related to the classical discrete cytoarchitectonic subdivisions. We used the recently released reference 3D-atlas brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Papp et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2015</xref>) to map all injections in a standardized space, irrespective of age. First, we identified coordinates of the dorsal, ventral, rostral and caudal border of respectively A29 and A30 in the atlas brain. The lines between the respective coordinates were smoothed using local regression. Next, we calculated the cutting angles of our experimental brains relative to the atlas brain and made sections of the standard atlas brain with the same cutting angles. We identified atlas-sections containing landmarks and cytoarchitectonic borders present in the section containing the center of each injection. The atlas coordinate of the center of each injection was recorded and served as an age-normalized 3D point-measure of the injection location within RSC. For illustrative purposes, the coordinates of all injections were plotted within the 3D volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, ITK-SNAP, NIH).</p><p>Since the caudal RSC cortex is curved both along the dorsoventral and rostrocaudal axis we flattened RSC and transposed each injection onto a 2D plane. This was done by dividing the surface area of A29 and A30 in the atlas brain into multiple triangles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The coordinates of the dorsal and ventral borders of A29 and A30 determined the coordinates of each triangle. For each injection, we calculated the shortest vector between the injection and the cortical surface within any of the triangles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thereafter, we calculated the intersection of the vector and the plane within the triangle. This coordinate represented the “transposed” location onto the cortical surface of each injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The normalized 2D coordinate of each injection was defined as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>); the dorsoventral coordinate was defined as , <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>where <italic>d<sub>v</sub></italic> and <italic>d<sub>d</sub></italic> represent the distance from the transposed injection to the ventral and dorsal border respectively. The rostrocaudal coordinate was obtained by first calculating a line along the rostrocaudal extend of A29 and A30, positioned equally distant from their respective dorsal and ventral borders. Next, we calculated the shortest vector between the transposed injection and the line and found the intersection between the two. The rostrocaudal coordinate was defined as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic>d<sub>r</sub></italic> and <italic>d<sub>c</sub></italic> is the cumulative distance from the cross section to the rostral and caudal end of RSC. This resulted in the normalized map of the positions of all injection sites analyzed in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>For cluster analyses, we smoothed each flatmap by applying a Gaussian filter of 5 x 5 bins with a standard deviation of 1.5. Thereafter we calculated pairwise correlations between each possible pair of flatmaps. The correlation matrix was subsequently clustered by using the k-means clustering algorithm in MatLab. The number of clusters was subjectively decided by evaluating the ratio between within- and between cluster variance. The number of clusters was fixed when adding more clusters would not result in a substantial decrease in the within- to between cluster variance ratio.</p><p>Our dataset contained experiments in animals of all ages between P1 and P19 and injections in animals aged P27 and P28. Since we did not have samples between P19 and P27 we only included experiments in animals aged P19 or younger in the statistical analyses. Experiments that did not result in labeled axons in any of the areas of PHC where not included in the analyses. The dorsoventral and transverse coordinates of centers of mass were thereafter analyzed independently. For each of the coordinates, we fitted a linear multiple regression model to the data using age and the normalized location of the injection as predictors. A model including the main predictors and two-way interactions was fitted to the data using SPSS (version 20, IBM, Armonk, NY). We subsequently removed from the model the two-way interaction with the lowest standardized β-value and were insignificantly different from zero (t-test), and a new model was fitted. This procedure was repeated until the model only consisted of the main effects and significant two-way interaction terms. In the regression models, the center of mass coordinates ranged from 0 (ventral) to 1 (dorsal) and from 0 (proximal and medial) to 1 (distal and lateral), the coordinates of the injection cite ranged from 0 (rostral) and 1 (caudal) and from 0 (ventral) and 1 (dorsal) and the age of the animal was measured in postnatal age in days. Regression coefficients are reported unstandardized with 95% confidence intervals.</p><p>To assess whether the data met the assumption of linear relationships, we visually assessed scatter plots in which each of the independent variables were plotted versus each of the center of mass coordinates. Additionally, we evaluated the standardized predictor values plotted against the standardized regression residuals to assess whether the assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity, independent residuals and normally distributed residuals were met. We additionally tested whether the residuals were normally distributed by visually inspecting frequency histograms and normal probability plots. Next, we tested multicollinearity of the independent variables by correlating each of the independent variables. No multicollinearity was assumed if the Pearson’s correlations were between -0.70 and 0.70. In addition, we assessed the variance inflation factor (VIF) of each model. The highest calculated VIF was 1.197, which is well below recommended cutoffs. Statistical significance of regression coefficients was determined using two sided <italic>t</italic>-test with p&lt;0.05 as criterion.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Bruno Monterotti and Paulo Giraõ for technical assistance with experiments.

The Methods are initially tough to wade through and to understand. I do think the study was well done; the authors successfully met the challenges of comparing anatomical data across developmental ages. However, most readers will not put in the time to access the Methods. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is not mentioned until the end of the paper in the Methods.

It is also possible that the same end could be achieved with a table.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>1) The authors discuss at length the involvement and importance of RSC for physiological correlates such as grid cells, head direction cells, etc. However, they only very briefly refer to the body of work that has revealed a causal role for RSC in spatial memory. Moreover, there is no mention of other, emerging evidence of the important for RSC in learning and memory beyond spatial tasks (e.g. work by Corcoran et al., Bucci and colleagues, Helmstetter's group). I suggest there be a least a little more mention of these sorts of studies simply because it would inform the reader as to why the current anatomical study is so important.</p><p>2) The authors previously report that there are connections between RSC and perirhinal cortex in their 2011 paper that described the RSC connectome. However, here they report that no such connections were revealed (subsection “General projection patterns”). This apparent conflict should be resolved.</p><p>3) As the authors note in the aforementioned 2011 connectome paper, various terminologies have been used to describe/identify the purported subregions of RSC. Here, the authors use the A29/30 nomenclature. It would be useful to briefly mention how those designations relate to other nomenclatures used to distinguish areas within RSC (e.g., by Burwell/Amaral, Vogt).</p><p>4) What was the rationale for defining the different age groups here (e.g., in the first paragraph of the subsection “Projection patterns in different age groups”)? It appears to be 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks and older – why is that an appropriate division?</p><p>5) It appears that data were pooled from males and females. Any reason to expect (or not) that there are potential sex differences in the temporal maturation of these connections given that there are sex differences in behavior/disorders related to these brain areas?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Generally the experiments were performed properly, and are described appropriately. In general, the manuscript is fine, however, quite some improvements can be made to the manuscript. The use of A30 and A29 is correct, but some explanation about other nomenclature for these regions is needed. Furthermore, A29 consists of more than one region, and connections from the sub-areas are not the same. Therefore, injections should be subdivided into these sub-areas. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> indicates that all projections to PHR arise from layer 5 in RSC, even so it should be mentioned that injections cover what layers in RSC. By the way, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> is of too low quality (and from what age are the injections?), also the pre/parasubicular injection seems to only retrogradely label A29. While the illustrations of the paper are fine, for the interested reader it would be of use to have some schematic drawing(s) of the described connections, and the timeline of their development. Finally, the schematic maps (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and further) showing the topography are very hard to read, they should be made more accessible to the average reader.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13925.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The main issue with the paper is readability, particularly the Methods and Results.

We have prepared a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, which schematically summarizes the main findings of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors discuss at length the involvement and importance of RSC for physiological correlates such as grid cells, head direction cells, etc. However, they only very briefly refer to the body of work that has revealed a causal role for RSC in spatial memory. Moreover, there is no mention of other, emerging evidence of the important for RSC in learning and memory beyond spatial tasks (e.g. work by Corcoran et al., Bucci and colleagues, Helmstetter's group). I suggest there be a least a little more mention of these sorts of studies simply because it would inform the reader as to why the current anatomical study is so important.</italic> We agree that the functional relevance of RSC in memory processes was under represented in the manuscript. We added a few sentences (Introduction, last paragraph) to emphasize these features of RSC. We decided to not bring this point into the Discussion since there are currently few studies investigating the functional relevance of the different RSC subdivisions. In addition, there are no developmental data exploring this topic. It is therefore challenging to discuss our results in this aspect.</p><p><italic>2) The authors previously report that there are connections between RSC and perirhinal cortex in their 2011 paper that described the RSC connectome. However, here they report that no such connections were revealed (subsection “General projection patterns”). This apparent conflict should be resolved.</italic> </p><p>This connection has previously been reported in Burwell and Amaral (Cortical afferents of the perirhinal, postrhinal, and entorhinal cortices of the rat. J Comp Neurol. 1998 Aug 24;398(2):179-205). The authors observed extremely few retrogradely labeled cell bodies in RSC after injections in A35 and 36. We have clearly stated the controversy in the subsection “General projection patterns”. Since this is only a small detail, we have dealt with this when describing the lack of projections in PER. In the Burwell paper, retrograde tracers were used. In our hands, retrograde tracers are generally more sensitive, but less specific than iontophoretically injected anterograde tracers, therefore the labeling in perirhinal cortex might have been the result of transport by passing fibers or we may have missed very sparse and relatively long projections by using anterograde tracers and relatively short post-injection survival times.</p><p><italic>3) As the authors note in the aforementioned 2011 connectome paper, various terminologies have been used to describe/identify the purported subregions of RSC. Here, the authors use the A29/30 nomenclature. It would be useful to briefly mention how those designations relate to other nomenclatures used to distinguish areas within RSC (e.g., by Burwell/Amaral, Vogt).</italic> We inserted a new paragraph in the beginning of the Results. We refer to Vogt for the nomenclature and to Sugar 2011 for a rosetta stone for RSC nomenclatures.</p><p><italic>4) What was the rationale for defining the different age groups here (e.g., in the first paragraph of the subsection “Projection patterns in different age groups”)? It appears to be 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks and older – why is that an appropriate division?</italic> These groups were only assigned for visualization purposes. The statistical analysis was done using a continuous age scale.</p><p>We chose to visualize these periods because the intrinsic HF-PHR connectivity has been reported to be fully developed during the second postnatal week (before P13), while the functional connectivity is fully developed from P14 an onwards. In addition, eye-opening occurs around P14 which is presumed to be an important developmental milestone. We therefore felt it was natural to group animals into P1-P6, P7-P13 and P14+.</p><p><italic>5) It appears that data were pooled from males and females. Any reason to expect (or not) that there are potential sex differences in the temporal maturation of these connections given that there are sex differences in behavior/disorders related to these brain areas?</italic> This was done to save animals. In each litter we obtained approximately 5 females and 5 males. To avoid having five unused animals from each litter we chose to do experiments on both genders. We thereby reduced the numbers of litters by 50%. In the literature, there are no strong data indicative of sex differences, neither in development nor in connectivity of the areas of research.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3: Generally the experiments were performed properly, and are described appropriately. In general, the manuscript is fine, however, quite some improvements can be made to the manuscript. The use of A30 and A29 is correct, but some explanation about other nomenclature for these regions is needed.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for this overall very positive evaluation. As stated above, we inserted a new paragraph in the beginning of the Results where the nomenclature and the cytoarchitectonic criteria used to define these areas is described.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, A29 consists of more than one region, and connections from the sub-areas are not the same. Therefore, injections should be subdivided into these sub-areas.</italic> </p><p>We totally agree with this comment. However, to subdivide A29 further is impossible in the youngest pups since the cytoarchitectonic differences are not apparent at this age. We therefore chose to define the dorsoventral axis of RSC as a continuous measure. The reasoning for this is that a continuous “subdivision” is comparable across all ages while the classical cytoarchitectonic subdivision is only usable for the oldest pups. We have now inserted a statement on this both in the Results section (first paragraph) and in the Methods section (subsection “Location of labeled fibers”, end of second paragraph). We acknowledge that our continuous measure is only indirectly related to the classical cytoarchitectonic subdivision since the classical borders of A29a, b and c follow only approximately our continuous definition of the dorsoventral axis of RSC. In our material we find that the transverse coordinate of center of mass of the RSC projections to PHR show an approximately linear relationship with the dorsoventral coordinate of the injection in RSC. We did not observe any discrete “jumps”. This suggest that the topographical organization of projections from RSC to PHR is not organized into discrete projection patterns from each of A29a, b or c (or A30) but is rather organized in a continuous gradient over the dorsoventral RSC, similar to what has been reported for the adult situation.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> indicates that all projections to PHR arise from layer 5 in RSC, even so it should be mentioned that injections cover what layers in RSC.</p><p>This is an important point, which was stated in the original manuscript and we also now explicitly mention this in the subsection “Development of density of projection”.</p><p>By the way, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> is of too low quality (and from what age are the injections?),</p><p>We expect that this comment resulted from the fairly low resolution of the figure we initially embedded in the manuscript. We have now uploaded a new version of this figure with increased resolution, such that all figures are now at the same, high resolution. The ages of the animals are described in the aforementioned subsection and in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. We have also added the ages into the figure.</p><p><italic>also the pre/parasubicular injection seems to only retrogradely label A29.</italic> </p><p>The injection in this animal is relatively large compared to the size of the brain and covers PrS, PaS and MEC. There are labeled neurons in both A30 and A29; however, it is clear that the neurons with the strongest fluorescent signal are located ventral A29.</p><p><italic>While the illustrations of the paper are fine, for the interested reader it would be of use to have some schematic drawing(s) of the described connections, and the timeline of their development.</italic> </p><p>This is a very good suggestion. We have submitted a <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, which schematically summarize the main findings of the manuscript.</p><p>Finally, the schematic maps (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and further) showing the topography are very hard to read, they should be made more accessible to the average reader.</p><p>We agree to this comment. We have therefore reorganized the figures, moving the former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> into supplementary figures. We have prepared new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, mapping the centers of mass of labelling for all experiments, which hopefully are more simple to read.</p></body></sub-article></article>
