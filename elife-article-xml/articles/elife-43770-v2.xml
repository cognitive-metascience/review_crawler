Although the IC plays important roles in speech processing, sound localization, and other auditory computations, the organization of the IC microcircuitry remains largely unknown. Using a multifaceted approach in mice, we have identified vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons as a novel class of IC principal neurons. VIP neurons are glutamatergic stellate cells with sustained firing patterns. Their extensive axons project to long-range targets including the auditory thalamus, auditory brainstem, superior colliculus, and periaqueductal gray. Using optogenetic circuit mapping, we found that VIP neurons integrate input from the contralateral IC and the dorsal cochlear nucleus. The dorsal cochlear nucleus also drove feedforward inhibition to VIP neurons, indicating that inhibitory circuits within the IC shape the temporal integration of ascending inputs. Thus, VIP neurons are well-positioned to influence auditory computations in a number of brain regions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43770.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our brains help us make sense of our surroundings. Our sense organs, for example the ears, receive signals from the environment, which are passed on to specialized parts of the brain, called nuclei. There, neurons process the information and send impulses to other areas in the brain, which eventually help us decide how to respond.</p><p>A nucleus called the inferior colliculus is one of the major hearing centres in the mammalian brain. In humans, it is vital for recognizing speech and pinpointing the location of sounds. It contains several different types of neurons, and links with many other areas of the brain.</p><p>While the inferior colliculus is crucial for our sense of hearing, little is known about the specific properties of the neurons within it. In particular, these cells are difficult to divide into well-defined groups. Even less is understood about the precise nature of the connections between these neurons, which likely underpin the computational power of the inferior colliculus. Goyer et al. therefore set out to identify a specific class of neurons in this region and map the circuits they formed.</p><p>Experiments were conducted on genetically modified mice whose neurons were only ‘glowing’ if they had a gene called <italic>VIP</italic> switched on. Detailed examination of the shape of the ‘VIP cells’, as well as their chemical and electrical properties, confirmed that they were indeed a distinct class of neurons.</p><p>Another set of experiments relied on a method that uses light to control the activity of brain cells. This showed that VIP cells received signals both from other neurons in the inferior colliculus, and from another hearing center in the brain. In turn, VIP cells sent signals over long distances to many other parts of the brain that handle sound signals. This suggests that VIP neurons have a wide-ranging influence on our brains’ ability to process sound.</p><p>The work by Goyer et al. has, for the first time, reliably identified specific circuits in a brain region essential for our sense of hearing. By knowing more about how the brain’s hearing centers are connected to each other, it may become possible to understand their roles in hearing loss. In this effort, the inferior colliculus may become a target for treatments for patients with hearing difficulties.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auditory</kwd><kwd>neuron types</kwd><kwd>inferior colliculus</kwd><kwd>VIP</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>neural circuits</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>401540516</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goyer</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002046</institution-id><institution>Hearing Health Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emerging Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>Michael Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC016880</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>Michael Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC004391</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schofield</surname><given-names>Brett R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>VIP neurons are a novel class of inferior colliculus stellate neurons that project to long-range auditory and non-auditory targets and integrate inputs from the auditory brainstem and contralateral IC.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The inferior colliculus (IC) is the hub of the central auditory pathway. Nearly all ascending output from the lower auditory brainstem and a large descending projection from the auditory cortex converge in the IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glendenning and Masterton, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oliver, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oliver, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Winer et al., 1998</xref>). In turn, the IC provides the main auditory input to the thalamocortical system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calford and Aitkin, 1983</xref>). Neurons in the IC exhibit selective responses to the spectral and temporal content of sounds and perform computations important for sound localization and the identification of speech and other communication sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Felix et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Winer and Schreiner, 2005</xref>). Despite these critical functions, we have limited knowledge about the organization and function of neural circuits in the IC. This is because probing neural circuits requires the ability to identify and manipulate specific classes of neurons, but IC neurons have proven difficult to delineate into distinct classes.</p><p>Anatomical studies have shown that IC neurons have disc-shaped or stellate morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Malmierca et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meininger et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oliver and Morest, 1984</xref>). Disc-shaped neurons maintain their dendritic arbors within isofrequency lamina and make up the majority of neurons in the tonotopically organized central nucleus of the IC (ICc). Stellate neurons in the ICc extend their dendritic arbors across laminae and are therefore thought to integrate information across sound frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oliver et al., 1991</xref>). Both disc-shaped and stellate cells can be glutamatergic or GABAergic, an indication that each of these morphological groups consists of at least two neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Oliver et al., 1994</xref>). Based on soma size and extracellular markers, IC GABAergic neurons have been divided into four classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beebe et al., 2016</xref>). Among these, ‘large GABAergic’ neurons are the one consistently identified neuron type in the IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geis and Borst, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ito and Oliver, 2012</xref>). However, there are currently no known molecular markers specific for large GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schofield and Beebe, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Defining IC neuron types based on physiology has also proven difficult. IC neurons exhibit diverse responses to tones, but a comprehensive study showed that these responses form a continuum and cannot be used on their own to define functionally significant groups of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Palmer et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, disc-shaped neurons could not be divided into distinct groups by matching their morphology with their in vivo physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wallace et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, GABAergic and glutamatergic IC neurons exhibit overlapping and equally diverse responses to sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ono et al., 2017</xref>). In vitro recordings have shown that IC neurons exhibit diverse firing patterns, but these firing patterns do not correlate with neuronal morphology or neurotransmitter phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ono et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Peruzzi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Reetz and Ehret, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sivaramakrishnan and Oliver, 2001</xref>).</p><p>In many brain regions, a multidimensional analysis that includes molecular markers has proven key to identifying neuron classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ascoli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zeng and Sanes, 2017</xref>). Here, by combining molecular, morphological, and physiological analyses, we identify vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons as a novel class of IC principal neurons. Our results show that VIP neurons are glutamatergic stellate neurons and represent approximately 20% of the stellate neurons in the ICc. VIP neurons are labeled in the VIP-IRES-Cre mouse line and are present in the major subdivisions of the IC, with a higher prevalence in caudal regions of the ICc, where most ascending input originates from monaural brainstem nuclei. Using viral tract tracing, we found that VIP neurons project to multiple auditory and non-auditory areas, demonstrating that a single neuron class can participate in most of the major projection pathways out of the IC. Using Channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping (CRACM), we found that VIP neurons integrate input from the contralateral IC and the auditory brainstem. Input from the auditory brainstem also drove local, feedforward inhibition onto VIP neurons. Thus, our data reveal a novel circuit motif that may control the temporal summation of ascending input to the IC. Together, these results represent a critical step toward determining how defined neural circuits in the IC support sound processing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The VIP-IRES-Cre mouse line labels neurons in multiple subdivisions of the IC</title><p>By crossing VIP-IRES-Cre mice with Ai14 reporter mice, we obtained mice in which VIP<sup>+</sup> neurons expressed the fluorescent protein tdTomato.

To investigate the neurotransmitter content of VIP neurons, we performed immunohistochemical staining against GAD67, a marker for GABAergic neurons, in brain slices from three VIP-IRES-Cre x Ai14 animals, aged P58 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We then counted tdTomato<sup>+</sup> neurons and GAD67-labeled cell bodies in one caudal and one rostral IC slice per animal. Because there were no regional differences in GAD67 staining among VIP neurons, neurons located in the ICc, ICd, and IClc were combined for this analysis.

Coronal IC sections from two VIP-IRES-Cres x Ai14 mice were stained with anti-NeuN and anti-bNOS. Three sections per mouse were analyzed: one caudal, one middle, and one rostral. To ensure unbiased counting of neurons, we applied the optical fractionator method, a design-based stereology approach (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">West et al., 1991</xref>). Accordingly, we used systematic random sampling to collect confocal image stacks with a 63x objective at evenly spaced intervals from each IC section. Each image stack was inspected to determine the boundaries of the slice, and guard zones were set at the top and bottom of the slice to delineate a central, 15 µm-thick section of the slice for subsequent analysis. Within this 15 µm-thick region, we separately marked NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons and tdTomato<sup>+</sup> neurons, then overlaid the NeuN and tdTomato images to determine the number of double-marked cells. We also collected tile scan images of each IC section analyzed using a 20x objective and used bNOS staining to determine the border separating the ICc from the IC shell. The 63x z-stacks were aligned to these tile scans, and counted neurons were assigned to the ICc or IC shell.</p><p>The results of the stereological analysis revealed that VIP neurons represented a larger portion of neurons in the ICc (3.5 ± 1.0%) than in the IC shell (1.5 ± 0.2%; two-tailed t-test, t<sub>(79) </sub>= 2.86, p = 0.005; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In addition, the prevalence of VIP neurons was highest in caudal regions of the ICc and the IC shell and tended to decrease in a caudal to rostral gradient. This trend was significant when comparing the caudal ICc to the rostral ICc (one-way ANOVA, F<sub>(2,37)</sub> = 7.27, p = 0.002, Tukey’s post hoc, p=0.001) and the caudal IC shell to the middle IC shell (one-way ANOVA, F<sub>(2,38)</sub> = 3.88, p = 0.03, Tukey’s post hoc, p = 0.03). These results suggest that VIP neurons are not evenly distributed along the rostral-caudal extent of the isofrequency lamina of the ICc and, according to the functional domain hypothesis, may be more likely to receive input from ascending afferents that preferentially target the caudal ICc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cant and Benson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loftus et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oliver et al., 1997</xref>). The functional implications of this anatomical arrangement will be addressed in more detail in the Discussion.

Recordings made from the ICc, ICd, and IClc were lumped together for this experiment because there were no clear differences in VIP neuron physiology across these subdivisions of the IC. VIP neurons had a resting membrane potential of −69.5 mV ± 4.4 mV (n = 216, corrected for liquid junction potential). In response to a current step protocol with hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current injections, VIP neurons showed minimal to no voltage sag to hyperpolarizing current steps and a sustained firing pattern of action potentials to depolarizing current steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub></xref>).

Sustained firing neurons were the most prevalent group in NT recordings (58.2%, 32 out of 55). Additionally, 3.6% (2 of 55) of randomly patched IC neurons fired only one spike at the onset of the depolarizing current step. This firing pattern was never observed in VIP neurons. The intrinsic physiology of VIP neurons also differed significantly from the general population of IC neurons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

We therefore hypothesized that the intrinsic physiology of VIP neurons in the ICc varied along the tonotopic axis of the ICc. During patch clamp experiments, VIP neurons were passively filled with biocytin via the internal solution. Slices were fixed and stained post hoc with a streptavidin-Alexa Fluor conjugate (see Materials and methods).

Correlations between intrinsic physiology and location in the ICc were tested by fitting a plane to scatter plots of intrinsic parameters versus medial-lateral and dorsal-ventral coordinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

For each of the above intrinsic parameters, values tended to be lower, indicating faster membrane properties, at more dorsolateral locations and higher, indicating slower membrane properties, at more ventromedial locations. Combined, these results suggest that variability in the intrinsic physiology of VIP neurons is at least in part due to their localization along the tonotopic axis of the ICc and that the membrane properties of VIP neurons tend to be faster in lower frequency regions of the ICc.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>VIP neurons have stellate morphology and dendritic spines</title><p>The streptavidin staining of biocytin-filled VIP neurons allowed for a detailed analysis of morphology.

This contrasts sharply with the 28% (12 of 43 neurons) of neurons that had spiny dendrites in non-targeted recordings from C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that VIP neurons represent a subset of IC cells.

To measure the orientation of ICc VIP neurons in relation to the isofrequency laminae, which in mouse run in a ~45° angle through the ICc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Stiebler and Ehret, 1985</xref>), we identified the longest and second longest axis of each neuron through principal component analysis and plotted the orientation of these axes on a standardized model of the IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). No preferred orientation was apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <italic>combined</italic>). Only 17% of VIP neurons (7 of 42) had their longest axis oriented within ± 15° of the 45° laminar plane, indicating that the dendritic arbors of most VIP neurons (83%, 35 of 42) may be positioned to cross one or more isofrequency laminae in the ICc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). To quantify this, we calculated the length the dendritic arbor extended perpendicular to a 45° laminar plane. The dendritic arbors of 83% of ICc VIP neurons (35 of 42) spread more than 100 µm perpendicular to the laminar plane, and more than 36% (15 of 42) spread more than 200 µm across the laminar plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Previous work in rats has shown that the isofrequency laminae have a center-to-center distance that ranges from 90 to 150 µm, while neurons contained within a lamina had a thickness ranging from 30 to 70 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Malmierca et al., 1993</xref>). If we assume that laminar dimensions in mouse are no thicker than those in rats, our results indicate that the dendritic fields of VIP neurons usually extend beyond at least one isofrequency lamina, consistent with the conclusion that VIP neurons in the ICc are a class of stellate neurons. Previous estimates indicate that approximately 15 – 20% of ICc neurons are stellate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oliver et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oliver and Morest, 1984</xref>).

In addition, electrical stimulation of commissural projections cannot differentiate between axons originating in the ipsilateral and contralateral IC. This is because electrical stimulation evokes both orthodromic and antidromic spikes, and, since most IC neurons have local axon collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oliver et al., 1991</xref>), antidromic spikes can lead to synaptic release from the local collaterals of neurons ipsilateral to the recording site. Furthermore, the commissure contains axons from sources other than IC cells, including cells in the auditory cortex, sagulum, nuclei of the lateral lemniscus and superior paraolivary nucleus (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Saldaña and Merchán, 2005</xref>); electrical stimulation in the commissure could also activate these axons. To overcome these obstacles, we turned to Channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping (CRACM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Petreanu et al., 2007</xref>). With CRACM, it is possible to selectively activate a single population of presynaptic neurons by anatomically and/or molecularly restricting the expression of an optogenetic protein. In our experiments, we used stereotaxic coordinates and intracranial virus injections to anatomically restrict Chronos expression. Epi-fluorescence imaging confirmed that Chronos-GFP expression was always clearly limited to the right IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) or the right DCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43770.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>VIP neurons in the ICc receive excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input from the contralateral IC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental setup.

We therefore first used CRACM to test whether VIP neurons in the ICc receive commissural input. Using stereotaxic, intracranial virus injections with AAV1.Syn.Chronos-GFP.WPRE.bGH, we drove expression of GFP-tagged Chronos, a fast Channelrhodopsin variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>), in the right IC. Note that we did not attempt to limit Chronos expression to a particular subdivision of the right IC. Visual inspection of Chronos-GFP fluorescence suggested that most of the somata labeled in the right IC were located in the ICc, but labeled somata were often also present in the ICd and occasionally the IClc.</p><p>We then targeted recordings to VIP neurons in the contralateral (left) ICc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In each experiment, we used GFP fluorescence to verify transfection of the right IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) and restricted our recordings to VIP neurons in areas of the left ICc where GFP-labeled axons were visible. Because commissural projections are a mixture of glutamatergic and GABAergic projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">González-Hernández et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hernández et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nakamoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Saint Marie, 1996</xref>), we used pharmacology to isolate EPSPs and IPSPs. Indeed, without adding receptor antagonists to the bath, postsynaptic potentials often were mixtures of IPSPs and EPSPs (data not shown). In the presence of AMPA and NMDA receptor antagonists (10 µM NBQX and 50 µM D-AP5, bath application), 2 – 5 ms flashes of blue light elicited IPSPs in 6 out of 12 neurons tested (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, left</bold>). IPSPs were completely abolished by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist gabazine (5 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, right; n = 6; amplitude, p = 0.006; rise time, p = 0.003; halfwidth, p = 0.001; membrane time constant, p = 0.003, paired t-test). On average (n = 6), commissural IPSPs in ICc VIP neurons were small (−1.53 mV ± 0.96 mV) and had moderate 10 – 90% rise times (7.8 ms ± 2.1 ms), halfwidths (15.1 ms ± 6.8 ms) and decay time constants (32.4 ms ± 17.0 ms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>To investigate excitatory commissural inputs to ICc VIP neurons, recordings were carried out in the presence of GABA<sub>A</sub> and glycine receptor antagonists (5 µm gabazine and 1 µM strychnine, bath application, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We found that 2 – 5 ms flashes of blue light elicited EPSPs in 11 out of 27 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, left). On average (n = 6), commissural EPSPs in VIP neurons were small (1.52 mV ± 1.08 mV) and had moderate 10 – 90% rise times (8.3 ms ± 4.3 ms), halfwidths (19.6 ms ± 7.6 ms) and decay time constants (43.5 ms ± 16.8 ms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Adding the NMDA receptor antagonist D-AP5 to the bath significantly reduced the halfwidth of EPSPs (14.3 ms ± 4.7 ms, p = 0.006) and revealed a trend toward reducing the rise time (6.3 ms ± 1.6 ms, p = 0.09) and decay time constant (30.6 ms ± 7.3 ms, p = 0.06) of EPSPs (ANOVA for repeated measurements with Tukey post-hoc test). The remainder of the EPSP was completely blocked by the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). These results suggest that VIP neurons in the ICc receive excitatory commissural input and express both AMPA and NMDA receptors at excitatory commissural synapses. Interestingly, commissural input activated NMDA receptors even though there was 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the bath and the somatic membrane potential was at or near the resting membrane potential throughout the recording. This may indicate that commissural synapses are located on the distal dendrites and/or the dendritic spines of VIP neurons.</p><p>Combined, the commissural CRACM experiments show that VIP neurons in the ICc receive excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input from the contralateral IC. Surprisingly, although GABAergic neurons make up &lt;= 20% of commissural projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hernández et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nakamoto et al., 2013</xref>), we found a higher connection probability for inhibitory commissural projections (50%; 6 out of 12 recordings performed in the presence of NBQX and D-AP5), than for excitatory connections (41%; 11 out of 27 recordings performed in the presence of gabazine and strychnine).</p><p>Due to the kinetics of optogenetic proteins and the possibility of activating optogenetic proteins in synaptic terminals, optogenetically-evoked PSPs may have slower kinetics than PSPs evoked by electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jackman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhang and Oertner, 2007</xref>). To test whether the kinetics of Chronos-evoked commissural PSPs were similar to those of electrically-evoked PSPs, we electrically stimulated the IC commissure while recording PSPs from VIP neurons in the contralateral IC. As indicated above, this raises the complication that electrically-evoked EPSPs were probably elicited both from the desired contralateral projections and from antidromic stimulation of ipsilateral axons. Compared to optogenetically-evoked EPSPs, electrically-evoked EPSPs (n = 6) had similar amplitudes and rise times, but had smaller halfwidths and trended toward faster decay time constants (amplitude: 2.4 mV ± 1.7 mV, p = 0.37; rise time: 6.28 ms ± 6.3 ms, p = 0.40; halfwidth: 10.3 ms ± 4.8 ms, p = 0.008*; decay time constant 28.4 ms ± 10.0 ms, p = 0.016, two tailed t-test, *critical p value with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons = 0.0125). Electrically-evoked IPSPs (n = 6) showed no significant difference in amplitude, halfwidth or decay time constant, but trended toward faster rise times (amplitude: −1.7 mV ± 1.3 mV, p = 0.78; rise time: 4.2 ms ± 2.3 ms, p = 0.025; halfwidth: 8.8 ms ± 7.3 ms, p = 0.16; decay time constant 36.8 ms ± 17.3 ms, p = 0.67, two tailed t-test, critical p value with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons = 0.0125). It should be noted that to position the stimulus electrode in the IC commissure contralateral to the recording site, these recordings had to be biased to VIP neurons in more rostral parts of the IC where the commissure was clearly visible, a bias that was not present in the CRACM recordings. Also, we cannot exclude that antidromic spikes may have influenced PSP analysis. Both may account for some of the observed differences in PSP kinetics. Overall, however, these data suggest that the kinetics of Chronos-evoked PSPs were generally similar to those of electrically-evoked PSPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>VIP neurons in the ICc receive synaptic input from the DCN</title><p>The DCN provides one of the major sources of excitatory input to the IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brunso-Bechtold et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oliver, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Osen, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ryugo et al., 1981</xref>). A previous study has shown that DCN afferents synapse onto glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), but it is not known which specific classes of IC neurons receive input from the DCN. In addition, the physiology of DCN afferent synapses remains unknown. To test whether VIP neurons receive synaptic input from DCN principal neurons, we injected the right DCN with the AAV1.Syn.Chronos-GFP.WPRE.bGH viral vector and recorded from VIP neurons in the contralateral (left) ICc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, left). To confirm selective transfection of the DCN, we sliced the brainstem of every animal used and determined whether GFP expression was present and limited to the right DCN. If there was no transfection or if there was considerable expression of GFP in the auditory nerve or VCN, no recordings were performed. In most cases, GFP expression was limited to the DCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, right) and GFP-labeled axons were present in the left ICc.</p><p>To block spontaneous IPSPs, we performed DCN CRACM experiments with GABAergic and glycinergic blockers in the bath (5 µm gabazine and 1 µM strychnine, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). We found that 2–5 ms pulses of blue light elicited EPSPs in 19 of 25 neurons tested, confirming that ICc VIP neurons receive synaptic input from the DCN. Light-evoked EPSPs had moderate amplitudes (2.85 mV ± 2.98 mV) and relatively slow rise times (4.2 ms ± 1.3 ms), halfwidths (20.6 ms ± 14.4 ms) and decay time constants (22.0 ms ± 6.7 ms) (n = 6 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, left and 8C). Because EPSP kinetics were relatively slow, we hypothesized that DCN synapses activate NMDA receptors on VIP neurons. Interestingly, D-AP5 had no significant effect on any of the measured properties (amplitude: 2.80 mV ± 2.54 mV, p = 0.96, rise time: 4.4 ms ± 1.7 ms, p = 0.95, halfwidth: 15.4 ms ± 6.1 ms, p = 0.37, decay time constant: 29.0 ms ± 7.1 ms, p = 0.16, two tailed t-test, critical p value with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons = 0.0125) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, middle, and 8C). In contrast to commissural inputs where D-AP5 had a significant effect on EPSP kinetics, this suggests that DCN inputs to ICc VIP neurons do not activate NMDA receptors under resting conditions. Subsequent addition of NBQX completely abolished DCN-evoked EPSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, right), confirming that DCN synapses activate AMPA receptors on ICc VIP neurons. Since fusiform cells in the DCN often fire at rates exceeding 100 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma and Brenowitz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nelken and Young, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Spirou and Young, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Young and Brownell, 1976</xref>), the slow kinetics of DCN-evoked EPSPs suggests that these EPSPs undergo temporal summation in VIP neurons.</p><p>To test whether Chronos-elicited synaptic release from DCN terminals was driven by action potentials as opposed to direct activation of DCN terminals by light, we repeated the DCN CRACM experiments in the presence of 1 µM tetrodotoxin (TTX). After TTX wash-in, EPSPs elicited by blue light flashes were completely and reversibly abolished in 3 of 3 tested VIP neurons (data not shown). This suggests that synaptic release in CRACM experiments was driven by action potentials, or was at least dependent on sodium channel activation in synaptic terminals.</p><p>To determine whether PSPs evoked by DCN inputs to VIP neurons differed from those evoked in non-VIP neurons, we recorded from non-fluorescent neurons in the ICc of VIP-IRES-Cre x Ai14 mice in which the DCN was transfected with Chronos. Recordings were targeted to neurons in regions of the ICc where Chronos-GFP-labeled axons were clearly visible. We found that 8 out of 12 non-VIP neurons received input from the DCN. EPSPs evoked by DCN inputs to non-VIP neurons (n = 8) had similar amplitudes, rise time, halfwidth and decay times (amplitude: 1.7 mV ± 0.6 mV, p = 0.34; rise time: 4.7 ms ± 1.6 ms, p = 0.52; halfwidth: 16.5 ms ± 9.6 ms, p = 0.77; decay time constant 25.9 ms ± 17.8 ms, p = 0.72; two tailed t-test, critical p value with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons = 0.0125) compared to those recorded from VIP neurons. Although the means were not statistically different, DCN-evoked EPSPs in VIP neurons showed less variability in halfwidth and decay time than EPSPs in non-VIP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). These results suggest that ICc neurons located near DCN afferents have a high probability of receiving input from the DCN, consistent with predictions made from anatomical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oliver, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oliver et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Together, these results identify VIP neurons in the ICc as a distinct postsynaptic target of DCN afferents.

Under these conditions, we observed that an IPSP was elicited 2–3 ms after the onset of the light-evoked EPSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). This IPSP could vary in strength between recorded VIP neurons. In some instances, the IPSP slightly altered the halfwidth and decay time constant of the EPSP. In other cases, the IPSP strongly limited the EPSP duration and generated a hyperpolarization after the EPSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, left). Washing in gabazine restored the EPSP to values comparable to the EPSPs recorded in the presence of inhibitory receptor antagonists (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>). Washing out gabazine restored the IPSP and limited EPSP halfwidth again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, right). Across five ICc VIP neurons, the IPSP significantly shortened the halfwidth of the elicited EPSP (p = 0.048, paired t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Halfwidth reductions ranged from 22% to 73%, with a median reduction of 36%. Because DCN to IC projections are glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito and Oliver, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oliver, 1984</xref>), and the periolivary nuclei and nuclei of the lateral lemniscus, the sources of ascending GABAergic input to the IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">González-Hernández et al., 1996</xref>), were not present in the brain slice, this inhibition must be due to DCN afferents activating a local feedforward inhibitory circuit within the IC. The latency to the IPSP onset also supports the theory of a disynaptic, local inhibitory circuit, as the IPSP always succeeded the initial EPSP. Thus, these results indicate that ascending input from the DCN activates a feedforward inhibitory circuit within the IC and that this circuit regulates the duration of DCN-evoked excitation in ICc VIP neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>By combining molecular genetics with physiological and anatomical approaches, we identified VIP neurons as a novel class of glutamatergic principal neurons in the auditory midbrain. In contrast to the diverse properties present in the broader population of IC neurons, VIP neurons consistently exhibited sustained firing patterns, spiny dendrites, and stellate morphology. Surprisingly, the identification of VIP neurons revealed that a molecularly-defined class of IC neurons can broadcast the output of the IC to multiple auditory and non-auditory brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). The identification of VIP neurons also enabled us to identify microcircuit motifs within the IC. In particular, we found that VIP neurons receive ascending input from the contralateral DCN and commissural input from the contralateral IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). That VIP neurons receive input from the DCN was consistent with the distribution of VIP neurons in the ICc, which was biased toward more caudal regions where DCN afferents are prominent. Input from the DCN also drove feedforward inhibition that could sculpt the effects of excitatory inputs to VIP neurons. Thus, feedforward inhibitory circuits within the IC may regulate the temporal summation of ascending inputs. By integrating multiple sources of input and participating in most of the major projections from the IC, VIP neurons are well-positioned to broadly influence auditory computations in numerous brain regions.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43770.019</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Summary of inputs and projection targets of VIP neurons in mouse IC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Summary of the major projection targets of VIP neurons identified by axonal tract tracing: MGB (medial geniculate body), SC (superior colliculus), contralateral IC, PAG (periaqueductal gray), SOC (superior olivary complex).

VIP neurons share a common set of molecular, neurochemical, morphological, and physiological features. VIP neurons are labeled in the VIP-IRES-Cre mouse line and are glutamatergic.

Tonotopic variation in the intrinsic physiology of VIP neurons was consistent with VIP neurons having faster membrane properties and therefore better temporal coding potential in lower frequency regions of the ICc. This parallels an in vivo study that found a gradient in the temporal coding capacity of cat ICc neurons that varied from better temporal coding in low frequency regions to worse temporal coding in high frequency regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rodríguez et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that it would not be possible to identify VIP neurons based on their morphology or physiology alone.

We propose that a multidimensional approach incorporating molecular markers will be essential to identifying the remaining neuron classes in the IC.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Diverse projection patterns of VIP neurons</title><p>We found that VIP neurons project not only to MGB and contralateral IC, the most common recipients of IC projections, but also to the nucleus of the brachium of the IC, superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray, superior olivary complex, and ipsilateral IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The number of extrinsic targets reached by VIP axons was a surprise given the relatively small population of VIP neurons. Do individual VIP neurons project to multiple targets? Previous retrograde labeling studies suggest that some patterns of collateral projection are more common than others for IC cells. IC cells that project to the contralateral thalamus appear to quite commonly have a collateral projection to the ipsilateral thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mellott et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, very few IC neurons project to the thalamus and the cochlear nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coomes and Schofield, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hashikawa and Kawamura, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Okoyama et al., 2006</xref>), or to the left and right cochlear nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schofield, 2001</xref>). Whether IC commissural cells can have collateral projections to the thalamus has been supported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">González-Hernández et al., 1996</xref>) or denied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Okoyama et al., 2006</xref>). Because retrograde tracing studies underestimate collateral projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schofield et al., 2007</xref>), such studies may have missed VIP neurons with collateral projections.</p><p>Alternatively, individual VIP neurons might project to one or a few targets. It would then be possible to subdivide VIP neurons based on their axonal projections. This would parallel the cerebral cortex, where the major classes of interneurons contain subclasses that often differ in their axonal targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). If such is the case, then the unifying feature of VIP neurons might be that they perform similar computational roles within circuits, even when the circuits themselves are involved in different functions. In any event, the axonal projection patterns of individual VIP neurons, to extrinsic targets and within the IC, will be important features for further characterizing VIP subclasses and their functional roles.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Integration of synaptic input by VIP neurons</title><p>Our results show that VIP neurons receive input from at least four sources: principal neurons in the DCN, local inhibitory neurons, and excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the contralateral IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). In multiple instances, we observed that VIP neurons received input from the DCN and a local inhibitory neuron or a combination of excitatory and inhibitory commissural input. Given that optogenetic circuit mapping experiments underestimate connection probabilities (not all synapses are transfected by the virus), these results suggest that many individual VIP neurons integrate input from ascending, local, and commissural sources. This is consistent with previous studies showing that individual IC neurons can integrate input from numerous sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito and Oliver, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Excitatory postsynaptic responses in IC neurons often involve activation of NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wu et al., 2004</xref>). Under in vivo conditions, the activation of NMDA receptors can influence how IC neurons respond to tones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sanchez et al., 2007</xref>). In VIP neurons, we found that excitatory commissural synapses activated AMPA and NMDA receptors, while synaptic input from DCN afferents activated only AMPA receptors. The activation of NMDA receptors occurred even though our ACSF contained 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and neurons were at their resting membrane potential. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that NMDA receptors in some IC neurons can be activated under similar conditions, even when AMPA are receptors blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sivaramakrishnan and Oliver, 2006</xref>). The activation of NMDA receptors in our recordings may indicate that excitatory commissural synapses tend to be located on the distal dendrites or dendritic spines of VIP neurons, where the local membrane potential might be sufficiently depolarized by activation of AMPA receptors to remove Mg<sup>2+</sup> block of NMDA receptors. A distal location would be consistent with the proposed modulatory role for commissural inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Orton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Orton and Rees, 2014</xref>). Similarly, the lack of NMDA receptor activation by DCN afferents might indicate that DCN synapses are located on proximal dendrites or possibly on the soma itself, or that these synapses lack NMDA receptors. These synaptic arrangements may have important implications for auditory coding and synaptic plasticity mechanisms in VIP neurons.</p><p>In many brain regions, feedforward inhibitory circuits control the time window for temporal integration of synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gabernet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pouille and Scanziani, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Stokes and Isaacson, 2010</xref>). In the ICc, it was recently shown that GABAergic neurons provide local inhibitory input mainly to neurons in the same isofrequency lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sturm et al., 2014</xref>). However, the conditions that recruit local inhibition have remained unclear. Our data provide direct evidence that activation of DCN afferents can elicit both direct excitatory input and disynaptic feedforward inhibition to VIP neurons. Feedforward inhibition can dramatically reduce EPSP halfwidth, suggesting that local feedforward inhibition regulates the temporal summation of synaptic inputs. In addition, while DCN afferents elicited modest EPSPs in VIP neurons, DCN input presumably drove spiking in the GABAergic neurons that provided feedforward inhibition. It will be important for future studies to identify this population of GABAergic neurons and the extent of their influence on auditory computations in VIP and other IC neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The distribution and sources of input to VIP neurons suggest they specialize in monaural processing</title><p>Ascending projections from most auditory brainstem nuclei restrict their synapses to subregions of the ICc, dividing the ICc into functional zones that may be specialized for processing specific classes of auditory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brunso-Bechtold et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cant, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cant and Benson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loftus et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Oliver, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oliver et al., 1997</xref>). We found that VIP neurons in the ICc were distributed with a significant bias toward the caudal ICc (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) and a tendency to be enriched in medial and dorsal regions of the ICc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Intriguingly, this distribution overlaps with the monaural domain of the ICc, an area that predominantly receives input from monaural nuclei, including the contralateral DCN and AVCN and the ipsilateral ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cant and Benson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loftus et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, a recent study in mice showed that excitatory ICc neurons that receive input from the DCN are unlikely to receive input from other ascending auditory sources but likely to receive input from the ipsilateral auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). These results lead us to hypothesize that VIP neurons are specialized for processing monaural cues, and in particular, monaural cues from the DCN. In future studies, it will be important to determine whether ascending input to VIP neurons is predominantly from the DCN, from a combination of monaural brainstem nuclei, or from both monaural and binaural sources. It will also be important to assess whether VIP neurons receive descending input from the auditory cortex and how commissural and cortical inputs shape sound processing in VIP neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>VIP neurons might regulate the excitability of MGB and SOC neurons through VIP signaling</title><p>An important question is whether IC VIP neurons use VIP signaling to modulate the activity of their postsynaptic targets. In cerebral cortex, 99.1% of neurons labeled in the VIP-IRES-Cre mouse immunostained with an antibody against VIP, suggesting that Cre expression in the VIP-IRES-Cre mouse is well correlated with the production of VIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Prönneke et al., 2015</xref>). There is therefore a strong likelihood that VIP neurons in the IC produce VIP. VIP acts by binding to one of three G-protein coupled receptors, VPAC1, VPAC2, and PAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dickson and Finlayson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Vaudry et al., 2009</xref>). Anatomical studies suggest that all three VIP receptors are expressed in the MGB and SOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sheward et al., 1995</xref>), both of which are postsynaptic targets of VIP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Activation of VIP receptors can have significant effects on neuronal excitability. In somatosensory thalamus, activation of VIP receptors increased the activation of HCN channels, depolarizing thalamocortical neurons and inducing them to switch from burst firing to tonic firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee and Cox, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sun et al., 2003</xref>). These data suggest that IC VIP neurons may potently modulate the activity of MGB neurons and other postsynaptic target neurons through VIP signaling. Thus, VIP neurons in the IC may exert an outsize influence on their long-range postsynaptic targets.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>The Jackson <break/>Laboratory</td><td>JAX:000664</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>VIP-IRES-Cre</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>JAX:010908</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Ai14</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>JAX:007914</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-GAD67 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="bottom">Millipore</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2278725">AB_2278725</ext-link> <break/>Cat#:MAB5406</td><td>IHC (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-NeuN (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="bottom">Millipore</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10807945">AB_10807945</ext-link> <break/>Cat#:ABN78</td><td>IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-bNOS (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_260754">AB_260754</ext-link> <break/>Cat#:N2280</td><td>IHC (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (donkey polyclonal)</td><td valign="bottom">ThermoFisher</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_141607">AB_141607</ext-link> <break/>Cat#:A-21202</td><td>IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (donkey polyclonal)</td><td valign="bottom">ThermoFisher</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2535792">AB_2535792</ext-link> <break/>Cat#:A-21206</td><td>IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>AAV1.Syn.Chronos-GFP.WPRE.bGH</td><td>University of Pennsylvania Vector Core/Addgene</td><td>Addgene:59170-AAV1 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_59170">Addgene_59170</ext-link></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene:59170">http://n2t.net/addgene:59170</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>AAV1.CAG.FLEX.eGFP.WPRE.bGH</td><td>University of Pennsylvania Vector Core/Addgene</td><td>Addgene:51502-AAV1 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_51502">Addgene_51502</ext-link></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene:51502">http://n2t.net/addgene:51502</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>gabazine</td><td>Hello Bio</td><td>Cat#:HB0901</td><td>also called SR95531 hydrobromide</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>strychnine hydrochloride</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat#:S8753</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>D-AP5</td><td>Hello Bio</td><td>Cat#:HB0225</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>NBQX disodium salt</td><td>Hello Bio</td><td>Cat#:HB0443</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Igor Pro 7 and 8</td><td>Wavemetrics</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000325">SCR_000325</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MATLAB R2018a and R2018b</td><td>Mathworks</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Neurolucida</td><td>MBF Bioscience</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001775">SCR_001775</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Neurolucida 360</td><td>MBF Bioscience</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_016788">SCR_016788</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were in accordance with NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals.

PSPs were elicited with 100 µs electric shocks, ranging from 45 µA to 320 µA.</p><p>To isolate or manipulate synaptic events, the following pharmacological agents were used, all diluted in standard ACSF: 5 µM SR95531 (gabazine, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist, Hello Bio), 1 µM strychnine hydrochloride (glycine receptor antagonist, Millipore Sigma), 50 µM D-AP5 (NMDA receptor antagonist, Hello Bio), 10 µM NBQX disodium salt (AMPA receptor antagonist, Hello Bio), 1 µM TTX (voltage dependent sodium channel blocker, Hello Bio).</p><p>Data analysis was performed using custom written algorithms in Igor Pro or MATLAB (Mathworks). Statistical tests were performed in R Studio (R Studio, Boston) for R 3.5.1 (The R Project for Statistical Computing, The R Foundation).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Post hoc reconstructions of morphology and morphology analysis</title><p>After recordings, the electrode was removed slowly to allow the cell membrane to reseal, and the slice was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4) for 12 – 24 hr. Slices were then washed in 0.1 M PB and stored in 0.1 M PB for up to three weeks. Recorded neurons were stained using fluorescent biocytin-streptavidin histochemistry. In brief, slices were washed in 0.1 M PB three times for 10 min (3 × 10 min in PB), permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PB for 2 hr, washed 3 × 10 min in PB, and stained at 4 °C for 48 hr with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 or 647, diluted 1:1000 in 0.1 M PB. Slices were then washed 3 × 10 min in PB and mounted on Superfrost Plus microscope slides in anti-fade media (Fluoromount-G). Z-stack images of streptavidin-Alexa Fluor labeled cells were obtained with a Leica TCS SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope using a 1.40 NA 63x oil-immersion objective. Three-dimensional reconstructions of neuronal morphology and quantitative analyses of soma and dendrite shape were performed on image stacks imported into Neurolucida 360 (MBF Bioscience). To facilitate comparisons of neuronal morphology, all reconstructed neurons are displayed as if they were in the left IC as viewed from a caudal perspective. Reconstructions of neurons that were located in the right IC were flipped along the dorsal-ventral axis so that they appear as if they were in the left IC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Correlation of neuron location and intrinsic physiology</title><p>Following biocytin-streptavidin histochemistry, tile scan images of the entire IC were collected using a 20x objective on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope. These images were then used to determine medial-lateral and dorsal-ventral coordinates of recorded neurons. The medial-lateral coordinate was measured as the distance of the soma from the medial axis (midline) of the IC slice (x axis). The dorsal-ventral coordinate was measured as the distance of the soma from the dorsal-most edge of the IC slice (y axis). Neurons in the right IC were combined with those from the left IC by multiplying the medial-lateral coordinate of neurons from the right IC by −1. Neurons were assigned to IC subdivisions, including the central nucleus (ICc), dorsal cortex, (ICd) and lateral cortex (IClc), by comparing neuron location in 20x tile scans to IC subdivision borders determined from standard series of IC sections immunostained for bNOS or GAD67 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choy Buentello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coote and Rees, 2008</xref>). Neuron coordinates were then compared to physiological parameters obtained during whole cell recordings. To test for correlations, data were fit with a plane using the Levenberg-Marquardt least squares method in Igor Pro. Fit quality was assessed with Pearson’s correlation coefficient and the adjusted R<sup>2</sup>. Fit significance (p value) was calculated based on the chi-squared statistic from the fit and the chi-squared cumulative distribution function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Determination of major axes of neuron morphology</title><p>Neuron morphology was reconstructed as described above. To determine the ‘length’ and ‘width’ axes of the dendritic arbors, the set of coordinates describing the morphology of the dendritic arbor of each neuron was exported from Neurolucida 360 (MBF Bioscience). Coordinates were imported to Igor Pro, where principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on either the x and y coordinates (2D PCA) or the x, y, and z coordinates (3D PCA). The orientation of the length and width axes was then derived from the first and second principal directions of the resulting eigenvector matrices. 2D PCA was used to determine the orientation of neurons within the coronal plane. 3D PCA was used to determine the axes to use for measuring dendritic arbor length/width ratios. For this, the spread of the dendritic arbor along the first and second principal directions was determined by rotating each morphology coordinate set according to its eigenvector matrix, then calculating the range from the minimum to maximum coordinates along the x (length, first principal direction) and y (width, second principal direction) axes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Intracranial virus injections</title><p>Intracranial virus injections were performed on mice age P21 – P35 using standard aseptic techniques. Throughout the procedure, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and their body temperature maintained with a homeothermic heating pad. An injection of the analgesic carprofen (5 mg/kg, CarproJect, Henry Schein Animal Health) was delivered subcutaneously. The scalp was shaved and a rostro-caudal incision was made along the midline to expose the skull. Injection sites were mapped using stereotaxic coordinates relative to the lambda suture. A single craniotomy was performed using a micromotor drill (K.1050, Foredom Electric Co.) with a 0.5 mm burr (Fine Science Tools).</p><p>Viral constructs were injected with a NanoJect III nanoliter injector (Drummond Scientific Company) connected to a MP-285 micromanipulator (Sutter Instruments). Glass injection pipettes were prepared by pulling capillary glass (Drummond Scientific Company) with a P-1000 microelectrode puller (Sutter Instrument). The injector tip was cut to an opening of ~20 µm and beveled at 30° with a BV-10 pipette beveller (Sutter Instrument). Injectors were back-filled with mineral oil and then front-filled with virus. AAV1.Syn.Chronos-GFP.WPRE.bGH (University of Pennsylvania Vector Core, Lot# CS1027L, 2.986e13 genome copies (GC)/ml) was used for CRACM experiments. AAV1.CAG.FLEX.eGFP.WPRE.bGH (Allen Institute 854, University of Pennsylvania Vector Core, Lot# CS0922, 4.65e13 GC/ml) was used for axonal tract tracing. For CRACM experiments, the IC was injected via two penetrations. Virus deposits were made at 250 µm intervals along the dorsal-ventral axis, resulting in four deposits in penetration one and three deposits in penetration 2. At each depth, 20 nl of virus was deposited, resulting in seven virus deposits and a total load of 140 nl virus per injected IC. DCN injections were limited to two deposits of 20 nl virus. For axonal tracing studies, viral load was reduced to 40 nl total (20 nl per site) to achieve sparser labeling of neurons. Injections were made at the coordinates shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>.</p><p>After injections were completed, the scalp was sutured with Ethilon 6–0 (0.7 metric) nylon sutures (Ethicon USA LLC), and the wound was treated with 0.5 – 1 ml 2% Lidocaine hydrochloride jelly (Akorn Inc). Once mice were ambulatory, they were returned to the vivarium where they were monitored daily until sutures fell out and the wound was completely healed.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43770.020</object-id><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Stereotaxic coordinates for virus injections.

For standard CRACM experiments, recordings were targeted to VIP neurons. In additional control experiments, recordings were targeted to non-fluorescent IC neurons in VIP-IRES-Cre x Ai14 crosses. During whole cell recordings, Chronos was activated by brief pulses of 470 nm light emitted by a blue LED coupled to the epi-fluorescence port of the microscope and delivered to the brain slice through a 0.80 NA 40x water immersion objective with a field number of 26.5 mm. Accordingly, the blue light spot had an area of 0.345 mm<sup>2</sup>. In all CRACM experiments, the soma of the recorded neuron was present in the field of view. Blue light flashes were 2 to 5 ms long, illuminated the entire field of a 0.80 NA 40x objective, and yielded optical power densities that ranged from 6 to 48 mW/mm². Optical power was set using a minimal stimulation protocol. In general, the shortest stimulus duration that elicited a PSP was chosen, combined with 120% of the optical power that was determined as the threshold to elicit PSPs. Yet, when using a 5 ms pulse with maximum optical power, EPSP kinetics did not change significantly (8 of 8 recorded neurons, data not shown) compared to the minimal stimulation paradigm. This suggests that light pulses elicited action potentials with consistent durations, regardless of optical power. Recording sweeps with light flashes were repeated 20 to 50 times in 0.5 – 1 s intervals to obtain average PSP values. During experiments to investigate receptor contribution to PSPs, drugs were washed in for at least 10 min before recording under the new condition. For each receptor antagonist, 7 – 8 washout experiments were conducted. In each case, drug effects reversed after washout (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Axonal projections</title><p>The right IC of VIP-IRES-Cre x Ai14 mice was injected with AAV1.CAG.FLEX.eGFP.WPRE.bGH and transcardially perfused 3 – 4 weeks later, as described above. Brains were frozen and sectioned at 40 µm on a sliding microtome. For some brains, sections were collected serially, and for others, sections were collected in three series. The brains were examined for eGFP-labeled axons and boutons, which were interpreted as VIP<sup>+</sup> projections originating in the IC. Some sections were counterstained with a fluorescent Nissl stain (Neurotrace 640/660, ThermoFisher, cat# N21483). Injection sites comprised a collection of eGFP-labeled cell bodies. Cases were included for analysis only if the eGFP labeled cell bodies were restricted to the IC. Images were collected on a Zeiss AxioImager.Z2 microscope. High magnification images were collected as z-stacks using a 1.40 NA 63X oil-immersion objective and structured illumination (Zeiss Apotome 2) for optical sectioning at 0.5 µm intervals. Images shown are maximum projections of collected stacks. Adobe Photoshop was used to colorize images, to globally adjust levels, and to add scale bars.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Gabriel Corfas and Carol F Elias for helpful discussions and advice.

In this study, the authors take advantage of molecular markers in mice to identify vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons in the central nucleus of the IC and utilize an impressive number of methods to characterize their morphology, intrinsic membrane properties, and circuitry. They show convincingly that the VIP neurons are spiny stellate glutamatergic neurons and, as a class, project to many targets of the IC. Furthermore, these neurons show sustained firing and receive mixed inputs from the contralateral IC and a direct excitatory projection from the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), followed by feedforward inhibitory inputs. Although the function of the VIP neurons is unclear from the data presented, this study provides an important contribution to our understanding of the neural subtypes in the inferior colliculus, with the VIP-cre line to be a highly useful tool to dissect auditory processing within this complex midbrain structure.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper references the recent Chen et al., 2018, manuscript. Does the current study reveal any connectional differences with the broader population of glutamatergic neurons, particularly across subdivisions of the inferior colliculus? For the CRACM experiments, the reviewers were concerned that no recordings are presented from non-VIP labeled neurons. A comparison of VIP vs non-VIP neurons, as was performed for the intrinsic physiology, would help strengthen the argument for differences between them. If this is because of technical difficulties associated with combining these recordings with optogenetic stimulation, you should test the commissural IC connections of VIP versus non-VIP neurons using conventional electrical stimulation and an in vitro commissural slice preparation (e.g. Lee et al., 2015, Hear Res).</p><p>2) The localization of the VIP neurons within the IC is interesting but raises some issues with the analysis. The images in Figure 1 show that the concentration of VIP neurons in the dorsomedial and caudal central nucleus is much higher than in other regions of IC. This suggests a distribution of VIP cells that is perpendicular to the tonotopic map, with a single isofrequency lamina comprising one region where VIP neurons are present and another where VIP neurons are sparse. A number of studies in different species have suggested similar differences in innervation from different regions of the brainstem. For example, when the distribution of inputs from dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) and the lateral superior olive (LSO) are compared in the cat, the DCN axons extend the full length of the lamina, including the dorsomedial part of the central nucleus, while the LSO inputs are restricted to the ventrolateral part of the lamina. Because of the uneven distribution of the VIP neurons, pooling all parts of the IC in the density measurements to determine the percentage of VIP that are glutamatergic and the percentage of IC neurons that are VIP positive is not a good approach (subsection “VIP neurons are glutamatergic and represent 1.8% of IC neurons”). The distribution of the VIP cells across the IC should be mapped and reported, and examined in relation to the location of specific IC inputs. This should help to strengthen conclusions about the possible role of the VIP neurons in auditory processing. This is also a potential problem with the percentages of neurons with different intrinsic properties (subsection “VIP neurons exhibit sustained firing patterns and their intrinsic physiology varies along the tonotopic axis of the ICc”).</p><p>3) Both the contralateral DCN and the contralateral IC are major sources of input to gerbil IC neurons (Nordeen et al., 1983; Moore et al., 1998), so it is perhaps not so surprising that this is true for mouse VIP neurons as well. Sustained firing is the most common firing pattern. The projections of the VIP neurons are investigated and documented in insufficient detail to tell whether these are special compared to other IC neurons. Overall, it seems that VIP neurons are an uncommon neuron type (&lt;2%) with rather common properties, and, based on the present results, it is therefore not straightforward to infer their unique contribution to auditory processing by the IC. This needs to be addressed, including through the approaches suggested above.</p><p>4) The authors make the advantages of the optogenetic approach in Figure 7 over simple electrical stimulation insufficiently clear. As there is no selectivity in the labelling and little or no selectivity in the activation, what is the added value for activating the contralateral projections? The optogenetic approach also has disadvantages, e.g. how meaningful is an EPSP rise time of 4.2 ms for a 2-5 ms pulse of light? It seems that a minimal stimulation protocol was used (subsection “Channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping”), but without more details on the criteria to set duration and intensity, it is hard to assess whether the PSP kinetics are meaningful. As a minimum, more details are required to assure us that release was driven by action potentials (or if this is not possible do the TTX control).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43770.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper references the recent Chen et al., 2018, manuscript.

Chen et al. reported little or no correlation among the glutamatergic ICc neurons receiving input from the contralateral DCN and those receiving input from the contralateral IC (Pearson’s r ≈ 0 [green color], their Figure 6B). Our data suggest that VIP neurons in the ICc are highly likely to receive input from the contralateral DCN (76% – 19 of 25 tested neurons), and moderately likely to receive input from the contralateral IC (50% of tested neurons received inhibitory input from the contralateral IC; 41% of tested neurons received excitatory input from the contralateral IC). We therefore do not think our results argue strongly for or against differences relative to the Chen et al. study. In addition, we feel that an examination of the sources of synaptic input to VIP neurons in ICd and IClc are beyond the scope of the present study but are important issues we will pursue in future work.</p><p>In the context of Essential Revision 2, we now address the Chen et al. results in more detail in the Discussion, subsection “The distribution and sources of input to VIP neurons suggest they specialize in monaural processing”. The Chen et al. study reported that excitatory ICc neurons receiving DCN input clustered away from other excitatory neurons and were unlikely to receive input from other ascending auditory sources (their Figure 6B; correlations near or less than zero). These results suggest that the main source of ascending auditory input to VIP neurons may be from the DCN.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the CRACM experiments, the reviewers were concerned that no recordings are presented from non-VIP labeled neurons.

Results of this experiment are shown in Figure 8F and detailed in the Results section, paragraph five of subsection “VIP neurons in the ICc receive synaptic input from the DCN”. In recordings from 12 non-VIP neurons, 8 received synaptic input from the DCN. In these neurons, the amplitude and kinetics of light-evoked EPSPs did not significantly differ from EPSPs recorded from VIP neurons. However, the halfwidths and decay time constants of EPSPs recorded from non-VIP neurons were more variable, suggesting that properties of DCN input to VIP neurons tend to be more homogenous, as might be expected for synaptic input to a defined population of neurons. Interestingly, the amplitude of DCN-evoked EPSPs was remarkably similar among VIP and non-VIP neurons (with the exception of one outlier in the VIP group). This might suggest that DCN synapses exert similar influence across their postsynaptic targets in the ICc.</p><p>A number of previous studies have examined the synaptic physiology of commissural inputs to unidentified neuron types in the IC. For example:</p><p>Reetz G, Ehret G. 1999. Inputs from three brainstem sources to identified neurons of the mouse inferior colliculus slice. Brain Res 816:527–543.</p><p>Moore DR, Kotak VC, Sanes DH. 1998. Commissural and lemniscal synaptic input to the gerbil inferior colliculus. J Neurophysiol 80:2229–2236.</p><p>Vale C, Sanes DH. 2002.

Eur J Neurosci 20:2133–2140. doi:10.1111/j.1460-9568.2004.03679.x</p><p>In particular, Moore et al. found that most IC neurons receive synaptic input from the contralateral IC, and they showed that these commissural inputs varied in their synaptic physiology. They further concluded that they were “unable to detect a relationship between dendritic architecture and synaptic input.” Because of these studies, we do not think it would be particularly informative to use CRACM to test the properties of commissural EPSPs and IPSPs onto non-VIP neurons. In general, we would expect to find results similar to those observed for the DCN CRACM experiment; namely that PSPs recorded from non-VIP neurons would have overlapping but more diverse kinetics compared to those recorded from VIP neurons. Overall, based on our results and previous studies from the IC and other brain regions, we think it unlikely that the properties of synaptic input to a specific neuron class will be a defining feature of that neuron class.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The localization of the VIP neurons within the IC is interesting but raises some issues with the analysis.

A number of studies in different species have suggested similar differences in innervation from different regions of the brainstem. For example, when the distribution of inputs from dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) and the lateral superior olive (LSO) are compared in the cat, the DCN axons extend the full length of the lamina, including the dorsomedial part of the central nucleus, while the LSO inputs are restricted to the ventrolateral part of the lamina. Because of the uneven distribution of the VIP neurons, pooling all parts of the IC in the density measurements to determine the percentage of VIP that are glutamatergic and the percentage of IC neurons that are VIP positive is not a good approach (subsection “VIP neurons are glutamatergic and represent 1.8% of IC neurons”). The distribution of the VIP cells across the IC should be mapped and reported, and examined in relation to the location of specific IC inputs. This should help to strengthen conclusions about the possible role of the VIP neurons in auditory processing. This is also a potential problem with the percentages of neurons with different intrinsic properties (subsection “VIP neurons exhibit sustained firing patterns and their intrinsic physiology varies along the tonotopic axis of the ICc”).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that pooling VIP neurons from across IC subdivisions obscured underlying patterns in the VIP neuron distribution. To address this concern, we repeated the stereological analysis of VIP neuron density in IC sections. Data were prepared from two new VIP-IRES-Cre x Ai14 mice. Sections from these mice were stained with NeuN and anti-bNOS, the latter enabling us to differentiate the ICc from IC shell regions (Coote and Rees, 2008). The results of this experiment are shown in Table 2 and described in the Results, paragraphs twp and three of subsection “VIP neurons are glutamatergic and represent 3.5% of ICc neurons”. Note that previous results were discarded because tissue from that experiment was not stained for bNOS. However, the overall prevalence of VIP neurons in the IC was similar between the previous and new data sets (1.8 ± 0.3% in the previous data set versus 2.3 ± 0.3% in the new data set).</p><p>The results shown in Table 1 demonstrated that out of 793 tdTomato+ VIP neurons, only 10 (1.3%) stained with the antibody against GAD67. There was no apparent pattern to the distribution of the 10 tdTomato+ neurons that stained for GAD67, and we suspect these neurons were non-specifically labeled or represent rare instances where tdTomato was ectopically expressed (i.e. non-VIP neurons that had a low level of Cre expression at some point during development). Overall, we believe our data strongly support the conclusion that VIP neurons are glutamatergic across all subdivisions and regions of the IC.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out that the functional domain hypothesis might explain the distribution of VIP neurons in the ICc. This is a very important point and one that we believe significantly increases the impact of our study. We have added text to the Introduction (fourth paragraph), Results (paragraph three of subsection “VIP neurons are glutamatergic and represent 3.5% of ICc neurons”), and Discussion (paragraph one and subsection “The distribution and sources of input to VIP neurons suggest they specialize in monaural processing”) to indicate that the distribution of VIP neurons suggests they may belong to the set of monaural neurons that mainly receive input from the cochlear nucleus and VNLL and not from the superior olivary complex (Group 2 in Cant and Benson, 2006; Cluster 1 in Loftus et al., 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Both the contralateral DCN and the contralateral IC are major sources of input to gerbil IC neurons (Nordeen et al., 1983; Moore et al., 1998), so it is perhaps not so surprising that this is true for mouse VIP neurons as well. Sustained firing is the most common firing pattern. The projections of the VIP neurons are investigated and documented in insufficient detail to tell whether these are special compared to other IC neurons. Overall, it seems that VIP neurons are an uncommon neuron type (&lt;2%) with rather common properties, and, based on the present results, it is therefore not straightforward to infer their unique contribution to auditory processing by the IC. This needs to be addressed, including through the approaches suggested above.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that addressing reviewer concerns has resulted in a manuscript that much better highlights the potential functional significance of VIP neurons. Here, in list form, we summarize several of the features of VIP neurons that are now directly addressed in the revised manuscript. We believe these features strongly suggest that VIP neurons play influential roles in auditory processing:</p><p>• By reassessing the density of VIP neurons with respect to IC subdivision boundaries, we found that VIP neurons represent 3.5% of ICc neurons. Since it is estimated that 15 – 20% of ICc neurons are stellate neurons, VIP neurons represent ~18 – 23% of ICc stellate neurons. Thus, VIP neurons encompass a significant percentage of the overall population of ICc stellate neurons. For reference, VIP neurons account for ~13% of inhibitory interneurons in cerebral cortex (Pronekke et al., 2015), but powerfully shape the function and output of cortical circuits (e.g. Pi et al., 2013; Garcia-Junco-Clemente et al., 2017, doi: 10.1038/nn.4483). We think the same is likely to hold true for VIP neurons in the IC.</p><p>• The asymmetrical distribution of VIP neurons in the ICc indicates that VIP neurons are present at highest densities in regions of the ICc that mainly receive monaural input, i.e. input from the DCN, AVCN, and VNLL, but not the LSO. This suggests that VIP neurons may play a specialized role in the processing of monaural stimuli. Furthermore, the Chen et al., 2018 study showed that excitatory ICc neurons that receive input from the DCN form a unique cluster of neurons that are relatively unlikely to receive input from other ascending auditory sources. We therefore propose that VIP neurons may play a critical role processing the output of the DCN.</p><p>• VIP receptors are present in the MGB and the SOC, both of which are postsynaptic targets of VIP neurons. Previous studies show that VIP receptors can powerfully influence the output of thalamocortical neurons. These results suggest that IC VIP neurons may exert outsize influence on their postsynaptic targets through activation of VIP signaling pathways.</p><p>• Almost nothing is known about the functional roles of ICc stellate neurons under in vivo conditions. This is largely because it has previously not been possible to target in vivo recordings to stellate neurons. The identification of VIP neurons in the IC and the existence of a mouse line that allows selective manipulation of VIP neurons (i.e. VIP-IRES-CRE mice) mean that our study positions the field for the first time to directly investigate the role of ICc stellate neurons in auditory processing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors make the advantages of the optogenetic approach in Figure 7 over simple electrical stimulation insufficiently clear. As there is no selectivity in the labelling and little or no selectivity in the activation, what is the added value for activating the contralateral projections?</p></disp-quote><p>We suspect that electrical stimulation of commissural axons is just as likely to activate axons originating from the IC ipsilateral to the recording site as it is to activate the desired population of axons originating from the contralateral IC. Since most IC neurons have local axon collaterals, antidromic spikes in commissural axons could easily lead to synaptic events driven by ipsilateral neurons. In addition, the commissure contains axons that originate outside the IC; these axons could also be activated by electrical stimulation of the commissure. The optogenetic approach has a distinct advantage over electrical stimulation because we can verify that the viral transfection led to expression of Chronos only in neurons on one side of the IC (in our case the right IC, contralateral to the recording site in the left IC). Because of this, optical stimulation provides a cleaner data set for investigating commissural input because it prevents contamination from local, ipsilateral inputs or from extra-collicular inputs, which may have very different physiological properties. We added text detailing this rationale to the Results, subsection “VIP neurons in the ICc receive excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input from the contralateral IC”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The optogenetic approach also has disadvantages, e.g. how meaningful is an EPSP rise time of 4.2 ms for a 2-5 ms pulse of light? It seems that a minimal stimulation protocol was used (subsection “Channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping”), but without more details on the criteria to set duration and intensity, it is hard to assess whether the PSP kinetics are meaningful. As a minimum, more details are required to assure us that release was driven by action potentials (or if this is not possible do the TTX control).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that optogenetic stimulation can distort the kinetics of PSPs. This is one of the reasons we work with Chronos, which has much faster activation kinetics than ChR2, and which therefore may increase the probability of Chronos eliciting action potential-driven synaptic release (Klapoetke et al., 2014). We now state this concern in the Results, paragraph six of subsection “VIP neurons in the ICc receive excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input from the contralateral IC”. We also performed additional experiments to address this concern. First, we directly compared the kinetics of light-evoked and electrically-evoked commissural PSPs, finding relatively small differences between the two. Second, we added a TTX control to the DCN CRACM experiment. We found that TTX completely abolished light-evoked EPSPs in 3 out of 3 VIP neurons (Results, paragraph four of subsection “VIP neurons in the ICc receive synaptic input from the DCN”). This suggests that optogenetic stimulation drove spike-mediated synaptic release, as opposed to directly depolarizing synaptic terminals. Third, we added additional details about the minimal stimulation paradigm to the Materials and methods, subsection “Channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping”. Interestingly, although we always used the minimal light intensity and duration needed to elicit a PSP, we found that increasing light duration to 5 ms and using the maximal light intensity possible with our equipment (48 mW/mm2) did not significantly alter the kinetics of light-evoked EPSPs. Together, these results suggest that the PSP kinetics we observed with optogenetic stimulation are reasonable approximations of the PSP kinetics that exist under physiological conditions. Nonetheless, we hope that the improved clarity about the possible shortcomings of optogenetic stimulation make it easy for readers to make their own assessment of the data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
