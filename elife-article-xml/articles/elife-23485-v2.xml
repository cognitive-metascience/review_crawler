After erythrocyte invasion, the intracellular pathogen must increase host cell uptake of nutrients from plasma. Here, we report that the parasite-encoded RhopH complex contributes to both invasion and channel-mediated nutrient uptake. As <italic>rhoph2</italic> and <italic>rhoph3</italic> gene knockouts were not viable in the human <italic>P. falciparum</italic> pathogen, we used conditional knockdowns to determine that the encoded proteins are essential and to identify their stage-specific functions. We exclude presumed roles for RhopH2 and CLAG3 in erythrocyte invasion but implicate a RhopH3 contribution either through ligand-receptor interactions or subsequent parasite internalization. These proteins then traffic via an export translocon to the host membrane, where they form a nutrient channel. Knockdown of either RhopH2 or RhopH3 disrupts the entire complex, interfering with organellar targeting and subsequent trafficking. Therapies targeting this complex should attack the pathogen at two critical points in its cycle.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23485.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23485.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23485.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The parasites that cause malaria in humans and other animals infect and live inside red blood cells to escape attack by their hosts’ immune systems. Malaria parasites grow and multiply in red blood cells before bursting out and invading new red blood cells. To fuel this growth, the parasite needs access to sugars and other nutrients that are found outside in the bloodstream. Malaria parasites achieve this by inserting some of their own proteins into the membrane of the red blood cell to form an unusual channel that allows the nutrients to enter the cell.</p><p>A parasite protein called CLAG3 (also known as RhopH1) is involved in formation of the unusual nutrient channel. Unlike most other proteins, malaria parasites make the CLAG3 protein while they are inside one cell and release it later when they invade a new red blood cell. The CLAG3 protein also binds to two other parasite proteins, called RhopH2 and RhopH3, to form a larger protein complex. However, it was not known what roles these other proteins played, or why the complex was made in the preceding red blood cell.</p><p>Ito et al. have now addressed these unknowns by editing the genes of the parasite that causes the most dangerous form of malaria in people, a parasite called <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. These experiments revealed that the parasites could still invade host cells as normal if they lost CLAG3 and RhopH2. This suggests, that contrary to what was expected, CLAG3 and RhopH2 are not needed for the invasion process. Instead, the experiments revealed that RhopH3 serves a major role in invasion, either by helping the parasite to interact with or enter the new red blood cell. After the parasite has invaded the cell, this complex of three proteins is shuttled to the red blood cell’s membrane, where it inserts to help form the nutrient channel.</p><p>The findings of Ito et al. reveal that one protein complex serves two unrelated but essential roles at different locations and time points in the life cycle of a malaria parasite. Since a parasite will not survive if it cannot enter a host cell and obtain nutrients, interfering with these processes by targeting this protein complex could lead to new therapies against malaria in the future.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23485.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23485.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>plasmodial surface anion channel</kwd><kwd>nutrient uptake</kwd><kwd>erythrocyte</kwd><kwd>merozoite invasion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006492</institution-id><institution>Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Support</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ito</surname><given-names>Daisuke</given-names></name><name><surname>Schureck</surname><given-names>Marc A</given-names></name><name><surname>Desai</surname><given-names>Sanjay A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gene knockdowns reveal that the conserved RhopH protein complex functions in both host cell invasion and channel-mediated nutrient uptake in malaria.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria parasites are sophisticated single-celled organisms that infect erythrocytes of many vertebrate animals; in humans, the virulent <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> pathogen remains a public health priority because of high mortality rates and global economic costs. These parasites have evolved novel proteins, some of which form multi-subunit complexes, to mediate host cell invasion and to enable intracellular survival.</p><p>One multi-protein complex, the RhopH complex, was identified in early proteomic studies of invasive merozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Campbell et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holder et al., 1985</xref>), but remains poorly characterized. Its name recognizes that it is a high-molecular weight complex localizing to rhoptries, which are specialized organelles at the apical end of the merozoite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holder et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cooper et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaneko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ling et al., 2003</xref>). Each of the three member proteins, termed CLAG (or RhopH1), RhopH2, and RhopH3, are synthesized in mature intracellular parasites known as schizonts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaneko et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2005</xref>). Upon egress, these proteins are secreted, along with other rhoptry contents, onto the erythrocyte targeted for invasion. It has therefore been assumed that the RhopH complex serves a role in invasion; because a fraction of this complex is transferred to the new host cell, another proposal has been that these proteins contribute to formation of the parasitophorous vacuole that surrounds the internalized parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaneko, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ocampo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ranjan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cortés et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, genetic mapping in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> subsequently implicated the CLAG paralogs on chromosome 3, CLAG3.1 and CLAG3.2, in the formation of the plasmodial surface anion channel (PSAC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nguitragool et al., 2011</xref>), a nutrient and ion channel at the host cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Desai et al., 2000</xref>). Subsequent studies with transport mutants and specific inhibitors have strengthened the evidence for CLAG3 and possibly CLAG2 in channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pillai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mira-Martinez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>). Although conservation of both the RhopH complex and PSAC activity in all examined <italic>Plasmodia</italic> spp. suggests a causal link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lisk and Desai, 2005</xref>), the precise contribution of these proteins to either the activation of channels or the formation of the nutrient pore is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desai, 2012</xref>). Growth defects in a reported CLAG3 knockout are consistent with a role in nutrient uptake, but could also result from the loss of other activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Comeaux et al., 2011</xref>). The multiple and seemingly conflicting proposals for the biological roles of member proteins in this complex have yet to be parsed out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the <italic>clag</italic> gene family, <italic>rhoph2</italic> and <italic>rhoph3</italic> are present as single copy genes in each <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species. The encoded RhopH2 and RhopH3 proteins remain poorly characterized. Here, we used parasite DNA transfection to edit these genes and to examine their roles throughout the parasite life cycle. Our studies show that both proteins are essential for parasite survival. RhopH3, but not RhopH2 or CLAG3, contributes to erythrocyte invasion. Because the formation and functional properties of the parasitophorous vacuole are preserved in our knockdowns, these three proteins do not appear to serve long-assumed roles in vacuole biogenesis. Instead, organic solute uptake and electrophysiological studies reveal that both RhopH2 and RhopH3 are required for successful PSAC formation; loss of channel activity leads to rapid parasite demise. These critical functions and the elaborate stage-specific trafficking we report makes the RhopH complex an attractive therapeutic target.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RhopH members are membrane-associated proteins that are transferred to erythrocytes during invasion</title><p>Each member of the RhopH complex is membrane-associated but can be partially extracted by Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> at pH 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting distinct pools are peripheral and integral to membranes.

Because each gene is transcribed and translated only within schizonts, the protein found in these maturing trophozoites reflects transfer from the merozoite during invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lustigman et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ling et al., 2004</xref>).

After invasion, each protein’s abundance remained relatively constant throughout parasite maturation from ring to trophozoite stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), consistent with biochemically stable proteins that do not undergo further synthesis until the schizont stage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CRISPR-Cas9 targeting yields knockdowns, but not knockouts</title><p>We next used transfection to explore essentiality and possible functions of RhopH2 and RhopH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Immunoblotting revealed that this treatment reduced each targeted protein to essentially undetectable levels in schizont-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This suppressor had no effect on RAP1, an unrelated membrane-associated rhoptry protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baldi et al., 2000</xref>), or on these proteins in untransfected parasites, indicating specific action at the introduced <italic>glmS</italic> riboswitch.</p><p>Remarkably, GlcN treatment of either <italic>R2glmS</italic> or <italic>R3glmS</italic> abolished not only the targeted gene product but also CLAG3, a third better-characterized member of the RhopH complex. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed this surprising finding and provided additional insights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). While RhopH2 was still detected in the <italic>R3glmS</italic> knockdown, it did not fully colocalize with RAP1 but instead had a more diffuse distribution; this suggests that RhopH2 may be retained in the parasite endoplasmic reticulum if it fails to interact with RhopH3. By contrast, RhopH3 appeared to traffic normally in GlcN-treated <italic>R2glmS</italic> parasites, as indicated by its apical colocalization with RAP1 in merozoites. Thus, CLAG3, RhopH2 and RhopH3 assemble into a complex either during or immediately after translation. RhopH3 reaches rhoptries in the absence of RhopH2, but the other two components are either rendered unstable or mis-trafficked in each knockdown. The unchanged intensity and distribution of RAP1 in both knockdowns excludes essential roles of RhopH2 or RhopH3 in trafficking unassociated proteins or in rhoptry formation.</p><p>Previous studies have reported erythrocyte binding for each RhopH complex member and have proposed roles in host cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sam-Yellowe, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ocampo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldwin et al., 2014</xref>). While RhopH3 antibodies also inhibit invasion, this protein's interactions with other RhopH members and possibly with other ligands prevent clear assignment of invasion roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ranjan et al., 2011</xref>). Interpretation is also complicated by antibody cross-reactivity, a well-established problem for parasite antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holmquist et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Udomsangpetch et al., 1989</xref>). We therefore examined the effect of knockdowns on this critical process. Dose-response studies revealed that GlcN had no measurable effect on egress and erythrocyte invasion by wild-type or <italic>R2glmS</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Because the <italic>R2glmS</italic> knockdown co-depletes both RhopH2 and CLAG3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>), fully preserved invasion in this parasite definitively refutes proposals that either of these proteins contributes to egress or invasion.</p><p>By contrast, <italic>R3glmS</italic> exhibited a dose-dependent effect on invasion, with 4 mM GlcN decreasing the number of ring-infected cells by 52% ± 3.0% (p=0.002, n = 3). This invasion defect did not result from failed maturation or reduced merozoite number because RAP1 labeling indicated that these were not compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Giemsa staining revealed extracellular merozoites (red arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), excluding effects on host cell rupture or merozoite egress. These findings restrict RhopH3’s precise contribution to a role in either host cell interaction or subsequent parasite internalization. Notably, the observed CLAG3 co-depletion mandated examination of both knockdowns and the serendipitously intact RhopH3 trafficking in <italic>R2glmS</italic> to exclude contributions from RhopH2 and CLAG3, and to determine that RhopH3 is the sole member participating in invasion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Subsequent transfer to new host cells requires an intact complex</title><p>We continued cultivation of GlcN-induced knockdowns and observed that these parasites progressed normally to the next trophozoite stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Interestingly, even RhopH3, which retained its rhoptry trafficking and invasion-associated functions in the RhopH2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>), failed to transfer to new erythrocytes in GlcN-treated <italic>R2glmS</italic>. As GlcN was without effect in untransfected parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), these findings indicate that these proteins require interactions with their cognate partners for successful transfer to the next erythrocyte at the time of invasion.

The currents on these cells corresponded to a 250- to 400-fold reduction in functional PSAC copy number, but the preserved inward-rectifying behavior suggests that the few remaining channels have unmodified unitary properties. As expected for cells with only a handful of active channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Conti and Wanke, 1975</xref>), these ensemble traces exhibited increased channel noise.

We applied a nonsaturating 1 mM GlcN during gene transcription to allow direct comparison of parasite expansion rates when nutrient availability is altered. After invasion, matched numbers of ring-stage infected cells were collected and used for cultivation without GlcN in either standard RPMI 1640-based medium containing high nutrient concentrations or PGIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pillai et al., 2012</xref>); this modified medium follows the RPMI 1640 formulation but has reduced, more physiological concentrations of key nutrients that are acquired via PSAC.

Using synchronized cultures, we removed TMP either after RhopH complex trafficking to rhoptries in late schizonts (‘LS’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) or immediately after erythrocyte invasion (early ring or ‘ER’). A second stringent synchronization prior to TMP removal ensured that this ER culture did not undergo RhopH2 destabilization until after host cell invasion (‘sync all’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Subsequent harvest at the mid-trophozoite stage revealed reduced permeability in both cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>), with a greater reduction when TMP was removed before invasion (LS). As also seen with the <italic>glmS</italic> knockdowns, TMP removal before merozoite egress led to reduced delivery of CLAG3 and RhopH3 upon invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, LS), demonstrating that RhopH complex integrity is important for faithful transfer during invasion. Importantly, TMP removal after invasion preserved CLAG3 and RhopH3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, ER). Nevertheless, these cells exhibited significantly reduced permeability (p=0.02, n=3), indicating that RhopH2 serves a role in channel formation beyond simply delivering the other RhopH components to invaded erythrocytes. The more modest effect on PSAC when TMP washout is performed after invasion may be conservatively accounted for by the relatively slow kinetics of DDD domain destabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muralidharan et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We next used protease susceptibility studies to explore whether the ER-stage knockdown compromises CLAG3 delivery and insertion at the host membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

Cultivation without TMP adversely affected the expansion of cultures within a single developmental cycle (red triangles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), indicating that any residual channel activity is insufficient to meet parasite nutrient demand. Continued cultivation without TMP for two months did not produce outgrowth of resistant parasites, revealing that changes in other host- or parasite-derived nutrient uptake mechanisms cannot compensate for the loss of the RhopH-associated channel. Restoration of TMP after two, four, or six days permitted parasite recovery with increasing lag periods (circles), consistent with an increasing fraction of irreversibly affected parasites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Proteolytic processing of RhopH3 undermines conditional knockdown</title><p>We found that the relatively weak PSAC inhibition in <italic>R3-DDD</italic> upon TMP removal results from proteolytic processing of RhopH3 near its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, arrow).

The RhopH complex appears to be secreted into the PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting that its member proteins must cross the bounding PVM to enter host cytosol and eventually reach the erythrocyte surface. Most exported proteins cross this membrane via the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> translocon of exported proteins (PTEX), but a recent study reported that CLAG3 export is unaffected by conditional knockdown of HSP101 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck et al., 2014</xref>), an essential PTEX component. As PSAC activity was curtailed in the PTEX knockdown, other exported proteins may also be required to form the nutrient channel. Using the 13F10 HSP101-DDD clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck et al., 2014</xref>), we confirmed that PTEX knockdown abolishes the development of PSAC-mediated uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and we then examined RhopH protein export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Remarkably, export of RhopH2 and of RhopH3 were both fully blocked in trophozoite-stage parasites grown for 48 hr without TMP. Colocalization with HRP2, a parasite protein carrying the canonical PEXEL export signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck et al., 2014</xref>), showed that both proteins were trapped in the vacuole upon PTEX knockdown. In contrast to the earlier study, we also found that CLAG3 export requires PTEX activity as TMP removal prevented its movement out of the PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> bottom row; colocalization with SBP1, another PTEX substrate; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck et al., 2014</xref>).

As two effective sgRNAs targeting each gene could not produce knockouts, we employed both transcription- and protein-level conditional knockdown to dissect the trafficking requirements and stage-specific roles of the least well studied components, RhopH2 and RhopH3. Our studies implicate cotranslational assembly of a complex that also contains CLAG3. Subsequent trafficking of CLAG3 and RhopH2 to rhoptries depends on the formation of a complete and stable complex, but RhopH3 can reach this organelle in isolation. Upon merozoite egress, RhopH3 alone contributes to host-cell invasion, either by contributing to ligand interactions with erythrocyte receptors or by facilitating parasite internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Fully formed complexes, but not individual components, can then be transferred to the invaded erythrocyte and deposited into the nascent PV. These proteins then utilize PTEX to access erythrocyte cytosol. Subsequent trafficking via the Maurer’s clefts, an organelle thought to facilitate onward protein export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tilley et al., 2008</xref>), eventually inserts the complex into the host membrane. At the erythrocyte surface, this complex defines PSAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), a nutrient and ion channel that accounts for long-known increases in infected cell permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Overman, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kutner et al., 1982</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23485.012</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for trafficking of the RhopH complex and its roles throughout the parasite cycle.</title><p>Cotranslational assembly of the three-member RhopH complex enables trafficking to the rhophtry (‘1’).

Early studies predicted that parasite proteins that are involved in the PSAC would be translated in ring- or trophozoite-stage parasites, just prior to the onset of solute uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kutner et al., 1982</xref>). Genetic mapping identified CLAG3 as a PSAC determinant and contradicted these predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nguitragool et al., 2011</xref>); production of CLAG3 in the prior cycle and packaging into rhoptries seemed to be inconsistent with a primary role for CLAG3 in channel formation. Molecular evidence for a RhopH3 role in erythrocyte invasion, as we now provide, suggests that this unexpectedly early synthesis and complicated trafficking evolved to enable two distinct functions at separate points in the parasite cycle. Whether the role in invasion or in nutrient uptake arose first and how the second function was added is unclear as all three members of the RhopH complex are conserved in plasmodia but have no clear orthologs in other apicomplexan parasites. The RhopH complex presumably acquired both functions early in adaption to erythrocytes as both are essential for survival in the vertebrate bloodstream.</p><p>Preserved invasion upon RhopH2 knockdown along with the fortuitous combination of aborted CLAG3 but intact RhopH3 targeting to rhoptries in the <italic>R2glmS</italic> parasite allowed us to determine that RhopH3 is the only member of the complex involved in merozoite invasion. How might loss of this protein interfere with successful erythrocyte invasion? As <italic>P. falciparum</italic> utilizes multiple receptor-ligand interactions for invasion, one possibility is that RhopH3 interacts directly with an erythrocyte receptor. A yeast-two hybrid screen and binding studies with a recombinant C-terminal fragment of RhopH3 suggest that the anion exchanger Band3 protein might be the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldwin et al., 2014</xref>), a proposal supported by the inhibitory effects of specific RhopH3 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ranjan et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, an indirect contribution of RhopH3 to ligand-receptor interactions or a role in transmembrane signaling to enable coordinated invasion remain good alternatives.</p><p>Our studies indicate that the RhopH complex is deposited into the PV upon invasion. It must then cross the PVM for trafficking onward to the host membrane. Immunofluorescence microscopy implicated the parasite-derived translocon termed PTEX in this process as all three RhopH complex members were blocked in the HSP101-DDD knockdown. Because our observations contradicted the original report involving this knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck et al., 2014</xref>), we explored whether the timing of TMP withdrawal or subsequent cell harvest and fixation could account for this discrepancy, but found that a range of withdrawal times (late trophozoite- to mature schizont-stage cultures) and harvest times (24–36 hr after egress and invasion) produced indistinguishable results (not shown). Because we were unable to address this discrepancy, we also examined PTEX dependence by looking at CLAG3 protease susceptibility, an approach that revealed quantitative failure of CLAG3 delivery to the host membrane upon PTEX knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>Exactly how the RhopH complex interacts with PTEX remains unclear. Although these proteins lack the PEXEL motif present in most exported proteins, several other PEXEL-negative proteins also utilize PTEX to reach the erythrocyte cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elsworth et al., 2016</xref>). Do all three proteins require passage through the translocon? As subsequent trafficking and insertion at the host membrane depend on an intact RhopH complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), models that require only a single RhopH protein to pass through the translocon may also yield the observed loss of export with PTEX knockdown. Is the complex disassembled by HSP101, a proposed unfoldase with an AAA+ ATPase domain, only to be reassembled after crossing the membrane? Because alkaline extraction suggests that RhopH proteins exist as both peripheral and integral membrane proteins within trophozoite-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we speculate that passage through the translocon may also serve to fold and insert transmembrane domains into the bilayer. Indeed, most integral proteins in other organisms require translocons for faithful insertion into membranes; bacterial SecYEG and eukaryotic Sec61-type translocons achieve this by allowing correctly folded proteins to exit directly into the bilayer through a lateral gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rapoport, 2007</xref>). Whether this lateral translocation of integral proteins is possible in PTEX is unknown and requires study.</p><p>We propose that interaction with PTEX deposits RhopH2 and RhopH3 at the outer surface of the PVM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This orientation is consistent with accessibility studies that found that antibodies can bind RhopH2 on the PVM but not intra-vacuolar MSP1 without detergent permeabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hiller et al., 2003</xref>). It is also consistent with subsequent export to the host membrane on exocytic vesicles, which predicts that proteins facing the host cytosol at the PVM will be endofacial when they reach the erythrocyte membrane. Immunoblotting confirms this final topology because RhopH2 and RhopH3 are not susceptible to extracellular protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Quantitative loss of host cell permeability in RhopH2 and RhopH3 knockdowns addresses two important uncertainties about nutrient and ion uptake by infected cells. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on the conditional knockdowns reported here provide evidence against the induced upregulation of human channels by the parasite: near-complete removal of RhopH-associated channels showed stochastic transitions from the handful of remaining functional PSACs but failed to uncover unrelated currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Staines et al., 2007</xref>). Non-conductive transport mechanisms such as transporters mediating electroneutral ion flux or those passing only uncharged solutes cannot be detected with patch-clamp and might still be present on infected cells; channels that are inactive under our recording conditions could also have been missed.</p><p>Although several studies have supported a CLAG3 role in PSAC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nguitragool et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pillai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mira-Martinez et al., 2013</xref>), its paucity of predicted transmembrane domains and lack of homology to known channel proteins raised doubts about whether this protein could form a pore in isolation. Stable association with two other membrane proteins and their requirement for channel activity makes the direct formation of the channel pore by the RhopH complex more plausible. This model is also supported by genetic mapping of transport inhibition by proteases to the <italic>clag3</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nguitragool et al., 2014</xref>), by an amphipathic transmembrane domain that appears to line a water-filled pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>), and by site-directed mutagenesis of critical residues that define PSAC behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>). Additional studies will be required to define the structural basis of permeation through PSAC and whether each RhopH member contributes to the pore or serves a less direct modulatory role.</p><p>Identification of a dual-function high-molecular weight complex with elaborate trafficking throughout the parasite cycle unveils a promising target for antimalarial therapies. PSAC activity is already an established drug target, validated with derivatives of a potent inhibitor and with molecular approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pillai et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2012</xref>); present studies).

Osmotic lysis half-times, normalized permeabilities, and percentage of cells refractory to osmotic lysis were determined with locally developed code.</p><p>Knockdown parasites were percoll-enriched after preincubation in percoll-sorbitol or percoll-xylitol solutions to allow efficient recovery of cells that had reduced organic solute permeabilities as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All numerical data were calculated and plotted as mean ± S.E.M. Statistical significance was calculated by unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test or one-way ANOVA.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom, Jon Clardy (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers were uncertain about the suitability of this manuscript for <italic>eLife</italic>, and after some discussion agreed on revision. A revision of your manuscript, if you should elect to pursue that path, will need to successfully address two general issues that pervade the current version of the manuscript. The first is the writing in the current version, which both reviewers found difficult to understand throughout and verging on the impenetrable on occasion. Much of this lack of clarity comes from trying to provide a comprehensive list of a lot of experiments without regard to providing a clearly discernible story line. It comes across as poorly organized, full of puzzling figures, and the occasional poorly supported claim. There is no clear and systematic definition of phenotypes and that coupled with different reverse genetic approaches contribute to the lack of clarity. Your report needs to be more focused, and you need to clearly define the contribution of the two components you focus on to the two phenotypes, invasion and nutrient uptake, involved.</p><p>Second, you need to make the article more accessible and interesting to researchers that are not familiar with (and possibly not terribly interested in) malaria. Unsupported, or unlikely statements, that your findings will contribute to therapeutic interventions, or provide a &quot;framework for the evolution of protein complexes&quot;, or provides &quot;direct molecular evidence for a RhopH complex role in parasite invasion&quot; need to be fully justified or removed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Summary: In this manuscript the authors characterize the roles of RhopH2 and RhopH3, two of the three proteins in the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> RhopH complex. They, and others, had previously demonstrated that CLAG3 (aka RhopH1) was important for solute uptake, and they tested if RhopH2 and RhopH3 also played a role in solute uptake. Additionally, other reports had implicated the RhopH complex (and in particular RhopH3) in the erythrocyte invasion, so they assessed the importance of RhopH3 and possibly of RhopH2 for invasion.</p><p>In accordance with previous studies (Baldwin 2014 and Ranjan 2011), they found that Rhop3 (and Rhop2) was important for invasion, although the studies were much more definitive for Rhop3 than Rhop2. Their studies, while not surprising, do provide important supporting information for the generally accepted model.</p><p>Their finding that both Rhop2 and Rhop3 are essential for the successful transfer of each of the RhoP proteins into a new erythrocyte host is a new finding. Their finding that Rhop2 helps form functional plasmodial surface anion channels (PSACs) is also new, although the effect of Rhop2 degradation after invasion was modest. They also report the paradoxical – in the sense that it contradicts earlier reports – result that the RhopH complex uses the PTEX transporter to leave the parasitophorous vacuole (PV). Their discussion clearly addresses but does not resolve the contradiction.</p><p>Issues to be addressed in a revision</p><p>1) The authors refer repeatedly to their use of CRISPR technology to define the roles of RhopH2 and Rphoh3, and they do demonstrate CRISPR's utility in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. But CRISPR's main utility was to introduce older technologies by creating the transcription knockdowns and conditional protein destabilization domains that provided most of the significant results in this manuscript. And CRISPR's use in Plasmodium has already been well documented (Ghorbal 2014).</p><p>2) The authors stress that their findings &quot;suggest several novel therapeutic approaches&quot;, and they offer one in &quot;drugs that interfere with assembly of the RhopH complex.&quot; This approach seems to require finding protein-protein interaction inhibitors (PPIs), which is a field with few successes and numerous failures. I believe that they should temper their claims, or possibly cite what success they've had in the approach as they do have a patent application.</p><p>3) The article is very difficult to read as it is written for an audience of experienced malaria researchers. The manuscript desperately needs a thorough editing to make it more accessible to <italic>eLife</italic> readers. For example, the term 'rhoptry' is used both explicitly and implicitly throughout the article – &quot;rhop&quot; appears more than 100 times in the main text – and I'm certain that few <italic>eLife</italic> readers know what a rhoptry is.</p><p>4) The authors explain that RhopH3 proteolytic processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) is responsible for the lack of lysis loss observed in the R3-DDD case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This explanation implies that RhopH3 is not being degraded by the DDD domain, and therefore active RhopH3 remains. However, the authors do not show that active RhopH3 is abundant in R3-DDD without TMP. I believe this should be an easy experiment to perform (the same style of blots they performed for the R2-DDD case should be sufficient). And this experiment would serve as great confirmation of their model that the minimal affect of R3-DDD is due simply to the method not working well to degrade RhopH3. If instead they observe substantial degradation of RhopH3, then the DDD domain likely degrades RhopH3 to a significant degree before the proteolytic processing removes the DDD domain. Then the authors would need to propose another explanation for why the removal of RhopH3 has minimal impact on PSAC function.</p><p>Less important issues</p><p>5) In the Abstract, the authors claim that their conditional knockdowns demonstrate that the rhoph2 and rhoph3 genes are required for bloodstream survival. Should this not read &quot;in vitro&quot; survival? There were no experiments within blood, so this seems like an overstatement.</p><p>6) The authors should reference Comeaux et al., Mol Microbiol 2011, 80:378. This paper shows that a knockout of CLAG3 had growth defects, which is an important corroboration of the Cell 2011 paper.</p><p>7) In subsection “Assembly-dependent trafficking and a RhopH3 role in invasion” at the end of third paragraph, the statement &quot;Thus, all three RhopH complex members require interactions with their cognate partners for successful transfer to erythrocytes at invasion.&quot; should be changed to make it clear that the data do not suggest that RhopH2 and RhopH3 require CLAG3 in order to get transferred. That is apparently not necessary, as CLAG3 knockouts are viable (Comeaux reference above).</p><p>8) The submission letter states that single molecule studies have been performed, but I can't figure out what this refers to.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The paper by Ito et al. describes functional analysis of the 2 essential proteins RhopH2 and RhopH3 in the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. For this purpose the authors use two different conditional knock-down approaches and identify a role in parasite invasion and nutrient uptake.</p><p>This is a very interesting study and following from their previous work on the parasite-induced channel PSAC. Data interpretation is complicated because both knock-downs also affect expression, and therefore likely function, of each other and a third PSAC component CLAG3. This should be accounted for more carefully for data interpretation and stated more explicitly throughout the manuscript.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>/D: It is very confusing to see that RhopH2 and RhopH3 knock-down results in simultaneous complete loss of each other's expression and CLAG3, but this is not recapitulated by IFA: here only CLAG3 is co-depleted in the knock-downs. It is also not clear whether RhopH2 co-localization with Rap1 is affected in the RhopH3 knock-down but not vice versa, as stated. This conflicting data and subsequent interpretation is a major issue continuing throughout the entire MS that needs to be thoroughly addressed.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>: This figure again shows the possible combinatorial function and cumulative phenotypes of the 2 knock-downs vs the 3 affected proteins. It should be a manor goal of the revision to address this issue and untangle the phenotypes/functions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23485.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Summary: In this manuscript the authors characterize the roles of RhopH2 and RhopH3, two of the three proteins in the Plasmodium falciparum RhopH complex.

Their studies, while not surprising, do provide important supporting information for the generally accepted model.</italic> </p><p>We do not agree that RhopH protein involvement in invasion is generally accepted. These and other prior studies have indirectly supported invasion roles for these proteins as well as CLAG3, relying primarily on erythrocyte binding assays with recombinant peptides and growth inhibition assays using antibodies. Unfortunately, these assays often produce misleading results because of nonspecific peptide binding and well-documented studies showing antibody cross-reactivity for parasite antigens (Holmquist et al., 1988; Udomsangpetch et al., 1989). Notably, while studies have suggested CLAG3 and RhopH2 contribute to invasion (Sam-Yellowe et al., 1992; Ocampo et al., 2005), our molecular studies formally refute this presumed role for both of these proteins. The revised manuscript clarifies this issue with a better description of prior data and highlights the new insights provided by our study (Results section).</p><p>We have performed additional experiments and revised the Results to clarify that only RhopH3 contributes to invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and subsection “Knockdowns co-deplete CLAG3 and reveal that only RhopH3 contributes to invasion”). We now show that RhopH3 knockdown does not affect merozoite development or parasite egress, and that its role is restricted to either host cell interaction or subsequent parasite internalization.</p><p><italic>Their finding that both Rhop2 and Rhop3 are essential for the successful transfer of each of the RhoP proteins into a new erythrocyte host is a new finding. Their finding that Rhop2 helps form functional plasmodial surface anion channels (PSACs) is also new, although the effect of Rhop2 degradation after invasion was modest. They also report the paradoxical – in the sense that it contradicts earlier reports – result that the RhopH complex uses the PTEX transporter to leave the parasitophorous vacuole (PV). Their discussion clearly addresses but does not resolve the contradiction.</italic> </p><p>We agree with this assessment. The effect of RhopH2 degradation after invasion was significant (P = 0.02, Student’s t test with n = 3 independent, matched trials), and modest only when compared to the nearly complete loss of PSAC seen with protein degradation prior to invasion. This lesser magnitude probably reflects the slow kinetics of protein destabilization/degradation after trimethoprim removal (halftime of 6 h for soluble proteins (Muralidharan et al., 2011), presumably longer for membrane proteins such a RhopH2). We have revised subsection “Knockdown via protein destabilization defines contributions after invasion” to clarify this point.</p><p>We heartily thank Josh Beck and Daniel Goldberg for multiple discussions and free exchange of reagents, both critical for examining the discrepancy with the prior report on PTEX. We agree that this contradiction will require further study.</p><p><italic>Issues to be addressed in a revision</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors refer repeatedly to their use of CRISPR technology to define the roles of RhopH2 and Rphoh3, and they do demonstrate CRISPR's utility in P. falciparum. But CRISPR's main utility was to introduce older technologies by creating the transcription knockdowns and conditional protein destabilization domains that provided most of the significant results in this manuscript. And CRISPR's use in Plasmodium has already been well documented (Ghorbal 2014).</italic> </p><p>We have revised the text to minimize references to CRISPR. We agree that this technology is already documented in malaria research, but to our knowledge, our study represents the first to perform a large number of CRISPR transfections to define and dissect the roles of two essential, interacting proteins.</p><p><italic>2) The authors stress that their findings &quot;suggest several novel therapeutic approaches&quot;, and they offer one in &quot;drugs that interfere with assembly of the RhopH complex.&quot; This approach seems to require finding protein-protein interaction inhibitors (PPIs), which is a field with few successes and numerous failures. I believe that they should temper their claims, or possibly cite what success they've had in the approach as they do have a patent application.</italic> </p><p>We have tempered these claims.</p><p><italic>3) The article is very difficult to read as it is written for an audience of experienced malaria researchers. The manuscript desperately needs a thorough editing to make it more accessible to eLife readers. For example, the term 'rhoptry' is used both explicitly and implicitly throughout the article – &quot;rhop&quot; appears more than 100 times in the main text – and I'm certain that few eLife readers know what a rhoptry is.</italic> </p><p>We have edited the manuscript to make more accessible to the broad <italic>eLife</italic> readership. The Introduction now also includes a more complete overview of the relevant background on parasite cell biology, a description of the key unknowns that we resolved, and a description of methods used. We have also added new schematics to help our readers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4F, 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) The authors explain that RhopH3 proteolytic processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) is responsible for the lack of lysis loss observed in the R3-DDD case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This explanation implies that RhopH3 is not being degraded by the DDD domain, and therefore active RhopH3 remains. However, the authors do not show that active RhopH3 is abundant in R3-DDD without TMP. I believe this should be an easy experiment to perform (the same style of blots they performed for the R2-DDD case should be sufficient). And this experiment would serve as great confirmation of their model that the minimal affect of R3-DDD is due simply to the method not working well to degrade RhopH3. If instead they observe substantial degradation of RhopH3, then the DDD domain likely degrades RhopH3 to a significant degree before the proteolytic processing removes the DDD domain. Then the authors would need to propose another explanation for why the removal of RhopH3 has minimal impact on PSAC function.</italic> </p><p>This is an important suggestion. We have now performed the requested immunoblots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). We also performed new IFAs showing that each RhopH member is abolished in R2-DDD trophozoites, but preserved in R3-DDD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These findings now show that proteolytic processing accounts for the relatively modest loss of PSAC activity in the R3-DDD knockdown.</p><p>We added a new schematic summarizing these findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and revised the text accordingly (subsection “Proteolytic processing of RhopH3 undermines conditional knockdown”).</p><p>Less important issues</p><p><italic>5) In the Abstract, the authors claim that their conditional knockdowns demonstrate that the rhoph2 and rhoph3 genes are required for bloodstream survival. Should this not read &quot;</italic>in vitro<italic>&quot; survival? There were no experiments within blood, so this seems like an overstatement.</italic> </p><p>We agree and have changed this.</p><p><italic>6) The authors should reference Comeaux et al., Mol Microbiol 2011, 80:378. This paper shows that a knockout of CLAG3 had growth defects, which is an important corroboration of the Cell 2011 paper.</italic> </p><p>We have added this citation.</p><p><italic>7) In subsection “Assembly-dependent trafficking and a RhopH3 role in invasion” at the end of third paragraph, the statement &quot;Thus, all three RhopH complex members require interactions with their cognate partners for successful transfer to erythrocytes at invasion.&quot; should be changed to make it clear that the data do not suggest that RhopH2 and RhopH3 require CLAG3 in order to get transferred. That is apparently not necessary, as CLAG3 knockouts are viable (Comeaux reference above).</italic> </p><p>The reported CLAG3 knockout and a tandem CLAG3-CLAG2 knockdown we reported (Hill 2007, Sharma 2013) retain paralogs on other chromosomes (CLAG8 and CLAG9 at a minimum). Because RhopH2 and/or RhopH3 transfer may be facilitated by interactions with any remaining CLAG paralog, it is not currently possible to exclude a similar CLAG requirement as the reviewer suggests. The revised manuscript clarifies this point.</p><p><italic>8) The submission letter states that single molecule studies have been performed, but I can't figure out what this refers to.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for this vague terminology. We were referring to single channel recordings with patch-clamp. We show currents from individual channels on the host erythrocyte membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and on the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane surrounding the intracellular parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We have revised the text (subsections “Activities at the parasitophorous vacuole are unaffected” and” The RhopH complex is required for nutrient channels on the host membrane”), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4F, 4H</xref>, and the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> to clarify these studies and the insights they provide.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>/D: It is very confusing to see that RhopH2 and RhopH3 knock-down results in simultaneous complete loss of each other's expression and CLAG3, but this is not recapitulated by IFA: here only CLAG3 is co-depleted in the knock-downs. It is also not clear whether RhopH2 co-localization with Rap1 is affected in the RhopH3 knock-down but not vice versa, as stated. This conflicting data and subsequent interpretation is a major issue continuing throughout the entire MS that needs to be thoroughly addressed.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the confusing presentation, which resulted from an inadequate explanation of the timing of key biological events. We have overhauled the Results section, added new data, and modified these figures to clarify the complicated interactions between these proteins and the stage-specific effects of knockdown.</p><p>We found that transcriptional knockdown of either protein has both early effects on trafficking of associated proteins within merozoites AND late effects on transfer of the complex to the next erythrocyte. These early and late effects are now presented separately in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, respectively.</p><p>The early effects were measured within 12 h of glucosamine addition when intracellular parasites have matured to schizonts but prior to egress. At this stage, our studies show that RhopH2 knockdown renders CLAG3 undetectable in both IFA and immunoblots, but RhopH3 is largely preserved and traffics normally to apical organelles in developing merozoites (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, where we have added a new stage-specific immunoblot). RhopH3 knockdown also renders CLAG3 undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), but differs in that RhopH2 trafficking appears to be adversely affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> shows that only RhopH3 is involved in erythrocyte invasion. Because GlcN-treated R2glmS invades normally despite undetectable levels of RhopH2 and CLAG3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), we refute long-standing proposals that these two proteins contribute to invasion. Because RhopH3 traffics normally to rhoptries in this knockdown, R2glmS parasites cannot exclude a RhopH3 contribution. The other knockdown parasite, R3glmS, addresses this unknown and shows a 50% reduction in invasion with 4 mM GlcN. This reduction can be confidently attributed to RhopH3 alone because contributions from the other proteins are excluded by normal invasion in the RhopH2 knockdown.</p><p>The late effects of knockdown are now shown separately (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Here, both knockdowns exhibit complete loss of all three proteins in immunoblots and IFAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). These finding indicate that RhopH2 and RhopH3 require interactions with each other for transfer to the new host cell at invasion; loss of CLAG3 is not surprising at this stage because it was already degraded due to early effects in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>: This figure again shows the possible combinatorial function and cumulative phenotypes of the 2 knock-downs vs the 3 affected proteins. It should be a manor goal of the revision to address this issue and untangle the phenotypes/functions.</italic> </p><p>We agree and have clarified the effects of stage-specific knockdown on trafficking and transfer of the 3 proteins to invaded erythrocytes (addressed above, revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).</p><p>The comment here refers to data now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, which combines kinetic osmotic lysis assays and whole-cell patch-clamp to determine that glucosamine-induced knockdown of either RhopH2 or RhopH3 produces essentially complete loss of PSAC activity on the host membrane.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> shows that nearly all cells in either R2glmS or R3glmS are refractory to osmotic lysis in sorbitol at 4 mM glucosamine, but WT cells are not significantly affected. (Sorbitol is a sugar alcohol with uptake primarily via PSAC.) Although the GlcN dose-response profiles for R2glmS and R3glmS appear to differ in this figure, statistical testing excludes significant differences between these parasites at each GlcN concentration, as expected if either knockdown abolishes transfer of all complex members.</p></body></sub-article></article>
