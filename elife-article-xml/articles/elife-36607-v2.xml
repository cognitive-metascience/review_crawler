However, the link between pain and the STN remains unclear. In the present work, using in vivo electrophysiology in rats, we report that STN neurons exhibit complex tonic and phasic responses to noxious stimuli. We also show that nociception is altered following lesions of the STN, and characterize the role of the superior colliculus and the parabrachial nucleus in the transmission of nociceptive information to the STN, physiologically from both structures and anatomically in the case of the parabrachial nucleus. We show that STN nociceptive responses are abnormal in a rat model of PD, suggesting their dependence on the integrity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. The STN-linked nociceptive network that we reveal is likely to be of considerable clinical importance in neurological diseases involving a dysfunction of the basal ganglia.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36607.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Parkinson’s disease is a condition affecting the human brain that becomes worse over time. The most common symptoms are tremors, muscle spasms and movements that are much slower than normal; all of which decrease an individual’s quality of life. Although there is currently no cure, the brain structures involved in Parkinson’s disease are known. These are collectively termed the basal ganglia, and are often targeted to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. For example, electrically stimulating the subthalamic nucleus (STN), one part of the basal ganglia, reduces muscle tremors and stiffness.</p><p>Pain is another common symptom in Parkinson’s disease. Patients often report strange burning or stabbing sensations with no obvious physical cause. They are also likely to be more sensitive to painful stimuli and have a lower pain threshold than normal. This suggested that the brain circuits that allow us to perceive and process pain could be somehow involved in Parkinson’s disease. Indeed, stimulating the STN is known to relieve pain in Parkinson’s disease, as well as the muscle symptoms, but exactly how the STN might link up with the brain’s ‘pain network’ remains poorly understood. Pautrat et al. therefore set out to explore the connection between pain networks and the STN, and determine its potential role in Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>First, the electrical activity of nerve cells in the STN of rats was measured, which revealed that these cells do respond to mildly painful sensations. Experiments using dyes to label cells in both the STN and brain structures known to transmit painful signals showed that the STN was indeed directly linked to the brain’s pain network. Moreover, rats with a STN that did not work properly also responded abnormally to painful stimuli, confirming that the STN did indeed influence their perception of pain. Finally, Pautrat et al. repeated their measurements of electrical activity in the STN, this time using rats that lacked the same group of nerve cells affected in the basal ganglia of patients with Parkinson’s disease. Such rats are commonly used to model the disease in laboratory experiments. In these rats, the STN cells responded very strongly to painful stimuli, suggesting that problems with the STN could be causing some of the pain symptoms in Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>This work reveals a new role for the STN in controlling responses to pain, both in health and disease. Pautrat et al. hope that their results will inspire research into more effective treatments of nerve pain in both Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>subthalamic nucleus</kwd><kwd>pain, nociceptive network</kwd><kwd>subcortical hyperdirect pathway</kwd><kwd>parabrachial nucleus</kwd><kwd>superior colliculus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coizet</surname><given-names>Veronique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ADR Région Rhône Alpes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coizet</surname><given-names>Veronique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UGA AGIR-POLE</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coizet</surname><given-names>Veronique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The subthalamic nucleus is linked to a nociceptive network and involved in nociceptive processing and perception.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pain is highly prevalent in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and includes primary symptoms assumed to originate from a dysfunction of the central nervous system. Patients describe bizarre and unexplained painful sensations such as burning, stabbing, aching, itching or tingling sensations, predominating on the more affected side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schestatsky et al., 2007</xref>). These symptoms are not directly related to the pain caused by the motor symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ha and Jankovic, 2012</xref>). Sensitivity to noxious stimulation is also increased in patients with PD, with or without pain symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berardelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brefel-Courbon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tinazzi et al., 2008</xref>), and their nociceptive threshold is altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chudler and Dong, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Conte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Djaldetti et al., 2004</xref>). Although it is well known that PD affects the basal ganglia, there is to date no clear description of a link between the basal ganglia and the cerebral network involved in pain. Interestingly, deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) in PD, a valuable and effective therapeutic technique for motor symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Krack et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Limousin et al., 1998</xref>), has also been shown to reduce pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cury et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hanagasi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Klingelhoefer et al., 2014</xref>). By contrast, the effects of dopamine replacement therapy on the pain symptoms in PD are controversial, with some investigations reporting an improvement, no effect or an aggravation of pain symptoms or nociceptive thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Conte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dellapina et al., 2011</xref>). These variable results of dopamine replacement therapy indicate a role for other systems in the pain symptoms observed in PD. Importantly in the present context, it has been demonstrated that pain relief following STN-DBS is superior to that following dopaminergic treatment, further positioning STN as a crucial structure in pain symptoms in PD and their relief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sürücü et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which STN-DBS improves pain in PD patients remains unclear, which raises a fundamental question about the link between the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and pain. Preliminary evidence suggests that noxious stimulation can modulate background activity in the STN, at least in the Parkinsonian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belasen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Heise et al., 2008</xref>). As a consequence, the STN could be linked to a nociceptive network involved in the perception of noxious stimuli, although this has yet to be explored fully. Despite the classical description of a sensory territory in the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 1986</xref>) and the functional impact that STN sensory responses could have on the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baunez et al., 2011</xref>), there is a paucity of information in the literature regarding the type of sensory stimuli that activate this structure and the afferent sensory source(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Coizet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hammond et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Matsumura et al., 1992</xref>). Two major subcortical central targets for ascending nociceptive information from the spinal cord are potential relays for nociceptive information to the STN: the superior colliculus (SC) and the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hylden et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Craig, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Klop et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McHaffie et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>We have shown that the SC, a highly conserved but evolutionarily ancient subcortical multi-sensory structure, directly projects to the STN and is the primary, if not exclusive, source of visual input into the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Coizet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tokuno et al., 1994</xref>). This projection shows that subcortical hyper-direct pathways exist between brainstem sensorimotor structures and the STN which predate, from an evolutionary perspective, those from the cortex — thus reinforcing the position of the STN as a critical input structure processing short latency visual signals in the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baunez et al., 2011</xref>). The substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) is also on the input side of the basal ganglia and we have shown that SNc receives nociceptive-related afferents from the PBN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coizet et al., 2010</xref>), raising the possibility that the STN may also receive such inputs.</p><p>It is interesting to note that the STN is well known to project heavily to basal ganglia output structures such as the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gurney et al., 2001</xref>), which in turn projects to the SC and PBN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schneider, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Deniau and Chevalier, 1992</xref>), linking the STN, SNr and SC/PBN anatomically. With the STN in a position to modulate a nociceptive network involving the SC/PBN, the elevated activity in the STN in Parkinsonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albin et al., 1995</xref>) could underlie some of the unexplained pain symptoms in this disease, with STN-DBS acting (at least in part) locally to achieve its analgesic effects. Nociceptive processing in the STN would also be consistent with the nucleus’s role as part of the brain’s interrupt circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jahanshahi et al., 2015</xref>), terminating behaviors that achieve negative outcomes, of which pain is a clear example.</p><p>Therefore, the main objective of the present work was to characterize the link between STN and nociception, answering the following questions:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Does the STN process nociceptive information?

We identified 39 (40%) and 17 (18%) cells showing a significant increase (‘up’ group) and decrease (‘down’ group), respectively, in their baseline firing rate with the stimulation, and no significant change for the remaining 42 cells (42%, ‘no change’ group). Contingency analysis did not reveal a specific topography of their location within STN, or a link to the shape of their action potential or to the presence or absence of a phasic response.

The ipsilateral ascending fibers leave the PBN in an antero-dorsal direction and pass above and through the dorso-caudal pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). There, they split into three large pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), a PBN-SC (intermediate and deep layers), a PBN-thalamic and a PBN-nigral ventral projection. PBN-labeled axons traveling to the STN are a rostral extension of the pathway we have described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coizet et al., 2010</xref>) from the PBN to the dopaminergic neurons in the ventral midbrain, the parabrachio-nigral pathway. A substantial number of fibers continue further forward to the amygdala and the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). This parabrachio-subthalamic pathway originates in the lateral and medial PBN (lPBN and mPBN, respectively). Thus, injections of either PHA-l or BDA centered preferentially on the lPBN or the mPBN were both associated with numerous labeled axons and terminals, which were differentially distributed within sub-regions of the STN. PBN fibers and terminals were largely seen in a dorsal sheet that extended across the entire mediolateral axis of the STN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>).

The proportion of cells exhibiting the three levels of STN baseline firing rate upon introduction of the stimulation (up, down or no change) was not altered in the PD rat groups (χ2 = 0.32; p=0.85). Therefore, STN phasic nociceptive responses in PD rats were exacerbated, while the tonic modulation of the firing rate was preserved.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study demonstrates for the first time that a large majority of STN neurons exhibit various mono- or multi-phasic responses to noxious stimulation, consistent with the hypothesis that one of the functions of the STN is to interrupt behavior when appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jahanshahi et al., 2015</xref>); in this case, to select a more appropriate action to try to relieve the noxious sensation. STN nociceptive responses mainly had a short latency (~20–40 ms) and could be recorded all over the structure. We have shown that most of the responsive cells are nociceptive-specific, as only few of them also respond to non-noxious somatosensory stimulation. In addition, we found that we could differentiate three types of STN neurons, which showed an increase, a decrease or no change, respectively, in their baseline firing rate upon introduction of the noxious stimulation. The spontaneous firing rate of STN ‘down’ cells was significantly higher than that of the two other groups, suggesting the possibility of a separate group of cells. Furthermore, we have shown that STN responses to nociceptive stimuli were abnormal in a rat model of PD, suggesting that the nociceptive responses recorded in STN depend on the integrity of the nigrostriatal DA system.</p><p>When determining the afferent source of nociception-related influence on STN activity, we have revealed a crucial role for two brainstem structures, the PBN and the SC, by demonstrating the effects of their inactivation on nociceptive responses in the STN and also by highlighting the existence of an anatomical direct pathway from the PBN to the STN. This parabrachio-subthalamic projection represents a second example of a subcortical hyperdirect pathway to the STN from a sensori-motor structure, in addition to the tecto-subthalamic pathway described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Coizet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tokuno et al., 1994</xref>). Finally, we have shown that these anatomico-electrophysiological findings translate into a functional role for the STN in mediating nociception, in that nociceptive behavioral responses were affected by lesions of the STN. However, a note of caution is required since we used only male rats, and thus care should be taken in extrapolating our results to females.</p><p>Using noxious electrical stimulation of the hindpaw allowed us to record precisely the timing of responses in our structures of interest with controlled parameters of stimulation. It is interesting to note that the majority of STN nociceptive responses had short latencies (76/79) and were monophasic (40/79), a pattern of responses that is similar in proportion to the pattern of STN responses following visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Coizet et al., 2009</xref>) but dissimilar to the pattern of STN responses following stimulation of the frontal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Magill et al., 2004</xref>), sensorimotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fujimoto and Kita, 1993</xref>) or motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kolomiets et al., 2001</xref>). The latter — in the majority of cases — are multi-phasic, with two excitatory phases (equivalent to the present biphasic +/+) often separated by an inhibition (equivalent to the present triphasic +/–/+). It has been hypothesized previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Magill et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitai and Deniau, 1981</xref>) that the short latency excitation following cortical stimulation appears to be driven by a hyperdirect pathway to the STN,whereas the later phases of the response arise from polysynaptic interactions, which are manifested more slowly. The inhibition following the first excitation has been hypothesized to involve the reciprocally connected STN–globus pallidus (GP) network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fujimoto and Kita, 1993</xref>). STN excitation may activate GP GABAergic neurons, which in return inhibit the STN. Overall, our data suggest that when the rat is subjected to noxious stimulation, the main pathway to the STN that is activated is a fast hyperdirect pathway, originating in part in the PBN. The fact that we only have a few cells showing an inhibitory second phase (10 biphasic and 5 triphasic, 15/79) indicates that STN nociceptive cells are rarely closely connected to the GP and lack GP-STN feedforward control.</p><p>Functionally antagonistic STN neuronal subpopulations have been found in the STN. Specific GO and STOP cells have been described in PD patients performing a stop signal paradigm, during motor execution or response inhibition, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benis et al., 2016</xref>). Sub-populations of STN cells have also been shown to code exclusively for reward magnitude (4% vs 32% sucrose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lardeux et al., 2009</xref>]), error-related activity (‘Oops neurons’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lardeux et al., 2009</xref>]), reward value (cocaine or sucrose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lardeux et al., 2013</xref>]) and for positive and aversive reinforcers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Breysse et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A major finding of our work is that we were able to differentiate a subpopulation of STN neurons that had a higher spontaneous firing rate on the basis of the effect of noxious stimuli on general tonic activity. This finding is important as glutamatergic tone from the STN is likely to have a strong impact on the tonic level of activity in the basal ganglia network, especially in the output structures (as we hypothesized that nociceptive-responding STN cells may not be densely connected to GP). The results from previous computational studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gurney et al., 2001</xref>) suggest that tonic control by the STN may adjust the general level of activity of the inhibitory GABAergic neurons of the basal ganglia output structures, which are known to project to the SC and PBN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schneider, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Deniau and Chevalier, 1992</xref>). This tonic STN control is hypothesized to be used by the basal ganglia to optimize selection of the most appropriate action. The identification of separate subpopulations of cells in the STN according to their spontaneous firing rate, and the orientation of the change of their firing rate following the occurrence of noxious stimulation,suggests that the tonic excitatory effects of the STN may not be uniform, although further work is required to elucidate the connectivity of the STN subpopulations. This mechanism is important in the context of PD in which STN activity is pathologically increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albin et al., 1995</xref>), probably disrupting this control. This possibility is further supported by our results showing enhanced phasic nociceptive responses in a PD rat model, with an increase in the latency to make nocifensive responses in the hotplate test following lesions of the STN. As well as interfering with action selection, disrupted STN control in PD would probably have an impact on the SC and PBN and their role in sensory signal processing.</p><p>In addition to demonstrating that STN neurons process nociceptive information, we also assessed whether two subcortical sensori-motor structures from the brain stem transmit nociceptive signals to the STN. Despite SC nociceptive responses having shorter latencies than those of STN neurons to the same stimulus, chemical suppression and lesions of SC had relatively minor effects on the responses of STN to noxious footshock. Lesions of the SC with acid ibotenic reduced the number of cells that do not respond to noxious stimulation, suggesting that the SC gates the pool of responding cells in the STN. Our previous work has demonstrated that the SC is a critical relay for short-latency visual input into DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dommett et al., 2005</xref>) but not for short-latency nociceptive input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coizet et al., 2006</xref>) transmitted by the PBN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coizet et al., 2010</xref>). The current results suggest the same organization when considering visual and nociceptive input into the STN. The SC is a crucial structure to transmit visual information while the PBN strongly contributes to the relay of nociceptive signals. PBN lesions significantly reduced the number of STN cells responding to noxious stimuli, sparing a group of cells with short latency short duration responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), which are possibly activated by nociceptive information relayed by the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dostrovsky, 2000a</xref>). This nociceptive network linked to the STN is the probable substrate underlying the successful analgesic effects of STN deep-brain stimulation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al. (2012)</xref> hypothesized that STN-DBS improves secondary pain symptoms in PD because this stimulation decreases the abnormally increased muscle tone in patients and may alleviate the primary nociception processing in the central nervous system. DBS effects are complex and despite the success of DBS in treating a variety of psychiatric and neurological disorders, the mechanisms underpinning its therapeutic efficacy remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McIntyre et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashkan et al., 2017</xref>). DBS is hypothesized to induce a ‘functional lesion’ of the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Follett, 2000</xref>), via depolarization blockade and synaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beurrier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dostrovsky et al., 2000b</xref>), which would lead to a suppression of the activity of STN neurons. We hypothesize that these mechanisms would reduce the pathologically increased firing rate in the STN in PD (and thus the pain symptoms), as well as nociceptive responses.</p><p>Our current work using anterograde tract-tracing neuroanatomy coupled with 3D reconstruction indicates that a small ascending bundle leaves the PBN and then splits into three massive projections traveling toward the SC, the thalamus and the SNc/STN. Some fibers from this last ascending pathway continue rostrally to terminate in the amygdala and the cortex. Comparison of the size of the bundle leaving the PBN and the size of the bundles traveling to their targets indicate that the number of labelled fibers clearly increase, suggesting that PBN axons have collaterals. This PBN-STN projection is possibly interconnected with other PBN efferents, such as the PBN–amygdala projection, which partly travels through the STN and has cells of origin that are of a similar type to those of the PBN cells projecting to STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sarhan et al., 2005</xref>). With a DBS effect on axons and fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chiken and Nambu, 2014</xref>), the characterization of this projection and network are important in the context of the effects of STN-DBS on pain symptoms. Overall, STN-DBS would not only impact STN and PBN nociceptive processing but would also modulate PBN-amygdala fibers and possibly other PBN efferents via the collaterals. The effect of STN-DBS would therefore impact many aspects of pain such as, for example, pain-related emotional reactions when activating the PBN-amygdaloid connection or neuroendocrine homeostatic regulation in response to pain by activating the PBN-hypothalamic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gauriau and Bernard, 2002</xref>). Further experiments are now needed to fully characterize the effect of STN-DBS on nociceptive processing in our rat models and how aspects of that network are modulated to achieve a DBS-related analgesic effect.</p><p>Pain is a multifaceted experience that can be understood in terms of somatosensory, affective and cognitive dimensions. DBS therapies that are focused on a single facet of pain, originally targeting somatosensory networks or more recently targeting affective regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schneider, 1986</xref>). The STN is a small structure with functional territories such as the limbic, cognitive and sensory, in close proximity to each other. This would allow the potential modulation of different modalities of pain and, in the future, the best placements of DBS electrodes within those territories would have to be tested to maximize the analgesic effect. Finally, numerous non-motor symptoms can worsen or improve depending on the electrical stimulation parameters, as well as the location of the electrode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). The best parameters of stimulation for nociception would need to take into account the effect of those parameters on other symptoms of PD.</p><p>Finally, non-neuropathic pain, recently recognized as a frequent and disabling symptom in PD, is a complaint affecting many patients who have numerous neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, motor neuron disease, Huntington’s disease, spinocerebellar ataxia and spinal muscular atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">de Tommaso et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings on the involvement of the STN in nociceptive processing and its link to a nociceptive network open a new direction for research to explore a possible role of this structure in other pain syndromes, especially extra-pyramidal ones like Huntington’s disease, which is characterized by a dysfunction of the basal ganglia. It also opens up the possibility of developing therapeutic strategies using DBS. A variety of brain sites have been identified for chronic stimulation procedures to attenuate pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Davis et al., 1998</xref>). These targets include the thalamus, the periventricular gray nucleus, the cingulate cortex and the motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gorecki et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Davis et al., 1998</xref>). With the involvement of the STN in a nociceptive network as demonstrated in our work, the STN-DBS technique can thus be considered in the future as a new target for the treatment of pain not only in pharmaco-resistant patients suffering from previously described neurodegenerative disease, but also, for example, in those with chronic pain disease or pharmaco-resistant patients with certain forms of migraine that have been shown to activate the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schwedt et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electrophysiology</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Fifty male Hooded Lister rats (265–450 g) were anaesthetised with an intra-peritoneal injection of urethane (ethyl carbonate; 1.25 g/kg as a 25% aqueous solution) and mounted in a stereotaxic frame with the skull level.

They also activate the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coizet et al., 2006</xref>), the PBN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coizet et al., 2010</xref>) and the dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coizet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2010</xref>) in a qualitatively similar way as a mechanical noxious pinch with a teethed forceps.</p><p>To ascertain the noxious nature of our stimulation, we performed three control tests based on the previous observations. i) We first performed an intensity test on a group of STN cells following footshocks with intensities ranging from 0 to 5 mA. Among the 17 STN neurons responding to the maximum 5 mA stimulation, a decrease of intensity was followed by a decrease of the number of responding cells following a 4 mA (n = 12) and a 3 mA (n = 7) stimulation. None of those cells showed a response for intensities under the threshold of 3 mA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, supplementary results). Furthermore, analysis performed on the 7 cells responding to 3, 4 and 5 mA showed a significant effect of the intensity of the stimulation when considering the maximum amplitude (ANOVA – repeated measure: F[2,20] = 11.51, p&lt;0.01) and the magnitude (ANOVA – repeated measure: F[2,20] = 17.55, p&lt;0.001). In both cases, there was a significant increase in the response parameters with the increase in the intensity (Tukey-Kramer post-hoc comparison — maximum amplitude: 3 mA vs 5 mA, p&lt;0.01, 4mA vs 5 mA, p&lt;0.05; magnitude: 3 mA vs 4 mA, p&lt;0.05; 3 mA vs 5 mA, p&lt;0.001). ii) We compared the effects of a mechanical pinch with a teethed forceps and a 5 mA footshock on STN neuron responses. All the cells responding to the manual pinch showed a qualitatively similar excitation to the footshock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, supplementary results), while none of the cells that were unresponsive to pinch were activated by footshock. iii) As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coizet et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2010</xref>), noxious footshock of 5mA for an hour induced the expression of c-fos labeling within the medial part of the ipsilateral superficial layers of the lumbar cord, especially layers I and II, although layers III–V also contained some labeling. In control animals, where electrodes were implanted but the stimulation was not delivered, substantially lower levels of c-fos were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>).

Each rat was anesthetized with isofluorane (5% for the induction and 1–2% for maintenance) and placed in a stereotaxic instrument. A 30-gauge metal injector needle filled with ibotenic acid (20 µg/µl in phosphate buffered saline) was introduced using the same coordinates as for the electrophysiological procedure. The injections in the PBN were made according to a previously published procedure by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reilly and Trifunovic (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2001)</xref> with electrophysiological guidance to improve the accuracy of the location of the lesion. The microinjections were made (0.5 µl/min) in the SC (0.5–0.65 µl) and the PBN (0.3–0.5 µl) as for the muscimol injections (see above). The cannula remained in situ for a further 10 min to minimize the spread of neurotoxin back along the track before the cannula was removed and the incision was closed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Lesion procedure in STN and hotplate test</title><p>Twenty Long Evans rats were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/Kg, s.c., Imalgène 1000, Merial, Lyon, France) and medetomidine (0.85 mg/Kg, s.c., Domitor, Orion Pharma, Espoo, Finland). Rats were secured in Kopf stereotaxic apparatus. Then, a unilateral 30-gauge stainless-steel injector needle connected by Tygon tubing (Saint Gobain performance plastics) with a 10 µL Hamilton microsyringe (Bonaduz, Switzerland) fixed on a micropump (CMA, Kista, Sweden) was positioned into the STN. Coordinates for the aimed site were (with tooth bar set at −3.3 mm): anteposterior −3.72 mm; lateral ±2.4 mm from bregma; dorsoventral −8.4 mm from skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Paxinos and Watson, 2005</xref>). Rats received a bilateral injection of either ibotenic acid (9.4 µg/µL, AbCam Biochemical, Cambridge, UK; STN-lesioned group, n = 12) or vehicle solution (phosphate buffer, 0.1M; Sham control group, n = 8). The volume injected was 0.5 µL per side infused over 3 min. The injectors were left in place for 3 min to allow diffusion. At the end of surgery, medetomidine was reversed by 0.2 mg (4.28 mg/Kg, s.c.) atipamezole (Antisedan, Orion Pharma, Espoo, Finland). Three weeks after the surgery, all the animals were subjected to the hotplate test. Each rat was placed on a heated metal plate (53°) surrounded by a transparent cylinder. The experimenter was constantly watching the rat’s behaviour during the test to measure the latency of the first sign of paw licking or jumping and to remove the animals from the apparatus quickly. The maximum time on the hot place was set to 30 s. The rat’s behaviour was also video recorded online on the computer for a second finer analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>6-OHDA lesions</title><p>Rats were anesthetised with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine-xylazine (0.765/1.1 ml; 1 ml/kg, i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic frame with the skull level. All the microinjections were made via a sharpened 30G injection cannula connected with polyethylene tubing to a 10 µl Hamilton syringe driven by an infusion pump (0.5 µl/min). After the injection, the cannula was left in place for a further 5 min to allow diffusion. Animals were divided into two groups: i) those with a total dopaminergic lesion (n = 9), in which 3 µl of 6-OHDA (Sigma-Aldrich, 3 mg/ml in sterile 0.9% NaCl and 0.1% ascorbic acid) was injected into the left SNc using the following stereotaxic coordinates: AP:+3.0 mm; ML:+2.1 mm and DV:+2.4 mm from interaural zero mm; and ii) a control group with no injection of the toxin (n = 9).</p><p>The extent of the DA denervation following the 6-OHDA injections in the SNc was determined using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry. To reveal TH, the sections were washed and incubated in a blocking solution containing 0.1M PB with 0.3% of triton X-100 (TX), 2.5% of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and 5% normal horse serum (NHS) for 2 hr before being transferred overnight to a 0.1M PB-TX 0.3% with 1% BSA and 2% NHS containing the primary mouse monoclonal TH antibody, diluted 1:3,000 (Chemicon, Hampshire, UK). The following day, sections were washed in 0.1M PB and incubated with the secondary antibody, biotinylated antimouse made in horse (in a dilution of 1:1,000 in 0.1M PB-TX 0.3% with 2% NHS) for 2 hr. Following further washes in 0.1M PB, the sections were exposed to the elite Vectastain ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) diluted 1:100 in PB-TX 0.3%, for 2 hr. Again following washes in 0.1M PB, immunoreactivity was revealed by exposure to VIP (Vector Laboratories) for 2 min, which produced a purple reaction product. Sections were then mounted onto gelled slides, dehydrated through alcohols and cleared in xylene before being coverslipped with DPX. TH-immunolabelling of DA neurons and terminals was evaluated using a light microscope (Nikon, Eclipse 80i, TRIBVN, Chatillon, France) coupled to the ICS Framework computerized image analysis system (TRIBVN, 2.9.2 version, Chatillon, France). For quantification, TH-labeled coronal sections of SNc (AP −5.3 mm to −5.8 mm from Bregma) and striatum (AP 0.20 mm to −0.30 mm from bregma) were digitized using a Pike F-421C camera (ALLIED Vision Technologies Stradtroda, Germany).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Peggy Mason as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers saw this study as well motivated into a largely un-explored aspect of PD and DBS therapy. Yet the reviewers had several serious reservations about the data:</p><p>- The experiments were underpowered. Results for n-s of 1 or 2 were discussed and many to most of the component experiments had total n-s of under 6.</p><p>- There are 3 different lesion methods used. The muscimol and ibotenic acid are used on cell responses and give very different results. An electrolytic lesion is used on behavior. Why? and if the neuronal responses underlie the behavior why the change in inactivation method?</p><p>- The absence of placement controls, and thus no control for repeated testing, for the lesions is a concern.</p><p>- The relationship between the tonic and phasic responding cells was unclear. From the numbers it would appear that some cells had both types of responses. Furthermore, regarding the tonic responses, some discussion of whether these were responses to noxious stimulation or to arousal would be helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is a well motivated study into an understudied symptom of PD, namely spontaneous pain, that appears relieved by STN-DBS. This study looks at mechanisms that may underlie this DBS effect. The authors find nociceptive responses in STN, that appear to arise in PBN and are positively modulated by Superior Colliculus. Electrolytic lesions of STN attenuate the hot plate test, lengthening the latency to respond. There are projections from the SC and PBN to STN.</p><p>This is a thorough paper. My major issue is that the authors use three different lesioning methods – electrolytic, muscimol and ibotenic acid- none of which are specific to cell type. Why the different lesioning methods yield different results is unclear. Thus the different roles of SC and PBN in shaping the nociceptive responses of STN remain unclear.</p><p>I don't understand Figure 2B. On left is supposed to be a decrease but if the dotted line is stim onset as mentioned in legend, then the rasters show an increase and vice versa for the right panel. Furthermore what is the relationship between the phasic and tonic responses?% s would suggest that they have to overlap. The statement that &quot;Interestingly, the orientation of the change could be predicted by the spontaneous firing rate of STN cells…&quot; is an overstatement. Only a decrease is associated with a higher rate. A lower rate is not informative as to whether the cell's firing rate will increase or not change.</p><p>The absence of placement controls for the lesions is a concern. There is simply no control and the effect of repeated testing is not known. Furthermore, this would appear to be a very important piece of the experiment and the lack of an accompanying figure is curious.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Arnaud Pautrat and colleagues show that the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is linked to the nociceptive brain network, involved in pain processing, affected by dopamine depletion and therefore probably play a major role in pathophysiology of the pain symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</p><p>They do so by revealing that 1) rodent (under urethane anesthesia) STN neurons exhibit in-vivo complex tonic and phasic responses to noxious stimuli; 2) pain perception is altered following a lesion of STN. They further characterize physiologically (by muscimol injections and simultaneous recording in the STN and at the inactivated target, and by ibotenic acid lesions) the role of the superior colliculus (SC) and the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) in the transmission of nociceptive information to the STN (PBN inactivation was found to be more effective than SC inactivation at reducing STN phasic pain responses). Additionally, they provide anterograde and retrograde anatomical evidence for the connections between the parabrachial nucleus and the STN (the anatomical connections between the SC and the STN are well known). The authors thus conclude that the PBN acts as a critical source of nociceptive input to the STN and the SC as a critical modulator of those responses. Finally, they show that STN pain responses are abnormal in the 6-OHDA rat model of PD.</p><p>This is a very comprehensive and important study. Unluckily, this reviewer is missing the answer to the next obvious question: do STN DBS affect pain processing in their model of Parkinsonism. If the authors have not done this experiment, please discuss this issue. My second major question is related to the discrimination between pain and arousal effects. I am aware of many rodent studies (e.g. by the Oxford group) that use pain to modulate the arousal (as reflected in the EEG) of rodents under urethane anesthesia. These points should be further discussed by the authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This study examined electrophysiological responses to noxious stimuli in the rat STN in healthy rats and in a PD model, the role of the superior colliculus and parabrachial nucleus, and the effect of STN lesions on pain-related behaviour. Although it has been known for some time that the STN is involved in pain, STN DBS can relieve PD, and that patients with PD can have chronic pain, there is little understanding of the underlying mechanisms and so this study topic is important. However, the study consists of so many subparts (mostly underpowered) that are poorly presented in terms of rationale and outcomes, that making sense of the study is challenging.</p><p>- There are no hypotheses laid out and so this complex study feels like a series of experiments that are not clearly tied together with any clear framework or proposed mechanism being tested.</p><p>- I found the study very difficult to follow. Given that the study is quite complex with many experiments, approaches and manipulations, it was somewhat difficult to follow without a clear framework as noted above. Thus, it would be useful to have a figure that shows the main concept of the study (perhaps with an anatomical circuit diagram) and the approach with these sub-studies/experiments and why the manipulations were being done.</p><p>- The authors should be more careful with terminology such as &quot;painful stimulation&quot; (should use &quot;noxious stimuli&quot; instead), &quot;pain-activated cells&quot; (should use &quot;noxious stimulus activated cells&quot;), and &quot;pain perception&quot; as pertains to behaviours in the rat as there is no way of knowing if the animals are indeed experiencing pain.</p><p>- The study was restricted to male rats. This is a major flaw given that there is no reason to omit female rats from such a study and given that there may indeed be sex differences in the pain system, it is a surprising study design flaw. Some countries and granting agencies now require animal studies to be done in both sexes unless there is a clear justification for restricting the study to one sex.</p><p>- In the electrophysiological study in healthy rats, it is not clear what kind of cells are being recorded from in the STN. Were the cells tested for responsiveness to anything other than footshock? It would be important to know if they were responsive to motor manipulations.</p><p>- The STN lesion studies were underpowered and the data were not provided in detail in figures.</p><p>- The effects of other manipulations and the anatomical studies were poorly conveyed in the results and figures and as with the STN lesion studies, many were underpowered.</p><p>- The symbols in Figure 1 could be improved to distinguish more clearly the responsive from non-responsive cells.</p><p>- I may have missed it but please clarify if the footshock responses were ipsi or contralateral. Also, it is important to provide information as to how the parameters of the noxious stimulation was derived and known to be noxious in nature.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Revealing a novel nociceptive network that links the subthalamic nucleus to pain processing&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Peggy Mason as Reviewing Editor and Andrew King as the Senior Editor.</p><p>This revision incorporates a far better motivated Introduction that convinces the reader that the work is of importance for understanding an important symptom in PD and that nociceptive responses in STN may represent an important interrupt-signal.

This manuscript now includes in vivo electrophysiology, behavioral assessment, tract-tracing neuroanatomy and a rat model of Parkinson’s disease to characterize a new pain network involving the subthalamic nucleus. We think this work provides conceptual advances and is of general interest because: – Clinical work with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) clearly links together pain and the subthalamic nucleus, but neither the neural basis for that link, nor the mechanism of action of DBS – a widely used clinical technique – are known. We provide significant insights into both. – We show for the first time that the subthalamic nucleus exhibits complex mono- or multi-phasic responses to noxious stimuli as well as various changes in baseline firing, revealing previously uncharacterized separate subpopulations of cells in this structure. – Analysis of STN tonic pain responses reveals that STN cells are not uniformly computing this painful signal. Therefore, our data provide insights about the complex intrinsic organization of the STN to differentially modulate action selection. – We also show for the first time the afferent origin of the nociceptive signals to the subthalamic nucleus and how they may be modulated. Our results reveal that the subthalamic nucleus is linked to a nociceptive network, within which the effects of DBS can be understood. – We demonstrate that the subthalamic pain responses and link to a nociceptive network translate into a functional role for STN in mediating pain perception. We show that rat pain perception is altered following a lesion of the subthalamic nucleus. – Discovering the source of afferent sensory (pain) information to the subthalamic nucleus reveals another “hyper-direct” input pathway to the basal ganglia complementing that already known from the cerebral cortex. Complementing our previous work, it supports the strong anatomical and functional connections between the basal ganglia and sensori-motor structures from the brainstem. – On the clinical side, our demonstration that subthalamic neurons are involved in pain processing and its well-known dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease could explain some of the debilitating pain symptoms that are prevalent in this disease. Our data support this hypothesis with a clear demonstration that STN pain processing is altered in a rat model of this disease. Given that pain phenomena are a feature of many neurodegenerative disorders, including those involving the basal ganglia, our insights could have widespread implications for the pathogenesis of aberrant pain phenomena and for their treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers saw this study as well motivated into a largely un-explored aspect of PD and DBS therapy. Yet the reviewers had several serious reservations about the data:</p><p>- The experiments were underpowered. Results for n-s of 1 or 2 were discussed and many to most of the component experiments had total n-s of under 6.</p></disp-quote><p>In the majority of cases, the very small Ns arose from considering subdivisions within such things as the response types in the STN following noxious stimulation. Given that every response is in some way unique, the decision about where to demarcate the boundaries between response types is somewhat arbitrary and on reflection we may have been led to focus on smaller differences between responses when the major differences (and larger Ns) were actually the most interesting. The smaller categories of response can be subsumed quite easily. We have now changed the section of the manuscript dealing with the categorization of responses. This section now focuses exclusively on the higher order classes of response and subsequently retains ample sample sizes in all categories.</p><p>Regarding tract-tracing experiments, the question of small Ns comes up frequently. We and others find that in general, there is low inter-case variability for anatomical tract-tracing, and, as a result, typically just a few cases are needed to describe a specific projection (i.e. Berendse and Groenewegen, Neuroscience, 1991; Coizet et al.,; 2017; Comoli et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2003; Kita and Kitai, J of comparative neurology, 1987). All our injections of anterograde tracer in the parabrachial nucleus (n = 8) labeled terminals in the dorsal part of the STN. This finding is consistent with the classical definition of a dorsal sensory-motor compartment of the STN where most sensory-motor structures project (Hamani et al., 2004; Haynes and Haber, J Neuroscience, 2013; Coizet et al., 2009; Kita and Kitai, J of comparative neurology, 1987; Kolomiet et al., 2001; Lanciego et al., Eur J of Neuroscience, 2004). The strength of our data is further supported by the use of different anterograde tracers (PHAL and Dextran) and retrograde tracers (Fluorogold and CTB), which we show provide the same distribution of labelled cells and terminals. To re-assure the reviewers, additional CTB injections in STN, recently processed in our lab (and confirming the present data), can be added to make the Ns equal to those using Fluorogold. Plotting all our anatomical data would be excessive, which is why we have presented the two most representatives cases for each anterograde and retrograde experiment. This technique of presentation is also based on previous works including our own (i.e. Comoli et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2003; Coizet et al., J of comparative neurology, 2007; J of neuroscience, 2009, 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- There are 3 different lesion methods used. The muscimol and ibotenic acid are used on cell responses and give very different results. An electrolytic lesion is used on behavior. Why? and if the neuronal responses underlie the behavior why the change in inactivation method?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that this was not sufficiently well explained. We used muscimol and ibotenic acidbecause each have strengths and weaknesses, but together they give a comprehensive picture of the involvement of the SC and PBN in the transmission of nociceptive information to the STN.</p><p>Muscimol does not create a lesion but produces a temporary pharmacological inactivation of the injected area (superior colliculus and parabrachial nucleus) allowing a direct comparison of STN nociceptive responses between a pre injection control period, a post injection period and a recovery period once the muscimol effect was cleared.</p><p>However, although the technique allows a pre-post comparison, the extent to which muscimol spreads within the target structures is difficult to determine. Hence, we also used ibotenic acid lesions whose extent could be determined histologically.</p><p>Those lesion/inactivation experiments gave the same results:</p><p>Pharmacological inactivation of the superior colliculus did not suppress STN noxious responses but rather diminished the duration of this responses (n = 9). Ibotenic acid lesion of the superior colliculus did not suppress STN noxious responses but rather diminished the duration of the responses (n = 28).</p><p>Pharmacological inactivation of the parabrachial nucleus suppressed or strongly reduced STN noxious responses (n = 13). Ibotenic acid lesion of the parabrachial nucleus strongly reduced STN noxious responses (n = 30).</p><p>NB: We did not use electrolytic lesion for the behavior but used ibotenic acid lesions, same as for the electrophysiological experiment.</p><p>The word “temporary” was added to the introductory paragraph of the Results “Effect of SC or PBN inhibition on STN nociceptive responses” for clarity: “To test the possibility that the SC or PBN transmits nociceptive signals to the STN, we pharmacologically inhibited their neuronal activity with muscimol, a GABAA agonist, and evaluated the effect of their temporary inactivation on STN nociceptive responses.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The absence of placement controls, and thus no control for repeated testing, for the lesions is a concern.</p></disp-quote><p>The hot place test was performed on two different groups of rat, a group with a ibotenic acid lesions of the STN (lesion group) and a group of sham rats injected in the STN with the excipient. Therefore, there was no repeat of the rats in this test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The relationship between the tonic and phasic responding cells was unclear. From the numbers it would appear that some cells had both types of responses. Furthermore, regarding the tonic responses, some discussion of whether these were responses to noxious stimulation or to arousal would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important question. The analysis of the tonic firing rate was performed on both STN nociceptive and non-nociceptive cells (n=98). This information has been added to the manuscript for clarity:</p><p>“We therefore performed an individual analysis on each of the 98 STN cells, whether responding to the noxious stimulation or not, to test if the change of their baseline firing rate after the introduction of the stimulation was statistically different or not robust …”.</p><p>There is no necessary relationship indeed between tonic and phasic responses as the modulation of tonic firing rate was also found in both nociceptive and non-nociceptive STN cells, although the reviewer is correct – both phasic and tonic modulations did occur in some (but not all) nociceptive cells. This information has been added to the manuscript for clarity:</p><p>“Contingency analysis did not reveal a specific topography of their location within STN, or link to their action potential shape, or to the presence of a phasic response or not.”</p><p>In addition to the above, please find below our point-by-point response addressing all the reviewer’s remaining comments:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] This is a thorough paper. My major issue is that the authors use three different lesioning methods – electrolytic, muscimol and ibotenic acid- none of which are specific to cell type. Why the different lesioning methods yield different results is unclear. Thus the different roles of SC and PBN in shaping the nociceptive responses of STN remain unclear.</p><p>I don't understand Figure 2B. On left is supposed to be a decrease but if the dotted line is stim onset as mentioned in legend, then the rasters show an increase and vice versa for the right panel. Furthermore what is the relationship between the phasic and tonic responses?% s would suggest that they have to overlap. The statement that &quot;Interestingly, the orientation of the change could be predicted by the spontaneous firing rate of STN cells…&quot; is an overstatement. Only a decrease is associated with a higher rate. A lower rate is not informative as to whether the cell's firing rate will increase or not change.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2B has been changed (now Figure 3 in the manuscript). We have removed the confusing phasic response occurring with the stimulation itself (at 0), which is not of interest for this analysis. Baseline firing rate is measured during the 500 ms (-0.5 to 0 in the figure) before the stimulation (at 0). We compared this value between the control set of stimulations (stimulator turned off) and the noxious set of stimulations (stimulator turned on). These two individual examples of an increase and decrease of baseline firing rate have been added for clarity. We wanted to illustrate our point that the baseline firing rate (the ‘tonic response’) of the cells was differentially changed when the animals were subjected to noxious stimulation, in some cases the baseline was increased and in other cases it was reduced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The absence of placement controls for the lesions is a concern. There is simply no control and the effect of repeated testing is not known. Furthermore, this would appear to be a very important piece of the experiment and the lack of an accompanying figure is curious.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a figure to complement the results (Figure 4 in the manuscript).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] This is a very comprehensive and important study. Unluckily, this reviewer is missing the answer to the next obvious question: do STN DBS affect pain processing in their model of Parkinsonism. If the authors have not done this experiment, please discuss this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>Testing the effect of STN DBS on pain processing in our rat model require a full set of experiments aiming to answer the following questions, partly raised by the present data:</p><p>1) Does STN DBS affect pain processing in our rat model of Parkinson’s disease, as suggested.</p><p>2) What would be the best target within STN? Pain is a multifaceted experience that can be understood in terms of somatosensory, affective and cognitive dimension. DBS therapies focused on a single facet of pain, originally targeting either somatosensory networks or more recently targeting affective regions (Shirvalkar et al., 2018). The STN is a small structure with functional territories such as limbic, cognitive and sensory, in close proximity to each other. This would allow the potential modulation of different modalities of pain. The best DBS electrodes placement within those territories would have to be tested.</p><p>3) What would be the best parameters of stimulation to re-establish normal pain processing? STN DBS parameters have been set to improve the motor symptoms. However, numerous nonmotor symptoms can worsen or improve depending on the electrical stimulation parameters, as well as the location of the electrode (i.e. Kim et al., 2015). This would have to be tested with respect to pain symptoms.</p><p>4) As the STN appears to be part of a novel nociceptive network, how are aspects of that network modulated to achieve a DBS-related analgesic effect, should one be achieved?</p><p>As expressed by reviewers 1 and 3, this is already a dense article, and the experiments planned to answer that question would constitute a second paper. The issue and the complexities thereof can however be discussed more fully in the present manuscript.</p><p>A paragraph has been added in the Discussion: “Further experiments are now needed to fully characterize the effect of STN-DBS on pain processing in our rat models and how aspects of that network are modulated to achieve a DBS-related analgesic effect. […] The best parameters of stimulation for pain would need to take into account the effect of those parameters on other symptoms of PD.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My second major question is related to the discrimination between pain and arousal effects. I am aware of many rodent studies (e.g. by the Oxford group) that use pain to modulate the arousal (as reflected in the EEG) of rodents under urethane anesthesia. These points should be further discussed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. Pinching the rat’s hindpaw for a few seconds is indeed a technique used to generate prolonged period of cortical activation in anesthetized rats (i.e. Mallet et al., 2008; Sharott et al., 2017). We therefore expect to generate this cortical activation during our stimulation protocol. We think that cortical activation is necessary for the expression of STN nociceptive responses, and also for the flow of low-level sensory information coming from brainstem structures such as the superior colliculus and the parabrachial nucleus. Indeed, our hypothesis is that the STN represents a node by which the cortex can control the activity of brainstem structures. Under normal circumstances, the STN receives numerous sensory inputs such as visual (Coizet et al., 2009) and auditory (Pautrat et al., in preparation) from the superior colliculus, and pain from the parabrachial nucleus (present data). With STN involvement of the brain’s interrupt circuitry, set to terminate the current behavior to allow the selection of a more appropriate action, such a circuit would require oversight to make sure behaviours were not constantly interrupted. Our suggestion is that brainstem inputs to the STN require a control signal from the cortex to favor or ignore those sensory processing. We therefore hypothesize that an increase arousal would facilitate STN responses to noxious stimulation to terminate behavior that achieves a painful outcome. It would be interesting in the future to test whether the noxious responses described in our current work vary with cortical activity.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This study examined electrophysiological responses to noxious stimuli in the rat STN in healthy rats and in a PD model, the role of the superior colliculus and parabrachial nucleus, and the effect of STN lesions on pain-related behaviour. Although it has been known for some time that the STN is involved in pain, STN DBS can relieve PD, and that patients with PD can have chronic pain, there is little understanding of the underlying mechanisms and so this study topic is important. However, the study consists of so many subparts (mostly underpowered) that are poorly presented in terms of rationale and outcomes, that making sense of the study is challenging.</p><p>- There are no hypotheses laid out and so this complex study feels like a series of experiments that are not clearly tied together with any clear framework or proposed mechanism being tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that this was not sufficiently explained. The main objective of the study was to establish and characterize the link between pain and the STN. For that purpose, we performed series of experiment to answer series of questions related to this main objective:</p><p>- We had to demonstrate that STN was processing pain information.</p><p>- We also had to demonstrate that manipulation of the integrity of STN could change physiological pain responses.</p><p>- In addition to these physiological results, it was crucial to demonstrate that the STN was anatomically targeted by afferents originating from primary pain structures. Indeed, there is to date no clear description of a link between the basal ganglia and the cerebral network involved in pain.</p><p>- Finally, to support the hypothesis that STN dysfunction could underlie some pain symptoms observed in Parkinson’s disease, we had to show that the STN was indeed dysfunctional in a rat model of this disease.</p><p>We think we achieved to answer to all those questions.</p><p>To clarify our objectives, we rephrased the last paragraph of the Introduction:</p><p>“Therefore, the main objective of the present work was to characterize the link between STN and pain, answering the following questions:</p><p>- Does the STN process pain information? We explored the possibility that noxious stimulation would induce nociceptive responses in the rat STN in vivo with electrophysiology. […] We present convergent evidence that the STN is functionally linked to a nociceptive network and that its pain responses are affected in parkinsonism. The objectives above are summarized in Figure 1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- I found the study very difficult to follow. Given that the study is quite complex with many experiments, approaches and manipulations, it was somewhat difficult to follow without a clear framework as noted above. Thus, it would be useful to have a figure that shows the main concept of the study (perhaps with an anatomical circuit diagram) and the approach with these sub-studies/experiments and why the manipulations were being done.</p></disp-quote><p>A figure summarizing the objectives and methods has been added to the manuscript (Figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors should be more careful with terminology such as &quot;painful stimulation&quot; (should use &quot;noxious stimuli&quot; instead), &quot;pain-activated cells&quot; (should use &quot;noxious stimulus activated cells&quot;), and &quot;pain perception&quot; as pertains to behaviours in the rat as there is no way of knowing if the animals are indeed experiencing pain.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed “painful stimulation” and “pain-activated cells” by “noxious stimuli” and “noxious stimulus activated cells” as suggested. “Pain perception” has been replaced by “pain responses”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The study was restricted to male rats. This is a major flaw given that there is no reason to omit female rats from such a study and given that there may indeed be sex differences in the pain system, it is a surprising study design flaw. Some countries and granting agencies now require animal studies to be done in both sexes unless there is a clear justification for restricting the study to one sex.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. We could justify the use of male rats by the fact that our present data rely on experiments performed previously in our lab (and elsewhere) on male rats. Our original characterization of the tecto-subthalamic pathway and electrophysiological experiments using visual stimulation were conducted using male rats (Coizet et al., 2009). This experiment set up the hypothesis that the superior colliculus, processing nociceptive information, could therefore transmit this information to the subthalamic nucleus. Furthermore, the characterization of the parabrachial-nigral pathway and electrophysiological experiments using noxious stimulation was also on male rats (Coizet et al., 2006, 2010). This work set up the hypothesis that the parabrachial nucleus could also be a candidate to relay nociceptive information to the subthalamic nucleus.</p><p>The fact that we used male rats only has been highlighted in the discussion: “However, there is a note of caution required since we used only male rats, and thus care should be taken in extrapolating our results to females.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In the electrophysiological study in healthy rats, it is not clear what kind of cells are being recorded from in the STN. Were the cells tested for responsiveness to anything other than footshock? It would be important to know if they were responsive to motor manipulations.</p></disp-quote><p>A group of 24 noxious stimulus activated cells were tested for non-noxious somato-sensory responses.

For clarity, we added this information into the Results section “Phasic response: Following the noxious stimulation performed in the contralateral hindpaw (120, 0.5 Hz), 19 STN cells remained unresponsive (19% ) while 79 STN neurons (81% ) exhibited a phasic response to the footshock with several patterns of response.”</p><p>An early draft included a paragraph explaining our choice of parameters based on the data from the literature and an additional pre-experiments performed to ascertain the noxious nature of our stimulations:</p><p>“Nociceptive nature of the stimulation</p><p>The electrical stimulation parameters from 3 to 5 mA have previously been shown to be approximately three times the threshold for activating C-fiber (Chang and Shyu, 2001; Matthews and Dickenson, 2001; Carpenter et al., 2003), to produce reliable Aδ and C-fiber responses in the anesthetized rat spinal cord (Urch et al., 2003) and c-fos expression in the nociceptive superficial lamina of the spinal cord (Coizet et al., 2006).

Hence, although the fact that the FR changes is not necessarily surprising, the magnitude of that change is.

Many of the glutamatergic STN projection neurons have intranuclear (local) axon collaterals making intrinsic, presumed excitatory connections within the STN (Kita, Chang and Kitai, 1983), and there is evidence for inhibitory interneurons in the STN – although the issue is somewhat controversial (Iwahori N, Yelnik and Percheron, 1979; Afsharpour, 1985; Pearson et al., 1985; Rafols and Fox, 1976). A significant number of STN neurons expressing GAD and morphologically different from STN principal glutamatergic neurons has been described (Nisbet, 1996; Levesque and Parent, 2005). Because of the GABAergic nature of those small cells, they are thought to represent subthalamic interneurons, while caution has been raised by Nisbet and collaborators that those GABA cells may also represent GABA-containing subthalamopallidal projection pathways. Both studies quantified the proportion of those neurons between 5.0 and 7.5% of STN total population. However small, those putative interneurons may indeed contribute to the decrease of baseline FR in other cell populations as well as the decrease in FR in the down cells following the activation of the up cells under noxious stimulation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
