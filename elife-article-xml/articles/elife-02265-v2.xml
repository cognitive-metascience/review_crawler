require precise temporal coordination of different muscle groups. Breathing, for example, involves the sequential activation of numerous muscles hypothesized to be driven by a primary respiratory oscillator, the preBötzinger Complex, and at least one other as-yet unidentified rhythmogenic population. We tested the roles of <italic>Atoh1-</italic>, <italic>Phox2b-</italic>, and <italic>Dbx1-</italic>derived neurons (three groups that have known roles in respiration) in the generation and coordination of respiratory output. We found that <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived neurons are necessary for all respiratory behaviors, whereas independent but coupled respiratory rhythms persist from at least three different motor pools after eliminating or silencing <italic>Phox2b-</italic> or <italic>Atoh1</italic>-expressing hindbrain neurons. Without <italic>Atoh1</italic> neurons, however, the motor pools become temporally disorganized and coupling between independent respiratory oscillators decreases. We propose <italic>Atoh1</italic> neurons tune the sequential activation of independent oscillators essential for the fine control of different muscles during breathing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02265.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02265.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02265.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A healthy adult at rest will breathe in and out around 20 times per minute. Each breath requires a complex series of coordinated muscle activity. Inhalation begins with the opening of the airway followed by the contraction of the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles between the ribs, causing the chest cavity to expand. As the lungs increase in volume, the pressure inside them drops and air is drawn in. Relaxation of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles compresses the lungs, causing us to exhale.</p><p>Breathing is driven by the brainstem and it cannot be suppressed indefinitely: holding your breath eventually triggers a reflex that forces breathing to resume. The region of the brainstem that controls breathing is called the preBötzinger Complex. However, there is increasing evidence that a second region in the brainstem is also involved. This region, which is called the retrotrapezoid nucleus/parafacial respiratory group, consists of three types of excitatory neurons—Dbx1 neurons, Phox2b neurons, and Atoh1 neurons—but their roles had not been clear. Now, using multiple lines of genetically modified mice, Tupal et al. have teased apart the roles of these three cell types.</p><p>These experiments showed that the Dbx1 neurons—which are also found in the preBötzinger Complex—have an essential role in sending the signals from the brain that drive the different muscle activities needed to breathe. The Phox2b neurons modulate breathing based on the level of carbon dioxide in the blood. Atoh1 neurons help control the sequence of respiratory muscle activity during a breath, probably by selectively inhibiting different populations of Dbx1 neurons.</p><p>The work of Tupal et al. indicates that distinct populations of neurons within the brainstem independently control two different aspects of breathing: the generation of breathing rhythms, and the coordination of these rhythms. Given that many other physiological processes involve rhythmic activity patterns, this model may help us to understand how the brain generates and controls complex behaviors more generally.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02265.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02265.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>breathing</kwd><kwd>central pattern generator</kwd><kwd>PreBötzinger Complex</kwd><kwd>oscillator</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL089742</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tupal</surname><given-names>Srinivasan</given-names></name><name><surname>Ling</surname><given-names>Guang-Yi</given-names></name><name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>Paul A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Wei-Hsiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11PRE6080004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Wei-Hsiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL104127</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Picardo</surname><given-names>Maria Cristina D</given-names></name><name><surname>Del Negro</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 NW071860</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Picardo</surname><given-names>Maria Cristina D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The rhythmic patterns of activity that underlie breathing are generated and coordinated by distinct populations of neurons within the brainstem.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the most essential and seemingly simple behaviors in mammals; breathing, requires state-dependent temporal coordination of multiple muscle groups, including the diaphragm and upper airway, to ensure unobstructed airflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>). All motor behaviors, in fact, require the coordinated activity of various muscles acting with temporal precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grillner, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2011</xref>), but the neural mechanisms underlying such temporal coordination are only starting to become clear.

Deflection of the diaphragm (inspiration) is the predominant breathing behavior in mammals and requires glutamatergic neurons within the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray, 2013</xref>).

The appearance of rhythmic abdominal activity, in vivo, or rhythmic facial cranial (VII) nerve output, in vitro, after opioid-induced inhibition of inspiration, together with data from transection experiments, have provided evidence for an independent second respiratory oscillator adjacent to the VII motor nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mellen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Janczewski and Feldman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Onimaru et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">2009</xref>).</p><p>Whereas the vast majority of excitatory neurons in the preBötC are derived from neural progenitors expressing the transcription factor (TF) <italic>Developing Brain Homeobox 1</italic> (<italic>Dbx1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray, 2013</xref>), the VII region contains three developmentally distinct excitatory neuronal populations that are prime candidates for generating abdominal and VII activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Although none has yet been conclusively shown to play a role in abdominal or VII rhythm generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>), all three populations express neurokinin 1 receptors (NK1R) and respond to Substance P (SP), and are theorized to couple with preBötC <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived glutamatergic neurons to generate coordinated respiratory behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02265.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Perinatal mouse hindbrain produces temporally coordinated respiratory output from cervical and lumbar motor pools, as well as internal intercostal respiratory muscles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon of sagittal view through caudal hindbrain indicating the locations of distinct developmentally defined glutamatergic populations important for breathing.

The IC muscle is innervated by motoneurons in the caudal thoracic spinal cord. Like the lumbar innervated abdomen, the IC is active during expiration in vivo and in more mature in vitro preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miller et al., 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Iscoe, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Legrand and Troyer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iizuka, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2004</xref>). As in preparations from older animals, we found rhythmic motor output from both cervical and lumbar roots that corresponded to rhythmic respiratory muscle activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These outputs were silenced by transection above the first cervical root (not shown), and thus require the hindbrain. In late fetal (E18.5) preparations, however, both lumbar motor roots and intercostal EMG were often co-active with cervical output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D,F</xref>). Importantly, however, cervical, lumbar, and IC activities were not identical arguing against a single source of respiratory drive for all respiratory motor pools. Cervical bursts were present without lumbar motor root or intercostal (IC) muscle activity, as is most common in adult rodents at rest (see arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), whereas both lumbar and IC activity were often active prior to the onset of cervical output, as in older preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). These data are consistent with the presence of functional and independent rhythmogenic sources of respiratory drive to cervical, thoracic, and lumbar motor pools in E18.5 mice. It further suggests these different patterns of temporal co-activation from different respiratory motor pools might be the consequence of variations in the coupling between independent respiratory oscillators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–L</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Dbx1</italic>-dependent, but not RL or RTN, neurons are necessary for respiratory rhythm generation</title><p>While these data are consistent with the coupling of a functional RTN/pFRG with the preBötC to produce coordinated cervical–lumbar motor output, the genetic identity of the essential neurons for lumbar output was unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3">Figures 1B and 3A</xref>).

WT hindbrain-spinal cord preparations produce highly reliable rhythmic cervical and lumbar motor outputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3">Figures 1C and 3B</xref>). Surprisingly, both cervical and lumbar respiratory motor outputs were still present after either elimination or silencing of RTN neurons in RL<sup>+</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> and RL<sup>+</sup>/RTN<sup>silent</sup> mice, although the cycle time between successive fictive breaths (the respiratory period) dramatically increased (p&lt;0.01 in RL<sup>+</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D,G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dubreuil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2012</xref>).

We again found that rhythmic respiratory output from both cervical and lumbar rhythms persisted, but the combined loss of both RL and RTN recovered respiratory periods to near WT levels under both baseline conditions and with SP application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Lastly, we tested the effect on lumbar output of the complete loss of <italic>Dbx1</italic>-dependent neurons in <italic>Dbx1</italic><sup>LacZ/LacZ</sup> mice (<italic>Dbx1</italic><sup>−</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), where both RL and RTN populations are unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived neurons are essential for the formation of the preBötC and rhythmic cervical output, but their role in lumbar output was unknown. In contrast to mice with loss of RL and/or RTN neurons, <italic>Dbx1</italic><sup>−</sup> mice produced no rhythmic respiratory output from either cervical or lumbar motor roots, even when stimulated with SP or elevated potassium in the hindbrain perfusion solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This failure was not due to an inability to generate spinal output of any kind, because global disinhibition of the hindbrain by application of bicuculline and strychnine produced robust but non-respiratory spinal outputs (not shown). These results are consistent with an important role for RTN neurons in modulating breathing, but undermine current hypotheses by indicating that RTN and RL neurons are neither necessary nor sufficient for lumbar respiratory motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Onimaru et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mellen and Thoby-Brisson, 2012</xref>). <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived neurons, however, are essential for the expression of both cervical and lumbar respiratory behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Independent oscillators persist in <italic>Atoh1</italic> mutant mice</title><p>The maintenance of lumbar output in RL<sup>−</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> mice raises the question of whether the networks underlying respiratory outputs to different motor pools in WT mice are generated by multiple oscillators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mellen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mellen and Thoby-Brisson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hägglund et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore et al., 2013</xref>) or by interactions within a single oscillatory population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). In WT mice, most fictive breaths showed cervical and lumbar motor co-activation. Often, however, individual cervical respiratory bursts occurred without a corresponding lumbar burst, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3">Figures 1C and 3B</xref>). Respiratory bursts in which one or more motor outputs are absent (termed deletions) occur both in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iizuka, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>). Analysis of deletions is used in spinal motor circuits as a test of independent oscillators controlling antagonist flexor and extensor muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McCrea and Rybak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grillner, 2011</xref>). In general, a single rhythmogenic source drives multiple motor outputs nearly identically. We reasoned that decreases in the number of oscillators driving motor output in mutant mice should be revealed by large decreases in, if not elimination of, respiratory deletions. This should be most true of lumbar motor outputs hypothesized to be generated by RTN/pFRG neural populations. We therefore determined the percentage of respiratory bursts in which respiratory motor pools were co-active in WT and <italic>Atoh1</italic> mutant mice.</p><p>We recorded simultaneously from three respiratory motor roots, lumbar, cervical and cranial facial (VII). VII motoneurons are directly adjacent to the location of the hypothesized secondary oscillator and can show rhythmic motor output in the absence of the preBötC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Onimaru et al., 2006</xref>). WT cervical-lumbar-VII bursts also showed highly associated output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The outputs from these three roots were not identical, however, as one might assume if they were driven by a single rhythmic source. Cervical bursts, for example, were co-active with both lumbar and VII (C+L+VII) only 29.2 ± 9% of the time (n = 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Lumbar and VII bursts were co-active with both other roots (C+L+VII) 34.9 ± 11.7% or 46.7 ± 11.3% of the time respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). All three motor pools could be active either alone or with one or the other motor pool, suggesting a high degree of independence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Cervical, lumbar, or VII roots were active independently, that is only a single motor pool was active, 23 ± 5.8%, 14 ± 6.3%, or 18.6 ± 10.4% of the time, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Our present results also match invertebrate preparations where individual oscillators increase their frequency after uncoupling from a network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mulloney, 1997</xref>). These data suggest that, in WT animals, each respiratory motor pool receives drive from independent but interconnected oscillators and that these oscillators persist in RL<sup>−</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> mice. These data further suggest that the loss of both RTN and RL neurons accentuates free-running oscillator activity induced by selective neuromodulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doi and Ramirez, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title><italic>Atoh1</italic>-dependent neurons are necessary for respiratory-related biphasic cervical bursts</title><p>The primary neurotransmitter of both RL and RTN neurons is glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stornetta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rose et al., 2009a</xref>). Consistent with their stimulatory role, the selective loss of RTN neurons leads to a significant prolongation of the inspiratory period. After the loss of both RL and RTN populations, however, the respiratory period recovered almost to WT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E,G</xref>). This raised the possibility that RL neurons mediate a net inhibitory effect on respiratory networks, possibly via activation of inhibitory neurons. Inhibition is essential for normal respiratory output to control the timing and pattern of the different respiratory muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marder and Bucher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ramirez and Viemari, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Janczewski et al., 2013</xref>). The possibility of a net inhibitory role of RL neurons led us to examine the temporal structure of respiratory motor output in WT and RL<sup>−</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> mice.</p><p>Respiratory networks produce several motor behaviors besides the basic cervical (eupneic) respiratory pattern. The best characterized of these are sighs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ramirez and Viemari, 2005</xref>), which are generated within the medulla, persist in reduced preparations, are first seen during late embryonic stages, and are increased after SP application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lieske et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballanyi and Ruangkittisakul, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapuis et al., 2014</xref>). Sighs consist of a biphasic inspiratory (cervical) burst with an initial peak of typical amplitude that, before decaying, gives rise to a larger amplitude sigh burst. This biphasic burst pattern is present under baseline conditions, both in vivo and in vitro. The sigh component of these biphasic motor outputs, however, can be decoupled from normal ‘eupneic’ bursts either pharmacologically or by blockade of inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lieske et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ramirez and Viemari, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tryba et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapuis et al., 2014</xref>). Our WT E18.5 preparations showed biphasic cervical bursts similar to sighs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B,D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B,F,G,I</xref>). Under baseline conditions, 6 of 11 preparations produced biphasic cervical bursts (54.5%). In the presence of 1 µM SP, biphasic cervical bursts increased and were present in 3 of 4 preparations (75%). Alternately, biphasic bursts decreased in the presence of 10<sup>−12</sup> M SST and were present in only 3 of 7 (42.9%) preparations. This is lower than what was recently found in E18.5 mouse in vitro slice preparations but not unreasonable given the elevated potassium used to stimulate respiratory-related output in slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapuis et al., 2014</xref>). Under baseline conditions in preparations showing biphasic cervical bursts, these augmented bursts occurred in 8.87 ± 3.16% of total cervical bursts. In addition, biphasic cervical bursts also showed a consistent biphasic lumbar pattern in which activity occurred primarily during the initial cervical peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B,F,G,I</xref>). SP increased the frequency of biphasic cervical bursts, which were often accompanied by an active inhibition of lumbar output during the second cervical peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This complex respiratory pattern was also found in cervical-lumbar-intercostal and cervical-lumbar-VII recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). In contrast to lumbar output, intercostal EMG activity was most active during the augmented burst, whereas VII output could be active during either burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">van Lunteren et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lieske et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ramirez and Viemari, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>). RL<sup>+</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> mice showed occasional biphasic cervical bursts, although lumbar activity in these events occurred during the larger peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

The interval between peaks in this 4.1% of respiratory bursts can be attributed to the inherent noise and variability in the output signals and are unlikely to reflect actual temporal disparity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>). The temporal distribution for RL<sup>−</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> mice showed a single peak temporal difference that was significantly less than in WT (median peak lag in WT = −39 ms and RL<sup>−</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> mice = −3 ms, p&lt;0.0016; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,I</xref>). This loss of normal temporal interval was not a simple consequence of low excitability in the network, because neither excitation with SP nor preBötC inhibition with SST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Onimaru et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray et al., 2010</xref>) generated any respiratory cycles with clear lumbar-cervical delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Unlike RL<sup>−</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> mice, however, RL<sup>+</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> and RL<sup>+</sup>/RTN<sup>silent</sup> mice maintained the interval between the cervical and lumbar peaks in some fictive breaths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). The overall temporal distributions in RL<sup>+</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> affected preparations were not statistically different from those of either WT or RL<sup>−</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> mice because their rhythms were extremely slow and they had far fewer respiratory bursts to analyze. These data support previous findings that RTN neurons provide a baseline excitatory drive to maintain respiratory output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Takakura et al., 2008</xref>) but suggest that RL neurons have a different function, possibly related to relative timing between motor pools.</p><p>The change of the delay interval distribution between lumbar and cervical peaks in RL<sup>−</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> mice is consistent with a change in connectivity between independent oscillators. The appearance of uncoupled fictive breaths, especially evident in cervical-lumbar-VII recordings, led us to wonder whether what might appear to be deletions at longer time scales (&gt;1 s) were, in fact, only changes in the relative timing of respiratory output such that lumbar or VII activity occurs at a different phase of the respiratory cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In vivo, the peak of activity for many respiratory neurons is delayed to late in the expiratory period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Richter, 1982</xref>). This type of phase switching is seen when moving from the simultaneous activation of legs during hopping to alternating activation during walking. To address this, we determined the phase of the peaks of lumbar and VII motor output during the cervical respiratory period (defined as Φ [0–360°] for each individual respiratory burst, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Strohl, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hwang et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Plowman et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huangfu et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Iscoe, 1998</xref>). Consistent with our interval analysis in WT mice, we found a single peak for both lumbar and VII root activity just prior to the peak of cervical output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In RL<sup>−</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> mice, the peak of both lumbar and VII activity also occurred just prior to cervical output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Interestingly, VII output showed a broadening of the phase of activity relative to cervical output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). In WT mice we found no secondary peaks that would indicate consistent phase differences. In RL<sup>−</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> mice, however, the lumbar trace showed a small second peak around 50° (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,E</xref>). This peak represented a respiratory pattern unique to RL<sup>−</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> mice that was characterized by an isolated cervical burst followed, after a pause, by lumbar and/or VII output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Together, however, these data suggest an absence of a longer timescale reorganization of respiratory activity.

We found that at this age, in vitro preparations also produce robust rhythmic output from lumbar motor pools that innervate abdominal muscles active during expiration, thoracic motor pools that innervate intercostal muscles during expiration, and VII motor pools, all of which is consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huangfu et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Iscoe, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Onimaru et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iizuka, 2010</xref>). In contrast to experiments in older animals, however, we found this lumbar output did not require altered pH or pharmacological stimulation. Moreover, we found the lumbar output overlapped cervical output for the majority of respiratory-related bursts, although the more mature ‘pre-inspiratory’ pattern was also present as in older rat in vitro preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Taccola et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Two developmentally distinct populations within the RTN/pFRG (<italic>Phox2b</italic>- and <italic>Atoh1</italic>-dependent RTN neurons) as well as <italic>Atoh1</italic>-dependent RL neurons have been hypothesized to generate the abdominal and/or VII rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Onimaru et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray, 2013</xref>). We find that both RL and RTN neurons are important for appropriately coordinated respiratory rhythm in cervical and lumbar motor pools. Respiratory periods are much longer in the absence of RTN glutamatergic neurons, consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dubreuil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). The elimination of both RL and RTN neurons, however, recovered baseline respiratory period. Not only does this reveal a previously unknown net inhibitory role for RL neurons in the control of breathing, but it also demonstrates that neither of these populations is necessary or sufficient for expiratory motor output, since both cervical and lumbar respiratory-related outputs persist after their genetic elimination. In the absence of <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived neurons, however, all rhythmic respiratory outputs were eliminated. The absence of both cervical and lumbar rhythms in <italic>Dbx1</italic> mutant mice suggests that in addition to its inspiratory rhythmogenic role in the preBötC, <italic>Dbx1</italic> is essential for the development of neurons necessary for the expression of rhythmic respiratory output from other motor pools, although the exact location of these neurons remains unknown. <italic>Dbx1-</italic>dependent neurons have recently been shown to play an important role in locomotor pattern generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Talpalar et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The temporal overlap of lumbar and cervical bursts raised the question whether the lumbar output seen in E18.5 wild-type preparations is generated by the same networks that produce active expiration in more mature in vitro preparations or in vivo. We propose that this is the case for three reasons. First, we found that lumbar and cervical activities were not identical. Either output could occur either in isolation or with a distinct temporal separation. This same pattern of independent motor activity was also seen in respiratory output from internal intercostal muscles or VII motor roots, suggesting it is a general property of respiratory motor pools. Second, output from lumbar and thoracic roots (which innervate expiratory musculature) has previously been shown to require structures outside of the preBötC and the rostral ventral respiratory group, which are the well-established sources of rhythmic inspiratory drive and premotor innervation to the phrenic motor pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miller et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Merrill and Lipski, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sasaki et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Iscoe, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Janczewski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Almeida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ford and Kirkwood, 2013</xref>). These anatomical differences are consistent with independent sources of respiratory drive to different motor pools serving inspiration and expiration, respectively, although we cannot rule out changes in connectivity during maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Iscoe, 1998</xref>). Third, simultaneous co-activation of cervical and lumbar roots is also present in older in vitro rat preparations, suggesting it is only the relative percentage of respiratory bursts showing one or the other pattern that changes, not the ability to generate each pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Taccola et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We further provide evidence that each respiratory motor pool receives input from independent but coupled oscillators that interact within the timescale of an individual respiratory event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carroll and Ramirez, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore et al., 2013</xref>). Respiratory networks are capable of reconfiguring to produce different patterns of respiratory outputs, such as sighs, depending upon the behavioral or modulatory state of the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lieske et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doi and Ramirez, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapuis et al., 2014</xref>). We extend those findings to include activation of lumbar, thoracic, and VII motor pools, which are normally, but not obligatorily, active during different phases of the respiratory cycle. We observed that sigh-like cervical patterns corresponded with lumbar outputs active primarily only during the initial eupneic phase, whereas intercostal and VII outputs were active during both biphasic cervical bursts. In contrast to these motor outputs, 95% of preBötC inspiratory neurons are active during both inspiratory bursts and during sighs, which suggests that the differential gating of motor output occurs outside the putative inspiratory oscillator or by transient reconfigurations within respiratory populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tryba et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapuis et al., 2014</xref>). We speculate that the differences in the timing and presence of respiratory outputs from lumbar and thoracic motor pools between these late fetal and more mature preparations are related to differences in the balance of synaptic interactions between hindbrain neurons and not the absence of connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Perreault and Glover, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The loss of both RTN and RL neurons does not preclude respiratory deletions but does lead to periods of transient decoupling of respiratory motor rhythms (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Between control and RL<sup>−</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> mice, individual motor pools differed in their co-activation. Lumbar outputs increased but cervical decreased their percentage of solitary activity. These data are inconsistent with a role for RL and RTN populations in generating lumbar respiratory output. It is important to note that the strong coupling of the cervical, lumbar, and VII motor roots in RL<sup>−</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> mice suggests that the excitatory connections likely arising from the preBötC are maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore et al., 2013</xref>). In RL<sup>−</sup>/RTN<sup>−</sup> mice, the temporal overlap between cervical and lumbar output was nearly complete, again raising the question of the independence of the drives to each motor pool. Because there is no evidence in the literature that loss of <italic>Atoh1</italic> would affect <italic>Atoh1</italic>-independent projection patterns, we suggest the temporal gap is lost because of differences in connectivity between hindbrain respiratory populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miesegaes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rose et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kohl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Perreault and Glover, 2013</xref>). We find that the loss of both RL and RTN neurons eliminates respiratory bursts with intervals longer than 150 ms between respiratory oscillators, that is, each population can be co-active or independent but lacks the capacity for the short temporal gaps necessary for normal breathing patterns.</p><p>We interpret these results to indicate that the loss of RL neurons eliminates a net inhibitory effect on preBötC <italic>Dbx1</italic> neurons, likely via reciprocally connected inhibitory interneurons. Recent work has found that biphasic inspiratory bursts (sighs) begin during late embryogenesis and that the temporal delay between eupneic and sigh components is dependent upon the strength of synaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapuis et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the density of the co-transporter necessary for setting the chloride equilibrium potential in the medulla increases significantly during the post-natal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu and Wong-Riley, 2012</xref>). This suggests the difference in the relative percentage of respiratory cervical-lumbar bursts showing temporal delays above 150 ms between our E18.5 preparations and older animals may be simply a consequence of generally weaker synaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greer et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We propose RL neurons play an essential role in the coordination of mammalian breathing behavior by modulating the inhibitory interneurons that produce the temporal lag between independent oscillators. This modulation also helps stabilize coupled oscillators preventing independent or unwanted activation. This has the advantage that temporal delays can be controlled without strongly affecting the rhythmogenic properties of the underlying oscillators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hill et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grillner, 2006</xref>). It is also possible, however, that the loss of <italic>Atoh1</italic> neurons indirectly affects respiratory networks by modulating the development of inhibitory populations or the overall maturation of hindbrain circuits. It is important to point out that we were unable to selectively eliminate lumbar motor output in any of our genetic manipulations. While our data are consistent with the presence of independent respiratory oscillators, we cannot rule out that the variability we see between respiratory motor pools is the consequence of higher level network interactions between a single distributed respiratory oscillator and small pools of respiratory premotor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, whether there are discrete anatomical boundaries between these putative independent oscillators is also unknown.</p><p><italic>Atoh1</italic> is essential for the development of a number of important neural populations in vertebrates. One general characteristic of many of these populations is their importance for the temporal coordination of the activity of different populations, be it fast motor coordination for neurons of the cerebellum or auditory processing in the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maricich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miesegaes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rose et al., 2009a</xref>). This temporal functionality is also consistent with previous data indicating a role for the <italic>Atoh1</italic>-derived RL neurons of the parabrachial nucleus in the phase-dependent inhibition of inspiratory output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Richter et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gray, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rose et al., 2009a</xref>). These data emphasize that phasic inhibition influences respiratory patterns but is not rhythmogenic per se, as has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Smith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdala et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Richter and Smith, 2014</xref>).</p><p>An influential model proposes that simple behaviors are generated by glutamatergic interneurons controlling the activation of segmentally organized unit burst oscillators (central pattern generators) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grillner, 2011</xref>). These excitatory unit-burst-oscillator networks are putatively coupled to inhibitory interneurons such that independent modules generate the activity underlying muscle groups that must be properly coordinated, for example, flexors and extensors across hinge joints in locomotion or specific left-right axial muscles in body segments during swimming. Recent work provides evidence for unit burst oscillator modules coordinated by inhibition in the mammalian spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dougherty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hägglund et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Talpalar et al., 2013</xref>). We propose that the mammalian respiratory network is organized in a similar fashion, with separate oscillators driving specific cervical and lumbar motor pools, in which the preBötC plays the central organizing role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore et al., 2013</xref>). The fact that RL glutamatergic neurons are not necessary for rhythmogenesis implies that the generation of rhythm and the modulation of phase timing are controlled by separate populations. This shared control is similar to proposed networks of coupled independent oscillators in invertebrate motor neurons but represents a novel viewpoint in vertebrate systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hill et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jezzini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mulloney and Hall, 2007</xref>). Whether <italic>Atoh1</italic>-dependent neurons control temporal intervals between independent oscillators only in breathing or also in other rhythmic behaviors is an interesting question for future research.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Experiments were done in accordance with the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Care et al., 1985</xref>).

After transferring the preparation into the recording chamber, the brainstem and spinal cord compartments were rendered mutually impervious with petroleum jelly. Allowing ∼30 min for stabilization, the extracellular electrophysiological recordings were made (acquisition rate 4 kHz) simultaneously from a cervical (C2–C6) and a lumbar (L1) ventral spinal motor root using suction electrodes, differentially amplified (low noise Grass Instruments, band pass filtering [0.3–3 kHz]), digitized using an analog to digital converter (AD instruments, Colorado Springs, CO) and then integrated over time (absolute value with a 100 ms decay time constant) using LabChart 7 Pro software (version 7.2.4, AD Instruments). Similarly, triple recordings were also made using an additional suction electrode to record from facial nerve or a sharp tungsten microelectrode (10 mΩ impedance and 1 µm tip diameter; FHC, inc.) to record electromyograph from intercostal muscle XI (IC) in a non-partitioned bath as previously described in neonatal rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iizuka, 1999</xref>). After recording baseline activity, 1 μM substance P (SP) or 10<sup>−12</sup> M somatostatin (SST) in aCSF was added selectively to the brainstem compartment in the partitioned bath preparations. In some early experiments, we used an enhanced aCSF suggested to increase the percentage of respiratory bursts with lumbar activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iizuka, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ruangkittisakul et al., 2008</xref>). We found no changes in the percent of lumbar bursts nor any differences in the phase distributions of fictive breaths, so we combined both solutions when comparing deletion and time lag. The peak time and amplitude, phase difference and inter-burst intervals (period) were determined for cervical, lumbar, and facial nerve bursts as well as for IC. The comparisons of cervical and lumbar periods indicative of respiratory frequency were made between the different genotypes by direct comparison, whereas the amplitudes of the integrated respiratory bursts were first normalized against the baseline arithmetic mean determined individually. The percentage of inspiratory and expiratory deletions was also calculated from each recording and these values were then compared between treatments and mouse lines. In cases of triple recording involving facial nerve, the relative degree of phase separation for the lumbar and facial nerve bursts from the preceding cervical burst (Φ) was determined by equating the instantaneous cervical inter-burst interval period to 360°. Moreover, coupling efficiencies of rhythms whose integrated peaks occurred within 1 s period of a cervical inspiratory burst were quantified and compared in facial nerve and IC triple recordings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Slice recordings</title><p>Transverse slices (550 µm thick) from neonatal (P0-P2) <italic>Atoh1</italic>-Cre<sup>TG</sup> X Rosa26-stop-YFP or tdTomato mice were dissected and prepared for recordings as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hayes and Del Negro, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Picardo et al., 2013</xref>).

Patch recordings employed a Dagan IX2-700 amplifier (Minneapolis, MN). Respiratory-related motor output was monitored from XII nerves with extracellular suction electrodes and a high-gain differential amplifier with band-pass filtering (0.3–1 kHz) (Dagan EX4-400), full-wave rectified and smoothed for display. Data were acquired using Chart software and a Powerlab 4/30 (ADInstruments). A liquid junction potential, which measured 1 mV, was not corrected in current-clamp experiments.

Using genetic lines that eliminate neurons that require certain transcription factors they assess the role of these genetic deletions on the breathing rhythm assayed electrophysiologically in the embryonic brainstem/spinal cord. They provide evidence that RL neurons do not generate the expiratory rhythm but are necessary for the coordination of expiration and inspiration. They further explore the origins of the expiratory rhythm itself. Their hypotheses about how expiration is generated and about the role of RL neurons in coordinating expiration and inspiration are novel and potentially transformative in the field. All three reviewers had high enthusiasm for these ideas but serious concerns that the authors do themselves and the field a disservice by publishing prematurely without necessary supporting data and analyses. The expert reviewers have several concerns detailed in their reviews that should be helpful to the authors.</p><p>Three major issues should be addressed to substantiate the conclusions of the authors so that these conclusions can be widely accepted.</p><p>1) The authors must provide supporting evidence that their expiratory recordings indeed show expiratory bursts and not inspiratory or mixed bursts.</p><p>2) The authors must precisely and quantitatively define coordination between expiration and inspiration. It is very confusing that the 'proper coordination' appears sporadic even in control preparations - moreover synchrony is a coordination.</p><p>3) The authors must clearly show that what they call sighs are indeed sighs and describe in detail their internal coordination.</p><p>The various expert reviewers address these 3 issues from different vantage points but all agree on their importance.</p><p>[Editors’ note: minor comments have not been included in the reviews below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors combine genetic and electrophysiological experimental studies to address the role of RL and RTN neurons in the mouse brainstem. Using genetic lines that eliminate neurons that require certain transcription factors they assess the role of these genetic deletions on the breathing rhythm assayed electrophysiologically in the embryonic brainstem/spinal cord with special reference to the expiratory rhythm which is currently not well understood. They find that the RL and RTN are not necessary or sufficient for the expiratory rhythm and uncover a hidden inhibitory role of the RL on the PreBotC, which controls the inspiratory rhythm. They then go on to show that the RL is necessary for expiration to lead inspiration as is the 'predominant' mode in adults and conclude it provides coordinating inhibition to the inspiratory rhythm generator in the PreBotC. Their results further indicate an independent but unidentified expiratory rhythm generator that requires the Dbx1 TF.</p><p>The writing is succinct but the paper is very dense and not that easy to follow. The figures are very complex and the legends hyperdense, but do provide the necessary data. The work appears carefully done with sufficient attention to detail and adequate numbers of experiments. The work may prove controversial in the respiration community because does not fit with existing conclusion about the role of RL and RTN in expiration, but really the results are hard to assail on that front. The respiratory rhythm generator is a well-studied motor network in vertebrates and has great significance for understanding general mechanisms in the brain and in health.</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>1) I am not qualified to judge the genetic deletions for completeness and specificity but there is supporting data that appears sound to a non-expert.</p><p>2) My major problem with the paper arises from the loose manner in which the coordination between inspiration and expiration is described. Originally it is claimed that a lag of &gt;150 ms between expiration and inspiration is normal for the adult nervous system “...active expiration usually precedes inspiratory output by hundreds of milliseconds (when both are present...'), but the % of fictive 'breaths' with this relation is not given. Then the normal WT coordination in the embryonic nervous system is described with only ∼26% of fictive 'breaths' show a lag of &gt;150 ms between expiration and inspiration. Thus it is unclear to me what is normal for this coordination: near synchrony or an expiratory lead (inspiratory lag). If majority %ages of an expiratory lead (inspiratory lag) are seen in adult nervous system then adult-like is appropriate as a description for this coordination. Even then the authors should each time make clear that they are speaking of coordination at all times, because the inspiration and expiration can be near coincident (i.e., near synchrony is a coordination) but that the ability of expiration to lead is missing in the transgenic lines (genetic deletions). Thus coordination is always present but certain intervals, rare though they may be in WT embryonic nervous system, are not present in the transgenics. Making this distinction clear is important because otherwise it is hard for a non-respiration expert to follow. In several places in the text I have high-lighted places where the authors should make this distinction.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Despite the fact that the paper proposes an interesting new hypothesis there are several concerns that need to be addressed in order first to make the figures more supportive to the conclusions made (in other terms given the illustrations presented the authors are over-interpreting their data), to render the paper more demonstrative (average and quantifications required) and the writing more rigorous. Amongst the large number of concerns only the major ones are detailed below:</p><p>- Two recent studies demonstrated that Dbx1-derived neurons do not contribute to the RTN/pFRG oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray et al., 2010</xref>). The authors should justify why they consider some Dbx1-derived neurons as part of the RTN/pFRG in the introduction?</p><p>- Why the expiratory bursts recorded from L1 do not show a typical bi-phasic discharge pattern as demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Janczewski et al (2002)</xref>?</p><p>- How do the authors explain that Substance P has no effect on the inspiratory period in the WT?, and that SP increases inspiratory period in the RL-/RTN- animals?</p><p>- The entire demonstration that RL neurons exert an inhibitory effect on the respiratory networks is absolutely not convincing. Sigh definition, samples selected for the illustration, the lack of quantification and contradictions in different part of the text prevent this part of the study to be demonstrative. It has been previously shown that inhibition serves to temporally associate the two components of a sigh burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lieske et al., 2000</xref>). Are the mutants generating two types of burst differing in terms of amplitude and frequency with no time relation (as it is the case in WT after blockade of inhibition)? If yes then the possibility that inhibition is deficient could eventually be proposed, but otherwise the complete absence of sigh does not necessarily mean a deficit in inhibition. In addition the sigh generating mechanisms have been shown to be an intrinsic properties of the preBötzinger network itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lieske et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tryba et al., 2008</xref>), so it is unclear how an inhibition originating from the RL neurons would play any role.</p><p>- The observation that L1 activity is missing in the Dbx mutant is interesting because this has not been documented yet.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ronald Calabrese (Reviewing editor); Nino Ramirez (peer reviewer).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors combine genetic and electrophysiological experimental studies to address the role of RL and RTN neurons in the control of respiration in the mouse brainstem. Using genetic lines that eliminate neurons that require certain transcription factors they assess the role of these genetic deletions on the breathing rhythm assayed electrophysiologically in the embryonic brainstem/spinal cord. They provide evidence that neither RL Atoh1 neurons nor RTN Phox 2b neurons generate the expiratory rhythm but RL Atoh1 neurons tune the sequential activation of independent oscillators essential for the fine control of different muscles during breathing. Their hypotheses about how expiration is generated and about the role or RL neurons in coordinating expiration and inspiration are novel and potentially transformative in the field. The paper contains new data and analyses that improve it over a previous submission.</p><p>1) The manuscript needs revision to make the presentation more accessible to a general audience. The data and figures and indeed the writing describing the data/figures are very complicated and the general reader will need a lot more guidance. Even experts in respiration need more guidance. Perhaps one method that will help the reader is to have the proposed circuit of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> brought up front in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> as an hypothesis to be tested and at the same time introduce the icons of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G-I</xref>. Then for each set of traces these icons could be used to guide the reader to see what interaction is being illustrated. The writing needs to use these iconic guides. The icons will also help is showing which neuron group is genetically eliminated in each experiment and/or is the target of peptide modulation or drugs and how these manipulations adjust the proposed circuit.</p><p>Creative use of icons and adjustments in writing could make the paper a lot easier to follow. Any way that the figures can be simplified by reducing the number of individual traces would be helpful. The legends to the figures need to be made as clear as possible even if this means expanding the number of words, and they should refer to the icons in each case. We found the delay histograms of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F-H</xref> and the phase histograms of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> particularly difficult because they are described by overly dense and telegraphic legends. The supplemental figures need to be incorporated into the flow directly or eliminated.</p><p>2) The analysis of “sighs” remains a problem from the last submission. The authors should simply refer to these as double bursts in the Results and then in Discussion bring up their possible relationship to sighs. The double bursts should be quantified and a conservative course set in Discussion.</p><p>3) Another concern from the original submission is that only ∼25% of the normal bursts show 'normal' coordination. There should be some comment on this issue. How do you interpret this low percentage? It would seem to imply that the network capriciously teeters between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>. Is this how you see it?</p><p>4) The question of independent oscillators is complicated. It is possible to view the results as supporting 3 independent oscillators. On the other hand, as another reviewer points out, all the oscillations are driven by DBX1 cells and differential sensitivity to opiates has not been established so independent oscillators may not be supported. The authors need to address this issue squarely.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02265.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>1) The authors must provide supporting evidence that their expiratory recordings indeed show expiratory bursts and not inspiratory or mixed bursts</italic>.</p><p><italic>The reviewers wondered whether rhythmic output from lumbar nerve roots was directly related to expiration as seen in vivo because, in late embryonic preparations, the peak of cervical output (inspiration) and the peak of lumbar output (possibly expiration) overlap temporally the majority of the time. This is an important question, because if what we are recording actually represents inspiration then our data say nothing about the genetic origin of expiratory motor output</italic>.</p><p>First, we recognize that the use of the term expiration to describe motor output, which (at best) occurs slightly before inspiration and more often is co-active with inspiration, is confusing. Expiration itself is often divided into stages with the period just prior to inspiration being called either late expiration or pre-inspiration. Even inspiration itself is more complicated, as each specific burst could be a eupneic breath, a sigh, a gasp or unrelated to breathing. We have decided it is more precise to step back from the terms inspiration and expiration but rather to simply name the motor root we are recording from, i.e., cervical or lumbar. We recognize it is widely accepted to describe cervical motor output as inspiration, but using only that one term was somewhat unwieldy. This is similar to descriptions of motor output in invertebrate systems. We do in places use the term “breath” in relation to the motor bursts to reinforce the respiratory-related nature of these outputs.</p><p>To address whether lumbar motor nerve roots generate expiratory-related output in more mature animals, we performed two different sets of new experiments. First, at the suggestion of all three reviewers, we examined the relationship between cervical and lumbar root activity with EMG muscle activity recorded from the XIth internal intercostal space (ICXI) in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). ICXI was chosen because it was accessible, allowed for simultaneous cervical and lumbar root recording, and, most importantly, was previously shown to be active out of phase with the inspiratory drive from cervical roots both in vivo and in previous in vitro experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iizuka, 2004</xref>). ICXI is driven by motoneurons in the caudal thoracic spinal cord, so it sits between the cervical and lumbar motor pools previously analyzed. Consistent with our previous recordings, the peak of ICXI activity most often occurred close in time to both cervical and lumbar respiratory outputs. However, also similar to previous recordings, the output of ICXI was not identical to cervical or lumbar outputs. Even in breaths in which lumbar output preceded cervical output, ICXI could be co-active with lumbar or both lumbar and cervical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, in breaths with biphasic sigh-like cervical bursts, ICXI was most active during the sigh-like burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus when recording from 3 roots, we found the timing and presence of activity were not consistent with being inspiratory output. These data are also consistent with previous work in rats and cats showing that respiratory drives to thoracic and lumbar motor pools, which drive caudal intercostal and abdominal muscles, emanate from neurons outside the preBötzinger Complex or rVRG, the proposed sources of inspiratory rhythm generation and phrenic premotor drive, respectively.</p><p>From each litter of Atoh1LacZ/+ crosses we have a window of a few minutes after C-section to guess which animal has the correct genotype based purely on the absence of breathing. This extremely limited time window and guesswork, coupled with the difficulty of the EMG recording experiments per se, has precluded successful EMG recordings in Atoh1 mutant mice. For many reasons, including both resource limits and ethical concerns about the number of animals that will need to be bred and sacrificed to generate a reasonable number of these recordings, we have decided not to continue these experiments.</p><p>Because the question of the relationship of lumbar output to expiration is important, we performed an additional series of new in vitro experiments in which we simultaneously recorded from lumbar, cervical, and VII motor roots in both WT and Atoh1 mutant animals (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Previous work has shown that VII output can occur in preparations that lack the preBötC. Also, The VII nucleus is directly adjacent to population(s) proposed to constitute a preBötC-independent respiratory oscillators related to expiration. In WT we again found that many breaths corresponded to overlapping co-activation of cervical, lumbar, and VII roots. Additionally, we found that each root can be active independently of the other and that for any breath any temporal sequence of the three motor roots is possible. In Atoh1 mutant mice, this same pattern of co-expression and independence of motor pool output persists. Importantly, however, we found that the pattern of independent rhythmic output we noticed in cervical-lumbar recording was more pronounced when analyzing three simultaneous root recordings.</p><p>We interpret these data to mean that in WT E18.5 mice, the motor outputs we record from lumbar, thoracic, and VII roots are driven by different neuron populations of neurons than the cervical inspiratory oscillator. We also suggest that these independent networks persist and play an essential role in the generation of cervical, lumbar, and VII motor output from Atoh1 mutant mice. We are clear to say that these different networks interact and their interaction is responsible for the temporal delays and coordination we see between motor pools. This is similar to recent findings in spinal cord networks showing independent activation of flexor and extensor motor outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hägglund et al., 2013</xref>)</p><p><italic>2) The authors must precisely and quantitatively define coordination between expiration and inspiration.

Using genetic lines that eliminate neurons that require certain transcription factors they assess the role of these genetic deletions on the breathing rhythm assayed electrophysiologically in the embryonic brainstem/spinal cord with special reference to the expiratory rhythm which is currently not well understood. They find that the RL and RTN are not necessary or sufficient for the expiratory rhythm and uncover a hidden inhibitory role of the RL on the PreBotC, which controls the inspiratory rhythm. They then go on to show that the RL is necessary for expiration to lead inspiration as is the 'predominant' mode in adults and conclude it provides coordinating inhibition to the inspiratory rhythm generator in the PreBotC. Their results further indicate an independent but unidentified expiratory rhythm generator that requires the Dbx1 TF</italic>.</p><p><italic>The writing is succinct but the paper is very dense and not that easy to follow. The figures are very complex and the legends hyperdense, but do provide the necessary data. The work appears carefully done with sufficient attention to detail and adequate numbers of experiments. The work may prove controversial in the respiration community because does not fit with existing conclusion about the role of RL and RTN in expiration, but really the results are hard to assail on that front. The respiratory rhythm generator is a well-studied motor network in vertebrates and has great significance for understanding general mechanisms in the brain and in health</italic>.</p><p><italic>Concerns</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) I am not qualified to judge the genetic deletions for completeness and specificity but there is supporting data that appears sound to a non-expert</italic>.</p><p>The completeness of genetic deletion is always of concern. We, and others, have previously published detailed analysis of the mice used in these experiments. The anatomical losses of both the Atoh1LacZ/LacZ and Phox2b-Cre;Atoh1LacZ/F within the RTN region have been published (Rose et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Both the Phox2b-Cre and the VGlut2F/F have been extensively characterized and were used as control for specificity of the other lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rossi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) My major problem with the paper arises from the loose manner in which the coordination between inspiration and expiration is described. Originally it is claimed that a lag of &gt;150 ms between expiration and inspiration is normal for the adult nervous system “...active expiration usually precedes inspiratory output by hundreds of milliseconds (when both are present...'), but the % of fictive 'breaths' with this relation is not given. Then the normal WT coordination in the embryonic nervous system is described with only ∼26% of fictive 'breaths' show a lag of &gt;150 ms between expiration and inspiration. Thus it is unclear to me what is normal for this coordination: near synchrony or an expiratory lead (inspiratory lag). If majority %ages of an expiratory lead (inspiratory lag) are seen in adult nervous system then adult-like is appropriate as a description for this coordination</italic>.</p><p>We inadequately explained how our findings relate to the existing literature in adults. We clarified the text throughout the revision. What is “normal” is complicated. The respiratory field has largely been interested in the question of inspiration and most (nearly all) of the analysis surrounding expiratory activity has been qualitative. Normally expiration is completely passive in adult mammals. Active respiratory output to abdominal and internal intercostal muscles is state-dependent and usually requires a stimulus such as CO2 or hypoxia, which boosts respiratory function overall. Motor output is then described as expiratory if it is not co-active with the diaphragm. Abdominal motor output is silent or at least decreased during inspiration. There is actually very little quantitative analysis of the temporal relation between late expiration (also referred to as pre-inspiration, E2, or Eb) with inspiration. We found one reference where we could infer the delay between abdominal and phrenic output to vary between less than 300ms to over 500 ms in an adult, anesthetized rat breathing elevated CO2 or decreased O2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Iizuka and Fregosi, 2007</xref>). We also cite a second reference showing that a minority of post-natal in vitro preparations also produce breaths where cervical and lumbar roots are co-active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Taccola et al., 2007</xref>). Together we interpret these data to indicate that the patterns of motor output we see in E18.5 WT preparations are relevant for understanding how adult networks produce expiratory behaviors.</p><p><italic>Even then the authors should each time make clear that they are speaking of coordination at all times, because the inspiration and expiration can be near coincident (i.e., near synchrony is a coordination) but that the ability of expiration to lead is missing in the transgenic lines (genetic deletions). Thus coordination is always present but certain intervals, rare though they may be in WT embryonic nervous system, are not present in the transgenics. Making this distinction clear is important because otherwise it is hard for a non-respiration expert to follow. In several places in the text I have high-lighted places where the authors should make this distinction</italic>.</p><p>We modified the title, abstract, and text to be more specific. For example, in our previous abstract we stated “Without RL neurons, however, temporal coordination between independent oscillators is abolished.” This has been modified to “Without Atoh1 neurons, however, the requisite temporal delays between motor pools are abolished and coupling between independent respiratory oscillators decreases”. Similarly the section previously titled “Rhombic lip neurons are necessary for inspiratory-expiratory temporal coordination” is now titled “Rhombic lip neurons are necessary for respiratory motor pool temporal delay”. Within that section, the sentence which previously read “These data indicate these reduced preparations can produce adult-like patterns of respiratory output complete with tight temporal coordination,” now reads “These data indicate these reduced preparations can produce the adult-like respiratory pattern of lumbar activity preceding cervical activity” .</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>Despite the fact that the paper proposes an interesting new hypothesis there are several concerns that need to be addressed in order first to make the figures more supportive to the conclusions made (in other terms given the illustrations presented the authors are over-interpreting their data)</italic>, <italic>to render the paper more demonstrative (average and quantifications required) and the writing more rigorous. Amongst the large number of concerns only the major ones are detailed below:</italic></p><p><italic>- Two recent studies demonstrated that Dbx1-derived neurons do not contribute to the RTN/pFRG oscillator (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4"><italic>Bouvier et al., 2010</italic></xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21"><italic>Gray et al., 2010</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>. <italic>The authors should justify why they consider some Dbx1-derived neurons as part of the RTN/pFRG in the introduction?</italic></p><p>The terminology of respiratory regions within the caudal pons is confusing even for many of us in the field. The term RTN/pFRG has been used to describe the general region of the brain thought to contain a putative expiratory oscillator but does not define a unique population nor does it have accepted boundaries (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray, 2013</xref>)).</p><p>The term RTN is accepted to represent a population of Atoh1+, Phox2b+, TH-, Lbx1+, VGlut2+ neurons surrounding the VII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guyenet and Mulkey, 2010</xref>). In adult rats these neurons play an important role in chemosensitivity. This same population has also been called the ePF, embryonic parafacial region by Fortin and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>). In Dbx1 mutant mice the Phox2b+ RTN neurons are not affected.</p><p>The term pFRG (parafacial respiratory group) was defined functionally, ten years ago, by voltage-sensitive dye studies that identified a region near the VIIn that was active prior to the preBötzinger Complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Onimaru and Homma, 2003</xref>). The region defined by these experiments only partially overlaps the Phox2b+ neurons of the RTN. While some neurons with firing patterns consistent with being pFRG neurons have been shown to express Phox2b, the genetic identity and boundaries of the pFRG are undefined. Other work in adult rats also suggests populations adjacent to the VII, but outside the RTN, strongly affects breathing and expiration.</p><p>Thus several groups have used the term RTN/pFRG as an imprecise but inclusive term to describe the general region surrounding the VII that plays a role in modulating breathing. I should point out that prior to the identification of specific genetic markers, the boundaries of the preBötC were similarly unclear between 1991 and 1999, and then it was ten more years before the developmental and genetic basis for understanding the preBötC core came to the fore.</p><p><italic>- Why the expiratory bursts recorded from L1 do not show a typical bi-phasic discharge pattern as demonstrated by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41"><italic>Janczewski et al (2002)</italic></xref><italic>?</italic></p><p>We describe this above in response to reviewer #1. Briefly, we do see breaths with lumbar and cervical delay, but they represent only a subset of breaths. Iizuka has shown that the phase of abdominal output changes between post-natal and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iizuka, 2010</xref>). The differences we see likely relate to differences in the maturation of respiratory circuits.</p><p><italic>- How do the authors explain that Substance P has no effect on the inspiratory period in the WT?</italic>, <italic>and that SP increases inspiratory period in the RL-/RTN- animals?</italic></p><p>The effect of SP on breathing depends heavily on the model system and the baseline conditions. In anesthetized in vivo rat, SP injection directly within the preBötC does not affect respiratory frequency, but produces sighs (Gray 2001). In in vitro experiments, the SP only had effects on frequency in preparations with slow initial frequencies (Yamamoto et al., 1992). This is in contrast to a strong frequency effect of SP on preBötC slices. In our experiments we include the entire hindbrain and the neurokinin 1 receptor is expressed in many places outside the respiratory regions we have focused on here. This includes the Atoh1-derived dorso-lateral pons.</p><p>We used SP because it has become a fairly standard stimulant of breathing and useful for comparing between papers. We find that SP does not have a statistically significant effect on frequency in either wild type or Atoh1 mutant mice but does increase the very slow rhythm of RTN- mice. This, in part, may be due to the increased instability of these late embryonic preparations. As SP did not produce a change in the pattern of lumbar activation but did affect deletions and pattern formation, especially in Atoh1 mutant, we did not focus on analyzing the frequency effect.</p><p><italic>- The entire demonstration that RL neurons exert an inhibitory effect on the respiratory networks is absolutely not convincing</italic>.</p><p>We agree this was an over-interpretation of the data.. We have modified the text in the discussion from “We interpret these results to indicate that RL neurons inhibit preBötC Dbx1 neurons, via reciprocally connected inhibitory interneurons” to We interpret these results to indicate that the loss of RL neurons eliminates a net inhibitory effect on preBötC Dbx1 neurons, likely via reciprocally connected inhibitory interneurons, and play an essential role in the coordination of mammalian breathing behavior by modulating the temporal lag between independent oscillators”. We are careful, however, to point out both in the initial description of our model and in the discussion that this inhibition in an interpretation of our results and not direct evidence of inhibition.</p><p><italic>Sigh definition, samples selected for the illustration, the lack of quantification and contradictions in different part of the text prevent this part of the study to be demonstrative. It has been previously shown that inhibition serves to temporally associate the two components of a sigh burst (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46"><italic>Lieske et al., 2000</italic></xref><italic>). Are the mutants generating two types of burst differing in terms of amplitude and frequency with no time relation (as it is the case in WT after blockade of inhibition)? If yes then the possibility that inhibition is deficient could eventually be proposed, but otherwise the complete absence of sigh does not necessarily mean a deficit in inhibition. In addition the sigh generating mechanisms have been shown to be an intrinsic properties of the preBötzinger network itself (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46"><italic>Lieske et al., 2000</italic></xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99"><italic>Tryba et al., 2008</italic></xref><italic>), so it is unclear how an inhibition originating from the RL neurons would play any role</italic>.</p><p>We agree our discussion of sighs was unclear and have significantly modified our Discussion to better fit the data (see above and responses to Reviewer #3).</p><p>The amplitudes and periods of respiratory output in these late embryonic preparations is more variable than in older animals, so we do not have the power to define sighs in the absence of a biphasic cervical burst. We do point out, however, that the patterns of output we see during sigh bursts in the WT – activation of cervical nerve roots but inhibition of lumbar nerve roots – do persist in Atoh1 mutants. The only deficit is the absence of biphasic cervical bursts. RL neurons could modulate sighs, even in slices, because the RL neurons are present throughout the medulla, including at the level of the preBötC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray 2013</xref>).</p><p><italic>- The observation that L1 activity is missing in the Dbx mutant is interesting because this has not been documented yet. However, the conclusion that the expiratory oscillator might depend upon Dbx1-derived neurons might be an overstatement. Indeed Dbx1 could be required for the specification of one element of the expiratory pathway but not necessarily the oscillator per se</italic>.</p><p>We whole-heartedly agree. In the text we now state clearly that Dbx1 is necessary for the expression of the behaviors, not that Dbx1 neurons generate the rhythm. For example:</p><p>“Dbx1-derived neurons, however, are essential for the expression of both cervical and lumbar respiratory behaviors.”</p><p>“The absence of both cervical and lumbar rhythms in Dbx1 mutant mice suggests that in addition to its inspiratory rhythmogenic role in the preBötC, Dbx1 is essential for the development of neurons necessary for the expression of rhythmic respiratory output from other motor pools, although the exact location of these neurons is, as yet, unknown.”</p><p><italic>- The authors should justify why they chose to record from YFP-Atoh1 derived neurons located in the ventrolateral medulla rostral to the preBötC but caudal to the RTN and not in other Atoh1-positive neuronal populations. One example of a YFP+ neuron receiving inhibition during inspiration (called expiratory neuron in the legend) is presented. Is this neuron part of the expiratory generator? If yes then we can suspect that Dbx1-derived neurons are also Atoh1+. Does such a population of neurons exist in the Bötzinger region? The authors used this neuron as an indication that at least some Atoh1 neurons within the medulla are synchronized to respiratory output</italic>. <italic>What can be the relevance of a result observed only once??</italic></p><p>We recorded at that level to examine whether Atoh1 neurons were strongly respiratory-modulated, like the majority of neurons within the ventrolateral medulla in preBötC-containing slices. More rostral populations are not accessible in visualized patch recordings. Atoh1 neurons release glutamate, but are not part of the preBötC because they are not Dbx1-derived. Like Dbx1, however, Atoh1-derived neurons form a column of neurons extending the length of the hindbrain. Furthermore, Atoh1 neurons are present at the level of the BötC, but because they are not glycinergic, Atoh1 neurons would not be considered part of the BötC per se. As we see no change in lumbar motor output in Atoh1 mutant mice, these neurons are not part of the expiratory oscillator. Although we only saw a single respiratory Atoh1 neuron, it is evidence these types of neurons exist and provides some of the first evidence that expiratory neurons at the level of the preBötC can be excitatory.</p><p><italic>-</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5"><italic>Figures 4 and 5</italic></xref><italic>: a single sample used as an illustration without any average traces, quantification of any parameters and long term recordings is not a strong demonstration that could support any conclusions.

The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and Figure 7–figure supplement 1 show average traces in WT and Atoh1 mutant mice. This new figure now clearly demonstrates the flexibility of the WT pattern and lack of temporal lag in the Atoh1 mutant. As to the images provided, they are typical of the outputs we see in our experiments, although we also now include motor output from internal intercostal and root output from the VII. We point out that sigh bursts in in vitro preparations are usually acquired from field potentials within the preBötC. In our case, we report motor root output and do not see as large an increase in amplitude for the sigh component. Whether this is due to an increase in both excitatory and inhibitory firing in the preBötC compared to just the excitatory component that would be visible via the motor output is unknown.</p><p>We have updated the methods to provide burst #s.

While the authors argue that the activity is similar to a mature network activity, I am not convinced that the data presented are sufficiently strong to arrive at this conclusion</italic>.</p><p>The question of whether the rhythmic output we describe is relevant for understanding adult behaviors is important. We respectfully disagree that what we recorded reflects an embryonic rhythm. Wild-type mice recovered by C-section at 18.5 are fully viable, breathe easily, and, if fostered, will survive to adulthood. These animals are not mature, but there is no evidence to suggest that their respiratory drives are generated by networks that become irrelevant one day later. As described above and in the modified paper, E18.5 mice generate a subset of breaths whose pattern of outputs are similar to what is seen in more mature in vitro and in vivo preparations. Moreover, Giles Fortin’s group showed very nicely that the early embryonic rhythm seen prior to e14.5 in mice is generated outside the ventral medulla in regions of the hindbrain that should be unaffected by either Atoh1 or Dbx1 mutation and that these rhythms vanish by E16.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2005</xref>). Together we interpret these data to indicate the patterns of motor output we record are relevant for understanding mature respiratory networks.</p><p><italic>2) The identification of the respiratory phases is based on root recordings and not on actual EMG activity from inspiratory and expiratory muscles. This is a major comment, because the entire study hinges on the proper identification of inspiratory and expiratory activity</italic>.</p><p>As described above, we have stepped back from using the terms inspiration and expiration to provide a more accurate description of the data. We have also analyzed both cervical and lumbar outputs in relation to either internal intercostal EMG recordings or VII root recordings and find that all three motor roots and EMG activity show similar patterns of independent function.</p><p><italic>3) The identification of a sigh burst is vague, which might lead to a misleading conclusion</italic>.</p><p>As described above, we have significantly modified our description of biphasic sigh-like bursts in WT animals to better fit the data and changed our descriptions where they inaccurately described the literature. Most importantly, we performed considerable new experiments that now add additional examples of motor output from VII root and intercostal muscle activity</p><p><italic>These caveats could be addressed experimentally – by performing additional experiments, or by adding clearly stated caveats into the discussion</italic>.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>1) The manuscript needs revision to make the presentation more accessible to a general audience. The data and figures and indeed the writing describing the data/figures are very complicated and the general reader will need a lot more guidance. Even experts in respiration need more guidance. Perhaps one method that will help the reader is to have the proposed circuit of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8A</italic></xref> <italic>brought up front in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>as an hypothesis to be tested and at the same time introduce the icons of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8G-I</italic></xref><italic>. Then for each set of traces these icons could be used to guide the reader to see what interaction is being illustrated. The writing needs to use these iconic guides. The icons will also help is showing which neuron group is genetically eliminated in each experiment and/or is the target of peptide modulation or drugs and how these manipulations adjust the proposed circuit</italic>.</p><p><italic>Creative use of icons and adjustments in writing could make the paper a lot easier to follow</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the advice to make the paper clearer for the general public and have made several significant changes to the text and figures. In the process of submission, it is sometimes extremely helpful to be asked to rethink how a paper is presented given the additional data acquired over time might be better used in a different manner.</p><p>First, we have modified the order of the paper to describe the details of the electrophysiological recordings from motor roots and EMG muscle to point out the basic experimental model and the putative relationship between specific hindbrain populations and the motor outputs from the different motor roots. To this we have also added modified versions of the putative network from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> to point out both features of motor output we will analyze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J-L</xref>). In this way we introduce the behaviors and hypotheses we are testing prior to describing the genetic manipulations and their effects.</p><p>Most importantly we have made significant modification to our figures to be clearer using a magenta rectangle to define the putative RTN/pFRG populations and a green circle to identify the preBötC. We have added a general schematic continuing the magenta rectangle and green circle describing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) the candidate populations thought to be important for the generation of respiratory behaviors other than inspiration using the same color from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for clarity. We have used this schematic to better explain the complicated genetics of the experiments throughout. This is clearest in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> where we show the motor patterns of cervical and lumbar output in WT and the four different transgenic mice models we used indicated by crossing out the populations targeted in each different mutation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> repeats the schematic and description for clarity. In addition, we have modified the colors being used to identify specific genetic population to be different from those used to describe behavioral output for better consistency.</p><p><italic>The legends to the figures need to be made as clear as possible even if this means expanding the number of words, and they should refer to the icons in each case. We found the delay histograms of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6F-H</italic></xref> <italic>and the phase histograms of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>particularly difficult because they are described by overly dense and telegraphic legends. The supplemental figures need to be incorporated into the flow directly or eliminated</italic>.</p><p>In general we have made our figure legends more descriptive and increasing their length by over 35%. For our descriptions of our analysis of the temporal lag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) we have added a cartoon more clearly describing what we are measuring as well as the possible network interactions that might underlie those patterns similar to the initial description in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and the summary hypothesis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. For our description of phase analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), we have similarly added descriptive model both of what we are measuring as well as the hypothesis being tested. In both cases we have modified the figure legends to better describe what is being measured and compared. We have also double-checked the description of the supplemental figures in the legends.</p><p><italic>Any way that the figures can be simplified by reducing the number of individual traces would be helpful</italic>.</p><p>We have reduced the number of traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref> to limit the repetition and make the figures clearer. The rest of the traces provide essential descriptions of the behavioral output and are numerous because of the number of different transgenic mouse models tested or as a consequence of suggestions during the review process (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The analysis of “sighs” remains a problem from the last submission. The authors should simply refer to these as double bursts in the Results and then in Discussion bring up their possible relationship to sighs. The double bursts should be quantified and a conservative course set in Discussion</italic>.</p><p>We have modified the results to refer to these as biphasic cervical breaths so as to not confuse the reader and only mention briefly in the results their similarity to sighs to provide a context for their inclusion. Importantly, a just published paper from the Thoby–Brisson group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapuis et al., 2014</xref>) describes the onset of sigh production in the embryonic mouse and the necessity for inhibition for producing the biphasic breath but not the sigh itself. These results are completely consistent with our proposed respiratory model and our experimental results and we have included this paper in our interpretation in the Discussion. See also our response to the question 3 below.</p><p><italic>3) Another concern from the original submission is that only ∼25% of the normal bursts show 'normal' coordination. There should be some comment on this issue. How do you interpret this low percentage? It would seem to imply that the network capriciously teeters between</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8G</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8H</italic></xref>. <italic>Is this how you see it?</italic></p><p>We have modified the discussion section to include newly published data describing changes in the strength of inhibitory synaptic drives in the respiratory network during late embryonic development as well as evidence for increased post-natal strengthening of inhibitory synapses. We now suggest less effective synaptic inhibition that strengthens post-natally could explain the differences we see in temporal delay at E18.5 as compared to older post-natal and adult animals. This fits both our model as well as the experimental results of other groups.</p><p>We interpret these results to indicate that the loss of RL neurons eliminates a net inhibitory effect on preBötC Dbx1 neurons, likely via reciprocally connected inhibitory interneurons. Recent work has found that biphasic inspiratory breaths (sighs) begin during late embryogenesis and that the temporal delay between eupneic and sigh components is dependent upon the strength of synaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapuis et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the density of the co-transporter necessary for setting the chloride equilibrium potential in the medulla increases significantly during the post-natal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu and Wong-Riley, 2012</xref>).</p><p>This suggests the difference in the relative percentage of cervical-lumbar breaths showing temporal delays above 150ms between our E18.5 preparations and older animals may be simply a consequence of generally weaker synaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greer et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, we propose RL neurons play an essential role in the coordination of mammalian breathing behavior by modulating the inhibitory interneurons that produce the temporal lag between independent oscillators. This modulation also helps stabilize coupled oscillators preventing independent or unwanted activation. This has the advantage that temporal delays can be controlled without strongly affecting the rhythmogenic properties of the underlying oscillators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hill et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grillner, 2006</xref>). It is also possible, however, that loss of Atoh1 neurons indirectly affects respiratory networks by modulating the development of inhibitory populations or the overall maturation of hindbrain circuits.</p><p><italic>4) The question of independent oscillators is complicated. It is possible to view the results as supporting 3 independent oscillators. On the other hand, as another reviewer points out, all the oscillations are driven by DBX1 cells and differential sensitivity to opiates has not been established so independent oscillators may not be supported. The authors need to address this issue squarely</italic>.</p><p>This is an important issue and our data are only part of a much more complicated story. We have now added the following to our discussion to point out the limitations of our results.</p><p>It is important to point out that we were unable to selectively eliminate lumbar motor output in any of our genetic manipulations. While our data are consistent with the presence of independent respiratory oscillators, we cannot rule out that the variability we see between respiratory motor pools is the consequence of higher level network interactions between a single distributed respiratory oscillator and small pools of respiratory premotor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, whether there are discrete anatomical boundaries between these putative independent oscillators is also unknown.</p></body></sub-article></article>
