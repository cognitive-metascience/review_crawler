The demand for sensory integration is particularly pressing when animals must choose among options that differ along several independent dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McFarland, 1977</xref>). For example, when assessing food options that differ in appearance, taste, smell, and texture, it may be advantageous for animals to integrate different sensory signals associated with each option and convert them into values along the same scale so that these options can be directly compared. While significant progress has been made in identifying the molecules and neurons that sense and process different sensory stimuli (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dunipace et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dahanukar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cameron et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2017b</xref>), less is known about how animals integrate different sensory information during decision making.</p><p>Egg-laying site selection by <italic>Drosophila</italic> females is a promising model for studying the molecular and circuit basis of sensory integration during decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Joseph et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> females lay one egg at a time and will explore and assess available substrates prior to depositing each egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Further, previous studies have shown that <italic>Drosophila</italic> females are sensitive to different properties of potential substrates such as sweetness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>), hardness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karageorgi et al., 2017</xref>), and levels of illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guntur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guntur et al., 2017</xref>), to name a few. Further, <italic>Drosophila</italic> females will reject an ‘inferior’ but otherwise acceptable substrate if a better one is available, thus hinting that they might be capable of ranking their options by integrating different sensory stimuli associated with each option and converting them into signals that reflect values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Joseph et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Joseph and Heberlein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azanchi et al., 2013</xref>). While the specific circuit mechanisms by which <italic>Drosophila</italic> females integrate different sensory signals during egg-laying remain to be determined, it is a tractable problem given the relative ease in assaying egg-laying preferences of many individual <italic>Drosophila</italic> females in parallel and the large number of gene and circuit manipulation tools available for this model organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Venken et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we set out to assess how <italic>Drosophila</italic> females integrate information of two distinct sensory properties of potential substrates – sweetness and hardness – when deciding where to deposit their eggs. Previous reports have shown that flies generally prefer the softer of two sweet substrates during feeding; for example, they prefer 0.5% agarose with sugar over 2.0% agarose with sugar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2017b</xref>). This feeding preference requires inputs from at least two distinct groups of mechanosensitive neurons on the labellum: one that uses the evolutionarily conserved mechanosensitive channel Transmembrane Channel-like (TMC) to sense hardness of substrates during discrimination of substrates, whereas the other uses the TRP channels NompC and Nanchung (Nan) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2017b</xref>). Interestingly, activation of the group that expressed NompC and Nan channels can directly inhibit the output of the sweet-sensing taste neurons, thereby further increasing the ‘food value’ of the softer substrate – the harder substrate should taste less sweet than the softer one because it induces stronger activation of the NompC/Nan-expressing neurons (that then exerts stronger suppression of output of sweet neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al., 2016</xref>). Inspired by these earlier reports, here we probed how <italic>Drosophila</italic> discriminate substrates of different hardness when making egg-laying decisions and how such decision is modified by detection of sweetness on the substrates. We found that, as in feeding, flies also generally preferred the softer substrate when given a hard substrate and a soft one to choose from for egg-laying. However, their soft preference during egg-laying did not require input from either of the two groups of mechanosensitive neurons that are critical for sensing and discriminating hardness of food substrates during feeding. More interestingly, detection of sweetness on substrates reduced discrimination of egg-laying substrates of different hardness, likely due to direct enhancement of output of TMC-expressing neurons by sweet neurons via axon-axon communication. Our results thus uncover a new mechanism by which <italic>Drosophila</italic> integrate chemosensory and mechanosensory information on choice options during an important decision-making task and highlight the fact that flies can recruit different sensory mechanisms to integrate the same two stimuli depending on the nature of their decision tasks – that is whether they are choosing substrates for feeding or for egg-laying purposes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> are receptive to laying eggs on plain (sugar free) substrates of different hardness but generally prefer the softer one</title><p>While it is commonly observed that flies tend to avoid depositing their eggs on very hard surfaces (e.g. hard plastic), the specific range of hardness that is acceptable for flies to lay their eggs and how well they discriminate egg-laying substrates of different levels of hardness have not been extensively explored.

Importantly, we did not add sucrose or other nutritive substances to these substrate so as to minimize the impact of chemosensory cues on flies’ sensing and discrimination of substrate hardness. Instead, we placed a drop of sucrose solution some distance away from the agarose substrates so that flies still had access to an energy source during egg-laying (see the ‘center hole’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46165.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> can discriminate egg-laying substrates of different hardness.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Upper image: schematic of our single-choice assay.

We found that flies laid comparable numbers of eggs on agarose whose concentration ranged from 0.25% to 1.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). But they laid fewer eggs on agarose with concentrations that were either too high or too low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), likely because they cannot easily insert their ovipositor into a substrate that is very hard and because they tend to avoid walking on a surface that is liquid-like. We then determined how well females discriminated agarose of different concentrations in two-choice assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In particular, we focused on examining whether flies favored the softer 0.5% agarose over several other harder substrates. We found that flies consistently laid more eggs on the 0.5% agarose when it was pitted against 1.0%, 1.25% or 1.5% agarose in different two-choice assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Since flies laid comparable amount of eggs on these concentrations of agarose in single-choice assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), their preference for the softer 0.5% agarose in the two-choice assays indicated that: 1) they were capable of discriminating ‘equally acceptable’ substrates of different hardness and 2) they preferred the softer one when given a choice. Further, tracking the positions of flies as they explored and laid eggs in a 0.5% vs. 1.5% two-choice assay showed that they spent comparable amounts of time on these two agarose substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>), suggesting that their preference to deposit eggs on the softer 0.5% agarose substrate was not due to intrinsic positional preference for the softer substrate.

We wondered whether these two groups of mechanosensitive neurons may also play a role in discriminating substrates of different hardness during egg-laying, although possibly by using channels other than TMC, NompC, and Nan, since mutants for these three channels did not behave significantly different from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, silencing these neurons by using the same tools employed by the feeding studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2017b</xref>) did not significantly impact flies’ ability to discriminate substrates of different hardness during egg-laying either: these manipulated flies still clearly preferred to lay eggs on the 0.5% agarose in the 0.5% vs. 1.5% two-choice assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). These results raised two possibilities: first, flies may rely on an as-yet-unidentified group (or groups) of mechanosensitive neurons on the labellum to sense and discriminate substrates of different hardness during egg-laying; second, the mechanosensitive neurons that are critical for discriminating substrate hardness during egg-laying may not be housed on the labellum.</p><p>To attempt to identify the appendage(s) that houses the specific mechanosensitive neurons that are critical for discriminating substrate hardness during egg-laying, we surgically removed different appendages from the animals. While rather crude, this approach allowed us to directly assess the requirement of specific appendage in hardness discrimination during egg-laying. We severed different appendages one at a time and found that, first, not surprisingly, removing the ovipositor caused animals unable to lay any eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, we were unable to assess the role of ovipositor in hardness discrimination during egg-laying. However interestingly, we found that severing the rest of the appendages either singly or together did not cause any reduction in substrate hardness discrimination during egg-laying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). More strikingly, flies without labellum or tarsi from all six legs – or both – not only still showed a clear preference to lay eggs on the softer of two substrates, their preference for the softer substrate was significantly stronger than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>), suggesting that these appendages may house mechanosensitive neurons that can act to <italic>inhibit</italic> hardness discrimination during egg-laying.</p><p>Taken together, these results uncover three important differences between substrate hardness discrimination during feeding and egg-laying. First, flies use different sets of mechanosensitive channels to discriminate substrates of different hardness during feeding and egg-laying – TMC, NompC, and Nan were not required for discrimination during egg-laying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) but were required for discrimination during feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2017b</xref>). Second, although flies rely on mechanosensitive neurons on the labellum/proboscis to discriminate substrates of different hardness during feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2017b</xref>), the principal mechanosensitive neurons they use to discriminate hardness during egg-laying likely may be housed on the ovipositor instead since removal of none of the other appendages caused females unable to discriminate substrates of different hardness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). While we do not have direct evidence to support this claim, we note that ovipositor is known to possess mechanosensitive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sánchez-Alcañiz and Benton, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stocker, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Newland and Burrows, 1994</xref>) and that flies have been shown to actively probe substrates with their ovipositor prior to depositing each egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Third and most curiously, labellum and legs may house mechanosensitive neurons whose input acts to inhibit – as opposed to promote – discrimination of substrates of different hardness during egg-laying, as severing these appendages enhanced discrimination of substrates of different hardness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Detection of sucrose on substrates inhibits discrimination of substrates of different hardness during egg-laying</title><p>Our experiments have so far focused on assessing how egg-laying females discriminated plain agarose substrates of different levels of hardness. To begin to probe how they evaluate substrates of different hardness in the presence of additional sensory cues, we next asked whether adding sugars to substrates of different hardness affects how they are discriminated by females. Specifically, we added the same amount of sucrose to both the 0.5% and the 1.5% agarose substrates and found that, interestingly, presence of sucrose in both substrates significantly reduced females’ preference to lay eggs on the softer 0.5% substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). The reduction in preference was mild when sucrose concentration was low (e.g. 5 mM) but became stronger as the concentration of sucrose increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). When the concentration reached 100 mM, flies became virtually indifferent between the 0.5% and the 1.5% choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A similar reduction in discrimination was observed when sucrose was replaced with several other sweet compounds, pineapple juice, but not with sorbitol, which is a nutritious but unsweet substance for flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, presence of the bitter chemical caffeine or the sour chemical acetic acid did not significantly impact discrimination of substrates of different hardness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, because a previous report has shown that arena size can influence how animals behaviorally respond to sucrose during egg-laying site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>), we also examined whether sucrose was similarly capable of reducing discrimination of substrates of different hardness when animals were selecting for egg-laying substrates in larger arenas. We found that, similar to what we have observed in our ‘regular arenas’, flies in arenas that were ~8X the size still preferred the softer 0.5% agarose over the 1.5% agarose when both substrates were sucrose free but reduced their soft preference when both contained 100 mM sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). Together, these results showed that the presence of sweet compounds in substrates can cause females to become less discriminating between substrates of different hardness during egg-laying.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46165.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Detection of sucrose on substrates by sweet neurons can inhibit discrimination of substrates of different hardness.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of eggs laid by a single WT female in a 0.5% vs. 1.5% two-choice assay where both substrates were sugar free (top) and where both substrates contained 100 mM sucrose (bottom). (<bold>B</bold>) PI (for 0.5% agarose) of WT females in a 0.5% vs. 1.5% two-choice assay where both substrates were sugar free (black) and where both substrates contained 100 mM sucrose (blue). ****p&lt;0.0001; Mann–Whitney test.

First, presence of sucrose significantly altered the hardness of these two substrates, rendering them to have similar levels of hardness. Second, detection of sucrose by sweet neurons modified how these substrates were perceived by flies. To test the first possibility, we measured the hardness of 0.5% and 1.5% agaroses with or without 100 mM, 300 mM, and 500 mM sucrose. We found that while the presence of different concentrations of sucrose did slightly alter the hardness of both the 0.5% and the 1.5% agarose substrates, differences in hardness between the two substrates remained significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To test the second possibility, we eliminated females’ sweet-sensing ability and tested how well they discriminated substrates of different hardness in the presence of sucrose. We first severed different appendages that are known to house sweet neurons and found that eliminating the tarsi or labellum significantly increased flies’ preference for the softer substrate in the presence of sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). Interestingly, while severing neither the wings nor the maxillary palps had any significant effect, severing the antennae also increased soft preference in the presence of sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). (It is worth noting that recent reports have suggested that some olfactory neurons express specific molecular sugar receptors and these neurons thus may <italic>potentially</italic> be capable sensing sugars, too [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yavuz et al., 2014</xref>]). We next removed several molecular sugar receptors from flies and found that mutants that are known to be defective in sugar sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yavuz et al., 2014</xref>) also showed a clear preference for the softer substrate in the presence of sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), as did flies with their sweet neurons selectively silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Further, silencing only the sweet-sensing neurons on the legs but not on the labellum (labeled by <italic>Gr64a<sup>GAL4</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>) recovered some soft preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>), too, albeit to a lesser extent than silencing all sweet neurons. As a control, we also silenced the bitter-sensing taste neurons and found that it failed to recover significant soft preference in the presence of sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Lastly, we showed that the improvements of hardness discrimination in the presence of sucrose by inhibiting sweet sensing were not because sweet neurons can act as inhibitors of hardness discrimination <italic>in general</italic>: silencing sweet neurons did not enhance discrimination of substrates of different hardness when the substrates were sugar free (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H and I</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that presence of sweet compounds on egg-laying substrates of different hardness can cause females to become less discriminating between them and reduce their preference for the softer one. Further, such sucrose-induced indifference towards substrates of different hardness requires activation of sweet neurons on flies’ labellum, tarsi, and possibly also on antennae (even though it is presently unclear whether <italic>Gr64f</italic>-expressing neurons on the antennae are truly capable of sensing sugar).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Sucrose-induced inhibition of discrimination of substrates of different hardness requires TMC and TMC-expressing mechanosensitive neurons</title><p>We next aimed to determine how activation of sweet neurons may promote indifference between two substrates of different hardness in the presence of sucrose.

While none of these channels appeared to play a role in hardness discrimination when the substrates were sugar free (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), it is conceivable that some may contribute to sugar-induced indifference between substrates of different hardness.

First, we reintroduced the <italic>tmc</italic> gene back to the <italic>tmc<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants (by using a <italic>tmc-GAL4</italic> that has been shown to label the TMC-expressing mechanosensitive MD-L neurons on the labellum as well as a few CNS neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>]). We found that this manipulation reverted <italic>tmc<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants to behave more like WT animals: they were less discriminating of substrates of different hardness in the presence of sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Second, we selectively silenced the output of TMC-expressing neurons (by using the same <italic>tmc-GAL4</italic> to direct expression of Kir2.1 or TNT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sweeney et al., 1995</xref>]) and found that these manipulations caused animals to clearly prefer the soft substrate like <italic>tmc<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants did despite the presence of sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, silencing the Nan-expressing group of neurons on the labellum did not recover any significant soft preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Importantly, silencing these <italic>tmc-GAL4-</italic>expressing neurons in the presence of <italic>vGlut-GAL80</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bussell et al., 2014</xref>), a transgene that blocked <italic>GAL4</italic>-dependent expression in CNS neurons labeled by <italic>tmc-GAL4</italic>, still caused animals to show a clear preference for the softer substrate in the presence of sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). But silencing neurons labeled by an independently generated <italic>tmc<sup>GAL4</sup></italic> (a knocked-in <italic>GAL4</italic> for <italic>tmc</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2016</xref>]), which fortuitously <italic>did not</italic> label the TMC-expressing mechanosensitive MD-L neurons on the labellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>), failed to recover significant soft preference in the presence of sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). We then asked whether animals that lacked either the <italic>tmc</italic> gene or functional TMC-expressing neurons might be defective in sugar sensing when selecting for egg-laying site, as such defect might also explain their preference for the softer substrate in the presence of sucrose. However, we found that these mutants readily discriminated two 0.5% agarose substrates with different levels of sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>), a task that requires them to sense sugar properly. We note that this is also consistent with the previous finding that MD-L neurons from WT and <italic>tmc</italic> mutants showed comparable electrophysiological responses to sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our results showed that TMC and TMC-expressing mechanosensitive neurons on the labellum did not play a significant role in hardness discrimination when both egg-laying substrates were sugar free, however interestingly, they can act to inhibit discrimination of substrates of different hardness when sucrose was present on both. The requirement of functional TMC and TMC-expressing neurons in sucrose-induced inhibition of discrimination (or sucrose-induced indifference) thus suggests that activation of sweet neurons may act to inhibit such discrimination by modulating the sensory pathway activated by TMC neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Axon termini of sweet taste neurons in the brain contact with and can signal to those of TMC neurons</title><p>Finally, we set out to identify the potential mechanism by which sweet neurons may modulate the sensory pathway activated by the TMC-expressing mechanosensitive neurons. A previous report had shown that sweet neurons and TMC-expressing neurons on the proboscis project their axons to overlapping areas in the subesophageal zone (SEZ) in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) and we confirmed this by using an independently generated tool to label sweet neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Given the close proximity of their projections, we wondered whether axons of sweet neurons may directly contact those of TMC-expressing neurons in the SEZ. To test this idea, we first used the ‘conventional’ GRASP technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feinberg et al., 2008</xref>) that targeted two halves of the GFP – CD4-spGFP1-10 and CD4-spGFP11 – to the cell membranes of the sweet neurons and the TMC-expressing neurons, respectively. Encouragingly, we detected reconstituted GFP clearly at areas targeted by both sets of axons in the SEZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). To test whether these putative contacts might be synaptic in nature, we switched to using the syb:GRASP technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Macpherson et al., 2015</xref>) where one-half of the GFP was targeted specifically to the presynaptic termini of the sweet neurons and would be exposed to the synaptic cleft only upon vesicle fusion. Again, we were able to detect reconstituted GFP clearly in the SEZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that sweet neurons can conceivably act as a presynaptic partner to axonal termini of TMC neurons in the SEZ.

To do this, we developed an <italic>ex vivo</italic> preparation where we monitored Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into axons of TMC-expressing by using the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). We first exposed the preparation to sucrose directly, and indeed observed a significant increase in GCaMP signal in the axonal termini of TMC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Several additional results suggest that the increase in GCaMP signal we observed was neither caused by movements nor because TMC neurons were intrinsically sugar sensitive. First, exposing the preparations to sorbitol, a sugar that cannot activate <italic>Drosophila</italic> sweet-taste neurons and cannot inhibit discrimination of substrates of different hardness during egg-laying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), failed to induce a significant increase in GCaMP in the axonal termini of TMC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Second, cell bodies of TMC neurons on the proboscis did not respond to sucrose whereas those of sweet neurons did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). Third, addition of sucrose failed to induce as significant an increase in GCaMP in TMC axons from mutant that lacked Gr64f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>); Gr64f is a molecular co-receptor for sugar that has been shown to be important for sugar sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yavuz et al., 2014</xref>). Further, we also found that sucrose-induced GCaMP increase in axons of TMC neurons was reduced in a <italic>tmc</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting that strong increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in termini of TMC axons requires co-activation of sweet neurons and input from TMC channels.</p><p>Lastly, to confirm independently that activation of sweet neurons can increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into axons of TMC neurons, we selectively expressed in sweet neurons the ATP-gated P2X<sub>2</sub> channel, a channel that is not expressed endogenously in flies and thus can be used for ‘chemogenetic activation’ of specific neurons of interest in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lima and Miesenböck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yao et al., 2012</xref>). We found that stimulating the P2X<sub>2</sub>-expressing sweet neurons with ATP also triggered a significant increase in GCaMP signal in axonal termini of the TMC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). In contrast, exposing control animals that did not express P2X<sub>2</sub> in their sweet neurons to the same levels of ATP did not produce such an increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E and F</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our collective results showed that functional sweet neurons and TMC neurons were both required for sucrose-induced inhibition of discrimination of substrates of different hardness. Further, axons of sweet neurons physically contacted those of TMC neurons in the brain and stimulation of sweet neurons increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into axonal termini of TMC neurons. Thus, one mechanism by which sucrose-activated sweet neurons can act to inhibit discrimination of substrates of different hardness during egg-laying is by directly enhancing the output of TMC-expressing mechanosensitive neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we showed that activation of sweet neurons by sucrose can promote <italic>Drosophila</italic> females to become indifferent between two substrates of different hardness during egg-laying, and that such sucrose-induced indifference required input from the TMC-expressing mechanosensitive neurons on the labellum. Specifically, we showed that <italic>Drosophila</italic> females generally preferred the softer substrate for egg-laying in a two-choice assay when both options were sugar free, but their preference for the softer substrate reduced significantly when both options contained 100 mM sucrose. Such sugar-induced indifference between substrates of different hardness depended on functional molecular sugar receptors and sweet neurons as well as, interestingly, functional TMC channel and TMC-expressing mechanosensitive neurons. Further, our anatomical-labeling and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging results showed that axons of sweet neurons directly contacted those of TMC-expressing neurons in the brain and that depolarizing the sweet neurons increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into axon termini of TMC neurons. Thus, such axon-axon contacts provide an anatomical basis for sweet neurons to directly modulate the output of TMC neurons in the brain. Together, these findings suggest that, during egg-laying site selection, activation of sweet neurons can act to inhibit discrimination of substrates of different hardness by enhancing the output of TMC neurons directly. Our results thus demonstrate a novel means by which <italic>Drosophila</italic> integrate specific chemosensory and mechanosensory properties of two competing substrates when evaluating them during a simple decision-making task. However, it is worth pointing out that the mechanism we described may not be the only path by which sweet neurons can act to modify discrimination of substrate hardness during egg-laying site selection. First, input from tarsi and antennae played a role, too. While we did detect <italic>tmc</italic> transcripts on them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), it is unclear whether <italic>tmc</italic>-expressing neurons on these structures (that were missed by the <italic>tmc-GAL4</italic>) have the same interaction with sweet neurons as the ones on the labellum. Second, while the function of <italic>tmc-GAL4</italic>-expressing neurons was required for sucrose to dampen hardness discrimination, we were unable to ascertain that direct artificial activation of these neurons was <italic>sufficient</italic> to do so in the absence of sucrose as such activation severely reduced females’ egg-laying rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>). Thus, one important next task is to identify the relevant mechanosensitive input from tarsi and antennae and assess how information they relay might be modulated by activation of sweet neurons during egg-laying site selection.</p><p>A second point that is worth discussing is whether our conclusions are compatible with findings from previous reports. While our results suggest that sweet neurons can act to potentiate the output of TMC neurons via axon-axon interaction, two recent studies have shown that activation of mechanosensitive neurons can inhibit the output of sweet neurons. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al. (2016)</xref> have shown that activation of TMC neurons can inhibit PER, a motor response triggered by activation of sweet neurons. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al. (2016)</xref> have shown that Nanchung-expressing neurons can inhibit PER and that axons of Nanchung-expressing neurons form inhibitory synapses with axons of sweet neurons. We proposed our conclusions are not incompatible with these earlier reports. First, it is conceivable that axons of mechanosensitive neurons and sweet neurons can have two distinct types of interactions: presynaptic inhibition from mechanosensitive neurons to sweet neurons as well as presynaptic facilitation from sweet neurons to TMC neurons. Second, while 100 mM sucrose may facilitate TMC neurons less when flies were sampling 1.5% agarose than on 0.5% agarose (taking into account that sweet neurons should be suppressed more on 1.5% agarose than on 0.5% agarose), this should reduce the difference in perceived hardness of 0.5% and 1.5% agarose substrates, thus not inconsistent with what we have seen. Moreover, it is unclear whether 0.5% and 1.5% agarose exerted very different levels of suppression on output of sweet neurons in our task. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al. (2016)</xref> showed that 0.2% vs. 2% agarose had significantly different impacts on feeding preference for 0.5 mM vs. 1 mM sucrose, however, the concentration of sucrose we used was 100 mM. For these reasons, we currently favor the idea that our conclusions expand the view of the relationship between sweet neurons and mechanosensitive neurons provided by the previous studies.</p><p>Another point worth discussing after comparing our work with previous reports is that flies appeared to use two different sensory mechanisms to discriminate substrates of different hardness during feeding and egg-laying, even though they generally preferred the softer substrate in both tasks. Previous studies have shown that flies rely on TMC, Nan, and NompC channels and two specific groups of labellum sensory neurons that express these channels to discriminate substrates of different hardness during feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2017b</xref>). In contrast, our results showed that neither these channels nor these neurons were essential for flies to discriminate substrates of different hardness during egg-laying. More curiously, our results suggest input from mechanosensitive neurons on the labellum (as well as possibly ones on antennae and tarsi) can act to inhibit discrimination of substrates of different hardness during egg-laying. This conclusion is supported in part by the observations that animals without intact labellum or functional TMC-expressing neurons on the labellum showed enhanced discrimination in the presence of sucrose during egg-laying. In contrast, <italic>tmc</italic> mutants did not discriminate substrates of different hardness well for feeding when given the exact same choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3F</xref>). The striking difference in the requirement of labellum and TMC on substrate hardness discrimination during feeding and egg-laying raises the question of what are the identities of the specific sensory neurons that promote discrimination of substrate hardness during egg-laying. The totality of our current results are consistent with a very <italic>tentative model</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) that <italic>Drosophila</italic> likely use some as-yet-unidentified mechanosensitive neurons on their ovipositor to sense and discriminate substrates of different hardness. We based this tentative model on the following reasons. First, ovipositor is known to possess mechanosensitive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sánchez-Alcañiz and Benton, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stocker, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Newland and Burrows, 1994</xref>); second, flies have been shown to actively probe the substrates with their ovipositor prior to depositing each egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2008</xref>); third and most importantly, animals that lacked the a significant portion of virtually all other appendages (e.g. labellum, tarsi, wings) but had intact ovipositor were still capable of discriminating substrates of different hardness. Thus, another important next task is to identify the mechanosensitive neurons on the ovipositor – or possibly on other body parts – that are critical for discriminating substrate hardness during egg-laying and the central targets of these neurons. Identities of these neurons will provide a much-needed molecular and anatomical basis to start elucidating how texture discrimination and substrate selection during egg-laying site selection is enabled and modulated.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46165.025</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A tentative model explaining how discrimination of egg-laying substrates of different hardness is regulated by mechanosensory neurons on different appendages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the absence of sucrose, detection of hardness of egg-laying substrates by mechanosensory neurons on the ovipositor promotes discrimination whereas detection of hardness of substrates by mechanosensory neurons on the tarsi and labellum inhibits discrimination. Moreover, animals discriminate the plain 0.5% vs. 1.5% agarose well because the contribution from the mechanosensory neurons on the ovipositor dominates over that from the tarsi and labellum in this decision. (We note that while <italic>tmc</italic> transcripts are present on tarsi, labellum, and antenna, inhibition of hardness discrimination in the absence of sucrose may be promoted by mechanosensitive channels that we have not identified in this work. Further, we have only indirect evidence that supports the idea that the specific mechanosensitive neurons critical for egg-laying substrate discrimination are present on the ovipositor.) (<bold>B</bold>) In the presence of sucrose, however, contribution from the mechanosensory neurons on the labellum, tarsi, and antenna increases, partly because output of TMC neurons on the labellum can be enhanced by sucrose-induced activation of sweet neuron. Consequently, animals discriminate the two sweet substrates less well due to enhanced input from mechanosensitive neurons that inhibit discrimination. (We note that TMC-expressing neurons on the tarsi and antenna may contribute to sucrose-induced inhibition, too, given that <italic>tmc</italic> transcripts were present on both. However, their precise relationship with sweet neurons is not known. Further, some mechanosensitive channels that we have not identified in this work may contribute, too).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46165-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Lastly, what is the potential advantage in allowing sugar detection to inhibit discrimination of egg-laying substrates of different hardness? Strong selectiveness likely costs effort and delays emergence of progenies. Thus, when deciding between two competing substrates that do not differ significantly in values, it might be more advantageous for flies to deposit their eggs on both. In our experiments, difference in values between the plain 0.5% agarose and the plain 1.5% agarose maybe relatively small because while flies preferred the 0.5% agarose over the 1.5% agarose in the two-choice assay, they laid comparable numbers of eggs on them when each was presented in single-choice assays. Thus, the presence of high concentration of sucrose in both substrates may further reduce their differences in values, thereby largely eliminating flies’ soft preference. (However, it is worth noting that we favored the idea that adding sucrose to the 0.5% and 1.5% agarose substrates may equalize their values by dampening them, at least in the context of our regular assays. This is because in our regular assays, adding sucrose to an agarose substrate <italic>reduces</italic> as opposed to increases its value: while flies readily accepted the sucrose-containing substrate for egg-laying, they consistently preferred the plain one when given a choice between a plain one and a sucrose-containing one to choose from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2015</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Finally, from an evolutionary point of view, we proposed that allowing sweet neurons to directly enhance the output of mechanosensitive neurons that can inhibit hardness discrimination during egg-laying may provide a neural substrate for different species to adopt different texture selectivity. For example, in contrast to <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the fruit pest <italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic> is more receptive to lay eggs on harder substrates and attack both ripe (harder) and rotten (softer) fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karageorgi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atallah et al., 2014</xref>). It may be interesting to test whether modifications of the structure and function of sweet and TMC neurons, and/or the connection between them, contribute to <italic>Drosophila suzukii’s</italic> acceptance of harder substrate during egg-laying.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Briefly, 20 to 30 females of the appropriate genotypes and 10 to 15 males of mixed genotypes were gathered into a single food vial that was supplied with wet yeast paste. After 4-8 days, the food in the vial became very chewed up by the larvae, and at this point females were well fed but deprived of egg-laying. Thus, they were ready to lay eggs when placed in our egg-laying apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). We usually let females lay eggs overnight (~14 hr). Groups to be compared were always run in parallel. Note that regardless of the assays we performed (single-choice vs. two-choice vs. large arenas), we always assayed at the level of single animals — each data point on a graph denotes the outcome (number of eggs laid or PI) of a single female.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Two-choice egg-laying assay in regular arenas</title><p>For two-choice assays, individual flies were placed in custom-made transparent Plexiglas chambers.

For optogentic activation experiments, flies were maintained similarly as described before except that immediately after eclosion, flies to be assayed were put into foil-covered food vials that contained 0.2 mM <italic>all-trans-</italic>retinal until ready for experiments. When ready, flies were then loaded into egg-laying apparatus illuminated with or without red LED light from above and allowed to lay eggs for ~14 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guntur et al., 2017</xref>). For thermogenetic activation experiments, flies were raised and egg-laying deprived (as described before) at 22˚C, and then placed at either control (22˚C) or experimental temperatures (30˚C) for ~14 hr for egg-laying. For <italic>two-choice assay in large arenas</italic>, we followed the same protocol for preparing the flies but used a custom-apparatus with arenas that are ~8X the size of that of regular arenas.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Egg-laying rate assay (single-choice assay)</title><p>For this assay, individual flies were put into two-choice chambers but we loaded the same concentration of agarose onto the two sides of each arena.

We used CamUniversal software for video acquisition, Avidemux software for video conversion, and the open-source tracking software Ctrax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Branson et al., 2009</xref>) for tracking. Individual egg-laying events in the videos were manually annotated.

Briefly, for each arena, 100 mM sucrose-containing 0.5% of agarose was placed on one trough and 100 mM sucrose-containing 1.5% agarose was placed on the other. The agarose was mixed with either blue dye (Erioglaucine disodium salt, Solarbio, Cat# E8500) or a red dye (Sulforhodamine B, Solarbio, catalog Cat# S6080). 2–4 day-old females WT and mutant flies were wet-starved for 24 hr and then loaded individually into each arena and allowed to feed in darkness for 90 min. We then examined the colors of the abdomens using a dissecting microscope after feeding was terminated. The food preference index (PI) for the 0.5% agarose (red color) was as follows: PI = [(N<sub>red</sub> + 0.5 <sub>Npurple</sub>) – (N<sub>blue</sub> + 0.5 <sub>Npurple</sub>)]/(N<sub>red</sub> + N<sub>blue</sub> + <sub>Npurple</sub>). N<sub>red</sub>, N<sub>blue</sub>, and N<sub>purple</sub> indicated the number of flies with red, blue and purple abdomens, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Egg-laying substrate hardness measurements</title><p>First, 40 ml of agarose gel (0.5% or 1.5% agarose with or without 100 mM sucrose) was prepared in a 60 mm<sup>2</sup> diameter dish (Nunc, Denmark). Agarose hardness, expressed as the maximum force (N), was measured at room temperature with a TA.XT plus texture analyzer (Stable Micro Systems, Goldaming, Surrey, UK) using a 50 mm diameter flat plunger (SMS P/50). The instrument settings were as follows: pre-test speed: 4.0 mm/s; test speed: 2.0 mm/s; post-test speed: 5.0 mm/s; strain: 40%; and trigger force: 5 g. The TPA analysis was carried out at ambient temperature (25°C).

First-strand cDNA was synthesized with First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) using an oligo(dT)18 primer and a 1 μg total RNA template in a 20 μl reaction, following the manufacturer’s protocol. We used I-5 2 x High-Fidelity Master Mix to conduct RT-PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA).

Fixed tissues were processed using standard antibody staining protocol before being mounted with SlowFade diamond (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Samples were imaged at 20 × or 40 × magnification on Zeiss 700 confocal microscopes (Jena, Germany), and processed with ImageJ. Titers for primary antibodies were as follows: mouse anti-nc82 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank nc82, 1:50), mouse anti-GFP (1:200, A11120, Thermo Fisher Scientific), rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000, A11122, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and rabbit anti-RFP (1:500, 600-401-379, Rockland). Secondary antibodies were Donkey Alexa 488 anti-rabbit, Donkey Alexa 488 anti-mouse, Donkey Alexa 594 anti-rabbit, and Donkey Alexa 594 anti-mouse (1:500, R37118, R37114, R37119, R37115, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

GCaMP6 fluorescence was acquired using a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope equipped with a 40 × 0.8 NA water immersion objective and the live-series ZEN image acquisition software. Briefly, baseline GCaMP fluorescence was acquired by scanning the cells with a 488 nm laser at 128 × 128 pixels at 8-bit dynamic range. The GCaMP6 signal in ROI acquired before stimulation (baseline) was used as F<sub>0</sub>, and the peak change in fluorescence after the addition of the test solution was used as F′. For quantification, <italic>Δ</italic>F/F was calculated as (F′-F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub> to reflect the changes in GCaMP signals before and after stimulation.

We tested whether the values were normally distributed using D’Agostino–Pearson omnibus and Shapiro–Wilk normality tests before performing statistical analysis. When data were normally distributed, we used parametric tests; when data were not normally distributed, we used non-parametric tests. All tests were two-tailed. All data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. We also consistently labeled the sample numbers directly on graphs.</p><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Sample size</title><p>Our results were based on analysis of behavior at the level of single animals.

All the data are biological replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Data exclusion</title><p>We only excluded data when the number of eggs laid by a female was less than 10 when we determined its preference index (PI). First, regular females generally laid more than 10 eggs in our experimental setting. Second, a low number of eggs would cause the PI to be unreliable: for example, if a female laid only one egg – one on choice A and zero on choice B – its PI for choice A would be 1, but there would be little confidence that this animal truly had this strong a bias.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

Your article has been reviewed by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor, Kristin Scott as the Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Wu et al., study how <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> integrates mechanosensory and chemosensory information in the context of egg-laying behavior. The authors report that excitation of sugar neurons directly activates TMC-expressing mechanosensory neurons by means of axo-axonic excitatory transmission, thereby suppressing texture discrimination in an egg-laying assay. Their genetic, behavioral and calcium imaging results point to a model in which strong activation of TMC-expressing MD-L neurons in the labellum inhibits oviposition. In addition, their preliminary observation suggests some unknown mechanosensory inputs from ovipositor in turn promote oviposition. In addition to feeding decision, this study on oviposition adds another nice example of the interplay between gustatory and mechanosensory inputs during fly's decision making. The proposed model of antagonistic regulation of oviposition is potentially interesting.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors did not provide direct evidence that strong activation of the TMC-expressing MD-L neurons inhibits oviposition (Figure 6). If their model is correct, one would predict that optogenetic or thermogenetic activation of TMC-expressing MD-L neurons would mimic the effect of sugar in their oviposition choice assay.</p><p>2) Surgical removal of labellum, tarsi, or antenna all restored texture discrimination in the presence of sugar. However, TMC-expressing MD-L neurons are present only in the labellum. The authors need to perform additional experiments to address the contribution of tarsi and antenna to oviposition texture discrimination. As it is, their model does not explain why sugar input from antenna (which is extremely speculative; the Amrein lab never demonstrated any sugar response in the olfactory receptor neurons), for example, can inhibit texture discrimination.</p><p>One possible experiment is tissue-specific RT-PCR to see whether TMC is also expressed in the antenna or leg. The study will be strengthened if the authors could provide a more comprehensive model to explain their results shown in Figure 3E, Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and Figure 4A-C.</p><p>3) At low sucrose concentrations (5mM) flies still prefer the soft side to lay eggs, but this preference disappears at a high sucrose concentration (100mM). Even if females are non-starved (the authors do not specify this in the methods), it could be that this high sucrose promotes feeding independently of food texture, making the flies lay eggs on either of the two agarose pads. In TMC mutants, flies might not be able to sense the sucrose properly and this would affect the feeding preference. The authors should show whether in the presence of sucrose 100 mM everywhere, feeding plays any role. To test whether TMC neurons are necessary for the proper evaluation of food, the authors could use the same behavioral setup but add for example colorants (blue and red) to each of the different agarose concentrations to see if consumption is the same as wild-type flies.</p><p>4) Jeong et al., (2016) showed that activation of labellar mechanosensory neurons expressing Nanchung suppresses sugar neurons by means of axo-axonic inhibitory transmission. In this context, one would expect that sugar neuron transmission is dampened by harder substrates (e.g. 1.5% agarose), which could in principle suppress the synaptic output of sugar neurons. In this context, flies are expected to show preference for softer substrate. Similarly, Zhang et al., (2016) showed that the optogenetic activation of TMC neurons leads to a decrease of sucrose induced PER in flies, implying that the mechanosensory neurons are in fact inhibiting the sugar sensory neurons, not the other way around. However here, the authors show that the sugar neurons are in fact activating TMC neurons. The authors need to perform additional experiments to address this discrepancy or at least provide some explanation in the Discussion section.</p><p>5) Schwartz et al., (2012) showed that the positive or negative influence of sugar on oviposition depends on the size of the egg laying chamber. The sugar-induced oviposition avoidance observed by the authors is likely an artifact of the small chamber size. It is unclear whether the interesting observation they made in this study is also influenced by the chamber size. The authors should at least conduct some of their key experiments in larger egg-laying chambers to see whether their conclusion still holds.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46165.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors did not provide direct evidence that strong activation of the TMC-expressing MD-L neurons inhibits oviposition (Figure 6).

However, we were unable to test properly whether optogenetic or thermogenetic activation of TMC neurons inhibits discrimination of substrates of different hardness. This is because both manipulations severely reduced egg-laying rate in our hands (see new Figure 4—figure supplement 1G-I). In the case of optogenetics experiment, we found that <italic>tmc&gt;CsChrimson</italic> flies became severely bloated with water and cannot lay eggs when exposed to red light during egg-laying. In the case of thermogenetic experiment, we found that while <italic>tmc&gt;dTRPA1</italic> flies generally did not lay eggs either at 31°C. We suspect this maybe because some of the <italic>tmc-GAL4</italic> labeled neurons were present on one or more of the internal organs and that artificial activation of these neurons caused the animals to become rather unhealthy. However, we note that out of 116 females we tested, there were 7 “escapers” that did lay ≥ 10 eggs – the minimum threshold we consistently applied when we assessed egg-laying preference of an animal. These animals discriminated 0.5% plain agarose vs. 1.5% plain agarose well, interestingly. This result suggests either TMC neurons were not sufficiently activated in these escapers, or that enhancement of output of TMC neurons is only necessary but not sufficient to dampen discrimination of substrate hardness (and that sweet neurons may recruit additional pathways to dampen hardness discrimination). We have included this possibility in the new Discussion section and modified our tentative model accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Surgical removal of labellum, tarsi, or antenna all restored texture discrimination in the presence of sugar. However, TMC-expressing MD-L neurons are present only in the labellum. The authors need to perform additional experiments to address the contribution of tarsi and antenna to oviposition texture discrimination. As it is, their model does not explain why sugar input from antenna (which is extremely speculative; the Amrein lab never demonstrated any sugar response in the olfactory receptor neurons), for example, can inhibit texture discrimination.</p><p>One possible experiment is tissue-specific RT-PCR to see whether TMC is also expressed in the antenna or leg. The study will be strengthened if the authors could provide a more comprehensive model to explain their results shown in Figure 3E, Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and Figure 4A-C.</p></disp-quote><p>It is indeed curious that severing the antennae or the tarsi enhanced discrimination of substrate of different hardness in the presence of sucrose, too. We took the approach suggested by the reviewers and conducted an RT-PCR experiment to assess whether <italic>tmc</italic> may be present on these two appendages, too. We found that, interestingly, while <italic>tmc-GAL4</italic> did not label neurons on either the tarsi or the antennae, <italic>tmc</italic> transcripts were indeed present on both. (These new results are shown in new Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). Thus, TMC and TMC-expressing neurons on the antennae and/or tarsi may <italic>potentially</italic> act together with TMC neurons on the labellum in dampening hardness discrimination in the presence of sucrose. We have therefore modified the model (see new Figure 6) by adding the presence of <italic>tmc</italic> on antennae and tarsi. But we note that we do not know whether the same axon-axon interaction mechanism we described in the manuscript applies to these “TMC neurons” (missed by <italic>tmc-GAL4</italic>) on the tarsi and antennae. For example, as the reviewers have pointed out, it is not known whether the <italic>Gr64f</italic> driver-labeled neurons on the antennae are truly sugar sensing. Further, we also acknowledged in the model that the presence of <italic>tmc</italic> transcripts on antennae and tarsi did not rule out the possible critical involvement of other mechanosensitive neurons/channels on these structures in dampening hardness discrimination during egg-laying site selection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) At low sucrose concentrations (5mM) flies still prefer the soft side to lay eggs, but this preference disappears at a high sucrose concentration (100mM). Even if females are non-starved (the authors do not specify this in the methods), it could be that this high sucrose promotes feeding independently of food texture, making the flies lay eggs on either of the two agarose pads. In TMC mutants, flies might not be able to sense the sucrose properly and this would affect the feeding preference. The authors should show whether in the presence of sucrose 100 mM everywhere, feeding plays any role. To test whether TMC neurons are necessary for the proper evaluation of food, the authors could use the same behavioral setup but add for example colorants (blue and red) to each of the different agarose concentrations to see if consumption is the same as wild-type flies.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid concern. We have now included a brief discussion and a new result that addressed these possibilities. Below we offered our arguments against the ideas that enhanced feeding was responsible for the sucrose-induced lack of hardness discrimination and that reduced sugar-sensing by TMC neurons was responsible for <italic>tmc</italic> mutants’ clear discrimination in the presence of sucrose. We have also emphasized in revised material and method that we did not starve the flies beforehand.</p><p>1) We have shown before that in our arenas, flies’ interest to feed on a given substrate is generally <italic>uncoupled</italic> from their interest to lay eggs on that substrate (Yang, He and Stern, 2015; Yang et al.,2008). For example, when given a plain 1% agarose and a 100 mM sucrose-containing 1% agarose to explore in our arenas, flies preferred to feed on the sucrose-containing one but preferred to lay eggs on the plain 1% agarose (this result was also shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). Similarly, when given a bitter+sucrose 1% agarose and a sucrose-only 1% agarose to explore, they preferred to feed on the sucrose-only substrate but to lay eggs on the bitter+sucrose substrate. (We note that Joseph et al., 2012 reported a similar observation where they found that when given a molasses food vs. a lobeline-containing molasses food to choose from, flies preferred to lay eggs on the bitter, lobeline-containing molasses food).</p><p>2) We have conducted a feeding preference experiment suggested by the reviewer (using the same arenas we used for egg-laying). We found that neither WT nor <italic>tmc</italic> mutants showed a feeding preference for the 0.5% agarose when given a 100 mM sucrose-containing 0.5% agarose and a 100mM sucrose-containing 1.5% agarose substrates to choose from (see new Figure 4—figure supplement 3). Thus, while WT and <italic>tmc</italic> mutants both showed lack of feeding discrimination when choosing between two sucrose-containing substrates of different hardness, they behaved very differently when choosing between the same two substrates for egg-laying – <italic>tmc</italic> mutants strongly favored the softer one for egg-laying but WT did not. This result again suggests that feeding and egg-laying preferences are not coupled in our arenas.</p><p>3) Two lines of evidence suggest that <italic>tmc</italic> mutants did not have impaired ability to sense sucrose. First, we have shown that <italic>tmc</italic> mutants and WT showed comparable discrimination of substrates that contained different levels of sucrose but were made with same concentration of agarose (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1D); second, Zhang et al., 2016 have shown by e-phys recording that MD-L neurons from WT and <italic>tmc</italic> mutants exhibited comparable levels of responses to sucrose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Jeong et al., (2016) showed that activation of labellar mechanosensory neurons expressing Nanchung suppresses sugar neurons by means of axo-axonic inhibitory transmission. In this context, one would expect that sugar neuron transmission is dampened by harder substrates (e.g. 1.5% agarose), which could in principle suppress the synaptic output of sugar neurons. In this context, flies are expected to show preference for softer substrate. Similarly, Zhang et al., (2016) showed that the optogenetic activation of TMC neurons leads to a decrease of sucrose induced PER in flies, implying that the mechanosensory neurons are in fact inhibiting the sugar sensory neurons, not the other way around. However here, the authors show that the sugar neurons are in fact activating TMC neurons. The authors need to perform additional experiments to address this discrepancy or at least provide some explanation in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point that we should have discussed. Here we offered our explanations and we have included a discussion on this point in our revised manuscript. We believed findings reported in Jeong et al., (2016) and Zhang et al., (2016) are not incompatible with ours.</p><p>1) We showed that sweet neurons can act to potentiate the output of TMC neurons through presynaptic facilitation, these two reports showed that NOMPCneurons – and potentially also TMCneurons – can act to inhibit the output of the sweet neurons through presynaptic inhibition. These two forms of modulations can co-exist.</p><p>2) The reciprocal nature of the interactions between sweet neurons and the mechanosensitive neurons indeed raised the concern that 100 mM sucrose may exert less facilitation on the output of TMCneurons when animals were sampling 1.5% agarose than when animals were sampling 0.5% agarose (as output of the sweet neurons were expected to be dampened more on the harder 1.5% substrate). Consequently, this is expected to cause TMC neurons to experience stronger sucrose-induced facilitation on the softer substrate than on the harder one, thus narrowing the perceived the differences in hardness of 0.5% vs. 1.5% agarose (mediated by TMC neurons). Therefore, the modulation reported by Zhang et al., and Jeong et al., would not produce outcomes that contradict ours.</p><p>3) We suspect the impact of substrate hardness on output of sweet neurons might be less significant on the decisions we described in this manuscript. Jeong et al., found that different concentrations (0.2% – 2%) of agarose can impact behavioral preference for 0.5 mM vs. 1.0 mM sucrose. The sucrose we used was 100 mM. Further, while Jeong et al., and Zhang et al., both showed that activation of mechanosensitive neurons can inhibit PER – a direct behavior readout for activation of sweet neurons, it is unclear whether 0.5% vs. 1.5% agarose may exert significantly different levels of inhibition on PER. For example, in Zhang et al., strong PER suppression was observed by comparing the impact of 3% agarose vs. 0% agarose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Schwartz et al., (2012) showed that the positive or negative influence of sugar on oviposition depends on the size of the egg laying chamber. The sugar-induced oviposition avoidance observed by the authors is likely an artifact of the small chamber size. It is unclear whether the interesting observation they made in this study is also influenced by the chamber size. The authors should at least conduct some of their key experiments in larger egg-laying chambers to see whether their conclusion still holds.</p></disp-quote><p>This is another very valid point. To address this question, we have now examined how WT and <italic>tmc</italic> mutants discriminated 0.5% vs. 1.5% agarose in the presence and absence of 100 mM sucrose in arenas that are ~ 8X the size of our regular arenas. We found that flies did not behave significantly differently when choosing substrates of different hardness in regular vs. large arenas: (1) both WT and <italic>tmc</italic> mutants preferred the 0.5% over 1.5% agarose in the large arenas, (2) 100 mM sucrose caused WT but not <italic>tmc</italic> mutants to reduce preference for 0.5% agarose in the large arenas. This result is now shown in new Figure 4—figure supplement 2B and C.</p></body></sub-article></article>
