however, the fluorescence levels provided by the original attempts to use this strategy were inadequate. In the present study, we developed a stochastic multicolor labeling method with enhanced expression levels that uses a tetracycline-operator system (Tetbow). We optimized Tetbow for either plasmid or virus vector-mediated multicolor labeling. When combined with tissue clearing, Tetbow was powerful enough to visualize the three-dimensional architecture of individual neurons. Using Tetbow, we were able to visualize the axonal projection patterns of individual mitral/tufted cells along several millimeters in the mouse olfactory system. We also developed a Tetbow system with chemical tags, in which genetically encoded chemical tags were labeled with synthetic fluorophores. This was useful in expanding the repertoire of the fluorescence labels and the applications of the Tetbow system. Together, these new tools facilitate light-microscopy-based neuronal tracing at both a large scale and a high resolution.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40350.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain is made up of millions of cells called neurons, and it is important to learn how these neurons are wired together to better understand how the brain works. To make it easier to tell individual neurons apart in samples from brains, some scientists have developed a process called Brainbow that labels individual neurons with different fluorescent colors. Scientists have also created techniques called “tissue clearing” to make a brain transparent in the laboratory. These techniques make the brain see-through enough to allow scientists to study the wiring of the brain in three dimensions.</p><p>These multicolor labeling and tissue clearing techniques are very helpful for studying the brain. But they have an important limitation; the fluorescent colors are not bright enough to allow scientists to trace the long extensions called axons and dendrites that wire neurons together. As a result, tracing axons and dendrites was difficult and required cutting the brain into hundreds of thin slices. It could take several months for scientists to trace the path of a single neuron. Brighter fluorescent labeling colors would allow scientists to use high-powered microscopes to trace the entire length of a neuron in a whole brain much more quickly and easily.</p><p>Now, Sakaguchi et al. have developed a bright multicolor labeling method for neurons called Tetbow. Tetbow produces more vivid colors allowing scientists to trace the wiring of neurons over long distances in the mouse brain. Sakaguchi et al. combined Tetbow with tissue clearing techniques to dissect and trace many neurons in a whole mouse brain within a few days.</p><p>Neuroscientists can now use Tetbow to speed up the study of how neurons are wired in the brain. Researchers working in other fields could also use Tetbow to help track the behavior of different cells. Tetbow allows everyone to see the beautiful wiring of the brain in three dimensions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fluorescence imaging</kwd><kwd>neuronal circuit</kwd><kwd>neuronal tracing</kwd><kwd>Brainbow</kwd><kwd>tissue clearing</kwd><kwd>chemical tag</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP17K14946</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leiwe</surname><given-names>Marcus N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP18dm0207055h</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imai</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP17H06261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imai</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012131</institution-id><institution>Brain Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imai</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006264</institution-id><institution>RIKEN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imai</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP16H06456</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imai</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP16K14568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imai</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP15H05572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imai</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP15K14336</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imai</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A bright and stochastic multicolor labeling method, Tetbow, facilitates millimeters-scale reconstructions of neuronal circuits at a large scale using tissue clearing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal circuits are the basis for brain function. Therefore, the reconstruction of neuronal wiring diagrams is key to understanding circuit function. Fluorescence imaging has been a powerful approach in visualizing the three-dimensional structure of neuronal morphology. In particular, fluorescent proteins are useful for labeling genetically-defined neuronal populations. In recent years, a number of tissue-clearing methods have been developed, and these have been optimized for use with fluorescent proteins and deep-tissue antibody staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Susaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>). These new tools have expanded the scale of the available technologies for fluorescence imaging to whole-organ and whole-organism levels.</p><p>It is still difficult, however, to dissect and trace an individual neuron from a brain sample labeled with a single type of fluorescent protein. One way to overcome this problem is to improve the spatial resolution. Recently, we developed a tissue-clearing agent for high-resolution three-dimensional fluorescence imaging, named SeeDB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ke et al., 2013</xref>). SeeDB2 was designed to minimize spherical aberrations, allowing for high-resolution imaging including super-resolution microscopy. In this approach, there was much improvement in the z-resolution, a critical factor for dissection of neuronal fibers crossing over along the z-axis. Similarly, expansion microscopy is also a promising new approach used to improve resolution in three-dimensional fluorescence imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ku et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tillberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Another approach to the dissection of neuronal circuits is multicolor labeling. To facilitate the dissection of individual neurons, a transgenic multicolor labeling method, Brainbow, has been developed, in which three different fluorescent proteins were expressed in a stochastic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Livet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loulier et al., 2014</xref>). Brainbow used the Cre-loxP system to express one of the three fluorescent protein genes stochastically in a transgene. When multiple copies of the transgene cassette are introduced, stochastic choices will result in a combinatorial expression of these three genes with different copy numbers, producing dozens of color hues.</p><p>Although the Brainbow concept is powerful for discriminating between numerous neurons using light microscopy, the existing Brainbow methods are of limited use for neuronal tracing. This is because the stochastic and combinatorial expression of fluorescent proteins is possible only at low copy number ranges for the transgenes, so that the expression levels of the fluorescent proteins were not sufficiently high for bright and high-resolution imaging of axons and dendrites. Therefore, many of the previous studies were forced to use subsequent antibody staining to produce reliable neuronal tracing. In the present study, we utilized the Tet-Off system (Tetbow) to develop a multicolor labeling method with enhanced expression. As vector (plasmid and virus)-mediated gene transfer has become a versatile tool in modern neuroscience, we aimed to perform multicolor labeling using these tools. As a proof-of-concept experiment, we demonstrated the ability to trace axons of individual neurons on the scale of several millimeters in the mouse olfactory system. To improve the stability of the fluorescence labels after harsh tissue-clearing treatment, we also developed a Tetbow system with chemical tags. When combined with the advances in the growing field of tissue-clearing techniques, these new multicolor labeling strategies should facilitate neuronal tracing at higher densities and resolutions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A trade-off between expression levels and color variation</title><p>Earlier Brainbow methods utilized transgenic animals for stochastic multicolor labeling. They utilized the Cre-loxP system, in which DNA recombination resulted in a stochastic selection of one fluorescent protein gene out of three (or more) choices. When multiple copies of the Brainbow transgene were introduced into the genome, stochastic recombination produced a variety of color hues based on different copy numbers of expressed fluorescent protein genes (collectively called XFPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Livet et al., 2007</xref>). In recent years, however, plasmid or virus vector-mediated gene transfer has become a more versatile strategy in neuroscience. We therefore tried to optimize a multicolor labeling method for vector-mediated gene transfer.</p><p>Previously, an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated Brainbow method (AAV-Brainbow) has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cai et al., 2013</xref>). However, in the vector-mediated gene transfer, the Cre-loxP system is not essential for the stochastic and combinatorial expression of XFP genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kobiler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Siddiqi et al., 2014</xref>). We can easily make color variations by introducing a mixture of three different XFP constructs: as long as the copy number of the introduced genes is small, labeled neurons will still produce a variety of colors irrespective of whether the Cre-loxP system is used or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). It should be noted, however, that color variation reduces as the copy number of the introduced genes increases. We can estimate the optimum copy number of the introduced XFP genes as follows. We considered that the number of introduced genes will follow a Poisson distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kobiler et al., 2010</xref>). When three different XFP genes are introduced at 20 copies/cell/color on average, a similar number of copies will be introduced into each neuron, and only a small degree of color variation will be generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By contrast, if the copy number is too small, many of the neurons will express just one XFP gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When these three genes are introduced at an average 2 copies/cell/color, much larger color variations will be produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40350.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tetbow strategy.</title><p>Stochastic representation of the vector-mediated multicolor labeling strategy. Here we assume that the copy numbers of introduced vectors follow a Poisson distribution. In a plasmid or virus-mediated gene transfer method, we do not need to use the Cre-loxP system. Rather, it is important to limit the number of genes introduced into each cell. For example, in theory, an average of 2 copies/cell/color can result in the stochastic expression of three different genes (<bold>B</bold>). If we introduce a copy number that is too small (e.g. an average of 0.2 copies/cell; <bold>A</bold>), only one of the three genes will be expressed in most cells. If too many genes are introduced in each cell (e.g. an average of 20 copies/cell; <bold>C</bold>), color variations will be reduced because many of the neurons will express a similar number of XFP genes. The use of the Cre-loxP system alone cannot solve this problem. Simulations of the expected color variations that are based on the various Poisson distributions (middle) are shown as ternary plots (100 plots/condition, right panel). The numerical data are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>.

We plotted the color values for cells in the color-coding space after intensity normalization (total intensity = 1). In this coding space, each dimension represents the intensity of one of the three colors (Red, Green, and Blue in pseudocolor representation). The mean Euclidean distance (<italic>d</italic>) for two randomly chosen cells was greater when the copy number was lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>), but this does not necessarily mean that we can discriminate between many cells, as the two cells are more likely to become the same color when copy number is too low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We therefore calculated the probability that two randomly chosen cells are discriminated on the basis of a given threshold distance in the color-coding space. Here we considered that cells within the threshold distance (<italic>d</italic>) from a reference are indiscriminable in the color-coding space; cells outside of the threshold distance were considered discriminable from the reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In our simulation, when we assumed a threshold distance of 0.1, 95.3% of cells could be discriminated from a given cell when XFP genes were expressed at 2 copies/color/cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We also found that experienced researchers can discriminate two colors separated by 0.1 Euclidean distances in the color-coding space at 94.5 ± 1.73% accuracy (mean ± S.D.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1— figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, ~2 copies/color/cell is the optimum when the color hues are judged visually by human experimenters.</p><p>We evaluated this prediction using the <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation of plasmid vectors into layer 2/3 cortical pyramidal neurons (electroporated at embryonic day 15). We introduced a mixture of three separate plasmid vectors encoding mTurquoise2 (blue), EYFP (green), and tdTomato (red) genes under a CAG promoter. When these plasmids were expressed at high copy numbers (CAG High; DNA solution introduced was 1 μg/μL/plasmid; 3 μg/μL in total; see 'Materials and methods' section for details), only small color variations were produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). When the DNA concentrations were reduced (CAG Low; 0.25 μg/μL/plasmid), the color variation increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), but the overall fluorescence levels were much reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Recent studies indicated that the tetracycline response element (TRE) promoter ensures much higher expression levels than the CAG promoter when expressed with a tetracycline trans-activator (tTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sadakane et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore used the tTA-TRE (Tet-Off) system instead of a common CAG promoter. We also introduced a Woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE) sequence in the 3’′ UTR of XFP genes to improve their expression levels. Earlier Brainbow techniques used membrane-bound XFPs because unmodified XFPs labeled the somata too brightly and affected the tracing of nearby neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cai et al., 2013</xref>). However, this problem can be easily solved by minimizing spherical aberration in microscopy by using an index-matched clearing agent, SeeDB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ke et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, unmodified XFPs label axons and dendrites much more brightly than the membrane-bound ones (data not shown). We therefore used unmodified XFPs instead of membrane-bound XFPs. These new set of constructs (named Tetbow; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) achieved much higher XFP expression levels when compared with the CAG-promoter plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). When we quantified the expression levels of EYFP, we observed a six-fold increase in fluorescence levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; CAG 0.25 μg/μL vs. Tetbow 0.25 μg/μL; n = 104 and 260, respectively, p&lt;0.0001, Kruskal Wallis with Dunn’s post hoc test). Tetbow allowed for much more robust multicolor labeling than the Brainbow constructs when introduced by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation, allowing more reliable axon tracing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Owing to the enhanced expression, the Tetbow system achieved bright labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) while maintaining the color variations produced by low copy numbers of XFP genes. When CAG-XFP genes were introduced at high concentrations (1 μg/μL each), the color variations were small; by contrast, the Tetbow constructs (0.25 μg/μL) produced much larger variations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In the color discrimination analysis, we confirmed that different cells are better discriminated by Tetbow than in the CAG High condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>We further tried to determine the optimum concentration of plasmids for Tetbow when labeled with <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation. Among the four plasmid concentrations we tested (0.05, 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 μg/μL each), color discrimination performance was comparable. Paradoxically, however, the expression levels of XFP were the highest at 0.25 μg/μL each, not at 0.5. We therefore considered the possibility that a moderate expression level of tTA is critical for the optimum expression. When 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 μg/μL of CAG-tTA plasmid was co-introduced with 0.25 μg/μL each of TRE-XFP plasmids, the highest expression level was found with 0.1 μg/μL CAG-tTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). Thus, too high a concentration of tTA leads to the suppression of TRE-XFP genes. Consistent with this assumption, when the WPRE sequence was added to the CAG-tTA plasmid, the expression level of TRE-XFP genes was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the expression level of tTA needs to be moderate to achieve the highest expression of TRE-XFP genes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40350.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Optimization of Tetbow plasmid concentrations for <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Plasmid concentrations for the four Tetbow vectors (CAG-tTA and three TRE-XFP vectors) were tested at 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 μg/μL.

However, the size of the conventional Brainbow gene cassettes was too large to allow them to be packaged into an AAV vector (&lt;5 kb). For this reason, a previous study divided the Brainbow cassette into two separate AAVs with two XFP genes each, and employed Cre-loxP recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cai et al., 2013</xref>). As described above, however, the Cre-loxP system is not needed to achieve multicolor labeling using AAV-mediated gene expression. Using the Tetbow strategy (i.e. multiple AAV vectors with different XFP genes), we can solve the size problem, and achieve improved multicolor labeling using simplified DNA constructs.</p><p>We generated four separate AAV vectors carrying <italic>SYN1</italic>-tTA, TRE-mTurquoise2, TRE-EYFP, and TRE-tdTomato genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The human <italic>SYNI</italic> promoter was used to express tTA specifically in neurons. These four AAV vectors (serotype AAV2/1) were injected into the cerebral cortex of adult mice (P56) and analyzed two weeks later. We found a stochastic and combinatorial expression of the encoded fluorescent proteins in Layer five neurons when injected at 4 × 10<sup>8</sup> gc/mL of AAV-<italic>SYN1</italic>-tTA and 3 × 10<sup>10</sup> gc/mL of AAV-TRE-XFPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). As expected from our simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the virus titer was critical for producing color variations. Higher virus titers led to reduced color variations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, right). In the cerebral cortex, 1–3 × 10<sup>10</sup> gc/mL of AAV-TRE-XFPs was found to be optimum on the basis of the resultant expression levels and color variations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>), but the optimum range may be different for different cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), injection volumes, or virus serotypes. Expression levels were sufficiently high for high-resolution imaging of neuronal morphology, including the visualization of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). It should be noted, however, that the expression of Tetbow AAVs can lead to toxic effects on cellular functions after a prolonged incubation period, as a result of the extremely high levels of expression. For example, cortical neurons started to show an aggregation of XFPs and displayed morphological abnormalities 4 weeks after virus injection, whereas olfactory bulb neurons were best visualized at 4 weeks. Thus, the optimum incubation time may be different for different cell types.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40350.025</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Tetbow labeling with AAVs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Layer five pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex labeled with Tetbow AAVs.

To test the utility of Tetbow, we focused on mitral and tufted (M/T) cells in the olfactory bulb, which project axons (up to several millimeters) to the olfactory cortex, including the anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, piriform cortex, cortical amygdala, and lateral entorhinal cortex. Previous studies have performed axon tracing on populations of M/T cells from glomeruli in the olfactory bulb using dye injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nagayama, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>), but these studies could not fully dissect individual axons. Other studies performed single-cell axon tracing using hundreds of serial brain sections, but these analyses were highly laborious and time-consuming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Igarashi et al., 2012</xref>). Owing to these limitations, we do not yet understand fully how the odor inputs into individual M/T cells are conveyed to the olfactory cortex.</p><p>To examine the axonal projections of M/T cells from the olfactory bulb, we injected Tetbow AAVs into the mouse olfactory bulb. First, Tetbow AAVs were expressed in most of olfactory bulb neurons. When compared to single-color labeling, the stochastic and combinatorial expression of XFPs was helpful in improving tracing performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Efficient axon tracing was further facilitated by the local injection of Tetbow AAVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>). In the olfactory bulb, many types of neurons were labeled, but only M/T cells projected their axons to the olfactory cortex. To facilitate high-resolution fluorescence imaging with a limited working distance of the objective lens (20x, NA = 0.75, WD = 0.66 mm), we flattened the olfactory cortical area onto a glass slide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>). After the fixation and tissue clearing, axons of individual M/T cells were clearly visualized with XFPs in the entire area of the olfactory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). The unique color hue was largely preserved at the average level, if not at a single-pixel resolution, from proximal to distal part in each axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Across the three image areas, the median Euclidean distance for the same neuron was 0.049 (interquartile range = 0.063, n = 34 pairs).

We introduced a limited number of copies of plasmids or virus vectors into neurons to enable the stochastic expression of XFPs based on a Poisson distribution. To enhance the expression levels of XFPs, we utilized a Tet-Off system, in which the tetracycline trans-activator (tTA) binds to the TRE promoter to drive the expression of genes of interest. In this way, we achieved multicolor labeling with much-improved brightness. Previously, the electroporation and virus infection of the Brainbow construct introduced just a small number of genes per cell, and as a result, the fluorescence levels were not sufficiently high for reliable neuronal tracing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kobiler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Egawa et al., 2013</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In fact, Brainbow methods often had to employ antibody staining to enhance the fluorescence signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cai et al., 2013</xref>). However, our Tetbow strategy provides enhanced fluorescence, allowing for high-resolution imaging without the need for antibody staining. As a result, our Tetbow strategy has opened up a new opportunity for large-scale high-resolution neuronal tracing using tissue clearing.</p><p>Our Tetbow strategy also overcomes a size-limit problem associated with AAV vectors. As we introduced tTA and TRE-XFP gene cassettes with separate AAV vectors, DNA construction was also simplified. Using our Tetbow AAVs, we could clearly visualize different neurons with different color hues at synaptic resolution. It should be noted, however, that using the correct virus titer is critical for the generation of color variations. If the virus titer is too low, many of the labeled neurons will express just one XFP gene. By contrast, if the virus titer is too high, many of the labeled neurons will express all three genes at similar levels. Recently, another group employed a similar strategy using a Tet-Off system and a newly engineered AAV for intravenous transduction; but the brightness levels that they achieved were not as good as those provided by CAG vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chan et al., 2017</xref>). To achieve the highest expression levels of XFPs, the expression level of tTA needs to be optimized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The Tet-Off system is also useful for controling the sparseness of XFP expression; by simply diluting the tTA vector, the expression of XFP can be sparsened without affecting color variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>AAV- based Tetbow is useful for a relatively broad set of applications, including use in less genetically tractable model animals. For example, an AAV-based Tet-Off system has already been tested in the marmoset brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sadakane et al., 2015</xref>). Like mice, these animals demonstrated high expression levels of fluorescent proteins when the Tet-Off system was used. Thus, our Tetbow strategy can be useful for neuronal tracing studies in various species including primates.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Multicolor labeling with chemical tags</title><p>In the present study, we also extended the Tetbow method to include chemical tags. Current tissue clearing methods are intended for the use of fluorescent proteins, but chemical tags can become a good alternative to the fluorescent proteins. First, unlike fluorescent proteins, once labeled with synthetic fluorophores, chemical tags are stable under harsh clearing conditions. This means that we can have a broader choice of clearing methods, particularly for lipid-rich and thick tissues. Chemical tags may also be useful for expansion microscopy, where the stability of fluorescent proteins has been a challenging aspect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ku et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tillberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2017</xref>). The fluorescence labeling of chemical tags is much easier than the antibody staining of XFPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kohl et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, synthetic fluorophores penetrate much deeper than antibodies because of their smaller size. Second, more choices of fluorescence spectrum and photochemical properties are available with chemical tags than with fluorescent proteins. For example, synthetic fluorophores cover the spectrum from UV to near-IR range, expanding the possible spectrum range when imaging. In addition, autonomously blinking fluorophores are very useful for localization-based super-resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Uno et al., 2014</xref>). Multicolor 3D PALM/STORM imaging of cleared tissues would be an interesting possibility in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Single-axon tracing for long-range axonal projections</title><p>In recent years, several tissue-clearing methods that are optimized for fluorescence imaging have been developed, expanding the imaging scale in light-microscopy-based neuronal tracing. However, the imaging resolution was not sufficiently high for densely labeled neuronal circuits. Therefore, we could only look at population-level connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oh et al., 2014</xref>) or at a very small subset of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Economo et al., 2016</xref>) with light microscopy. To examine the projection diagram of individual neurons, a single-cell barcoding and RNA sequencing approach, MAPseq, has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kebschull et al., 2016</xref>). Although MAPseq is a promising new tool in the study of area-to-area connectivity for hundreds of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Han et al., 2018</xref>), we cannot know the finer details of their neuronal morphology. Currently, saturated connectomics is only possible with electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kasthuri et al., 2015</xref>), but the analytical throughput is currently not sufficient for the study of long-range projections. The combination of Tetbow and tissue clearing can become a useful tool to fill the gap, allowing the dissection of densely labeled neurons at a large scale.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations and future challenges</title><p>In the present study, we employed our Tetbow method to analyze axonal projection profiles for M/T cells in the mouse olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We were able to find labeled axons in all the areas of the olfactory cortices that we examined (piriform cortex, cortical amygdala, and lateral entorhinal cortex), but it remains unclear whether we could completely label all the fibers to their termini. In fact, it is extremely difficult to know whether the labeled termini are really termini or are interrupted by small unlabeled gaps. Even if the second scenario is very likely, it is difficult to know which segments are in fact connected to each other, but the variable color hues can help. Single-cell labeling is advantageous to avoid such ambiguity, although the throughput is limited for such analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Igarashi et al., 2012</xref>). By contrast, multicolor labeling may be useful to compare the projection patterns in the same animals. In our analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, we traced axons using conservative criteria: we terminated tracing when labeled axons were interrupted by small gaps. Nevertheless, the quality of axonal tracing was comparable to that in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nagayama, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>). To further improve the tracing performance (including up to the axon termini), it will be important to improve labeling methods in order to fill the thin neuronal fibers completely and evenly.</p><p>In this study, we employed manual neuronal tracing to Tetbow data, and were able to trace individual M/T cell axons successfully at the millimeter (&gt;6 mm) scale. Color hues were consistent at a global scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), but not perfect in high-magnification images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Chromatic aberration can also be a problem in the high-resolution imaging of thick tissues. Another important challenge will be to improve the color hue consistency throughout a neuron and to develop auto-tracing software that is optimized for the multicolor-labeled neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

To obtain brain tissue, mice were i.p. injected with an overdose of nembutal (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma) or somnopentyl (Kyoritsu Seiyaku) to produce deep anesthesia, followed by an intracardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Excised brain samples were post-fixed with 4% PFA in PBS at 4°C overnight. Samples were then embedded in 4% agarose and cut into slices of 220, 500, or 1000 μm thick with a microslicer, PRO7N (Dosaka EM).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title><italic>In utero</italic> electroporation</title><p>The <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation of plasmids to the cerebral cortex and mitral cells was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saito, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muroyama et al., 2016</xref>). Pregnant ICR mice were anesthetized with medetomidine (0.3 mg/kg), midazolam (4 mg/kg), and butorphanol (5 mg/kg), or with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). The uterine horns carrying embryos were exposed through a midline abdominal incision. To label L2/3 neurons in the cortex, 1 μL of plasmid solutions diluted in PBS was injected into the lateral ventricle of the embryos at E15 using a micropipette made from a glass capillary. Electric pulses (single 10 ms poration pulse at 72 V, followed by five 50 ms driving pulses at 40–42 V with 950 ms intervals) were delivered by a CUY21EX electroporator (BEX) and forcep-type electrodes (5 mm diameter, #LF650P5, BEX). To introduce pCAG-XFP vectors, the labels pCAG-mTurquoise2, EYFP, and tdTomato were injected into the lateral ventricle and electroporated at high-copy (1 μg/μL each, 3 μg/μL in total) or low-copy (0.25 μg/μL each, 0.75 μg/μL in total) numbers. pTRE-XFP vectors with pCAG-tTA were injected and electroporated at low-copy numbers (0.25 μg/μL each, 1.0 μg/μL in total) when not specified; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the exact plasmid concentrations are specified. To label mitral cells in the olfactory bulb, <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation was performed at E12. Electric pulses (single 10 ms poration pulse at 72 V, followed by five 50 ms driving pulses at 36 V with 950 ms intervals) were delivered with forceps-type electrodes (3 mm diameter, #LF650P3, BEX). After the electroporation, the uterine horns were placed back into the abdominal cavity, and the abdominal wall and skin were sutured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>AAV</title><p>AAV vectors were generated using the AAVpro Helper Free System (AAV1, #6673, Takara) from Takara and the AAVpro 293 T cell line (#632273, Clontech) following the manufacturers’ instructions. The backbone pAAV plasmid is for AAV2. Thus, the serotype used in this study is AAV2/1. AAV vectors were generated by AAVpro 293 T cells (#632273, Clontech). AAVpro 293T is a commercialized cell line for production of AAV vectors. We did not test for mycoplasma contamination in our hands. In our experiments, cells within 10 passages were used for virus production. AAV vectors were purified using the AAVpro Purification Kit All Serotypes (#6666, Takara). Virus titers were then determined by qPCR using the AAVpro Titration Kit (#6233, Takara) and the StepOnePlus system (ThermoFisher). To infect the AAV vectors, C57BL/6 mice (P56-70) were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), and an AAV virus cocktail was injected into the brain using the nanoject II system and glass capillaries (#3-00-203-G/XL, Drummond). The injection volume was 207 nL in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, 138 nL in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>, and 207 nL ×5 different locations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>. The final concentration of the virus cocktail was 4 × 10<sup>8</sup> gc/ml for AAV2/1-<italic>SYN1</italic>-tTA2 and 1 × 10<sup>10</sup>–1 × 10<sup>11</sup> gc/mL each for AAV2/1-TRE-mTurquoise2-WPRE, AAV2/1-TRE-EYFP-WPRE, and AAV2/1-TRE-tdTomato-WPRE. The mice were sacrificed 2 or 4 weeks after viral injection. It should be noted that the expression of Tetbow AAV can lead to toxic effects for cellular functions after prolonged incubation because of the extremely high levels of expression. For example, cortical neurons started to show aggregation of XFPs and morphological abnormality 4 weeks after virus injection. Olfactory bulb neurons were best visualized 4 weeks after virus injection without obvious sign of toxicity. The optimum timing for the analysis may be different for different cell types.</p><p>The following stereotaxic coordinates were used for AAV injection.

Diode lasers of 442 or 448 nm, 488 nm, and 552 nm wavelength were used for mTurquoise2, EYFP, and tdTomato, respectively. In some experiments, a white light laser was used to image mTurquoise2, EYFP, and tdTomato. To image chemical tags, SNAP-Surface 488, HaloTag TMR Ligand, and CLIP-Surface 647 were imaged with diode lasers of 488 nm, 552 nm, and 638 nm wavelength, respectively. Emission light was dispersed by a prism and detected by HyD detectors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Image processing and quantification</title><p>Microscopy data were processed and visualized with LAS X (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013673">SCR_013673</ext-link>, Leica Microsystems) or Imaris (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007370">SCR_007370</ext-link>, Bitplane). Image data were excluded from further quantitative analyses when the data contained saturated fluorescence signals. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, the fluorescence intensities on somata were quantified with ImageJ at every 2.97 μm thickness. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, an image of the soma was taken and analyzed at the focal depth for each cell. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, color values at axons were analyzed for maximum intensity projection images, as there may be a slight chromatic aberration along the z axis. After binarization, the average color value ratio was determined for each segment of each axon. Ternary plots, box plots, and statistical analyses were prepared using MATLAB (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link>, MathWorks). Image data were acquired by RS, to prevent bias when they were subsequently analyzed by MNL. First, the fluorescence intensity in each channel was normalized so that the median intensity was 1. Then, the intensity values were further normalized so that the length of the vector was 1. Raw quantification data (Source Data files) are accompanied with figures.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, we focused on axons were found within 200 μm of the anterior end of the image. We terminated tracing when labeled axons were interrupted by unlabeled gaps; in such cases, we judged that we cannot be 100% sure whether the interrupted segments are connected. Thus, our tracing was performed using very conservative criteria, and thus most probably provides an underestimate of the entire wiring diagram. Axons that can be traced for &gt;1,000 μm were analyzed (25 axons). Putative mitral and tufted cells were identified on the basis of the projection area (piriform cortex vs. olfactory tubercle) and their axonal trajectories. Brightly-labeled putative mitral and tufted cells were further analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>, we focused on axons that crossed the anterior plane and within the lateral half. We chose 100 axons in an unbiased manner from the dorsal to ventral direction. The criteria for successful tracing are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>; as these criteria are very strict, the area that is traced may be an underestimate.

All of the subjects (from the Imai lab) have experience in fluorescence imaging, understand the purpose of the test, and have trichromatic color vision. To prevent the intensity of the color from influencing the decision, the intensity was randomly varied between 50–100% for each square displayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The subject was presented with a choice to discriminate between two colors at a specified Euclidean distance. Specifically, they were asked to determine whether the two columns form a cross or a parallel line. For each Euclidean distance presented, there were 100 trials per subject, with the average success rate stored. Note that this test was not intended to evaluate the color discrimination performance of people in general.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Modeling</title><p>Poisson distributions were calculated in MATLAB, by creating independent distributions for each XFP for each specified copy number. 200 ‘cells’ were selected for each copy number group with associated XFP values derived from the Poisson distributions.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Tetbow: bright multicolor labeling of neuronal circuits with fluorescent proteins and chemical tags&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Moritz Helmstaedter as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers.</p><p>Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at this point. However, if you are able to provide the additional experiments outlined below, we would be willing to consider a revised manuscript. This decision reflects the fact that <italic>eLife</italic> does not allow reviewers to suggest new experiments that are likely to take longer than 2 months to perform for a revision decision. By instead rejecting these manuscripts, we leave it up to the authors to decide if they think the reviewers are essentially correct, in which case, they may wish to do the requested experiments. If, however, they do not agree with the reviewers, then we would expect authors to send the paper elsewhere. Of course, if you already have the requested experiments in hand, we would be very pleased to have a revised manuscript, incorporating those new data immediately.</p><p>Your manuscript reports an approach for bright multicolor labeling of neurons with the goal of deducing neuronal circuitry. While the reviewers see a benefit of this technology over existing techniques, the following points would need to be added to the manuscript to satisfy the consensus concerns of the reviewers (see below for unedited original reviews):</p><p>1) While it may seem plausible that an improvement of color distinction and/or brightness of labeling and/or constancy of colors were achieved, a clear application demonstrating the advance over existing techniques is missing. The reviewers suggest either of the following two proof-of-principle reports:</p><p>- Quantitative report of long-distance (millimeters) color constancy when labeling axons.</p><p>- Automated / efficient reconstruction of single neurons over longer distances, quantification that this reconstruction is performing better with TetBow than with previous techniques.</p><p>2) The implications of the technique for circuit reconstruction (connectomics) should be described more cautiously: in local dense networks, the fluorescent labeling of neurons alone does not allow the inference of synaptic connectivity. For long-range labeling, the situation is more benign. We would ask that you amend the text accordingly and discuss this, also in light of the requested proof-of-concept application (see point 1).</p><p>Without a proof-of-principle experiment showing clearly the advance of the method over existing technology, the evaluation of the manuscript would be substantially less positive.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript &quot;Tetbow: bright mutlicolor labeling of neuronal circuits with fluorescent proteins and chemical tags&quot; by Sakaguchi et al. reports the development of a multicolor neuronal labelling toolbox that uses the Tetracyclin-operator system instead of the Cre-loxP system used for the &quot;Brainbow&quot; technology. The main claim of the manuscript is that this different approach increases color variability and provides enhanced color intensity. While an improvement over the &quot;Brainbow&quot; technology for neuron labelling is a relevant endeavour.</p><p>I see the following key concerns with the manuscript:</p><p>1) The notion of wiring diagram and circuits is mistaken when all that is provided is an intracellular labelling of a presynaptic neuronal population. Wiring diagrams imply synapse detection which this method is currently not providing. This has to be made very clear and care should be taken not to confuse the terminology. Still, intense and long-range labelling of a large number of presynaptic neurons can contribute to circuit analysis and in this sense the method could be valuable.</p><p>2) While the manuscript contains many beautiful images, a quantitative documentation of long-range color constancy is missing. In this reviewer's opinion the long-range color constancy is a key prerequisite to use multicolor labelling methods at the light level for circuit inference. While locally the detection of synapses is absolutely required to distinguish an incidental from a synaptic contact, millimeters away from the source neuron, circuit inference can be plausibly done by judging the projection target regions of presynaptic neurons. However, for this the neurons have to stay brightly labelled over millimeters if not centimeters in larger brains. This needs to be documented and quantified for this approach to make a substantial advance.</p><p>3) Related to point 2, it would be necessary to show a clear, at least potential improvement in terms of interpretation of such data. Some proof of concept application would be required – at least a hypothetical one. This does not imply that for a methods manuscript a full result has to be documented but at least the notion of what this kind of result could be and why this method in contrast to previous methods will be able to achieve this. Again, I would suggest using the long-range circuit inference as one of these possible key applications.</p><p>In summary I think this is an interesting methodological advance that however so far lacks clear quantitative documentation of long-range color constancy. The enhancement of color space is impressive but without a clear application difficult to judge in terms of its impact for neuroscience.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this article the authors present a useful variation of Brainbow strategy for stochastic multicolor labeling of neurons. Their method, which they called Tetbow, combines the Tet-Off system with the Brainbow approach. They show that they can generate multicolor labeling using plasmids for XFPs or chemical tags as well as with viral tools. These reagents will be a useful addition to the already available recombinase based or transgenic toolkit for multicolor labeling. However, the authors' major claim that the expression levels of FPs using this approach is much higher, therefore this strategy 'should facilitate neuronal circuit reconstruction at higher densities and resolutions' compared to the current -best of class- Brainbow approaches is not supported by the data presented. Labeling many neurons in a brain and labeling individual neurons bright enough for complete reconstructions is a challenging problem. But it is not clear from the data presented that the approach presented in this manuscript solves this problem.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The conditions for induction of the Tet-Off system need to be described in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>2) It is not clear from the description why the 0.25µg/µl was chosen for the in utero electroporations. Were multiple concentrations tried? Was the chosen concentration arrived at after examining spread (colors) or by looking at ternary plots as in Figure 2D.</p><p>3) Subsection “Image processing and quantification”, subsection “Modeling”, subsection “Imaging data”, include code and data location.</p><p>4) Figure 2 panel D – the ternary plot could be separated out for the three conditions for clarity.</p><p>5) Figure 1—figure supplement 1 seems unnecessary – addresses a special case of Brainbow.</p><p>6) Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 can be condensed together; the plasmid cartoons again could be condensed. Similarly, for the other plasmid and vector maps.</p><p>7) Figure 2—figure supplement 3 – Brainbow 3.0 experiment is uninformative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Sakaguchi et al., present a toolbox for multicolor neuronal labeling termed &quot;Tetbow&quot;. Their approach relies on mixing three distinct vectors that express different colors of fluorescent protein (cyan, yellow or red) with the Tet-Off system. Each fluorescent protein gene is under the control of a tetracycline response element (TRE), activated by a transactivator (tTA2) encoded by a fourth vector. The authors show that this strategy enables multicolor labeling of mouse neurons by in utero electroporation, and provide evidence that higher expression and more color contrast can be achieved with Tet-Off transactivation compared with direct expression of the fluorescent proteins from a CAG promoter. They also present a variation of their technique in which protein tags (SNAP, Halo and CLIP) are used to label neurons with combinations of synthetic fluorochromes resistant to tissue clearing procedures. Finally, they present a version of Tetbow based on AAV vectors, which also achieves multicolor labeling of neurons in injected brain areas.</p><p>The tools presented in the manuscript may be of interest for the neuroscience community and several convincing images are provided that support their effectiveness. I have however several general concerns about the manuscript:</p><p>First, most of the concepts used in the paper are not new. For instance, multicolor labeling with mixtures of vectors expressing distinct XFPs has been introduced several years ago (Weber et al., 2011), as has been the usage of AAV vectors (Cai et al., 2013) or electroporation (Loulier et al., 2014) to achieve multicolor neuronal labeling, and the modeling of the relation between copy number and color combinations (Kobiler et al., 2010).</p><p>Second, beyond the images presented in the article, there is no demonstration of a usage of the Tetbow approach to trace connectivity. An application of these strategies to study some aspects of brain circuitry is essential to evaluate their usefulness. In particular it appears uncertain that labeled neuronal processes can be followed in their entirety in neural tissue samples.</p><p>Third, due to incomplete description or inappropriate evaluation procedures, the actual improvement brought by Tetbow appears uncertain. For instance, it is unclear if the number of samples analyzed in Figure 1 is sufficient to minimize discrepancies among the different brains analyzed, and between different sections of a given brain. The authors also claim that their scheme is simpler that Brainbow, but in practice this is hardly the case: with Tetbow, a total of 4 plasmids or AAV vectors must be introduced in neurons of interest, while with Brainbow two plasmids (Brainbow et al., 2014) or 2 AAVs (AAV no. 1 and no. 2, Cai et al., 2013) are sufficient. In addition, with Tetbow, careful titration of the different color vectors needs to be performed for each fresh vector preparation, while expression of different XFPs is intrinsically balanced in Brainbow transgenes, making them inherently more reproducible. Concerning the strategy based on protein tags (Figure 5), one cannot assess how deep synthetic fluorochromes labels diffuse within tissue sections: does this scheme really enable to label more than just the first few 10th of micrometers of tissue samples? Finally, are Tetbow protein tags (Figure 5) and AAVs (Figure 6) more efficient in terms of expression level and color contrast than standard vectors? It seems that most cells in Figure 5 and Figure 6 coexpress all three XFPs and that the color contrast in these samples is low.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Tetbow: bright multicolor labeling of neuronal circuits with fluorescent proteins and chemical tags&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

They have significantly strengthened their study, with the addition of: (1) a theoretical analysis of the color discriminability expected with their labeling scheme; (2) a more precise characterization of the effects of plasmid and AAV concentrations and ratios on color labels; (3) examples of axon tracing over long distances in mitral cells labeled with AAV mixtures. This latter point constituted the main insufficiency of the initial draft of the article, and is addressed in a relatively convincing manner, although an evaluation of the applicability of chemical tags for tracing is still lacking. The tools presented in the manuscript and the efforts made at characterizing optimal labeling conditions will be of interest for the neuroscience community.</p><p>My main comment about this new version of the article concerns the presentation of the results, which requires significant revision of the text for the following reasons:</p><p>- Several concepts presented in the article are not novel per se and are simply improved and more deeply explored than in the studies that introduced them. The true interest of the article lies in these improvements and optimizations, which will undoubtedly be useful to the community, not in the rediscovery of previous ideas. This is for instance the case of multicolor labeling with mixtures of distinct single-color viral vectors (Chan et al., 2017; Weber et al., 2011) or plasmids (Siddiqi et al., 2014), modeling of the relationship between copy number and color (Kobiler et al., 2010), usage of the Tet-Off system to amplify expression in a multicolor context (Chan et al., 2017 and other studies)…When introducing these concepts, the text should state this explicitly and refer to the related articles.

The reviewers suggest either of the following two proof-of-principle reports:</p><p>- Quantitative report of long-distance (millimeters) color constancy when labeling axons.</p><p>- Automated / efficient reconstruction of single neurons over longer distances, quantification that this reconstruction is performing better with TetBow than with previous techniques.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to demonstrate the capabilities of our bright multicolor-labelling method, Tetbow. Particularly, proof-of-principle experiments such as tracing long-range axonal projections would be helpful. In our new sets of experiments, we focused on mitral and tufted (M/T) cells in the olfactory bulb (OB), which project axons (up to ~6 mm long) to the olfactory cortices, including the olfactory tubercle, piriform cortex, cortical amygdala, and lateral entorhinal cortex. When we labeled M/T axons with Tetbow, axon collaterals of M/T cells were clearly visualized in the piriform cortex; however, published Brainbow constructs could not clearly label these axons in the same condition (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Automated circuit tracing is obviously an important future direction using Tetbow; however, it is far beyond the scope of the current submission to develop and include auto-tracing software. Instead, we performed manual tracing. To evaluate the performance of our manual tracing objectively, we examined the color discrimination performance of researchers (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). We confirmed that we can visually discriminate color hues with 0.1 Euclidian distance in a C-Y-R color coding space with &gt;90% accuracy (Figure 1H). In that situation, one cell can be successfully discriminated from ~90% of random cells (Figure 1G).</p><p>We then evaluated the performance of Tetbow for manually tracing M/T cell axons. In one experiment (Figure 8), we injected AAV-Tetbow locally. In another experiment (Figure 8—figure supplement 2), we injected the same virus cocktail to the entire dorsal OB densely. Tracing was performed after tissue clearing. In the local injection experiments, only dozens of M/T cells were labelled, and these axons were clearly distinguishable from each other and could be traced into the olfactory cortex (Figure 8). Each M/T cell demonstrated a unique branching pattern in the cortex (Figure 8—figure supplement 1), supplementing previous studies that used laborious single-axon tracing (Nagayama et al., 2010; Sosulski et al., 2011; Ghosh et al., 2011; Igarashi et al., 2012). Notably, the unique color hue was maintained from proximal to distal part of M/T cell axons, allowing for reliable manual tracing (Figure 8C). In the second experiment (dense labeling), most of M/T cells in the dorsal OB were labelled (Figure 8—figure supplement 2A); however, these axons were dissociated and traced for hundreds of microns based on color hues, which was impossible with single-color labeling (Figure 8—figure supplement 2B, C). Together, we concluded that our Tetbow method allows for long-range axonal tracing (at several millimeters scale) in cleared tissues at unprecedented reliability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The implications of the technique for circuit reconstruction (connectomics) should be described more cautiously: in local dense networks, the fluorescent labeling of neurons alone does not allow the inference of synaptic connectivity. For long-range labeling, the situation is more benign. We would ask that you amend the text accordingly and discuss this, also in light of the requested proof-of-concept application (see point 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our method cannot validate synaptic connectivity, while synaptic structures such as dendritic spines and axon boutons can be clearly visualized. We also understand that some researchers use “connectomics” or “wiring” strictly for synapses, whereas others use them also for mesoscopic and macroscopic levels from an area to another area. In the new experiments for tracing long-range projections, we merely analyzed the branching patterns of individual M/T cells. To avoid unnecessary confusions, we amended the text accordingly. We have changed “connectomics” to “neuronal tracing”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) The notion of wiring diagram and circuits is mistaken when all that is provided is an intracellular labelling of a presynaptic neuronal population. Wiring diagrams imply synapse detection which this method is currently not providing. This has to be made very clear and care should be taken not to confuse the terminology. Still, intense and long-range labelling of a large number of presynaptic neurons can contribute to circuit analysis and in this sense the method could be valuable.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for recognizing utility of our new method. To avoid any possible confusions, we amended the text, as explained above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the manuscript contains many beautiful images, a quantitative documentation of long-range color constancy is missing. In this reviewer's opinion the long-range color constancy is a key prerequisite to use multicolor labelling methods at the light level for circuit inference. While locally the detection of synapses is absolutely required to distinguish an incidental from a synaptic contact, millimeters away from the source neuron, circuit inference can be plausibly done by judging the projection target regions of presynaptic neurons. However, for this the neurons have to stay brightly labelled over millimeters if not centimeters in larger brains. This needs to be documented and quantified for this approach to make a substantial advance.</p><p>3) Related to point 2, it would be necessary to show a clear, at least potential improvement in terms of interpretation of such data. Some proof of concept application would be required – at least a hypothetical one. This does not imply that for a methods manuscript a full result has to be documented but at least the notion of what this kind of result could be and why this method in contrast to previous methods will be able to achieve this. Again, I would suggest using the long-range circuit inference as one of these possible key applications.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have performed analysis of long-range projections focusing on M/T cells, as detailed above. We also evaluated the reliability of manual (visual) neuronal tracing (Figure 1H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary I think this is an interesting methodological advance that however so far lacks clear quantitative documentation of long-range color constancy. The enhancement of color space is impressive but without a clear application difficult to judge in terms of its impact for neuroscience.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the enthusiasm on our manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we added a new analysis of M/T cell projection (Figure 8). The projection patterns of M/T cells from the OB to the olfactory cortex have been a big mystery for many years. While several studies tried axonal tracing from the OB to the olfactory cortex (Nagayama et al., 2010; Sosulski et al., 2011; Ghosh et al., 2011; Igarashi et al., 2012) and partially revealed the logic, single axon tracing has been still laborious. We believe that with our new strategy (a combination of Tetbow labeling and tissue clearing) should open an opportunity for producing and studying a more comprehensive map of long-range axonal projection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] These reagents will be a useful addition to the already available recombinase based or transgenic toolkit for multicolor labeling. However, the authors' major claim that the expression levels of FPs using this approach is much higher, therefore this strategy 'should facilitate neuronal circuit reconstruction at higher densities and resolutions' compared to the current -best of class- Brainbow approaches is not supported by the data presented. Labeling many neurons in a brain and labeling individual neurons bright enough for complete reconstructions is a challenging problem. But it is not clear from the data presented that the approach presented in this manuscript solves this problem.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous manuscript, we compared the brightness and color variability using CAG-XFP and Tetbow constructs. We believe that this is a fair comparison, as we used the same amount of plasmids containing the same fluorescent proteins. We, however, understand that it is also important to perform a side-by-side comparison with the current -best of class- Brainbow constructs for realistic samples. To address this issue, we introduced Brainbow AAV plasmids (Cai et al., 2013) and Tetbow plasmids (this study) into M/T cells using <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation. It should be noted that only EYFP is shared between two methods, and the other fluorescent proteins are different.</p><p>We analyzed three samples each. As for Tetbow, we could clearly visualize M/T cell axons in the olfactory cortex, millimeters away from the OB. However, we could not recognize any axonal signals in our two Brainbow samples, and we could only detect faintly dotted signals for one sample (Figure 2— figure supplement 2). As we could not recognize axons in 2/3 samples, we cannot evaluate fluorescence intensity quantitatively. However, these results clearly demonstrate the improved neuronal tracing ability of Tetbow. Single axon tracing is also shown in Figure 8. Thus, our method solved the problem.</p><p>To demonstrate the power of mulcicolor labeling strategy, we also compared tracing performance for multicolor vs single color (artificially produced from the multicolor data) using densely-labelled challenging sample (Figure 8—figure supplement 1). The result was quite obvious as expected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The conditions for induction of the Tet-Off system need to be described in the Materials and methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>The Tet-Off system does not require DOX administration.

The plasmid amount or virus titer is detailed in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clear from the description why the 0.25µg/µl was chosen for the in utero electroporations. Were multiple concentrations tried? Was the chosen concentration arrived at after examining spread (colors) or by looking at ternary plots as in Figure 2D.</p></disp-quote><p>We examined four different concentrations of the Tetbow plasmids (0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 µg/µL). As for the color discriminability, we introduced a new evaluation metric in the revised manuscript. We examined how likely two randomly chosen cells can be discriminated based on color dissimilarity (Euclidian distance in a color coding space). As the discriminability is determined by the threshold Euclidian distance, we examined discriminability at various threshold levels. To place this in context, the accuracy of human vision was also tested. In manual (human vision) recognition, the threshold level was ~0.1 (Figure 1H). In terms of color discriminability, there was no significant difference among the four conditions (Figure 3A-C). To our surprise, the intensity of fluorescent proteins was highest at 0.25µg/µL, not 0.5. We therefore used 0.25µg/µL for the <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation.</p><p>We further examined why 0.25 was better than 0.5, and found that a lower concentration of tTA is preferred for higher expression levels of TRE-XFPs (Figure 3D-F). It is possible that an excessive amount of tTA interferes with the transcription machinery. Based on this finding, we also omitted the WPRE sequence for tTA plasmids, and it performed better without WPRE.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Image processing and quantification”, subsection “Modeling”, subsection “Imaging data”, include code and data location.</p></disp-quote><p>All of the codes developed in this study will be uploaded to GitHub.

The conclusion is that fluorescence was too weak for neuronal tracing with Brainbow3.0. However, it is true that Brainbow3.0 expresses mOrange2, EGFP, and mKate, none of which is used in Tetbow. To answer this reviewer’s request, we performed new experiments using another set of Brainbow plasmids, which contain EYFP (Cai et al., 2013). This result is now in new Figure 2—figure supplement 2. Again, the fluorescence was too weak for neuronal tracing in this condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] The tools presented in the manuscript may be of interest for the neuroscience community and several convincing images are provided that support their effectiveness. I have however several general concerns about the manuscript:</p><p>First, most of the concepts used in the paper are not new. For instance, multicolor labeling with mixtures of vectors expressing distinct XFPs has been introduced several years ago (Weber et al., 2011), as has been the usage of AAV vectors (Cai et al., 2013) or electroporation (Loulier et al., 2014) to achieve multicolor neuronal labeling, and the modeling of the relation between copy number and color combinations (Kobiler et al., 2010).</p></disp-quote><p>We are fully aware of all of these publications and, of course, have cited them in our initial submission. The major improvement introduced in this study is the enhanced expression with Tet-Off system. Furthermore, the result was qualitatively different. In the published methods, we could not clearly visualize fine axons without antibody staining. Therefore, they were not sufficiently powerful for large-scale analysis. However, with our new Tetbow strategy, we could trace millimeter-long axons after tissue clearing. We thus believe that our method is a major breakthrough toward large-scale neuronal tracing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, beyond the images presented in the article, there is no demonstration of a usage of the Tetbow approach to trace connectivity. An application of these strategies to study some aspects of brain circuitry is essential to evaluate their usefulness. In particular it appears uncertain that labeled neuronal processes can be followed in their entirety in neural tissue samples.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have performed new experiments, which are now in Figure 8. At the very least, Tetbow-labelled axons were found in entire regions of the olfactory cortex (olfactory tubercle, piriform cortex, cortical amygdala, and lateral entorhinal cortex).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, due to incomplete description or inappropriate evaluation procedures, the actual improvement brought by Tetbow appears uncertain. For instance, it is unclear if the number of samples analyzed in Figure 1 is sufficient to minimize discrepancies among the different brains analyzed, and between different sections of a given brain.</p></disp-quote><p>The old Figure 1 only contains simulation results. If this reviewer meant Figure 2, we analyzed three brains each. In our new Figure 3F, we indicate three different brain samples separately in circles. There was no discrepancy among samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also claim that their scheme is simpler that Brainbow, but in practice this is hardly the case: with Tetbow, a total of 4 plasmids or AAV vectors must be introduced in neurons of interest, while with Brainbow two plasmids (Brainbow et al., 2014) or 2 AAVs (AAV no. 1 and no. 2, Cai et al., 2013) are sufficient. In addition, with Tetbow, careful titration of the different color vectors needs to be performed for each fresh vector preparation, while expression of different XFPs is intrinsically balanced in Brainbow transgenes, making them inherently more reproducible.</p></disp-quote><p>We examined whether careful titration of the different color vectors are critical in our method. Both in simulation based on Poisson distribution (Figure 1G) and actual experiments (Figure 3 for plasmids; Figure 7 for AAVs); a 3-5-fold difference did not produce a big difference. These new sets of experiments demonstrate that Tetbow is highly reproducible, irrespective of small changes in plasmid amount or virus titers.</p><p>Of course, when the copy number is too high, the color variation will decrease, but this is also the case for Brainbow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concerning the strategy based on protein tags (Figure 5), one cannot assess how deep synthetic fluorochromes labels diffuse within tissue sections: does this scheme really enable to label more than just the first few 10th of micrometers of tissue samples?</p></disp-quote><p>Compared to antibodies, which are really huge, the molecular weights of chemical tag substrates are very small. To demonstrate efficient penetration or chemical tags, we stained 1mm-thick brain slices expressing chemical tags in layer 2/3 neurons. After staining with fluorescent substrates, the entire thickness was clearly visualized with fluorescent labels (Figure 6—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, are Tetbow protein tags (Figure 5) and AAVs (Figure 6) more efficient in terms of expression level and color contrast than standard vectors? It seems that most cells in Figure 5 and Figure 6 coexpress all three XFPs and that the color contrast in these samples is low.</p></disp-quote><p>In terms of color variation and consistency, they are basically the same. In the chemical tag strategy, one protein tag reacts with just one substrate molecule. Thus, the brightness does not improve a lot, compared to the fluorescent proteins. More spectral variation is one advantage, as is already mentioned in the Discussion section. AAV can indeed enhance the expression level when compared to plasmids. This point is now mentioned in the Results section.</p><p>As the expression levels of XFPs are extremely high with the AAV Tetbow, XFPs start to aggregate and neurons start to die several weeks after virus injection. We sacrificed animals 2-4 weeks after injection, before these morphological damages emerge. This point is also clarified in the text.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>While the reviewers were very positive about the extensive revision, they concluded after extended discussion that they would strongly recommend to address the following remaining issues.

We could find labeled axons in all the areas of the olfactory cortices we examined, including the olfactory tubercle, piriform cortex, cortical amygdala, and lateral entorhinal cortex (now in Discussion section). We could also find several axon collaterals in each mitral cell, which was comparable to these earlier studies.
