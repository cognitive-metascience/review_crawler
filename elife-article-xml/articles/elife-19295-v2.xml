In the auditory system, inhibition already modulates second order neurons in the cochlear nucleus, e.g. spherical bushy cells (SBCs). While the physiological basis of inhibition and excitation is well described, their functional interaction in signal processing remains elusive. Using a combination of in vivo loose-patch recordings, iontophoretic drug application, and detailed signal analysis in the Mongolian Gerbil, we demonstrate that inhibition is widely co-tuned with excitation, and leads only to minor sharpening of the spectral response properties. Combinations of complex stimuli and neuronal input-output analysis based on spectrotemporal receptive fields revealed inhibition to render the neuronal output temporally sparser and more reproducible than the input. Overall, inhibition plays a central role in improving the temporal response fidelity of SBCs across a wide range of input intensities and thereby provides the basis for high-fidelity signal processing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19295.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19295.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19295.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In humans and other animals, small differences in the time at which a sound arrives at each ear are crucial for determining the location of the sound. Neurons in the first processing station of the brain – the cochlear nucleus – receive information about sounds (or “inputs”) from the ears. They then produce electrical signals that relay this information to other areas of the brain. Some of these inputs increase the activity of the neurons and so are known as “excitatory” inputs, while other “inhibitory” inputs decrease the activity of the neurons. The balance between these two inputs determines what information is passed to other parts of the brain, but it is not clear how these inputs interact.</p><p>Keine, Rübsamen and Englitz studied electrical activity in the brains of Mongolian gerbils while being exposed to sounds with more natural properties than previously studied. The experiments reveal that inhibitory inputs play an important role in controlling the activity of neurons in the cochlear nucleus. By decreasing the neurons’ activity, inhibitory inputs allow these cells to respond to many different levels of sound, from very loud to very quiet. The experiments also show that excitatory and inhibitory inputs are triggered by similar sounds so that the two processes quickly balance each other. This means that the brain is equally able to work out where a sound is coming from regardless of whether it is loud or quiet.</p><p>Further work is now needed to understand responses to natural sounds and to determine how experimentally removing the inhibitory inputs affects hearing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19295.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19295.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>inhibition</kwd><kwd>spherical bushy cell</kwd><kwd>cochlear nucleus</kwd><kwd>Mongolian gerbil</kwd><kwd>sound localization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK 1097</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keine</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RU 390/19-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rübsamen</surname><given-names>Rudolf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RU 390/20-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rübsamen</surname><given-names>Rudolf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Sklodowska Curie Fellowship 660328</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Englitz</surname><given-names>Bernhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibition in the brainstem has further roles beyond temporal sharpening and improves reproduction for a multitude of sounds.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dynamic processing in neural networks is controlled by an interplay of excitation and inhibition. In cortical processing, the dominant excitatory neurons interact reciprocally with inhibitory neurons, which serve key functions in shaping the responses (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>). In the auditory cortex, recent work has emphasized the role of inhibition in dynamically balancing excitation via a high degree of co-tuning (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wehr and Zador, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Renart et al., 2010</xref>) that serves to shape and accelerate network dynamics. Similarly, in other modalities, inhibition was found to be co-tuned with excitation in the cortex, typically with a wider tuning, generating the well-described inhibitory sidebands (auditory: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Wu et al., 2008</xref>, visual: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Sohya et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Niell and Stryker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Liu et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Katzner et al., 2011</xref>, olfactory: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</xref>). Temporally, inhibition often follows excitation closely (auditory: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wehr and Zador, 2003</xref>, somatosensory: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Wilent and Contreras, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In the auditory brainstem, the role of inhibition has also been studied, however, from a more fundamental perspective, without a focus on its functional role during complex stimulation. Various studies have shown prominent inhibitory influences on signal processing in the cochlear nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Caspary et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gai and Carney, 2008</xref>), in the medial and lateral superior olive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Grothe and Sanes, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Myoga et al., 2014</xref>), and in the dorsal and ventral nuclei of the lateral lemniscus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Yang and Pollak, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Burger and Pollak, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Nayagam et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Pecka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Spencer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The cochlear nucleus (CN), the first stage of the central auditory system, is the starting point of distinct neuronal circuits involved in sound source localization. Spherical bushy cells (SBC) in the anteroventral division of the CN (AVCN) provide the temporally precise excitatory inputs to binaural neurons in the medial superior olive (MSO), where interaural time differences are computed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Yin and Chan, 1990</xref>). These SBCs receive suprathreshold excitatory input from auditory nerve fibers (ANF) via large axosomatic terminals, the endbulbs of Held (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brawer and Morest, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schwartz and Gulley, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ryugo and Sento, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Nicol and Walmsley, 2002</xref>). In addition, inhibitory inputs on SBCs have been reported, which provide surprisingly slow acoustically evoked inhibition mediated by glycine and GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Wu and Oertel, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kolston et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Juiz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mahendrasingam et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Xie and Manis, 2013</xref>), with glycine dominating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Nerlich et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>Due to the requirements of high-fidelity acoustic processing underlying sound localization, many studies focused on the fast and temporally precise signal transmission in auditory brainstem circuits. With respect to changes in temporal precision from ANF to neurons in the CN some studies – comparing population data – reported a general increase in temporal precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Joris et al., 1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">1994b</xref>), while others found no change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bourk, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blackburn and Sachs, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Winter and Palmer, 1990</xref>), or reported decreased temporal precision at certain stimulation frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Paolini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Fukui et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>More recent studies advanced the analysis to the single-cell level, by comparing the endbulb of Held evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) with the action potentials (AP) of the SBCs allowing for a direct comparison of ANF input and SBC output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Typlt et al., 2010</xref>). This enabled a direct assessment of the input-output function under the condition of acoustic stimulation, also in combination with pharmacological manipulations. The respective experiments revealed a slight increase in temporal precision of signal coding, attributed to the influence of acoustically evoked inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dehmel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuenzel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Keine and Rübsamen, 2015</xref>). It may be argued that the stimulus conditions employed were rather static and did not adequately reflect the challenge of processing the dynamics of spectrotemporal complex acoustic signals. While fast inhibition in T stellate cells has been attributed to a role in comodulation masking release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Pressnitzer et al., 2001</xref>), the inhibitory dynamics in SBCs seem to be too slow for such an effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Xie and Manis, 2013</xref>). Previous studies investigated inhibition using pure tone stimulation, and this is why the functional role of inhibition in signal processing at the ANF-SBC synapse during complex acoustic stimulation has not been fully resolved.</p><p>In the present study, we set out to elucidate the functional role of acoustically evoked inhibition at the ANF-SBC synapse using combined in vivo loose-patch recordings with direct iontophoretic manipulation of inhibitory receptors and a detailed input-output signal analysis based on spectrotemporal receptive fields in responses to complex acoustic stimulation. Our results indicate a reliable co-tuning of inhibition with the main excitatory input. While we observed some sharpening of the response in time and frequency, our results suggest that inhibition functions as a gain control that renders the postsynaptic response sparser in time and more reproducible across trials. Temporal sparsity, i.e. a response restricted to fewer time-points, can increase the information per spike while reducing the energy expenditure. Reproducibility, i.e. a more consistent response to identical stimuli, can provide reliable stimulus encoding.</p><p>These improvements are a consequence of the combined subtractive/divisive action of glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuenzel et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">2015</xref>): The subtractive component enhances the temporal sparsity by raising the threshold for spiking. The divisive component acts primarily as a gain control, which - in conjunction with the co-tuning - maintains the SBC output rate in a smaller range across different stimulus levels. Together these two effects focus the SBC output onto well-timed stimulus events across a wide range of stimulus levels. Thus, inhibition improves the basis for the high-fidelity signal processing in downstream nuclei crucial for sound localization irrespective of the prevailing stimulus levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The interaction between acoustically evoked excitation and inhibition is a key constituent at the initial stages of signal processing in the auditory brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dehmel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuenzel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Keine and Rübsamen, 2015</xref>). This study aimed for an investigation of sound-evoked inhibition on the processing of complex structured signals (mimicking broadband acoustic conditions) at the auditory nerve-to-spherical bushy cell synapse (ANF-SBC). A total of 85 units were recorded from the rostral pole of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN), the location of large, low-frequency coding SBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bazwinsky et al., 2008</xref>). The identification of SBCs was based on the following physiological properties: a discernible prepotential in addition to the complex waveform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Pfeiffer, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Englitz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Typlt et al., 2010</xref>), short AP duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Typlt et al., 2012</xref>), high spontaneous firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Smith et al., 1993</xref>), and the primary like response pattern to pure-tone stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blackburn and Sachs, 1989</xref>). From these 85 cells, 23 were recorded while simultaneously applying glycine receptor agonists and antagonists. Units had a characteristic frequency (CF) of (mean ± standard deviation) 2.1 ± 0.6 kHz and a minimal threshold of (median [first quartile, third quartile]) 7.5 [0.8, 14.9] dB SPL.</p><p>To understand how acoustically evoked inhibition shapes SBC output, the present report focuses on the differential analysis between SBC EPSPs that trigger a postsynaptic AP, i.e. EPSP<sub>succ</sub> and EPSPs that fail to trigger an AP, i.e. EPSP<sub>fail</sub>. Previous studies showed that during spontaneous activity, EPSP amplitudes are close to threshold, such that not all ANF input spikes trigger an SBC output spike. Also, acoustically evoked inhibition interacts dynamically with the EPSPs and prevents output spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuenzel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Keine and Rübsamen, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The respective differences between ANF input and SBC output can be analyzed from the complex waveform of SBC signals consisting of the presynaptic action potential (prepotential, PP) and the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) which may or may not be followed by an AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The fast EPSP rising slope served for the detection of both types of signals, while the dynamics of the signals’ falling slopes reliably allowed to distinguish between the two: (i) EPSP<sub>succ</sub>, i.e. EPSPs that successfully trigger postsynaptic APs, and (ii) EPSP<sub>fail</sub>, i.e. EPSPs that fail to trigger APs. The maximum falling slope was consistently higher in EPSP<sub>succ</sub> than in EPSP<sub>fail </sub>(EPSP<sub>succ</sub> = 21.1 ± 4.9 vs. EPSP<sub>fail</sub> = 4.4 ± 1.2 V/s, difference [Δ] = 16.8 ± 4.3 V/s, p&lt;0.001, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, n = 62, U1 = 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> left, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The sum of EPSP<sub>fail</sub> and EPSP<sub>succ</sub> was defined as the ANF input to the SBC, while the subset of EPSP<sub>succ</sub> indicated the output ascending to the next level of processing, i.e. the superior olivary complex.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19295.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Separation and attribution of pre- and postsynaptic neuronal response components.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <bold>Left</bold>: Representative trace of an in-vivo loose-patch recording of a spherical bushy cell (SBC) showing both EPSPs followed by an action potential (arrows, blue dots) and EPSPs which fail to trigger an AP (arrowheads, gray dots). <bold>Right</bold>: Superimposing the events (50 events of each type) shows that both signal types share the presence of a prepotential (PP) and an EPSP, but may (EPSP<sub>succ</sub>) or may not (EPSP<sub>fail</sub>) trigger a postsynaptic AP.

Acoustic stimulation at the unit’s CF at 50 dB SPL, i.e. within the excitatory response area, increased the failure fraction to 0.49 [0.41, 0.59] rendering the ANF-SBC synapse less reliable during acoustic stimulation (Δ = 0.18 ± 0.29, p&lt;0.001, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, n = 62, U1 = 0.2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synaptic depression alone fails to account for increased failure rates</title><p>The increased incidence of failures during acoustic stimulation has been attributed to the activation of inhibitory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuenzel et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Keine and Rübsamen, 2015</xref>). However, also in vitro experiments need to be considered, which showed strong depression at the ANF-SBC synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wang and Manis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Yang and Xu-Friedman, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) affecting SBC responsiveness for up to tens of milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Yang and Xu-Friedman, 2015</xref>). Such depression might also suppress SBC spiking in vivo and result in an increased failure fraction during acoustic stimulation. Still, in vivo the impact of depression was shown to be smaller, since ongoing spontaneous activity – completely absent in slice recordings – seems to keep the synapse in a chronically depressed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hermann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lorteije et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Yang and Xu-Friedman, 2015</xref>). Also, the in vivo calcium concentration was reported to be lower than in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid usually used in slice studies resulting in lower vesicle release probabilities and thus smaller depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Borst, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuenzel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Friauf et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To determine the cause of altered reliability of synaptic transmission at the ANF-SBC synapse, and to dissect the effect of acoustically evoked inhibition from synaptic depression, we first quantified the dependence of the EPSP rising slope on the preceding spontaneous activity. As indicated above, the rising slopes of EPSP<sub>fail</sub> and EPSP<sub>succ</sub> differ, but still show a considerable range of overlap. For each unit, the EPSP rising slopes were pooled for EPSP<sub>succ </sub>and EPSP<sub>fail</sub> and binned. Then, the fraction of EPSP<sub>succ</sub> was calculated for each bin, and a Boltzmann function was fitted to the EPSP<sub>succ</sub> probability distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> left). The symmetric inflection point of this function indicates the threshold EPSP, i.e. the EPSP slope necessary to trigger an AP with &gt;50% probability. EPSP rising slopes showed strong depression for inter-event intervals (IEI) &lt; 2 ms resulting in high AP failure rates. But, already for IEIs &gt; 5 ms, the preceding activity had only a minor influence on EPSP rising slopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, middle). Averaging the normalized EPSP slopes across cells showed a facilitating effect for IEI between 2 ms and 20 ms (green markers, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> right). The threshold EPSP was increased for IEIs &lt; 2 ms, but not for longer IEIs (black line) and the increase in threshold EPSP resulted in an increased failure fraction for IEIs &lt; 2 ms (orange histogram). While IEIs up to 20 ms resulted in increased EPSP slopes, the effect of IEIs on threshold EPSP and failure fraction was limited to short IEIs &lt; 2 ms. These data are consistent with previous studies, suggesting the presence of short-term facilitation rather than depression of synaptic events. Considering only the last preceding IEI, however, disregards the potential impact of previous medium- and short-term afferent activity. Also, in vitro studies yielded the influence of short-term depression at the ANF-SBC synapse to extend well beyond the last IEI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Yang and Xu-Friedman, 2015</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19295.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Preceding activity has only a minor, facilitating influence on EPSP rising slopes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <bold>Left</bold>: Estimation of threshold EPSP for a representative cell: The EPSP rising slopes were binned (0.5 V/s bin size) and the proportion of EPSP<sub>succ</sub> calculated for each bin.

The specific glycine receptor antagonist strychnine was iontophoretically applied to block the acoustically evoked glycinergic inhibition. The effectiveness of the glycine block was tested before sound stimulation by simultaneously applying glycine and strychnine, with the application current for strychnine adjusted to block the effect of iontophoretically applied glycine. The ANF input firing rates were not influenced by the block of inhibition (control = 282 ± 48 Hz vs. strychnine = 283 ± 50 Hz, Δ = 1.2 ± 26.7 Hz, p=0.88, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, n = 11, U1 = 0.18, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The SBC output rates in the excitatory field, however, were substantially increased under glycine block (control = 122 ± 49 Hz vs. strychnine = 192 ± 39 Hz, Δ = 70 ± 47.9 Hz, p&lt;0.001, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, n = 11, U1 = 0.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We next tested if the block of glycinergic inhibition differentially affects the threshold EPSP during spontaneous activity and during acoustic stimulation. When glycinergic inhibition was blocked, the threshold EPSP was only affected during acoustic stimulation, but not during spontaneous activity (interaction drug × stimulus condition, p&lt;0.01, η² = 0.13, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, n = 11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Acoustic stimulation at CF under control condition resulted in a significant threshold EPSP elevation (threshold EPSP spont = 5.4 ± 1.6 V/s vs. stim = 8.8 ± 3.1 V/s, Δ = 3.5 ± 2.9 V/s, p&lt;0.01, two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni-adjusted, n = 11, U1 = 0.41) and this shift was absent when the inhibition was blocked (threshold EPSP spont = 5.9 ± 2 V/s vs. stim = 5.8 ± 1.8 V/s, Δ = 0.1 ± 1.3 V/s, p=0.82, two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni-adjusted, n = 11, U1 = 0.09, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The effects observed under acoustic stimulation were very different from the respective manipulations performed during spontaneous activity. In the absence of acoustic stimulation, the block of glycinergic inhibition had no effect on output rates (control = 51 ± 26 Hz vs. strychnine = 49 ± 20 Hz, Δ = 1.6 ± 18.5 Hz, p=0.79, two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni-adjusted, n = 11, U1 = 0.14, data not shown), and threshold EPSP (control = 5.5 ± 2.5 V/s vs strychnine = 5.6 ± 2.6 V/s, Δ = 0.03 ± 0.16 V/s, p=0.53, two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni-adjusted, n = 11, U1 = 0.09, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Eii</xref>). Similar to acoustic stimulation, the input rates were not altered during inhibition block (control = 85 ± 26 Hz vs. strychnine = 86 ± 22 Hz, Δ = 0.4 ± 16.6 Hz, p=0.94, two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni-adjusted, n = 11, U1 = 0.09, data not shown).</p><p>These data suggest a major role of glycinergic inhibition in acoustically evoked signal processing, but a negligible impact during spontaneous activity.

Previous studies directly comparing the ANF input and SBC output showed an increase in temporal precision which has been attributed to the impact of inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dehmel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuenzel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Keine and Rübsamen, 2015</xref>). These studies focused on the responses to static pure-tone stimulation leaving the question for a potential influence of acoustically evoked inhibition on signal transmission in a more complex, i.e. a more naturalistic acoustic environment unaddressed.</p><p>Considering this issue, we first tested the responses of SBCs to sinusoidal amplitude-modulated (SAM) and frequency-modulated (SFM) acoustic stimuli. SAM stimuli were presented at the respective units’ CF 30 dB above the excitatory threshold with modulation frequencies between 50 Hz and 400 Hz (modulation depth = 100%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The discharge activity of the units showed different degrees of modulation congruent with the SAM for both the ANF input and the SBC output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). The AP failure fraction increased from 0.27 ± 0.22 in the absence of acoustic stimulation to 0.43 ± 0.18 during SAM stimulation (Δ = 0.16 ± 0.18, p&lt;0.01, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, n = 14, η² = 0.11, data not shown) and was independent of modulation frequency (factor frequency: p=0.19, η² &lt; 0.01; interaction stimulus type × frequency: p=0.27, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, η² &lt; 0.01, n = 14). The temporal precision of ANF input and SBC output to SAM stimulation was estimated by calculating the vector strength (VS) at different modulation frequencies. The SBC output exhibited consistently higher VS compared to its ANF input (Δ = 0.06 ± 0.04, p&lt;0.001, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, n = 14, η² = 0.09, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>), and decreased for modulation frequencies above 200 Hz (factor frequency: p&lt;0.001, η² = 0.09; interaction signal type × frequency: p&lt;0.05, η² &lt; 0.01, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, n = 14). To estimate the degree of modulation of the neural response, the modulation depth was estimated by calculating the standard deviation of the first cycle of the normalized cross-correlation function. Modulation depth was considerably higher at the SBC output (Δ = 0.04 ± 0.04, p&lt;0.001, η² = 0.09) and decreased with modulation frequency (factor frequency: p&lt;0.001, η² = 0.08; interaction signal type × frequency: p=0.12, η² &lt; 0.01, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, n = 14).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19295.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Tone bursts with sinusoidal amplitude modulations (SAM) of different modulation frequencies were used to investigate the input-output function under the condition of dynamically altered amplitude profiles.</title><p>Overall, SAM testing revealed higher temporal precision and reproducibility from ANF input to SBC output. (<bold>A</bold>) The upper panel (black) shows the stimulus and the lower panel the dot-raster plot of the discharges of a representative SBC to 200 stimulus presentations with a differentiation between EPSP<sub>succ</sub> (blue) and EPSP<sub>fail</sub> (gray).

This trial-to-trial variability was quantified by calculating the within-cell, across-trial crosscorrelations separately for the ANF input and SBC output. The peak height of the crosscorrelation was termed reproducibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Joris et al., 2006</xref>). It provides a measure of how repeatable the neural response is across trials, given identical stimulus presentations. If the reproducible features of the response encode stimulus properties, e.g. certain salient events, then an increased reproducibility corresponds to more trustable encoding of stimulus information across trials.</p><p>The analysis revealed higher reproducibility in the SBC output compared to the ANF input (Δ = 0.4 ± 0.25, p&lt;0.001, η² = 0.09) and also showed a systematic decrease with increasing modulation frequency (factor frequency: p&lt;0.001, η² = 0.04; interaction signal type × frequency: p&lt;0.01, η² &lt; 0.01, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, n = 14). To obtain a better understanding of how precisely the neuronal response reproduces the stimulus envelopes, the delay-adjusted period histograms were correlated to the stimulus envelope resulting in a Corr<sub>Norm</sub> between 0.82 and 1 (see Materials and methods for explanation). The analysis revealed higher Corr<sub>Norm</sub> for the SBC output compared to the ANF input (Δ = 0.01 ± 0.01, p&lt;0.05, η² = 0.02), which for both signal types increased with modulation frequency (factor frequency: p&lt;0.05, η² = 0.08; interaction signal type × frequency: p=0.19, η² &lt; 0.01, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, n = 14). These analyses show that the increase in temporal precision observed during pure-tone stimulation is maintained during amplitude-modulated sounds across a wide range of modulation frequencies.</p><p>In a next step, the modulation of unit discharges to periodic frequency modulations (SFM) was explored. For that purpose, the stimulus intensity was fixed at 30–40 dB above the unit’s threshold and the stimulus frequency modulated between one octave below and two octaves above the unit’s CF. This frequency range covers the whole excitatory area as well as the inhibitory sideband. Similar to the SAM stimulation, the SFM resulted in prominent modulations of the units’ firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and increased failure fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) (spont = 0.34 ± 0.25 vs. stim = 0.6 ± 0.13, Δ = 0.26 0.23, p&lt;0.001, η² = 0.29, data not shown). In contrast to SAM stimulation, SFM led to increased failure rates at higher modulation frequencies (e.g. 0.52 ± 0.13 at 20 Hz vs. 0.65 ± 0.12 at 400 Hz modulation frequency, p&lt;0.001, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, η² = 0.02, n = 19, data not shown). For SFM stimulation – same as for SAM - the SBC output showed higher VS compared to their ANF input (Δ = 0.14 ± 0.09, p&lt;0.001, η² = 0.21, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> left) (factor frequency: p&lt;0.001, η² = 0.48; interaction signal type × frequency: p&lt;0.001, η² = 0.03, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, n = 19). Still, overall the VS of ANF input and SBC output decreased with increasing modulation frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> left). Notably, the VS of the SBC output deteriorated to a lesser degree than the ANF input. At modulation frequencies of 20 Hz, the output VS was not significantly different between ANF input and SBC output (ANF input = 0.61 ± 0.06 vs. SBC output = 0.63 ± 0.1, Δ = 0.04 ± 0.07, p=0.17, two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni-adjusted, n = 19, U1 = 0.16). For modulation frequencies of 400 Hz, however, the VS of the SBC output was considerably higher than the ANF input (ANF input = 0.25 ± 0.08 vs. SBC output 0.4 ± 0.09, Δ = 0.15 ± 0.06, p&lt;0.001, two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni-adjusted, n = 19, U1 = 0.5). It has to be considered that the interpretation of VS values is difficult when the period histogram of the neuronal response shows multiple peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We, therefore, used a set of additional measures to describe the neuronal response to SFM stimuli when comparing ANF input and SBC output. The modulation depth was considerably higher for the SBC output than the ANF input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> midleft; Δ = 0.24 ± 0.16, p&lt;0.001, η² = 0.28) and strongly depended on the modulation frequency (factor frequency: p&lt;0.001, η² = 0.37; interaction signal type × frequency: p&lt;0.001, η² = 0.03, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, n = 19). The same holds for signal reproducibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> midright; Δ = 1.9 ± 1.2, p&lt;0.001, η² = 0.38) which also showed prominent frequency dependency (factor frequency: p&lt;0.001, η² = 0.26; interaction signal type × frequency: p&lt;0.001, η² = 0.02, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, n = 19). Unlike the previous measures, the normalized correlation between SFM stimulus envelope and neural response revealed a lower reproducibility for the SBC output compared to the ANF input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> right; Δ = 0.02 ± 0.03, p&lt;0.001, η² = 0.06), and the difference also holds with respect to the effect of modulation frequency (factor frequency: p&lt;0.001, η² = 0.43; interaction signal type × frequency: p&lt;0.001, η² = 0.03, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, n = 19). Overall, these data suggest that – same as for the SAM stimuli – the SBC output shows temporally increased precision and higher response reproducibility during SFM stimulation.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19295.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Tone bursts with sinusoidal frequency modulations (SFM) of different modulation frequencies were used to investigate the input-output function under the condition of dynamically altered frequency profiles.</title><p>Overall, SFM testing revealed improved temporal precision and across-trial reproducibility across the ANF-SBC synapse. (<bold>A</bold>) The upper panel (black) shows the SFM stimulus with a detail enlargement visualizing the dynamic frequency modulation.

In natural environments, however, the auditory system has to cope with simultaneous dynamic changes in both frequency and amplitude embedded in ambient background noise. To mimic such conditions, while preserving the possibility for a quantifying data analysis, dynamic acoustic stimuli composed of gamma-tones randomly placed in the spectrogram were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> top, randomized gamma-tone sequence, RGS, see Materials and methods for details). The SBC activity can then be characterized using spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs).

As expected, both STRFs showed common features, e.g. frequency domain of excitation above and below the unit’s CF (in the present example 2 kHz, estimated from single tone tunings) and also the response latency (here 2.5 ms). Importantly, the reduction in the responses establishing a high-frequency sideband was already present in the ANF input to the SBCs and did not become more pronounced in SBC output. Since the ANF activity is not affected by acoustically evoked inhibition, the respective frequency-specific reduction observed in the ANF input to the SBCs likely reflects mechanical interactions in the cochlea, previously described as two-tone suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Engebretson and Eldredge, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sachs and Kiang, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Sellick and Russell, 1979</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the signal processing at the ANF-SBC junction, the two STRFs were subtracted from each other after normalizing each by its standard deviation (to compensate for overall firing rate differences, see Materials and methods for details; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> bottom). This normalization allows a quantification of changes in the tuning shape. The increase in EPSP<sub>fail</sub> in the STRF of the SBC output manifests itself as a broad field of negativity in the difference-STRF around CF extending up to ~10 ms after the onset of the effective signal components around 2 kHz. The respective differences between ANF input and SBC output were quantified in all recorded SBCs (n = 34) separately for the positive (red) and negative (blue) regions in the STRF (corresponding to influential spectrotemporal locations in the stimulus prior to the response). Summing all the positive regions revealed a significant reduction from ANFs to SBCs (ANF = 0.38 [0.37, 0.41] vs. SBC = 0.33 [0.31, 0.36], Δ = 0.05 [0.03, 0.07], p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test, n = 34, U1 = 0.16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). Similarly, the summed negative region in the SBC output was significantly larger in magnitude than the ANF input (ANF = 0.18 [0.15, 0.23] vs. SBC = 0.25 [0.18, 0.29], Δ = 0.04 [0.02, 0.07], p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test, n = 34, U1 = 0.1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Together, this suggests an inhibitory influence acting broadly with respect to the neuron’s tuning.</p><p>We further quantified changes in the shape of the main excitatory peak. The spectral tuning, measured as half-width of the excitatory region, was reduced at the SBC output compared to ANF input, suggesting a spectrally sharper tuning at the SBC output (ANF = 1.2 [0.9, 1.4] octaves vs. SBC = 1 [0.8, 1.2] octaves, Δ = 0.1 [0, 0.2], p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test, n = 34, U1 = 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Temporal precision, measured correspondingly as the half-width of the excitatory region, was somewhat higher for the SBC output, but did not reach statistical significance (ANF = 2.2 [1.8, 3.4] ms vs. SBC = 2.0 [1.8, 3.1] ms, Δ = 0.08 [-0.1, 0.18], p=0.16, Wilcoxon signed rank test, n = 34, U1 = 0.03, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>The overall shape of the difference-STRF of all units was studied by aligning all STRFs to the peak excitation and averaging them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).

At a false discovery rate of 0.01, the gray line shows the region of significant deviation.</p><p>Overall, the STRF analysis confirmed the presence of inhibition co-tuned with excitation, exhibiting a longer-lasting time-course of about 10 ms with respect to the onset of the excitatory signal component. Consequently, also under dynamic broadband stimulation, inhibition is confirmed to only marginally act above or below the neuron’s excitatory receptive field and results in only a slight spectral sharpening of the SBC output. Next, we addressed the functional consequences of this co-tuned, prolonged inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Glycinergic inhibition renders SBC responses sparser, more reliable and temporally more precise</title><p>The functional consequences of co-tuned inhibition appear less evident than those of narrow, sideband inhibition. The latter can diversely shape the response properties, by reducing responses only for small, off-CF regions. Co-tuned inhibition, on the other hand, has been proposed to contribute to a precisely timed balancing of excitation to keep neurons within their dynamic ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Renart et al., 2010</xref>). To test for such a mechanism, we quantified properties of the SBC output in comparison to the ANF input with respect to the temporal sparsity of the response and reproducibility across trials. Efficient neural codes have been proposed to show high sparsity, i.e. respond only rarely but then with high firing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Field, 1994</xref>). Again, the RGS stimulus was used to test the effect of acoustically evoked inhibition under complex acoustic conditions.

For this analysis, the obtained correlograms were divided by the product of the individual firing rates, rendering the results independent of absolute firing rates. Reproducibility was then calculated as the peak of the correlograms measured at 0 ms lag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Bi</xref>). In 97% (33/34) of all recorded cells, the SBC output exhibited a higher level of reproducibility (units above line of equality, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Bii</xref>). Also, the population analysis yielded a significantly higher reproducibility of the SBC output than the ANF input (ANF = 0.46 [0.37, 0.65] vs. SBC = 0.83 [0.48, 1.3], Δ = 0.35 [0.12, 0.73], p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test, n = 34, U1 = 0.18, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Biii</xref>).</p><p>To estimate the temporal precision across trials, the temporal dispersion was quantified as the half-width of the across-trial cross-correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Ci</xref>). Temporal precision across trials improved from ANF input to SBC output in two-thirds of the recorded SBCs (24/34, units below line of equality, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Cii</xref>). Still, population analysis yielded a significant improvement in temporal precision (temporal dispersion: ANF = 7.04 [5.25, 7.93] ms vs SBC = 4.96 [3.47, 6.9] ms, Δ = 1.1 [0, 1.98] ms, p&lt;0.01, Wilcoxon signed rank test, n = 34, U1 = 0.03, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8iii</xref>). Response reproducibility across trials renders the response more identifiable for downstream processing stages which rely on precisely timed inputs. The increased sparsity reduces the energy expense by removing spikes which reflect the constant part of the response. Temporal precision of encoding also improved, although this was only observed in about 70% of the cells.</p><p>Finally, we directly tested whether the observed changes in response properties were indeed caused by acoustically evoked, glycinergic inhibition. Another set of 12 units were recorded under RGS stimulation, and glycinergic inhibition was blocked by iontophoretic application of strychnine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Aiv, Biv, Civ</xref>). Like in the experiments reported above, the analysis differentiated between the ANF input to SBCs and the respective SBC output. Under control conditions, cells showed the above-described increase in sparsity and reproducibility at the ANF-to-SBC transition. Blocking the glycinergic inhibition resulted in decreased sparsity of the SBC output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Aiv</xref>; control = 0.34 ± 0.1 vs. strychnine = 0.27 ± 0.07, Δ = 0.07 ± 0.06, p&lt;0.01, two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni–adjusted, n = 12, U1 = 0.33). Also, the block of inhibition caused a decrease in response reproducibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Biv</xref>; control = 0.79 ± 0.39 vs. strychnine = 0.53 ± 0.19, Δ = 0.26 ± 0.23, p&lt;0.05, two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni-adjusted, n = 12, U1 = 0.21) and an increase in temporal dispersion at the SBC output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Civ</xref>; control = 5.6 ± 1.6 ms vs. strychnine = 7.5 ± 1.7 ms, Δ = 1.9 ± 1.6 ms, p&lt;0.01, two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni-adjusted, n = 12, U1 = 0.21). In summary, the block of inhibition reduced the observed improvements from the ANF input to the SBC output, rendering both more similar. Importantly, the ANF input was not affected by the block of inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Aiv, Biv, Civ</xref>) (sparsity: control = 0.18 ± 0.05 vs. strychnine = 0.18 ± 0.05, Δ = 0 ± 0.01, p=0.5, U1 = 0.13; reproducibility: control = 0.32 ± 0.11 vs. strychnine = 0.32 ± 0.1, Δ = 0 ± 0.03, p=0.8, U1 = 0.08; temporal dispersion: control = 8.5 ± 0.9 ms vs strychnine = 8.5 ± 1 ms, Δ = 0 ± 0.6 ms, p=0.99, U1 = 0.08, n = 12, two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni-adjusted). In comparison with the pre-post data, the pharmacological dataset shows smaller variability across cells, which may be due to the lack of outliers in the latter, smaller dataset. In summary, these data directly show that glycinergic inhibition is a critical factor for the observed improvements from ANF input to the SBC output during complex acoustic stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Subtractive inhibition suffices to explain the improvement in sparsity, reproducibility, and temporal precision</title><p>SBCs have been shown to be influenced by both hyperpolarizing and shunting effects of inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuenzel et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Nerlich et al., 2014a</xref>). While hyperpolarization has been attributed to a subtractive effect on firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Doiron et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Silver, 2010</xref>), shunting inhibition has mainly divisive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Mitchell and Silver, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Prescott and De Koninck, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Capaday and van Vreeswijk, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ly and Doiron, 2009</xref>). We investigated the functional effect of either type on the response via a simple simulation: either a fixed fraction (divisive, relative to the instantaneous firing rate) or a fixed number (subtractive) of spikes was removed from the ANF spike trains, matching the experimentally observed SBC output rates. Purely divisive inhibition, corresponding to a scaling of the PSTH, does not improve sparsity, reproducibility or temporal precision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, purple, Δsparsity = 0 ± 0, p=0.99, Δreproducibility = 0.01 ± 0.02, p=0.25, Δtemporal dispersion = 0.05 ± 0.41, p=0.89, n = 34, one-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni-adjusted, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>).

As a consequence, many temporal measures improve such as vector strength and across-trial temporal precision. We find inhibition to act largely co-tuned with excitation, although its latency and duration exceed the excitatory input, similar to the respective relationship found in the cortex. Therefore, we propose glycinergic inhibition to take a functional role as a gain control and a signal quality enhancer, which optimizes the SBC output for the subsequent high-fidelity integration for sound localization in the MSO and LSO (see below).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Signal analysis and iontophoretic modulation confirm local inhibitory influence</title><p>The endbulb synapse depresses considerably during high-frequency firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bellingham and Walmsley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wang and Manis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Yang and Xu-Friedman, 2008</xref>) despite the large size of the presynaptic synaptic terminal and the reliable, suprathreshold excitation observed in slice recordings. The present in vivo recordings showed that the increased failure fraction during acoustic stimulation cannot be explained by synaptic depression alone. This was evidenced by an analysis of EPSP thresholds and furthermore confirmed by iontophoretic application of a glycine receptor agonist and antagonist. In conclusion, the elevation of the EPSP threshold has proven to be a reliable indicator for inhibitory action, leading to an increased failure fraction. These data are consistent with previous in vivo studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuenzel et al., 2011</xref>), as well as with slice and model studies demonstrating that an increase in inhibitory conductance can elevate threshold EPSP in bushy cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Xie and Manis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Kuenzel et al., 2015</xref>). In summary, the endbulb of Held–SBC synapse seems to operate close to AP threshold and shows variable reliability which is strongly influenced by acoustically evoked inhibition (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuenzel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Keine and Rübsamen, 2015</xref>). While the observed frequency response areas are consistent with previous reports, we did not observe two distinct types of inhibition as reported earlier, i.e. broadband vs. on-CF inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Caspary et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2002</xref>). Instead, the present data suggest that inhibition at SBCs is broadband and on-CF.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Iontophoretic application of glycine covers the physiologically relevant conditions</title><p>SBCs receive inhibitory inputs both on their somata and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gómez-Nieto and Rubio, 2009</xref>). Both glycine and GABA receptors were shown to be present, with the latter playing a secondary role as demonstrated in slice experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Nerlich et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">2014b</xref>). Therefore, we focused on the modulation of glycinergic inhibition. The applied dose was equated to match the acoustically evoked level of AP failures, keeping inhibition in the physiologically relevant range. This cautious approach will tend to underestimate the in vivo effect of glycine since the block of glycine receptors by local application of strychnine might be incomplete. Consistent with the slice data, the lack of threshold EPSP elevation during the block of glycinergic inhibition suggests only a minor influence of the GABAergic component during tone burst stimulation. The GABAergic inhibition might have an additional modulatory function or may only be activated during periods of high activity, as has been suggested for the glycinergic inhibition in the bird’s nucleus magnocellularis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fischl et al., 2014</xref>), the avian homolog of the AVCN. Overall, we find glycine to have a substantial influence in shaping transmission at the SBC junction. However, the increased SBC output rates during block of glycinergic inhibition might increase the influence of spike depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lorteije et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuenzel et al., 2011</xref>) and other factors such as spike threshold adaptation have to be taken into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fontaine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Huang et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Inhibitory mechanism for improving sparsity and reproducibility of the neural response</title><p>For a broad range of acoustic stimuli, we observed a consistently sparser and more reproducible response in the SBC output compared to the ANF input. Can a simple inhibition achieve these changes in signal representation? Glycinergic inhibition has previously been demonstrated to be neither purely subtractive nor purely divisive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuenzel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Nerlich et al., 2014b</xref>) and act with a short delay of ~3 ms on time scales of ~10–15 ms. These properties may be sufficient for increasing sparsity and reproducibility under the assumption that large deviations of firing rate are the consequence of stimulus-elicited, high firing probabilities rather than noise (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The latter would be temporally unrelated to the stimulus, and its transmission would reduce the reproducibility, and probably also the usefulness of the transmitted information for further processing.</p><p>In SBCs, this would translate to multiple, closely timed spikes for an individual input or across multiple excitatory inputs. The partially subtractive glycinergic inhibition would be strongly triggered by large instantaneous firing rates, and weaken subsequent inputs which do not occur closely to other inputs. On the PSTH level, a subtractive reduction thus almost inevitably increases sparsity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Reproducibility will also be increased if the average temporal precision of high peaks is greater than the bulk of spikes at lower firing rates. Divisive inhibition typically leaves sparsity and reproducibility unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), although the influence on sparsity will partially depend on the measure used.</p><p>Due to the inhibitory/excitatory co-modulation with level, the enhancement in sparsity and reproducibility can extend over a wide range of levels. These considerations do not rule out additional enhancements of temporal precision, via additional excitatory inputs, however, these would be influenced similarly by the inhibition. The considerations above are challenging to study since precise temporal control over multiple inputs would be required.</p><p>Generally, if the information in the response is largely maintained, an increase in temporal sparsity can be advantageous for mainly three reasons. First, the information per spike is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barlow, 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Olshausen and Field, 2004</xref>). This is relevant for downstream cells, who can then combine information more efficiently with other inputs, to achieve higher precision, e.g. for estimating interaural time delays. Second, since the SBC’s response occurs on a reduced plateau of unmodulated firing than the ANF’s, changes in firing rate will lead to larger relative changes in firing rate, which should improve their detection in the target neurons. Avoiding saturating or strongly adapting postsynaptic responses also supports this improvement in change detectability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mitchison and Durbin, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Graham and Willshaw, 1997</xref>). Third, a reduction in the number of spikes reduces the energetic load on the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Levy and Baxter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baddeley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Attwell and Laughlin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Olshausen and Field, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Graham and Field, 2007</xref>). In the present case the failures of transmission may, therefore, more appropriately be contrasted with the <italic>spikes selected for transmission</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Inhibition at the endbulb synapse in the context of sound processing</title><p>SBCs provide the indispensable temporally precise excitatory inputs to the interaural time difference based sound localization in the MSO. Both, physiological and modeling studies suggest the neurons in the MSO act as coincidence detectors by primarily relying on the precise spike timing of binaural inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Goldberg and Brown, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Yin and Chan, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Franken et al., 2014</xref>). While sparsity has predominantly been advocated as an advantageous coding principle due to its reduced energy demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Levy and Baxter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Graham and Field, 2007</xref>), in the MSO there might be a different justification for sparsity: With the MSO neurons acting as coincidence detectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Couchman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Plauška et al., 2016</xref>), sparse excitatory inputs would lead to an improved signal-to-noise ratio of the correlation, i.e. of its peak in relation to the common floor of correlation. Presently, this is shown by the reproducibility measure across trials, which <bold>–</bold> when just considering signal processing – can be regarded as the correlation between the activity of independent neurons from both sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Joris, 2003</xref>). Equally important, the effective gain control achieved through the acoustically evoked inhibition will allow the MSO to retain a similar level of binaural sensitivity across a wide range of sound levels and stimuli. Importantly, this sparsening and increase in reproducibility were observed for the wide range of stimuli presently tested.</p><p>The observed increase in reproducibility in SBC output compared to the ANF input is consistent with previously reported population data. Studies comparing ANF and AVCN neurons (most likely spherical or globular bushy cells) in the cat reported increased reproducibility in neurons of the AVCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Louage et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">van der Heijden et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we directly studied the increase across trials within single ANF-SBC junctions and not across cells. We conjecture that reproducibility across cells always increases if both cells increase their reproducibility individually. However, this can only be assessed with the peak of the cross-correlation, if the cells are matched in their tuning, a condition which is typically assumed for bilateral inputs into the MSO. For non-matched cells, reproducibility should increase but would have to be assessed with a different measure, which measures the set of responses to a given stimulus (for example Mutual Information).</p><p>Presently, we show that this increase is directly achieved at individual ANF-SBC junctions through the postsynaptic interaction of acoustically evoked excitation and inhibition. Also, during both narrowband and broadband stimulation, the block of inhibition resulted in a considerable decrease in reproducibility, sparsity, and temporal precision compared to the control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Hence, our results show that acoustically evoked inhibition plays a major role in shaping the SBC response. Most models of pitch perception are based on or related to an autocorrelation of neuronal activity and rely on temporal precision and reproducibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Licklider, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Meddis and Hewitt, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cariani and Delgutte, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Yost, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Cheveigné, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Denham, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Joris, 2016</xref>). The improvement of both characteristics at the ANF-SBC synapse might support the neuronal processing of pitch, but experimental evidence is lacking. Other transmitters such as acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Fujino and Oertel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Goyer et al., 2016</xref>) or norepinephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kössl and Vater, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Rothman and Manis, 2003</xref>) have modulatory effects on the SBC activity, but their effect on precisely-timed signal processing is not yet fully understood.</p><p>The output of SBCs is also relevant for general processing of sounds, i.e. their representation for later analysis, e.g. auditory recognition, a process distinct from sound localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Clarke et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Maeder et al., 2001</xref>). The increase in reproducibility might be beneficial in this part of the pathway as well. On the other hand, sparsity may have adverse effects, if the overall level is unavailable or if low level sound information in the ANF response is not represented anymore in the SBC response.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Inhibition under spectrotemporally broad and dynamic stimulation</title><p>Natural stimuli tend to depart from the classical laboratory stimuli, in being spectrotemporally broad and diverse.

STRFs were first introduced to study midbrain neurons in the grass frog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aertsen and Johannesma, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aertsen et al., 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">1981</xref>), and have since been an essential tool for auditory neuroscience along many stations of auditory system, ranging from the auditory nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kim and Young, 1994</xref>) and the MNTB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Englitz et al., 2010</xref>) to the inferior colliculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Escabi and Schreiner, 2002</xref>), and the auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kowalski et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">David et al., 2012</xref>). Recent developments in STRF estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Theunissen et al., 2001</xref>) make them a versatile tool to study the combined spectrotemporal stimulus selectivity of neurons for a wide range of acoustic stimuli. The present extension to pre- and postsynaptic activity is unique and provides a direct estimate of the spectrotemporal response modification occurring at a single endbulb synapse. It reveals inhibition to be co-tuned with excitation, but outlasting the latter, which – in total – leads to a slightly improved excitatory response precision. This response profile directly confirms the spectral properties gained from the pure-tone tuning curves and is in agreement with findings from of our previous studies on inhibition at the SBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Keine and Rübsamen, 2015</xref>). The pre-post STRF analysis could provide a generally applicable tool for the investigation of a wider range of modulations of signal processing at the giant synapses in both MNTB and AVCN, for example the functional differences on synaptic transmission under the stimulation with natural acoustic stimuli or removal/application of specific neurotransmitters, e.g. GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Nerlich et al., 2014b</xref>) or neuromodulators, e.g. acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Goyer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The RGS stimulus allows a robust estimation of STRFs while keeping the spectrum sparse (unlike dense stimuli as the TORC stimulus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Klein et al., 2000</xref>). A sparse spectrum is advantageous for the present study of the potentially long-lasting inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Nerlich et al., 2014b</xref>) since it prevents a continuous activation of inhibitory inputs causing saturation. It remains to be addressed, whether the RGS is a sufficient model for natural stimuli, or whether the natural statistics lead to a more specific activation of the inhibition arriving at the SBCs.</p><p>Overall level-dependence of STRF estimation was beyond the scope of this study and not investigated here in more detail. While the RGS stimulus contains different sound levels at different times and frequencies (via the randomized placement and shape of each gamma-tone), the overall, average sound level was kept constant. We predict that SBC STRFs will exhibit a greater robustness to changes in level compared to ANF STRFs, based on the gain-modulating inhibitory input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Source of inhibition</title><p>Several nuclei have been suggested to provide the inhibitory inputs to SBCs. The present data suggest the inhibitory source to feature a broad, symmetrically shaped tuning, consistent with an integration over a wide set of primary tuned inhibitory cells. The integration would have to be weighted by the distance to the postsynaptic CF, in order to achieve the symmetry in inhibitory modulation. In a recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Campagnola and Manis (2014)</xref> showed directly that bushy cells receive symmetric inhibition from within the CN. Further, the ~1 ms delay of the onset of acoustically evoked inhibition compared to the onset of excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuenzel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Keine and Rübsamen, 2015</xref>) suggests a single additional synaptic relay.

Signals were band-pass filtered between 5 Hz and 7.5 kHz using a zero-phase forward and reverse digital IIR filter and stored for offline analysis using custom-written Matlab software.</p><p>Extracellularly recorded voltage signals of SBCs are typically composed of two (PP-EPSP) or three components (PP-EPSP-AP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) reflecting the respective discharge of the presynaptic endbulb of Held (PP, prepotential), the postsynaptic EPSP, and the postsynaptically triggered AP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Englitz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Typlt et al., 2010</xref>). Signals were detected using a slope threshold for the rising flank of the EPSP. In this report, EPSPs that failed to trigger a postsynaptic AP were termed EPSP<sub>fail</sub> while EPSPs that successfully trigger an AP were termed EPSP<sub>succ</sub>. The separation between EPSP<sub>succ</sub> and EPSP<sub>fail</sub> was based on the maximum falling slope following the detection time point. The APs following EPSP<sub>succ</sub> exhibited a considerably faster-falling flank than EPSP<sub>fail</sub> enabling a clear separation of both signal types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The detection thresholds were kept fixed for each recorded unit, but varied between units to account for different signal-to-noise ratios. For comparison of timing between EPSP<sub>succ</sub> and EPSP<sub>fail</sub>, all events were time-stamped on their respective maximum EPSP slope. Previous studies showed that the maximum slope of the EPSP is a reliable measure of EPSP strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuenzel et al., 2011</xref>). To determine the threshold EPSP, the maximum EPSP slopes of EPSP<sub>succ</sub> and EPSP<sub>fail</sub> were binned (bin size = 0.5 V/s), and the fraction of EPSP<sub>succ</sub> calculated for each bin. Then, a Boltzmann function of the form <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> was fitted to the data with each bin weighted relative to the number of events in that bin. The symmetric inflection point <italic>d</italic> indicates the threshold EPSP, i.e. the EPSP slope necessary to yield a &gt; 50% probability of triggering a postsynaptic AP (see also supplementary Matlab code). Earlier studies showed the influence of preceding neural activity on EPSC/EPSP and AP amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Englitz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lorteije et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Yang and Xu-Friedman, 2015</xref>).

Therefore, a weighted average of all preceding events was used, with the impact dependent on the distance and EPSP slope of the respective events.

The temporal precision of spikes throughout the stimulus period was assessed by calculating the vector strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Goldberg and Brown, 1969</xref>). The significance of phase-locking was tested based on the Rayleigh approximation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Mardia, 1972</xref>). Vector strength is an inadequate measure if the units firing rate reproduces the stimulus modulation. Therefore, we calculated the stimulus reproduction (Corr<sub>Norm</sub>) as the normalized cross-correlation between the stimulus modulation and the respective response PSTH, adjusted for the latency of the neural response (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Tolnai et al., 2008</xref>) for a detailed explanation). Note that Corr<sub>Norm</sub> is constrained to the positive range [0, 1] and an unmodulated response would yield a value of 0.82. High Corr<sub>Norm</sub> values (&gt;0.9) are only obtained when the response shape follows the stimulus envelope. The reproducibility of the neuronal responses was estimated by measuring the central peak of the shuffled autocorrelation across identical stimulus presentations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Joris et al., 2006</xref>). The modulation depth of the neural response to the 100% amplitude modulation was estimated by calculating the standard deviation of the first cycle of the normalized cross-correlation function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Estimation of spectrotemporal receptive fields</title><p>Spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) represent the neural tuning in the dimensions of the spectrogram (time and frequency) and help to identify stimulus properties that control spiking at high temporal resolution. Specifically, we used STRFs to study the time course of inhibition during ongoing, spectrally dispersed stimulation. Estimation of STRFs was performed using generalized reverse correlation, as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Theunissen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Englitz et al., 2010</xref>). STRFs were estimated for both the input to the SBCs (EPSP<sub>fail</sub> + EPSP<sub>succ</sub>), as well as the SBC output (EPSP<sub>succ</sub>). Both input and output were aligned to their maximum EPSP slope, to enable a subtraction of the two STRFs using congruent reference points. STRFs were individually normalized to their standard deviation (positive peak lead normalization to very similar results), in order to allow an evaluation of tuning shape, removing the gain from overall firing rate. Without normalization, the result remains qualitatively the same. However, the inhibitory effect is then dominated by the difference at the STRF peak, which stems from the overall firing rate difference between ANF and SBC. The resulting difference-STRF indicates the translation in spectrotemporal sensitivity from ANF input to the SBC output (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We interpret this difference to be a consequence of three factors (i) local inhibition, together with (ii) postsynaptic processes of spike-frequency adaptation and (iii) Na-channel inactivation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Temporal sparsity, temporal precision and reproducibility of the neural response</title><p>We evaluated multiple measures of synaptic responsiveness to quantify the input-to-output signal processing at these second order neurons of the ascending central auditory pathway.

Second, we calculated the kurtosis of the firing rate distribution introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Field (1994)</xref>, which quantifies the peakedness of the firing rate distribution. Note, that this classical definition may lead to counterintuitive interpretations, e.g. if a neuron has dominantly high firing rates and is only rarely silent (also leading to high kurtosis). This measure is hence provided for historical reference.</p><p>Third, we calculated a simple and intuitive measure, which we term ‘Close-to-Silence-Index’ (CSI).

Different thresholds lead to different CSI values but allows one to define what a ‘non-response’ or ‘small-rate’ is. We here chose F = 15 Hz, although other sensible values (5–20 Hz) gave qualitatively similar results. The CSI is a useful estimator if the firing rate distribution is monomodal. Sparsity analysis was performed on PSTHs sampled at 100 Hz (see also supplementary Matlab code).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Reproducibility</title><p>Across multiple repetitions of a stimulus, the neural response can repeat reliably or exhibit a high trial-to-trial variability.

Comparison between two independent groups was performed using student's two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Inhibition in the auditory brainstem enhances signal representation and regulates gain in complex acoustic environments&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that this paper was an interesting study that enhanced our understanding of the transformation of information between the auditory nerve and the cochlear nucleus. The data were generally well analysed (but see below for suggestions for improvement) and no further experiments were deemed necessary. While some of the results in the early part of the paper have been reported by others (including their own group), the latter part of the paper, looking at the coding of more natural stimuli i.e. SAM, SFM and RGS, contains new and interesting data.</p><p>There are quite a few comments, but the reviewers feel these can all be satisfactorily addressed by the authors. In particular, the reviewers would appreciate a clearer explanation of the STRF stimulus and its analysis e.g. concepts such as sparsity and reproduction need to be made more accessible. In addition, the authors should address the issues of data analysis and presentation outlined in the comments below.</p><p>Essential comments</p><p>1) It is important to set out more clearly what this study is addressing. To say simply that &quot;the functional role [of inhibition] is not entirely understood&quot; (Introduction section) is inadequate. In the Abstract and Introduction you suggest that one possibility is to compensate for stimulus level. The passage at the beginning of subsection “Inhibition at the endbulb in the context of sound localization” seems important to this argument, but it is difficult to understand how sparsity enhances coincidence detection in MSO. If two inputs simply fire less, then there are fewer opportunities for coincidence, so it seems coincidence detection could get worse if the spikes are deleted at random. The authors posit that reproducibility also occurs across cells, not just within. Do the present data support that? How does level tolerance arise out of this?</p><p>2) The concepts of sparsity and reproduction need to be more clearly explained. This is especially true in subsection “Glycinergic inhibition renders SBC responses sparser, more reliable and temporally more precise”, but even in the Abstract, these terms should be clearly defined.a) Why is kurtosis a measure of sparsity? Kurtosis seems to capture both tails of a distribution, but the term &quot;sparsity&quot; implies decreased firing generally, which would include a shift in the mean firing rate, or a skew towards longer intervals. Kurtosis, as the 4th moment, seems to be chosen to avoid both those features. Why is that? It should also be clearly explained why sparsity might be important. The argument from saving energy is not very compelling, if there is not also a decrease in firing rate.b) The term reproduction is not clear. Its definition is hidden in the Methods and while the values are compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, an example is not shown until <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. &quot;Reproduction&quot; has a connotation of being able to recreate something (e.g. using a response to reproduce the stimulus). However, the quantification seems to be using cross-correlation of responses. Perhaps &quot;reproducibility&quot; would be a better term for this measure, though it is important to consider that just because a response is reproducible does not mean it is correct or efficient or useful.</p><p>3) Do all primary-like units show failures? Did you just select cells that showed failures? Please comment on cell type. How is it determined that these are spherical bushy cells? Are recordings targeted towards cells with particularly large synaptic inputs? How many synaptic inputs does each cell receive? Are the electrical signals assignable to activity of one input? Does the analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> assume these are single inputs? If they are multiple synaptic inputs, how is this approach justified?</p><p>4) Spike depression. Lorteije et al., 2009 suggested that &quot;spike depression&quot; (presumably the refractory period) contributed to EPSP failures at the calyx of Held. The refractory period would likely appear as an increase in threshold during periods of high activity, similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> right, and a decrease in spike amplitude with high activity, similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> right. This possibility should at least be acknowledged, and the strychnine results interpreted with this in mind as well.</p><p>5) Second paragraph subsection “Synaptic depression alone fails to fully account for increased failure rates”: Mathematically, what you have done here is correct, but it will likely be confusing to many readers. It is unclear why an &quot;error function&quot; (Boltzmann?) is used to fit this data, as the points clearly cluster into two clouds, and the &quot;threshold&quot; point is not near any of the data points. Why were the data not binned along the ordinate of rising slope (in 0.5 or 1 V/s bins), and the probability of success or failure computed in each bin, based on the total number of succ+fail. This would give the type of representation that would then make sense in terms of fitting to a Boltzmann to obtain a &quot;threshold&quot;. Maybe do this as an inset?</p><p>6) The summary plots can be very difficult to read. Each plot shows median, quartiles and outliers, as well as averages. This gets very busy, and winds up obscuring or minimizing the important differences. For example, in Figure 3Ciii the averages are squashed down in the lower part of the panel, and most of the panel is taken up with outliers. It would be better to maximize the plot area to make the data as visible as possible. Averages and standard errors are sufficient when testing with a t-test, as are box-and-whisker plots when a non-parametric test. This applies to summary plots throughout, with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D &amp; 6D</xref> particularly hard to read.</p><p>7) Many plots compare paired values, and report the original values (+/- SE), but not their differences. For example, 3Ci reports average CFs of ANF and SBC. The average values of these are not very meaningful. What is important is the difference between CFs for input vs. output, which is not reported. This applies in many other places: in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, differences in threshold, Q, asymmetry; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> right panels, effects of glycine, strychnine, stimulation; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>, differences between input and output; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C-F</xref>, differences between input and output, Figure 8iii, iv, differences between input and output, effects of strychnine.</p><p>8) ANOVAs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, 6. It is very difficult to understand the ANOVA carried out here. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, left, the ANOVA results suggest there is &quot;a systematic variation with modulation frequencies&quot;. This is not visible in the plot, and furthermore, the nature of the &quot;systematic variation&quot; is obscured by an ANOVA. Did it go up or down? In the FM analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the extreme frequencies show little effect, but 100 Hz modulation shows a strong effect. Why is this behavior so non-linear? Did the results match some sort of expected outcome?</p><p>9) Flatness of the RLF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Using standard deviation to quantify flatness of the RLF is confusing. A standard deviation is a comparison to a mean, and the mean here is not meaningful because it depends on which intensities were sampled. My sense is that the standard deviation would depend on whether the RLF is sampled symmetrically about a cell's dynamic range (the SD would be maximal), or asymmetrically (the SD would be lower). Please justify this measure more carefully. A more intuitive measure of flatness may be the difference in firing rate between maximum and minimum (normalized appropriately).</p><p>10) Effects of inhibition. The analysis of the effects of inhibition is very thorough, and beautifully shown, but does not adequately acknowledge similar results from earlier work. This is particularly noticeable in the final paragraph of subsection “Acoustically evoked inhibition elevates threshold for AP generation”, which does not acknowledge that Kopp-Scheinpflug, 2002 and Kuenzel, 2011 also showed similar tuning of inhibition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> investigate different types of stimuli, but it would be helpful to compare the findings against others' results using tuning curves. The period histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref> seem to show that the output is simply shifted lower compared to input. Is such a simple overall shift sufficient to explain the changes in vector strength, modulation depth, reproduction, and correlation? Or, are the temporal characteristics of inhibition also important?</p><p>11) FM data period histograms. The FM stimuli appear to yield 2 or 3 peaks in the representative example of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Multi-peaked firing can undermine the utility of the standard VS calculation. That is, each peak may be very tight and repeatable, but by having more than one, the VS decreases.</p><p>12) STRF analysis: This analysis is very nice, but some clarification would be helpful.a) Why is the inhibitory STRF calculated by subtracting the ANF and SBC plots? Please explain how and why firing rates are normalized by the standard deviation. Is it normalized by subtraction or division? What if this normalization is not done? Please add a scale bar to these plots. Can this analysis be done instead by using only the EPSP(fail) for the kernel estimation? How would this approach differ from the subtraction approach?b) The size of the excitatory region is described as sharper in the SBC compared to ANF. This is not obvious in the example. Can the spectral width be indicated on the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> somehow? Is there a similar effect in the tuning curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>? It is not clear how sound level influences the STRF. Would that affect this width measurement?</p><p>13) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: This is a very important figure, because it addresses how inhibition influences the information carried by SBCs compared to ANFs. It would be very helpful if the authors could take a stab at explaining how inhibition may enhance sparsity, reproduction, and temporal dispersion. In the case of sparsity, it seems like it cannot be simply a change in the mean firing rate, because kurtosis should not include that (unless there are weird effects of rectification at firing rate of 0).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19295.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential comments</italic> </p><p><italic>1) It is important to set out more clearly what this study is addressing.

The review process has motivated us to investigate the mechanisms deeper than before (see below), which leads to a clearer and more insightful bottom-line:</p><p>&quot; These improvements are a consequence of the combined subtractive/divisive action of glycine (Kuenzel et al., 2011, 2015): The subtractive component enhances the temporal sparsity by raising the threshold for spiking. Therefore, mostly high instantaneous firing-rate events pass the junction, which often correspond to salient events in the cell's frequency range. The divisive component acts primarily as a gain control, which – in conjunction with the co-tuning – maintains the SBC output rate in a smaller range across different stimulus levels. Together these two effects focus the SBC output onto well-timed stimulus events across a wider range of stimulus levels. Thus, inhibition improves the basis for the high-fidelity signal processing in downstream nuclei crucial for sound localization irrespective of the prevailing stimulus levels.&quot;</p><p>We have added this passage in the Introduction section, in addition to a number of other clarifications.</p><p>Regarding the other questions raised in this point:</p><p>The reviewers correctly point out that the step from improved sparsity and reproducibility to improved coincidence detection is not a trivial one, and should be addressed more directly. As the reviewers indicate, a random deletion of spikes would not lead to improved coding. Since a random deletion would correspond to a divisive scaling of the PSTH, it would also not lead to an increase in sparsity (although this would depend to some degree on the measure, see the next point). The effect of inhibition in this case is at least partially subtractive (see also #10 and #13 of the essential comments below for more details), which means that the spikes/parts of the PSTH that remain are those occurring during phases of high firing rate or high firing probabilities. These are the phases, when the stimulus drives a lot of spikes in the current frequency band/neural tuning (directly shown e.g. by the STRF tuning). For a given excitatory frequency these phases will correspond to high stimulus level (given the monotonic rate-level functions of ANFs), which are likely to be present in both the left and the right ear. We propose, that in this way, a given frequency channel transmits the most salient events in its frequency channel, which will also have the best timing (based on the general level-latency dependence (Heil and Irvine, 1997; Heil et al., 2008; Neubauer and Heil, 2008). Such an increase in temporal precision was also demonstrated before, (e.g. (Joris et al., 1994a, 1994b; Dehmel et al., 2010; Kuenzel et al., 2011) and also our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and 8. Note, that due to the co-tuning of the inhibition with excitation, the strength of inhibition varies across level. Thus, across all levels the neuron’s response to the <italic>relatively</italic> loudest peaks are kept, which is what we refer to as gain control.</p><p>Next, the outputs from both ears are then combined in the MSO (and LSO) for sound localization: In order to precisely estimate sound source locations, MSO neurons have to detect “correct” coincidences, i.e. coincident spikes from both ears while neglecting coincident spikes from one ear or coincidences that are purely random. MSO neurons possess a number of anatomical (Stotler, 1953; Smith, 1995; Agmon-Snir et al., 1998) and biophysical specializations (Scott et al., 2007; Mathews et al., 2010) to distinguish between monaural and binaural coincidences. The increase of ANF firing rates with sound pressure level would – at high sound intensities – likely result in a large number of coinciding inputs at the MSO level and create MSO activity at unfavorable ITDs, i.e. coincident spikes just by chance alone. The above described focus on the relatively highest-level events may allow the MSO to focus on binaural spikes with high temporal fidelity, and thus avoid inaccurate contributions to the ITD estimation. The increase of inhibition with level maintains a more limited range of firing rates across level. Given the presumably strong biophysical basis of coincidence detection in the MSO, it seems plausible that precise ITD processing can only function over a limited range of input firing frequencies. However, as intuitive as this reasoning may seem, it remains partly speculative at this point. We have added considerations along the lines above in the Discussion, adding to Discussion sections that have been added in response to other points raised by the reviewers (see section: Inhibitory mechanism for improving sparsity and reproducibility of the neural response)</p><p>Next, the reviewers inquired whether reproducibility increases across cells as well. Before answering this point, we would like to make our claim more precise: If reproducibility is measured with cross-correlation at time-shift 0, an increase in reproducibility in a single cell, does not necessarily lead to an increase in reproducibility across multiple cells. Since different cells will have different tuning properties, their cross-correlation may well reduce (at time-shift 0), even if both cells individually increase their cross-correlation at time-shift 0. If cells with matched tuning properties are compared, however, an increase in reproducibility in each cell, should translate to an increase across cells. We have tested this directly for a subset of cells, identified by clearly peaked ANF cross-correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>). We selected cells where identical stimulus parameters were used and in all tested cases (14 pairs of cells) the cross-correlation at time-shift 0 increased, as predicted. However, although the increase across cells was positive (0.15+/-0.18, Wilcoxon signed ranks test, p&lt;&lt;0.001) it was slightly smaller (Wilcoxon signed ranks test, p=0.03) compared to the increase within the same set of cells (0.53+/-0.41), which could be a consequence of the residual tuning mismatch between these cells.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19295.024</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Reproducibility of the SBC output also improves across cells, if these are well matched in their CF and stimulus.</title><p>Top/right: Cross-correlograms between ANF input (orange) and SBC output (blue) across pairs of cells (columns and rows enumerate the cells, diagonal is the same cell (gray background), for comparison). Our sample contained 9 cells (one group of 3, and one of 6 cells), which were stimulated with the identical RGS stimulus, giving a total of 18 across pairs. One of the cells did not show an improvement in reproducibility (with itself) and correspondingly did also not show an improvement with other cells (blue background). Since the reviewers asked about improvements in reproducibility, this cell is excluded from the population analysis below. Bottom left: Reproducibility between ANF input and SBC output within (purple) and between (black) cells. Reproducibility also increased between different cells with similar tuning properties (dots above line of equality). Bottom middle: Population data indicate a significant increase in reproducibility of the SBC output compared to the ANF input between cells (p&lt;0.001, n=14, Wilcoxon signed rank test.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19295.024">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19295.024</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19295-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>On the other hand, if reproducibility were measured with a more general measure, e.g. the entropy of the response given a stimulus (i.e. H(R|S)), or – more typically – mutual information (I(R,S) = H(R)-H(R|S)), then we would predict that an increase in reproducibility on single cells would always lead to an increase in reproducibility on the population level. While the current number of repetitions would make entropy estimation inaccurate (Panzeri and Treves, 1996), the general argument for an overall increase is as follows: considering the extreme case, where every cell produces an individual, but unique spike-train for a given stimulus. Then the neural population would also emit a unique population spike-train, thus be highly reproducible. Similarly, if a single cell becomes more reproducible, this reduces the set of response emitted by the entire population. We have added the following abbreviated version of this argument to the Discussion:</p><p>“Here, we only directly studied the increase across trials within a cell, but not across cells. We conjecture that reproducibility across cells always increases, if both cells increase their reproducibility individually. However, this can only be assessed with the peak of the cross-correlation, if the cells are matched in their tuning, a condition which is typically assumed for bilateral inputs into the MSO. For non-matched cells, reproducibility should increase, but would have to be assessed with a different measure, that measures the set of responses to a given stimulus (for example Mutual Information).”</p><p><italic>2) The concepts of sparsity and reproduction need to be more clearly explained. This is especially true in subsection “Glycinergic inhibition renders SBC responses sparser, more reliable and temporally more precise”, but even in the Abstract, these terms should be clearly defined.a) Why is kurtosis a measure of sparsity? Kurtosis seems to capture both tails of a distribution, but the term &quot;sparsity&quot; implies decreased firing generally, which would include a shift in the mean firing rate, or a skew towards longer intervals. Kurtosis, as the 4th moment, seems to be chosen to avoid both those features. Why is that? It should also be clearly explained why sparsity might be important. The argument from saving energy is not very compelling, if there is not also a decrease in firing rate.</italic> </p><p>We added additional information on sparsity and reproducibility to the Introduction and Results section at their first appearance. The word limit in the Abstract prevented us from explaining the concepts in more detail there.</p><p>We used the kurtosis of the firing rate distribution to measure the sparsity of the neural response, since it had been classically suggested as a measure of sparseness (Field, 1994) with higher values of kurtosis related to higher sparseness (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> of Field, 1994). The rationale for the use of kurtosis in the original work was to assess the 'peakedness' of the firing rate distribution, which led Field to consider kurtosis as a &quot;useful measure&quot;, although not necessarily the best measure for sparseness.</p><p>We, however, agree with the reviewer's observation, that the use of kurtosis is too general in the present context, since both tails above and below the average contribute, hence, there could be cases with identical kurtosis but very different average firing rate. We, therefore, apply another method of sparseness quantification, which does not suffer from this problem. This measure has been suggested by Rolls and Tovee, (1995) and later taken up by Willmore and Tolhurst (2001), as well as several subsequent studies in neuroscience (~200, according to citation counts on Google Scholar).</p><p>This measure is defined as: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:msub><mml:mrow/><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo> </mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> denote the time average.

CSI is defined as the fraction of PSTH bins, which are below a certain threshold (here chosen to be 15 Hz, quite low compared to the range of up to 400 Hz firing rate, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>), i.e. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>#</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mo>#</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p><p>CSI is also an index, thus ranges only between 0 and 1. CSI essentially directly evaluates how close a cell is to spiking at low rate for most of the time. Assuming monomodal firing rate distributions, which are limited from below by 0, it should be a reliable measure for sparsity as well, especially if a conservative threshold is chosen.</p><p>Overall the results between the three sparseness measures do not differ qualitatively, all indicating the SBC responses to be temporally sparser than the ANF responses. Since kurtosis has historically been used we keep it in the supplement figure together with the CSI, and replace the – to our knowledge – most standard definition of sparseness by Rolls and Tovee, 1995 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><p>Secondly, as suggested by the reviewers, we now address the virtues of sparse coding in greater detail in the Introduction (briefly) and the Discussion (at greater length), but not in the Results, since this remains an interpretation. Concretely, we focus on the information per spike and the energy efficiency: One main advantage of sparsity can be the increased information per spike, e.g. to temporal information, or also the detection of changes in firing rate/stimulus properties, if sparsity is achieved through gain normalization. Since the firing rate does indeed decrease in all cells (after all we are studying failures of transmission), we also keep the argument of more energy-efficient coding, but provide a more detailed argument now.</p><p> <italic>b) The term reproduction is not clear. Its definition is hidden in the Methods and while the values are compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, an example is not shown until <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. &quot;Reproduction&quot; has a connotation of being able to recreate something (e.g. using a response to reproduce the stimulus). However, the quantification seems to be using cross-correlation of responses. Perhaps &quot;reproducibility&quot; would be a better term for this measure, though it is important to consider that just because a response is reproducible does not mean it is correct or efficient or useful.</italic> </p><p>We agree that “reproducibility” is more in line with our definition (and maybe more grammatical) than “reproduction”, hence, we replaced it throughout the revised manuscript. To introduce the term an explanation has been added to the Results section and a subplot has been added to its first mention in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> which illustrates its definition.</p><p>Further, we also agree that increased reproducibility of the neural response does not necessarily imply a more efficient or useful coding of acoustic information (for 'correct', see below). However, reproducibility across trials, which we measure here, provides a basis for the consistency in extracting information (e.g. interaural time difference, but also stimulus envelope) to repeated presentations of the same stimulus. This is the minimal requirement one should have for a consistent processing of stimuli.</p><p>According to Joris, 2003, comparing each pair of spike trains from recordings of a single cell can be considered as providing the input to a simple binaural coincidence detector. While we think the quantification on the basis of the cross-correlation is generally sensible, it is particularly fitting in the context of subsequent computations for extracting interaural time-delays in subsequent processing stations, which likely relies on operations similar to cross-correlation (Colburn, 1996; van der Heijden et al., 2013; Franken et al., 2014; Plauška et al., 2016). For example, MSO neurons are thought to perform an approximate cross-correlation between their bilateral inputs, hence, an increase in cross-correlation translates into a more precise firing of MSO neurons, i.e. more precise in interaural time.</p><p>The last point raised by the reviewers, whether a more reproducible response is more correct, is hard to answer, without relating it to the subsequent computation. For example, if only interaural-time difference were computed, then the combination of increased reproducibility and temporal precision can be taken as a signature of a 'more correct' response for this purpose. However, this could also render the response less correct for other purposes. We have added these important considerations to the Discussion. They are embedded into the section dealing with functional origin of the increase in sparsity and reproduction (see below):</p><p>&quot;These properties may be sufficient for increasing sparsity and reproducibility under the assumption that large deviations of firing rate are the consequence of stimulus-elicited, high firing probabilities rather than noise (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The latter would be temporally unrelated to the stimulus, and its transmission would reduce the reproducibility, and probably also the usefulness of the transmitted information for further processing […].&quot;</p><p><italic>3) Do all primary-like units show failures? Did you just select cells that showed failures? Please comment on cell type. How is it determined that these are spherical bushy cells? Are recordings targeted towards cells with particularly large synaptic inputs? How many synaptic inputs does each cell receive? Are the electrical signals assignable to activity of one input? Does the analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> assume these are single inputs? If they are multiple synaptic inputs, how is this approach justified?</italic> </p><p>From our recordings at the rostral pole of the AVCN, all cells showed failures but to very different degrees (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We did not encounter a cell that was completely fail safe and even for cells which showed low failure rates during spontaneous activity, the failure rate generally increased under acoustic stimulation. The SBCs were determined by a number of physiological properties such as high-spontaneous rates (Smith et al., 1993), localization at the rostral pole of the AVCN (Bazwinsky et al., 2008), the presence of a discernible prepotential in addition to complex waveform (Pfeiffer, 1966; Englitz et al., 2009), short AP duration (Typlt et al., 2012), and primary-like response patterns to pure-tone stimulation (Blackburn and Sachs, 1989). Based on these properties the SBCs can be reliably differentiated from the second type of principal neurons in the AVCN, the stellate cells. By considering these physiological properties, we are confident that the recorded cells were large SBCs, which have been shown to project to the MSO in cats (Osen, 1969). We added this information at the beginning of the Results section.</p><p>Each SBC receives between 1-3 endbulb inputs in mice (Cao and Oertel, 2010), and the majority of rostral SBCs seem to receive a single endbulb in cats (Ryugo and Sento, 1991), whereas GBCs are reported to receive between 10-70 endbulb inputs (Liberman, 1991; Spirou et al., 2005). Our dataset and previous studies recording from low-CF SBCs in the Mongolian Gerbil suggest that the majority of cells receive a single functional endbulb input (Kuenzel et al., 2011, 2015). This conclusion is supported by the following findings:</p><p>(i) Multiple endbulb inputs to SBCs would be indicated by a larger variation of EPSP slopes reflecting differences in the convergence of different inputs which – during in vivo recording of spontaneous activity – will not be completely synchronized. The consequently expected variations in the shapes (and amplitudes) of EPSPs were not observed in our recordings.</p><p>(ii) Multiple endbulb inputs onto SBCs would be indicated by violation of the refractory period and temporal overlap of two or more EPSPs. Our data on EPSP slopes show a unimodal distribution and we did not observe an overlap of multiple EPSPs in the recordings.</p><p>(iii) Multiple endbulb inputs would likely be reflected by ANF input rates above the rates of single auditory nerve fibers, since converging ANF inputs on bushy cells originate from the same SR type (Ryugo and Sento, 1991).</p><p>To further deal with this issue we compared the distribution of ANF input rates of our recordings with published data from recordings of single AN fibers from the Mongolian Gerbil (Schmiedt, 1989; and Müller, 1996; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 2</xref>). We extracted the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in Schmiedt (1989) and from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in Mueller (1996), constructed histograms and compared these to the histogram of ANF input rates of our recordings. In our recordings we did not observe cells with low spontaneous rates, which was expected, since SBCs are predominantly contacted by high-SR ANF (Smith et al., 1993). The distribution of spontaneous ANF input rates observed in the present study matches the distribution of spontaneous rates obtained from single auditory nerve fibers, suggesting that a single ANF is sufficient to produce the observed spontaneous rates. The largest endbulbs were reported at CFs between 1-4 kHz, the CF range of this study (Rouiller et al., 1986; Sento and Ryugo, 1989). Thus, our data are naturally biased towards large SBCs that receive large endbulb endings.</p><p>Furthermore, in our recordings we observed an activity-dependent facilitation of EPSPs, which might be caused by residual calcium accumulation in the endbulb of Held (Borst, 2010). If our recordings would contain EPSPs from multiple independent endbulbs, we would not see such facilitation, since only a fraction of EPSPs should be affected by previous activity. Also, the observation of facilitation rather than depression is unlikely to occur with multiple endbulb inputs.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19295.025</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>The experimentally determined ANF input (top) showed spontaneous rates consistent with previously published auditory nerve recordings of the Mongolian Gerbil (middle &amp; bottom; data extracted from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in Schmiedt (Hearing Research, 1989) and from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in Mueller (Hearing Research, 1996) respectively).</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19295.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19295.025</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19295-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>4) Spike depression. Lorteije et al., 2009 suggested that &quot;spike depression&quot; (presumably the refractory period) contributed to EPSP failures at the calyx of Held. The refractory period would likely appear as an increase in threshold during periods of high activity, similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> right, and a decrease in spike amplitude with high activity, similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> right. This possibility should at least be acknowledged, and the strychnine results interpreted with this in mind as well.</italic> </p><p>We agree that spike depression and the influence of refractory period could potentially contribute to failures in AP generation in SBCs. This effect was also addressed in a previous study by Kuenzel and colleagues (2011) who showed that shortly after an SBC spike the failure fraction is increased, similarly to the results reported in the study at hand. Both Lorteije et al., 2009 and Kuenzel et al., 2011 reported short recovery times of 0.8 ms and 2.1 ms, respectively, indicating that the influence of spike depression on signal transmission is limited to periods shortly after the last SBC spike.</p><p>We attempt to address the influence of spike depression on AP generation in vivo by recording spontaneous activity in the absence of sound stimulation, when the inhibitory influence is likely small (note that the block of glycinergic inhibition did not influence the input-output function in the absence of sound stimulation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>During acoustic stimulation, the block of glycinergic inhibition counteracts the increase in threshold EPSP, but does not render the synapse fail safe. We do not deny that spike depression will contribute to the input-output function at the ANF-SBC synapse, however argue that this effect is constrained to a short time window after the last spike. Additionally, the observed general increase in threshold EPSP during acoustic stimulation was absent or reduced when blocking glycinergic inhibition, indicating that the effect of spike depression on failure rate is limited. However, we now acknowledge the influence of spike depression more clearly in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>5) Second paragraph subsection “Synaptic depression alone fails to fully account for increased failure rates”: Mathematically, what you have done here is correct, but it will likely be confusing to many readers. It is unclear why an &quot;error function&quot; (Boltzmann?) is used to fit this data, as the points clearly cluster into two clouds, and the &quot;threshold&quot; point is not near any of the data points. Why were the data not binned along the ordinate of rising slope (in 0.5 or 1 V/s bins), and the probability of success or failure computed in each bin, based on the total number of succ+fail. This would give the type of representation that would then make sense in terms of fitting to a Boltzmann to obtain a &quot;threshold&quot;. Maybe do this as an inset?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is intuitively not comprehensible that the current approach is a valid method for the estimation of threshold EPSP. The criticism of the reviewer is well taken and we not only would like to justify the approach in this letter but also explain the approach in in more detail in the text body of the manuscript. Choosing a Gaussian error function was based on a previous study (Kuenzel et al., 2011). Fitting different kinds of sigmoid functions (e.g. Boltzmann function, logistic function) resulted in different slope parameter, but identical inflection points, thus providing the same estimates for the threshold EPSP. In the original submission, we refrained from binning the rising slopes to avoid potential effects of bin size on threshold EPSP estimation. Also, in the method applied in the original manuscript, the fit is inherently weighted by the number of events, which is not the case when using binned data, as all bins will be equally weighted independent of the number of events in each bin, i.e. a probability calculated from e.g. 3 events contributes equally to the fit as does a probability calculated from 1000 events. This is why we thought the use of raw, unbinned data would provide more reliable data. However, we agree that the approach suggested by the reviewers is a more intuitive method of threshold calculation. We therefore recalculated the threshold EPSPs throughout the manuscript using the suggested method (bin size=0.5 V/s). We added a linear weighting parameter to each bin based on the number of events in each bin. The results are virtually identical to the previous approach (Pearson’s r=0.9996, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 3</xref>). We changed the respective passage in the Methods and Results section and modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> accordingly, which now shows the binned fraction of EPSPsucc across the EPSP rising slopes.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19295.026</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Comparison of threshold EPSP estimation methods: Right: Representative cell.</title><p>The version in the revised manuscript is based on the probability distribution of EPSP<sub>succ</sub> as a function of binned EPSP slope (top).

Each plot shows median, quartiles and outliers, as well as averages. This gets very busy, and winds up obscuring or minimizing the important differences. For example, in Figure 3Ciii the averages are squashed down in the lower part of the panel, and most of the panel is taken up with outliers. It would be better to maximize the plot area to make the data as visible as possible. Averages and standard errors are sufficient when testing with a t-test, as are box-and-whisker plots when a non-parametric test. This applies to summary plots throughout, with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D &amp; 6D</xref> particularly hard to read.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is correctly pointing out, that the way the data were presented in the graphs made it difficult to single out the important effects. We choose this approach to show all observed values and scaled the axes to cover all theoretically possible values (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, where correlation coefficient is bound between -1 and 1.) We added the marker for the representative cell to transparent show, how its values compare to the rest of the population. In the revised manuscript we followed the reviewers’ suggestion to increase the plot area in the summary plots accordingly. In Figure 3Ciii we added a second y-axis to spread the data for the Q40 values, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>, we replaced the boxplots with markers indicating the mean +/- standard deviation, which makes the graphs much easier to read.</p><p><italic>7) Many plots compare paired values, and report the original values (+/- SE), but not their differences. For example, 3Ci reports average CFs of ANF and SBC. The average values of these are not very meaningful. What is important is the difference between CFs for input vs. output, which is not reported. This applies in many other places: in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, differences in threshold, Q, asymmetry; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> right panels, effects of glycine, strychnine, stimulation; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>, differences between input and output; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C-F</xref>, differences between input and output, Figure 8iii, iv, differences between input and output, effects of strychnine.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that relevant information was missing the way the data were presented. Our motivation had been to provide a transparent presentation of the distribution of the raw data. We now added mean ± standard deviation for differences in the paired comparison to provide this previously missing information to the reader.</p><p><italic>8) ANOVAs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, 6. It is very difficult to understand the ANOVA carried out here. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, left, the ANOVA results suggest there is &quot;a systematic variation with modulation frequencies&quot;. This is not visible in the plot, and furthermore, the nature of the &quot;systematic variation&quot; is obscured by an ANOVA. Did it go up or down? In the FM analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the extreme frequencies show little effect, but 100 Hz modulation shows a strong effect. Why is this behavior so non-linear? Did the results match some sort of expected outcome?</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the misleading term “systematic variation” when describing the results of the VS across stimulation frequencies. Our focus was on the comparison between ANF input and SBC output rather than changes across modulation frequencies. Regarding the VS values, for both ANF input and SBC output the VS decreased with increasing stimulation frequency (VS 50 Hz: ANF=0.26 ± 0.09 vs. SBC=0.31 ± 0.07: 400 Hz: ANF=0.2 ± 0.1 vs. SBC=0.25 ± 0.1). While relatively stable VS values are obtained up to 200 Hz modulation frequency, the VS was significantly reduced at 400 Hz for both ANF input and SBC output. Importantly, the VS of the SBC output was larger than the ANF input across all frequencies tested.</p><p>The reviewer correctly observed the effect of the modulation frequencies, and here is, how we would like to explain this finding: The non-linearity of the frequency effect could be explained by the time-constant of the impact of inhibition. The FM stimulus spanned 3 octaves around the unit’s CF, thus covering frequency areas with strong inhibition and areas lacking any inhibitory effect. The time constant of the inhibitory effect is around 20-50 ms in slice recordings (Nerlich et al., 2014), but somewhat shorter in vivo (10–15 ms. Nerlich et al., 2014; Keine and Rübsamen, 2015). During frequency modulated stimulation, the inhibitory conductance should therefore also be modulated and essentially act as a band-pass filter. The slowest and highest modulation frequencies might result in saturation of inhibition or insufficient activation (if the inhibitory conductance does not summate), thus reducing the inhibitory effect on the ANF-to-SBC synapse. However, the exact inhibitory dynamics in vivo are not well understood, also the combination of cell types exerting this inhibition on SBC is unclear. Hence, the temporal dynamics of inhibitory inputs during acoustic stimulation remain elusive. At this point, we can only speculate, why the effect is smaller at the highest and lowest frequencies tested, but it is tempting to argue, that the inhibitory dynamics capture the modulation rates of natural acoustic stimuli. Further studies employing natural sounds would be necessary to evaluate the inhibitory effect on different time scales.</p><p><italic>9) Flatness of the RLF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Using standard deviation to quantify flatness of the RLF is confusing. A standard deviation is a comparison to a mean, and the mean here is not meaningful because it depends on which intensities were sampled. My sense is that the standard deviation would depend on whether the RLF is sampled symmetrically about a cell's dynamic range (the SD would be maximal), or asymmetrically (the SD would be lower). Please justify this measure more carefully. A more intuitive measure of flatness may be the difference in firing rate between maximum and minimum (normalized appropriately).</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is right in pointing out, that the measure of rate-level variability (RLV) as the standard deviation of the rate-level function (RLF) will depend on the intensities that actually were sampled. We calculated the standard deviation across all of the sampled intensities, identically for the ANF input and the SBC output. In most cells, the RLF of the ANF input shows monotonic increase over a relative wide range of firing rates, while the RLFs of the output were more flat or even non-monotonic. A measure of monotonicity was previously suggested by Kuenzel and colleauges, (2015), which relates the maximum firing rate throughout the RLF to the firing rate obtained at highest sound intensities. While this measure is suitable for detecting non-monotonic behavior in the SBC RLF, it does not quantify the gain of neuronal response, i.e. the change in firing rate across the sound intensity. Since non-monotonic behavior of the RLF is only present in about half of the SBC (Winter and Palmer, 1990; Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2002; Keine and Rübsamen, 2015), we opted to use another measure. The original measure was normalized to the spontaneous activity and sampled identically for all cells, and thus quantifies the deviation of firing rates relative to the spontaneous activity. Still, the reviewer is right in pointing out that in the original analysis, the RLV will depend on the threshold of the neuron, i.e. for identical changes in firing rates, different measures of RLV might be obtained. While this should not pose a major problem for the comparison of ANF input and SBC output (which are both driven by the same ANF), we agree that the way the data were analyzed might be somewhat puzzling for the reader. We therefore calculated the RLV as suggested by the reviewer as the difference between minimal and maximal firing rate normalized to the spontaneous activity of ANF input and SBC output, thus providing a measure of the change in firing rates relative to spontaneous activity independent of the sampled sound intensities or the unit’s threshold. Consequently, the RLV was renamed rate-level gain (RLG) throughout the manuscript. The new analysis is shown in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Although both measures quantify somewhat different properties of the RLF, a comparison between both resulted in significant positive correlation between the two (input: rs = 0.36, p &lt; 0.01, output: rs = 0.35, p &lt; 0.01). Therefore, using the method suggested by the reviewers allows us to draw the same conclusion about the reduction in gain, but is more intuitive to the reader.</p><p><italic>10) Effects of inhibition. The analysis of the effects of inhibition is very thorough, and beautifully shown, but does not adequately acknowledge similar results from earlier work. This is particularly noticeable in the final paragraph of subsection “Acoustically evoked inhibition elevates threshold for AP generation”, which does not acknowledge that Kopp-Scheinpflug, 2002 and Kuenzel, 2011 also showed similar tuning of inhibition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> investigate different types of stimuli, but it would be helpful to compare the findings against others' results using tuning curves. The period histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref> seem to show that the output is simply shifted lower compared to input. Is such a simple overall shift sufficient to explain the changes in vector strength, modulation depth, reproduction, and correlation? Or, are the temporal characteristics of inhibition also important?</italic> </p><p>As the reviewer correctly pointed out, the analysis of tuning curves showed similar characteristics of inhibition as reported earlier. While we did not observe two distinct types of inhibition, consistent with Kuenzel et al. (2011), we found inhibition to be broader than excitation, which is consistent with (Caspary et al., 1994; Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2002). We now acknowledge and cite these earlier findings now in the revised manuscript.</p><p>One of the main functions of inhibition seems indeed to be the control of gain, i.e. an overall shift in the firing rates and less dependence of firing rate on sound intensity. However, various studies showed, that the temporal precision also improves from the ANF to SBC on a single-unit level (Dehmel et al., 2010; Kuenzel et al., 2011; Keine and Rübsamen, 2015). Recent studies analyzing the EPSP size showed, that large EPSPs are better timed than small EPSPs (Kuenzel et al., 2011). Modeling studies showed that an increase in temporal precision can be achieved by a sufficiently large number of converging inputs (Rothman et al., 1993; Kuenzel et al., 2015) and such non-endbulb inputs have been reported in the rat VCN (Gómez-Nieto and Rubio, 2009). A recent modeling study showed that inhibition in combination with excitatory inputs at the dendrites could increase the temporal precision, but inhibition alone cannot (Kuenzel et al., 2015). Additionally, as documented by Nerlich et al. 2014 (and already mentioned above) the inhibitory inputs are rather slow, thus not suited to act on a spike-to-spike basis.</p><p>To answer the question of the reviewer, we tested if the increase in vector strength, temporal precision, reproducibility and reproduction can be achieved by different mechanisms of inhibitory action. First, we simulated a pure divisive effect of inhibition, i.e. a random loss in output spikes. For that we used the input spike times of our recordings and pseudorandomly removed spike times to match the failure fractions observed in our recordings. The simulated SBC output then reflects a pure (divisive) scaling of the ANF input with failure rates identical to the experimental data. This simulation showed that a random reduction in postsynaptic firing rates is not sufficient to cause the observed increase in temporal precision and trial-to-trial reproducibility neither for SAM nor SFM stimulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">2</xref>). Next, we simulated a purely subtractive effect of inhibition by removing a fixed number of output spikes per bin, again matched to the experimentally observed failure rates. This results in an overall shift of the histogram, without affecting the gain of the response. We observed an increase in vector strength, modulation depth, reproducibility and sparsity for both the SAM and SFM stimulation. Notably, the simulated increase during SAM stimulation even exceeded the experimental data, while during SFM stimulation, the simulated subtractive inhibitory effect matched the data well.</p><p>Finally, we applied the same simulations to the data obtained during RGS stimulation. Again, we find that purely divisive inhibition cannot explain the increase in sparsity, reproducibility and temporal precision, while pure subtractive inhibition matches the data well. The simulation of purely subtractive inhibition shows a larger improvement in sparsity and reproducibility than observed in the data.</p><p>We conclude that the subtractive shift in SBC output rates compared to the ANF input can explain the increase in most metrics. A subtractive effect on the firing rates has been associated with hyperpolarizing inhibition with slow temporal dynamics (Doiron et al., 2001), consistent with previous slice recordings in SBCs (Nerlich et al., 2014). However, we also observed a reduced response gain of the SBC output, which is generally attributed to shunting inhibition (Rose, 1977; Koch and Poggio, 1992). Previous studies showed that both types of inhibition might be present at the SBC synapse and our data suggest that these two mechanisms result in a two-fold effect of increased temporal precision and reduced sound level dependence. While during SFM stimulation with constant stimulus level, the simulated subtractive inhibition matches the observed data well, during SAM stimulation, the simulated subtractive inhibition overestimates the effect on the SBC output. This might be caused by the inherent changes in stimulus level and the additional effect of inhibition on response gain in the experimental data.</p><p>Regarding the temporal dynamics of inhibition: Considering the slow dynamics of inhibitory currents, the temporal relation between inhibition and excitation might play only a minor role. It seems conceivable that the slow inhibitory currents will summate during acoustic stimulation, resulting in a functionally tonic inhibitory conductance (Nerlich et al., 2014; Kuenzel et al., 2015). However, it has been shown, that well-timed EPSPs are more likely to generate an SBC output than poorly timed EPSPs. Also, experimental data provided evidence that indeed the EPSP size, and – depending on this – the probability of SBC AP generation, does partially depend on the timing of the event (Keine and Rübsamen, 2015; Kuenzel et al., 2015), and it has been suggested that non-endbulb excitatory SBC inputs might facilitate AP generation of well-timed endbulb EPSPs (Ryugo and Sento, 1991; Gómez-Nieto and Rubio, 2009). The degree of non-endbulb excitatory inputs converging on SBCs and their activation pattern during acoustic stimulation remains to be investigated to draw conclusions of their importance of signal processing.</p><p><italic>11) FM data period histograms. The FM stimuli appear to yield 2 or 3 peaks in the representative example of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Multi-peaked firing can undermine the utility of the standard VS calculation. That is, each peak may be very tight and repeatable, but by having more than one, the VS decreases.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that using VS for distributions with multiple peaks does not provide a sufficient measure of the temporal precision or reproducibility of the neuronal response. We included the VS for SFM stimuli to use a traditional, standardized measure for comparison with the SAM data and previous publications. We complemented VS with other measures of modulation depth (which for example deals well with multiple peaks), reproducibility and CorrNorm to provide a more comprehensive description of the temporal response properties. Also, the main focus of this analysis targeted a direct comparison of ANF input and SBC output rather than changes across modulation frequencies.</p><p>However, to inform the reader about the potential problems in VS interpretation for the observed phase histograms, we added a paragraph at the Results section which reads:</p><p>“It has to be considered that the interpretation of VS values is difficult when the phase histogram of the neuronal response shows multiple peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We, therefore, used a set of additional measures to describe the neuronal response to SFM stimuli when comparing ANF input and SBC output.“</p><p><italic>12) STRF analysis: This analysis is very nice, but some clarification would be helpful.a) Why is the inhibitory STRF calculated by subtracting the ANF and SBC plots? Please explain how and why firing rates are normalized by the standard deviation. Is it normalized by subtraction or division? What if this normalization is not done? Please add a scale bar to these plots. Can this analysis be done instead by using only the EPSP(fail) for the kernel estimation? How would this approach differ from the subtraction approach?b) The size of the excitatory region is described as sharper in the SBC compared to ANF. This is not obvious in the example. Can the spectral width be indicated on the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> somehow? Is there a similar effect in the tuning curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>? It is not clear how sound level influences the STRF. Would that affect this width measurement?</italic> </p><p>We are happy to provide the information the reviewer asked for. We realize that some necessary information was missing in the original manuscript which happened by trying to keep the text succinct.</p><p>Strictly speaking, we computed the difference STRF by subtracting the STRFs of ANF from the STRF of the SBC. Basically, this difference STRF could have positive and negative parts, but – in the recorded datasets – was dominated by negative parts, i.e. indicative of a reduction in response, which could be described as 'inhibitory STRF' (i.e. wherever the SBC STRF is smaller than the ANF STRF, some spikes were missing, and this could be due to inhibition), although not all missing spikes needed to be an indication for inhibition. We therefore (as far as we know) do not refer to it as &quot;inhibitory STRF&quot;, but more generally as difference-STRF.</p><p>For us, the normalization seems to be an appropriate procedure, since otherwise, the change in gain (i.e. overall firing rate which in part was also due to unspecific failures of spike transmission) dominates the change in shape of the STRF. We originally computed it on non-normalized STRFs, which leads to a similar result after the excitatory peak. However, one obtains a dominating, large peak at BF x Best Latency, which visually masks the changes thereafter. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 4</xref> documents the observed difference without normalization. The units of the STRF are Hz/dB SPL, as they map from the dB scaled spectrogram to firing rate.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19295.027</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19295.027">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19295.027</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19295-resp-fig4-v2"/></fig></p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we added color scale bars to two of the plots in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> (top two plots are on the same scale, normalization is performed according to the standard deviation of the STRF, and then commonly normalized to peak close to 1).</p><p>The difference STRF could also be computed using the EPSPfail, which would mathematically be equivalent (if the appropriate weighting is included) to the difference without normalization. We chose to perform it as the difference since it offers the possibility to normalize (essentially to focus on the shape, rather than overall rate) in between the responses, and we can visualize each of the STRFs in comparison.</p><p>Regarding spectral width: Indeed, the spectral half-width is only slightly reduced, and this is not the case not in all units. We now indicate the spectral half-width in the example cell visually, demonstrating that the unit shown is a representative example (see also subpanel E).</p><p>The potential influence of sound level on the shape of the units’ response areas is an interesting suggestion: It would be interesting to test the level dependence of ANF and SBC output separately with the prediction that output shape would be more constant than input shape. Given the inhibitory influence, this could hold up to high sound levels, but may deteriorate at low sound levels.</p><p>In previous studies in the MNTB (Englitz et al., 2010), we experimented with different choices of sound level, essentially finding similar results as (Rabinowitz et al., 2011) in the auditory cortex (testing for sound contrast processing), namely that the shape of the STRF is mostly invariant, but that the scaling (e.g. via an output nonlinearity) is changed. Therefore, it could also be that changes in gain would be hidden in the STRF structure. But, at this point, this is speculation since in our stimuli overall loudness was not modulated. A consideration of possible sound level influence has been added to the Discussion.</p><p>The computational aspects regarding the benefit of normalization are now explained in more detail in the Methods section, right where the STRF is introduced, and furthermore are also briefly mentioned in the Results section (with reference to the Methods).</p><p><italic>13) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: This is a very important figure, because it addresses how inhibition influences the information carried by SBCs compared to ANFs. It would be very helpful if the authors could take a stab at explaining how inhibition may enhance sparsity, reproduction, and temporal dispersion. In the case of sparsity, it seems like it cannot be simply a change in the mean firing rate, because kurtosis should not include that (unless there are weird effects of rectification at firing rate of 0).</italic></p><p>Thank you for encouraging us to address this topic directly: since reviewer point #10 asked a similar question, we partially have dealt with the mechanism above.</p><p>We think that the main effect of inhibition is a general shift of the response rates closer to quiescence (due to combined divisive/subtractive effects). This shift is triggered by sound evoked glycinergic input, which covaries with excitation, but arrives slightly delayed (~3ms, Keine and Rübsamen, 2015)<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://f1000.com/work/citation?ids=1980015">http://f1000.com/work/citation?ids=1980015</ext-link>. It prevents ANF inputs from evoking SBC output spikes, a mechanism especially affecting poorly timed endbulb inputs (Kuenzel et al., 2011, 2015; Keine and Rübsamen, 2015). As a consequence, sparsity increases, as in many cases mainly the previously high peaks in firing rate remain, whereas a bulk of PSTH bins is shifted to low or zero firing rate bins. As indicated by the reviewer, this will lead kurtosis to increase, as well as the other two measures of sparsity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> for a comparison of sparsity).</p><p>More generally, we think that the subtractive part of the glycinergic inhibition, in combination with the well-timed, high firing rate events, can explain the improvement of sparsity, reproducibility and temporal precision. We tested this hypothesis by simulating the effects of simple divisive (remove fixed fraction of spikes – relative to the firing rate – from a time bin in a spiketrain) and subtractive (remove fixed number of spikes from each time bin in a spiketrain) inhibition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The removal of events was matched to the experimentally observed failure fractions. It appears the subtractive part of the inhibition can achieve these improvements, whereas the divisive part leaves them unchanged. On the other hand, the divisive part, together with the co-tuning of excitation and inhibition may preserve the SBC’s ability to respond in a limited range of firing rates (Figure 3Biii/D). It should be noted that the simulated subtractive inhibition resulted in greater improvements than observed in the experimental data, additionally supporting a combined subtractive/divisive inhibitory action. A further, theoretical exploration of this combination appears beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>From the literature it appears that the effect of glycinergic inhibition is not clearly subtractive or divisive (Kuenzel et al., 2011, 2015; Nerlich et al., 2014). Hence, both a general increase in membrane permeability (leading to divisive firing rate effects) as well as shifts of membrane potential by hyperpolarization (during a phase of depolarization, leading to subtractive effects on the firing rate level) seem to shape the SBC output (see Ayaz and Chance (2009) for more details). Subtractive and divisive inhibition have been shown to differently affect the neuron’s output and tuning properties. While sole subtractive inhibition can sharpen the tuning and shifts the stimulus-response function without altering the gain, divisive inhibition preserves the tuning and influences the response gain (Wilson et al., 2012).</p><p>We think that such a – potentially temporally unspecific – effect is nonetheless compatible with an increase in temporal precision, if the high peaks of the ANF firing rate are linked to specific acoustic events. In the cross-correlations underlying the computations of reproducibility and temporal precision, a removal of the bulk of spikes, and a focus on the peak rates, would lead to higher, tighter correlations. These precisely timed spikes are then preserved and transmitted to the MSO (see #1 for more detail). Assuming that the same occurs at the other AVCN, this would hence lead to a sharpening of interaural temporal correlation.</p><p>These arguments were added to the Discussion of the revised manuscript as a new paragraph “Inhibitory mechanism for improving sparsity and reproducibility of the neural response”</p></body></sub-article></article>
