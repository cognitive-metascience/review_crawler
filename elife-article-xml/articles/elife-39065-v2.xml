Here, we investigate how the actomyosin scaffold protein anillin contributes to epithelial mechanics in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryos. Increased mechanosensitive recruitment of vinculin to cell–cell junctions when anillin is overexpressed suggested that anillin promotes junctional tension. However, junctional laser ablation unexpectedly showed that junctions recoil faster when anillin is depleted and slower when anillin is overexpressed. Unifying these findings, we demonstrate that anillin regulates medial-apical actomyosin. Medial-apical laser ablation supports the conclusion that that tensile forces are stored across the apical surface of epithelial cells, and anillin promotes the tensile forces stored in this network. Finally, we show that anillin’s effects on cellular mechanics impact tissue-wide mechanics. These results reveal anillin as a key regulator of epithelial mechanics and lay the groundwork for future studies on how anillin may contribute to mechanical events in development and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>anillin</kwd><kwd>epithelium</kwd><kwd>laser ablation</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>tissue mechanics</kwd><kwd>contractility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arnold</surname><given-names>Torey R</given-names></name><name><surname>Stephenson</surname><given-names>Rachel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006801</institution-id><institution>Rackham Graduate School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rackham Merit Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arnold</surname><given-names>Torey R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Biomechanics in Regenerative Medicine Training Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shawky</surname><given-names>Joseph H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000997</institution-id><institution>Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Beckman Scholars Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dinshaw</surname><given-names>Kayla M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Higashi</surname><given-names>Tomohito</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HD04475</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>Lance A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R56 HL134195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>Lance A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM112794</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Ann L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In epithelial cells, anillin organizes the medial-apical actomyosin cortex into a contractile load-bearing structure and increases tissue-level stiffness.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During development, an organism takes its shape by generating forces and establishing mechanical properties at the cellular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davidson, 2012</xref>). Forces produced by the contractile actomyosin cytoskeleton within cells are transmitted between cells and through the tissue via cell–cell junctions. By coordinating which cells are contracting, elongating, or rearranging, tissues can bend, fold, or elongate allowing for the complex tissue organization found in many multicellular organisms. Understanding how cell-scale mechanical inputs result in tissue-scale changes requires a comprehensive knowledge of the proteins involved in controlling cellular mechanics.</p><p>Anillin is a scaffolding protein that was first characterized for its role in cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Field and Alberts, 1995</xref>) and has since been shown to regulate cytokinesis in organisms ranging from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Piekny and Maddox, 2010</xref>). Anillin localizes to the actomyosin contractile ring during cytokinesis and primarily to the nucleus during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Field and Alberts, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oegema et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Avino, 2009</xref>). During cytokinesis, anillin anchors the contractile ring to the plasma membrane by binding to actomyosin through its N-terminal myosin- and F-actin-binding domains and to lipids through its C-terminal C2 and PH domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Straight et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piekny and Glotzer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Anillin can both enhance and limit contractility during cytokinesis through binding directly to active RhoA as well as several proteins that positively or negatively regulate Rho, and by crosslinking F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piekny and Glotzer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frenette et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manukyan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Descovich et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Recently, novel roles for anillin in regulating epithelial cell–cell junctions have been reported. Our group showed that anillin is localized to cell–cell junctions in frog embryos where it regulates cell–cell junction integrity, as both tight junctions and adherens junctions were disrupted when anillin was knocked down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, we showed that anillin scaffolds the contractile actomyosin machinery connected to epithelial cell–cell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>). Proteomic studies supported anillin’s association with cadherin-mediated adhesions in fly and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toret et al., 2014</xref>). Studies in human epithelial cells confirmed and expanded our understanding of anillin’s function at cell–cell junctions. Anillin knockdown in cultured human epithelial cells resulted in junction disassembly and disorganized junctional F-actin and myosin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). A recent study reported that myosin II anchors anillin to the apical cell cortex, and cycles of binding and unbinding to anillin stabilize active RhoA by increasing its cortical residence time, thus promoting junctional actomyosin contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Budnar et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, in vivo studies in zebrafish demonstrated that barrier function in the kidney, which is mediated by tight junctions, was compromised by a mutation in anillin that causes Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis, a leading cause of kidney failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gbadegesin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite these emerging roles for anillin in regulating actomyosin-mediated cell–cell junction contractility, very little is known about how anillin contributes to the mechanical properties of epithelial tissues in development and disease. Notably, anillin is expressed during developmental events that are controlled by mechanical inputs from cells and tissues, including gastrulation and neurulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Session et al., 2016</xref>). Anillin is also overexpressed in multiple human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 2005</xref>). Increased tissue stiffness is frequently observed during tumorigenesis; tumor growth and metastases are sensitive to mechanical cues, which can significantly affect cancer prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kumar and Weaver, 2009</xref>). Changes in mechanical properties can be mediated by changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix as well as changes in the organization of the intracellular cytoskeleton. Although there is little research on how anillin may contribute to the mechanical properties of cancer cells, it is becoming clear that anillin’s function extends beyond cytokinesis. Anillin resides not only in the nucleus of interphase cancer cells, but also in the cytoplasm, and anillin expression can have either positive or negative outcomes for patients depending on the cancer type and anillin’s subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suzuki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ronkainen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Magnusson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Idichi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Based on anillin’s demonstrated role in regulating cell–cell junction contractility and potential involvement in regulating development and disease, we sought to investigate whether anillin affects epithelial cell and tissue mechanics. We used the animal cap epithelium of developing <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryos as a model vertebrate epithelial tissue. Using a combination of techniques including live imaging, laser ablation, and tissue stiffness measurements, we identified a new role for anillin in organizing F-actin and myosin II at the medial-apical surface of epithelial cells. We show that anillin promotes a contractile medial-apical actomyosin network, which produces tensile forces in individual cells that are transmitted between cells via cell–cell junctions to promote tissue stiffness.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Anillin increases junctional vinculin recruitment but reduces recoil of junction vertices after laser ablation</title><p>Since anillin can both promote and limit contractility at the cytokinetic contractile ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piekny and Glotzer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manukyan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Descovich et al., 2018</xref>), and anillin localizes to cell–cell junctions where it maintains F-actin, myosin II, and proper active RhoA distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>), we sought to test whether anillin affects junctional tension. As a readout of relative tension on junctions, we quantified the junctional accumulation of Vinculin-mNeon. High junctional tension induces a conformational change in α-catenin, which recruits vinculin to adherens junctions to reinforce the connection to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yonemura et al., 2010</xref>). We have previously vetted a tagged vinculin probe in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> and used it to show that the cytokinetic contractile ring applies increased tension locally on adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Higashi et al., 2016</xref>). To test how anillin affects junctional vinculin recruitment, we knocked down anillin with a previously characterized morpholino oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>) or overexpressed a tagged version of anillin (Anillin-3xmCherry). In control embryos, Vinculin-mNeon accumulated weakly along bicellular junctions and strongly at tricellular contacts, which are sites of higher tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Higashi and Miller, 2017</xref>). When anillin was knocked down, the intensity of Vinculin-mNeon was reduced at junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We also examined mCherry-α-catenin intensity because vinculin intensity could vary based on the amount of its binding partner α-catenin available at junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). When anillin was knocked down, mCherry-α-catenin was strongly reduced at junctions; therefore, the reduced Vinculin-mNeon intensity may not indicate reduced tension because α-catenin is also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Notably, when anillin was overexpressed, the intensity of Vinculin-mNeon at junctions was significantly elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), and the intensity of mCherry-α-catenin was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>), indicating that the increased Vinculin-mNeon recruitment was due to a tension-induced conformation change in α-catenin.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39065.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Anillin increases junctional vinculin recruitment but reduces recoil of junction vertices after laser ablation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images of live epithelial cells in gastrula-stage <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryos expressing a probe for the plasma membrane (2x membrane localization signal of Src family tyrosine kinase Lyn tagged with TagBFP at its C-terminus) and inculin-mNeon when anillin is knocked down (KD) or overexpressed (OE).

When anillin was knocked down, cells became less polygonal and more rounded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), a hallmark of reduced tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yonemura et al., 2010</xref>). This is consistent with our previous report that anillin knockdown leads to effects associated with reduced tension including cell rounding, apical doming, and loss of F-actin and myosin II from junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, when anillin was overexpressed, junctions exhibited a wavy, distorted shape compared to more linear control junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, wavy junctions can indicate either unbalanced high tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tokuda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nowotarski and Peifer, 2014</xref>) or uniform low tension along the junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nowotarski and Peifer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>As a complementary approach to test whether anillin promotes junctional tension, we measured junction recoil after laser ablation. The amount of junction recoil (measured as the distance between cell vertices over time) is reported to correlate with the relative junctional tension such that a junction under high tension will exhibit enhanced recoil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farhadifar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</xref>). We used a 2-photon laser to ablate a local site in the center of a bicellular junction in embryos expressing E-cadherin-3xGFP. To avoid potential contributions of junction length to recoil, junctions of a similar length were selected for ablation in control, anillin knockdown, and anillin overexpressing embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). After laser ablation, control junctions recoiled 2.8 ± 0.2 µm after 18 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Based on our hypothesis that anillin promotes junctional tension, we expected to see reduced junction recoil when anillin was knocked down; however, recoil increased to 4.1 ± 0.4 µm after 18 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

Although the vinculin recruitment and laser ablation results initially seemed to be at odds with one another, an interesting phenotype emerged from the laser ablation data when we observed the Anillin-3xmCherry channel in anillin overexpression embryos, as anillin highlights the apical surface of the cells as well as the cell–cell junctions.

In cells induced to apically constrict by Shroom3 overexpression, anillin accumulated across the apical surface of the cell, first near junctions then emanating towards the center of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Taken together, these data support the idea that anillin is required to establish a contractile medial-apical network that can coordinate whole-embryo contraction. When anillin is depleted, this network is not able to properly contract, disrupting cellular and embryo-wide contraction, and when anillin is overexpressed, large bundles of actomyosin enhance whole-embryo contraction. It is possible that anillin also affects the assembly rate and the physical properties of this actomyosin network, which we test later in the manuscript.</p><p>Our results indicate that anillin not only regulates junctional actomyosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>), but also organizes a medial-apical contractile actomyosin network that, when mechanically integrated across cells in an epithelial tissue (here the <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal cap epithelium), can affect tissue-level contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Based on our data, we speculate that anillin can regulate the orientation of tensile forces applied on cell–cell junctions as shown in the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. This model reconciles our initially surprising results that knocking down anillin leads to <italic>decreased</italic> junctional vinculin recruitment but <italic>increased</italic> recoil after laser ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). We propose that anillin knock down weakens medial-apical actomyosin to the point where it is no longer a contractile network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This results in decreased pulling forces perpendicular to junctions, allowing the parallel forces generated by junctional actomyosin to dominate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, overexpressing anillin results in increased medial-apical actomyosin and reorganizes the actin into thick contractile bundles that connect perpendicular to the junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), making perpendicular forces on junctions dominant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This working model is consistent with our data showing that when anillin is overexpressed, vinculin recruitment to junctions is increased; following junction laser ablation, vertex separation is reduced; and following medial-apical laser ablation, apical expansion is increased. Thus, our model suggests that the level of anillin expression regulates whether junctional or medial-apical actomyosin is the primary load-bearing structure on the apical surface of epithelial cells.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39065.020</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Anillin organizes medial-apical actomyosin and regulates the orientation of tensile forces applied on junctions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the apical surface of epithelial cells showing junctional and medial-apical F-actin and anillin in control embryos or when levels of anillin are perturbed. When anillin is knocked down, medial-apical F-actin is strongly reduced, and when anillin is overexpressed, medial-apical F-actin is reorganized into thick bundles decorated with myosin II that span the apical surface.

Overexpression of ΔRBD, ΔC2, and ΔPH did not result in structuring of medial-apical F-actin into long or short bundles, appearing similar to the negative control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,H</xref>). It should be noted that the ability of anillin mutants to bundle F-actin may depend on their localization to the medial-apical surface. If ΔC2 and ΔPH localized to the medial-apical surface at similar levels to Anillin FL, it is possible that they might be able to bundle F-actin. Together, these results indicate that anillin’s F-actin-binding and Rho-binding domains are necessary for structuring medial-apical F-actin into long bundles that span the apical surface, and anillin’s medial-apical localization is facilitated by actomyosin binding with possible contributions from binding to the plasma membrane, regulators of RhoA, or Septins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Anillin regulates epithelial cell mechanics by stabilizing medial-apical F-actin</title><p>Our findings demonstrated that anillin’s actin-binding function is necessary to reorganize medial-apical F-actin, and previous work has shown that anillin stabilizes F-actin by preventing Cofilin severing of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tian et al., 2015</xref>). This led us to ask whether anillin stabilizes medial-apical F-actin, and if actin stabilization contributes to changes in epithelial cell mechanics. To test whether anillin stabilizes F-actin, we used Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) of Actin-mNeon in controls cells and in cells overexpressing anillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). After photobleaching in control cells, Actin-mNeon recovered to 77 ± 2%, whereas in cells overexpressing anillin, Actin-mNeon recovered to 57 ± 4% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>), indicating that anillin stabilizes actin filaments. We found that anillin requires its actin-binding domain to stabilize medial-apical F-actin; when the Anillin Δact mutant was overexpressed, F-actin recovered to a similar level as controls, 78 ± 4%. We performed FRAP of Actin-mNeon when anillin was knocked down, but because anillin knockdown drastically reduces medial-apical F-actin, we had to inject excessive amounts of Actin-mNeon mRNA in order to even visualize medial-apical F-actin. This high level of Actin-mNeon led to abnormal cell and embryo morphology in control and anillin overexpression embryos. In anillin knockdown cells, the overexpressed Actin-mNeon recovered to 96 ± 8%; however, these data cannot be directly compared with control and anillin overexpression data because of the differing levels of Actin-mNeon expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39065.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Anillin regulates epithelial cell mechanics by stabilizing medial-apical F-actin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Single plane confocal images of live epithelial cells from gastrula-stage <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryos expressing actin tagged with mNeon (Actin-mNeon) in control, anillin overexpressing (OE), or Anillin Δactin-binding domain OE embryos. White dashed circle shows the medial-apical area bleached in the zoomed view montages on the right.

Similar to our results in the gastrula-stage animal cap epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,E</xref>), regions of the dorsal isolates where anillin was knocked down showed a marked reduction in junctional and medial-apical F-actin compared with internal control regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

With this diverse set of interactions, it is not surprising that anillin functions in a range of cellular processes across the tree of life. It is required for cytokinesis in many organisms, from yeast to vertebrates, promotes cellularization in fly embryos, maintains bridges between germ cells in worms, and regulates migration in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Field and Alberts, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Piekny and Maddox, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, anillin has an emerging role in regulating cell–cell junctions and promoting proper tissue barriers through maintaining the contractile actomyosin network connected to cell–cell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gbadegesin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Budnar et al., 2018</xref>).

Generally, junctional laser ablation is thought to measure the amount of line tension or tension in the direction parallel to the edge of a cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rauzi and Lenne, 2015</xref>). However, there is also evidence that the medial-apical actin network can serve as a load-bearing structure within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our junctional laser ablation experiments produced unexpected results with respect to the prevalent line tension paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) and led us to characterize a new function for anillin in organizing contractile medial-apical actomyosin structures. Junctional laser ablation indicated that anillin knockdown cells exhibited increased recoil, whereas anillin overexpressing cells exhibited reduced recoil compared with controls. These results were unexpected because all other evidence (vinculin recruitment) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), F-actin and myosin II junctional intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>), cell shape changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>), suggested that junctional tension was reduced when anillin was knocked down and increased when anillin was overexpressed. If we had performed either the vinculin recruitment or junctional laser ablation experiments in isolation, opposite conclusions would have been drawn about how the anillin expression level affects junctional tension. A weakness of these tension probing techniques is that they do not easily reveal the direction of forces acting on the junction. For example, if a junction recoils slowly parallel to the junction after laser ablation, is this because there is less parallel tension, more perpendicular tension, or other mechanical changes? By performing medial-apical laser ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–G</xref>), we were able to show that anillin promotes a medial-apical actomyosin network that produces tensile force and stores contractile energy that acts perpendicular to cell–cell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).</p><p>Through FRAP studies, we found that anillin stabilizes medial-apical F-actin, which may be important for establishing this network as a load-bearing structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). By stabilizing F-actin with jasplakinolide, we found that junction recoil was dramatically decreased, similar to the effect with anillin overexpression, indicating that cellular mechanics are also regulated by the physical properties of the F-actin network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) in addition to the contractile forces generated by the network.</p><p>Finally, we showed that anillin promotes tissue-wide stiffness, and this likely contributes to the changes we observe in cellular mechanics, as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). When anillin was knocked down, the stiffness of <italic>Xenopus</italic> dorsal isolates was reduced, or put in other terms, the tissue compliance was increased. While there is little direct evidence about how tissue compliance affects laser ablation results, it is easy to conceive how two junctions under the same tension - one in a compliant tissue vs. one in a non-compliant tissue - would recoil at different velocities. A recent study found that cell boundary stiffness was locally increased by unidirectional actomyosin-generated tension, and when ablated parallel to this axis, the tissue displayed high recoil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chanet et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, when actomyosin-generated contractility was omnidirectional, cell boundary stiffness increased evenly around the cell boundary, and when ablated, the tissue displayed reduced recoil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chanet et al., 2017</xref>). While changes in the axis of actomyosin contractility certainly contribute to the changes in junction recoil, the changes in boundary stiffness may also play an essential role. In the future, it would be interesting to make more robust stiffness measurements at the apical surface using techniques such as atomic force microscopy or micro-aspiration. Our results emphasize the emerging point that studies using laser ablation or other methods of measuring junctional tension should consider potential contributions of perpendicular tensile forces generated by the medial-apical actomyosin network, the stability of F-actin filaments, and the compliance of the junction and surrounding tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Anillin regulates apical contractility in epithelia</title><p>Combining our previous study, which showed that anillin maintains F-actin, myosin II, and proper RhoA activity at cell–cell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>), with this study, which shows that anillin promotes a contractile medial-apical network, positions anillin as a key regulator of contractility at the apical surface of epithelial cells. The medial-apical population of actomyosin has previously been characterized, particularly in flies, and is critical for constricting the apical surface of epithelial cells to drive tissue bending during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dawes-Hoang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Plageman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin and Goldstein, 2014</xref>). Our results suggest that the level of anillin expression may modulate redistribution of cellular load-bearing structures from junctional/circumferential when anillin is expressed at a low level to cortex-spanning/medial-apical when anillin is expressed at a high level. This shift parallels one seen during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development over the course of germ band elongation. Initially, tissue tension is transmitted primarily through junctional structures, but by the end of germ band elongation, it is carried by cortex-spanning structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2009</xref>). Additional work will be necessary to distinguish the functions of anillin-organized contractility at junctional and medial-apical contractile arrays.</p><p>Anillin’s role in regulating medial-apical contractility may function to prevent junction disassembly by generating forces perpendicular to the junction. myosin II-generated tension applied on adherens junctions can prevent junction disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weng and Wieschaus, 2016</xref>). Here, we showed that anillin-organized medial-apical contractility produces perpendicular tension on adherens junctions. This raises the possibility that protective tensile forces organized by medial-apical anillin are lost when anillin is knocked down, which could lead to the compromised junctions we have previously reported in anillin knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our findings establish anillin as a candidate protein that may be involved in developmental events that require apical constriction including gastrulation and neurulation. Anillin’s potential role in development is supported by the fact that many of anillin’s interacting proteins - including active RhoA, the formin Diaphanous, F-actin, and myosin II - also localize to the medial-apical actomyosin network and are required for apical constriction events during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mason et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin and Goldstein, 2014</xref>). Of note, when Shroom3, which is known to induce apical construction during neurulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haigo et al., 2003</xref>), was overexpressed, anillin strongly accumulated across the medial-apical surface as apical constriction proceeded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In the future, it will be interesting to directly test whether anillin plays a role in driving apical constriction during gastrulation and/or neurulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Does anillin regulate tissue stiffness in development and disease?</title><p>Our data demonstrating that anillin promotes tissue stiffness is intriguing because tissue stiffness can affect tissue folding during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>) as well as cell migration during development and in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barriga et al., 2018</xref>). Although we cannot confirm whether reduction in tissue stiffness after anillin knockdown is directly related to loss of medial-apical anillin vs. contributions from loss of junctional anillin, failed cell division events, or the changes in other tissue layers, the idea that anillin is regulating tissue stiffness by organizing actomyosin contractility at one or more of these sites is supported by previous work. For example, tissue stiffness increases during <italic>Xenopus</italic> development, and this is dependent on F-actin and myosin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, the ~35% reduction in stiffness we observed after anillin knockdown is in line with the ~50% reduction in stiffness observed after acute drug treatments that disrupt F-actin or myosin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, a recent study directly connected medial-apical contractility with promoting tissue stiffness, and found that the direction of contractility promoted oriented tissue stiffness, which in turn drove proper tissue invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chanet et al., 2017</xref>). Future studies should investigate whether anillin impacts developmental events that require tissue stiffening.</p><p>Our findings may also provide insight into the role anillin plays in cancer progression. To date, studies examining anillin’s role in tumor progression and survival outcome have produced conflicting evidence. Most studies have found that anillin is overexpressed in diverse tumors, and its expression correlates with cancer progression and poor survival rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suzuki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Idichi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). However, work examining the subcellular localization of anillin found that <italic>nuclear</italic> localization of anillin correlates with poor survival rates, whereas <italic>cytoplasmic</italic> localization of anillin is a marker of favorable prognosis, suggesting that anillin’s localization rather than its expression level is key (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ronkainen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liang et al., 2015</xref>). Our finding that anillin increases tissue stiffness may help explain anillin’s role in tumor progression. It is well known that tumors increase in stiffness over time due to increased extracellular collagen, and this stiffening promotes tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang et al., 2014</xref>); however, measurements of the stiffness of individual cancer cells revealed that cells become less stiff as they become metastatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Swaminathan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2014a</xref>). Considering our results in this context, we speculate that <italic>cytoplasmic</italic> anillin could help protect against cancer progression, as anillin stiffens the cells and the tissue by reorganizing actomyosin, preventing cells from entering a migratory metastatic state. Our previous work showing that anillin is important for maintaining normal cell–cell adhesion could also play a role in preventing cancer cell invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results reveal that by structuring medial-apical actomyosin, anillin helps orchestrate apical contractility in epithelial cells, affects the orientation of tensile forces applied on junctions, and promotes tissue stiffness.

Future work is required to tease apart the contributions and interplay among anillin’s versatile roles in cytokinesis, cell–cell adhesion, and medial-apical actomyosin regulation and how they culminate to promote a functional epithelium.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> <break/>(<italic>Female</italic>)<italic>, Oocyte</italic> <break/> <italic>positive,</italic> Pigmented)</td><td><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic></td><td>Nasco</td><td>Cat #: LM00531</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> <break/>(<italic>Female</italic>)<italic>, Oocyte</italic> <break/> <italic>positive,</italic> Albino)</td><td><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic></td><td>Nasco</td><td>Cat #: LM00531(A)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Xenopus</italic> <break/><italic>laevis</italic> (<italic>Male</italic>), <break/>Mature <break/>7.5–9 cm, <break/>Pigmented)</td><td><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic></td><td>Nasco</td><td>Cat #: LM00715</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Anillin <break/>morpholino <break/>oligonucleotide)</td><td>Anillin MO</td><td>Gene Tools;

In brief, the tissue sample is compressed along its anterior-posterior axis, while the resistive force is measured by the deflection of an optical fiber force transducer.

Vinculin and α-catenin intensities were normalized by dividing by the membrane probe (mem-BFP) intensity. For perpendicular vs. parallel actin fiber experiments, Lifeact-RFP was expressed to visualize actin. Two junctions were chosen for each image by looking at the Lifeact-RFP channel for bundles of F-actin associated with junctions in the two orientations. Vinculin and membrane intensities were then measured as above.</p><p>Vertex recoil after laser ablation: In Fiji, a straight line was drawn between the vertices to measure the amount of separation over time.</p><p>Percentage of cells that separate perpendicularly: Cells that displayed junctional splaying of E-cadherin-3xGFP were marked as exhibiting perpendicular separation. Each data set was qualitatively examined three times for this phenotype, and the percentages were averaged.</p><p>F-actin and myosin II intensity: In Fiji, a circular ROI with a diameter of 10 µm placed in the center of the cell was used to measure medial-apical intensity. For fixed phalloidin staining of F-actin, the raw intensity values were used. For live imaging of myosin II with SF9-mNeon, the intensity was normalized by dividing by the membrane probe intensity.</p><p>Medial-apical recoil after laser ablation: In Fiji, a straight line was drawn spanning the junction-junction distance perpendicular or parallel to the cut site to measure the amount of apical expansion over time.</p><p>Strain mapping: Deformations of cells were detected by adapting an algorithm, which registers two images by deforming one image to match the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sorzano et al., 2005</xref>). Single-plane confocal images at two time points were aligned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thévenaz et al., 1998</xref>) and analyzed with the bUnwarpJ plug-in for ImageJ. The deformation between the two images is reported as a directionless pixel intensity based on the distance each pixel had to be manipulated in x and y to be realigned to fit the image. For image alignment, the ablation site was masked in Image J, as these areas can have wounding artifacts that are static and impact the strain output. Ablation sites were masked by creating a new slice for the image, selecting the ablated area, setting it the value to 0 (Math, Set), and setting the outer area to 255. Tiff images with masked ablation sites were then processed with bUnwarpJ. Strains (ε<sub>x</sub>, ε<sub>y</sub>, ε<sub>yx</sub>, ε<sub>yx</sub>) were calculated first in the image directions x and y. Principle strains (ε<sub>1</sub> and ε<sub>2</sub>) were calculated to minimize shear strain, and their contribution to strain area (ε<sub>1</sub> + ε<sub>2</sub> + ε<sub>1</sub> ε<sub>2</sub>) was calculated and displayed as a strain map. Strain maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> are images with a Phase LUT applied in ImageJ.</p><p>ATP contraction index: Kymographs were generated in Fiji, and shift of the pigment in each kymograph was measured three times as length by tracing a line across the image: near the top, center, and bottom of the kymograph. These values were averaged, and movement of the whole embryo in the field of view was subtracted from the contraction by tracing the bottom edge of the embryo in the kymograph to obtain the contraction index.</p><p>F-actin intensity after ATP: In Fiji, a circular ROI with a diameter of 10 µm placed in the center of the cell was used to measure medial-apical intensity over time. Change in F-actin intensity was measured by subtracting baseline intensity from peak intensity. Baseline was the average of the 10 time points before ATP, and peak was the average of the 10 time points starting at 45 s after ATP. For near junction vs. center of cell F-actin intensity comparisons, a smaller ROI with a diameter of 3 µm was used to measure F-actin intensity in the center of the cell or near the cell periphery.</p><p>Blinded categorization of medial-apical F-actin organization: Confocal images of the F-actin channel (Lifeact-RFP) when Anillin FL or anillin mutants were overexpressed were exported as JPEGs using ImageJ. File names were then randomly generated using the Random Names program created by Jason Faulkner from How-To-Geek <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://goo.gl/1EcGCa.">https://goo.gl/1EcGCa.</ext-link> Cells that were ~80% or more visible in the field of view were then categorized as: (1) no F-actin fibers, (2) short F-actin fibers that do not span the apical surface, or (3) long F-actin fibers that span the surface. Each cell could only be placed into one category, so if for example a cell contained both short and long fibers it would go into the long fiber category. Categorization was done by three different blinded individuals, and their categorizations were averaged to produce the final graph.</p><p>Anillin medial-apical intensity: A circular ROI with a diameter of 10 µm was placed in the center of the cell, and average intensity was collected for Anillin FL or anillin mutant constructs tagged with 3xGFP.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Anillin regulates epithelial cell mechanics by structuring the medial-apical actomyosin network&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Alpha Yap (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This interesting manuscript addresses the issue of how acto-myosin regulation influences tissue mechanics. Using the early <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo, the authors show that anillin supports a medial-apical actomyosin network in addition to actomyosin at junctions, which they reported earlier (Reyes et al., 2014). The reviewers agreed that your manuscript is polished, complete and clear. They also agreed that most of the conclusions presented by the authors are well-substantiated.</p><p>The major concerns raised by the reviewers relates to the axis of force generated by anillin. The hypothesis of two different axes is possible, but is not really tested. This is for two reasons: a) It assumes that vinculin is responding to a perpendicular force. While this is how we draw the cartoons, that is purely speculative. Most forces will have some perpendicular and shear (parallel) components. b) It depends on interpreting differences in recoil as differences in tension. Recoil will also have a frictional element and thus the apparent contradiction needs to have experiments coupled possibly with mechanical modelling.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers recommended additional experiments and textual changes for your manuscript:</p><p>A) Additional analyses and experiments</p><p>1) As the authors cautiously point out in the first paragraph of the subsection “Anillin increases junctional tension but reduces recoil of junction vertices after laser ablation”, depleting anillin not only reduces vinculin tension-sensor signal but also α-catenin, confounding the conclusions about tension-sensor levels. The authors should present a ratio of tension-sensor signal to α-catenin or total vinculin signal to normalize for junctional integrity/robustness/mass. This will allow them to conclude more confidently whether there is a reduction in tension in this condition, since the lower tension-sensor signal could be due to lower tension-sensor occupancy of junctions following anillin depletion.</p><p>The shape of the recoil curves in Figures 1D and 6F are unusual, exhibiting a delay after cutting. Do individual cut recoils exhibit a rapid increase and gradual plateau? If not, perhaps the unusual shape of these recoil dynamics is a signature of the complex directionality of forces on the junction. A specific question about the unusual recoil kinetics is what happens between 20 and 46 seconds for a junction like the one shown in Figure 6G, which has totally opened (parallel) at 46 seconds, while the population average at 20 seconds in 6F shows only 0.2 microns of parallel recoil?</p><p>2) The phenomenon reported in Figures 1F and 6G of perpendicular junctional dissociation needs to be quantified. Is there any separation in this perpendicular direction in control junctions or those depleted of anillin? These measurements for the population of cut junctions need to be reported. In addition, a control example, with comparable time-course, needs to be shown to accompany abnormal junction response.</p><p>3) The contribution of anillin's various protein interaction domains is implicated by expressing truncation constructs and assessing apical actin network organization. However, as the authors report, many of the anillin truncations are not properly enriched in the apical actin network. Just as low expression level for a truncation construct prohibits the attribution of any failure of that truncation to replace function of full-length, the same is true if the truncation is not present/enriched in the subcellular structure of interest. The authors need to tone down their conclusions of the roles of anillin's various regions in organizing apical actin for constructs that do not normally localize. I would like to see both apical <italic>enrichment</italic> (numbers in 5C and 5G compared to cytoplasmic or other intensity?) and network organization quantified (likely with an open-source image analysis software) so that normalizing for anillin abundance could be attempted/done.</p><p>4) Does anillin contribute differentially to tension/contractility and stiffness in the medial-apical network? Here it might be informative to manipulate the medial-apical region directly, by making laser cuts in the medial apical cortex itself (e.g. Stephan Grill and the 1-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo).</p><p>5) The reviewers wondered: Is the medial-apical network pulsatile? Is pulsatility affected by anillin overexpression (is it dampened)? If possible, measuring any pulses in the network contraction would allow the authors to add this as a part of their model for how anillin works.</p><p>6) Analysis of actin stability in the overexpression of the delta-F-actin mutant should be performed.</p><p>B) Textual changes:</p><p>1) Introduction. The last two paragraphs are a little long and discursive. In particular, the final paragraph rather anticipates the story in too much detail.</p><p>2) Figure 7: morphological defects seen in presomitic mesoderm, notochord and ectoderm in KD – please describe these.</p><p>C) If possible, the reviewers thought that a mechanical model could add to the interpretation of the data. They agreed that some of the experiments above may address these concerns as well. I think that it is very difficult to interpret these results without a mechanical model (or at least I find it very difficult). There are at least 3 levels of complexity that need to be considered. 1) Actomyosin can contribute to tension but also influence viscoelasticity. (Conceivably, a highly cross-linked actomyosin network might be very elastic but not actually generate much tension.) 2) As the authors note (and has been developed in some of e.g. Pierre-Francois Lenne's reviews) recoil is the product of tension divided by friction. It can't always be equated to tension; and this is potentially one of those cases, since the authors data indicate that tissue stiffness is increased. 3) Both the medial-apical and junctional networks may contribute and it is difficult to tease these apart. Looking at their videos, I would consider the possibility that the impact of anillin on the medial-apical network may be principally to increase stiffness in this region of the cell, rather than as a source of tensile force. This could explain the slower recoil of junctions when anillin is overexpressed, because a stiffer medial-apical network limits recoil of the junction. Of course, this implies that the junctions and medial-apical network are physically connected.</p><p>Also the reviewers agreed that this would help the manuscript, the authors thought that if this was not able to be added in the two month time frame, the experiments requested may also address these same concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39065.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The major concerns raised by the reviewers relates to the axis of force generated by anillin.

We agree with the reviewers that the original submission did not fully test whether the effects Anillin has on medial-apical actomyosin increase perpendicular forces exerted on cell-cell junctions. To address this concern, we performed two new experiments.</p><p>First, we examined the orientation and connection of the medial-apical F-actin bundles to junctions for insights into the contractile nature of the actin fibers. We examined junctional Vinculin intensity in cells overexpressing Anillin and compared Vinculin recruitment at junctions with F-actin bundles oriented <italic>perpendicular</italic> or <italic>parallel</italic> to the junction. We found that junctions with <italic>perpendicularly</italic> oriented medial-apical F-actin fibers exhibited higher Vinculin intensity compared to junctions with <italic>parallel</italic> F-actin bundles. This data is now presented in Figure 3A and B.</p><p>Second, we probed the mechanics of the apical surface of cells by making laser cuts in the medial-apical cortex. Epithelial cells store tensile energy through the strain of the elastic material of the cortex. By measuring apical expansion of epithelial cells after medial-apical laser ablation, we found that the tensile energy stored in the medial-apical cortex (indicated by strain released after ablation) increased when Anillin was overexpressed and decreased when Anillin was knocked down. Strain intensity maps (determined by fitting the final ablation time course image to the first image) indicate the strain intensity for each pixel as well as areas of expansion and contraction following laser ablation. Local cellular strain released by ablation was reduced when Anillin was knocked down and increased when Anillin was overexpressed, while tissue-level strains were similar for controls and Anillin overexpression and reduced for Anillin knockdown. This new data presented in Figure 3C-G.</p><p>Together, the Vinculin recruitment and medial-apical laser ablation results indicate that tensile energy is stored across the apical surface of <italic>Xenopus</italic> epithelial cells, and Anillin organizes medial-apical actomyosin into a load-bearing structure. While we do not rule out the possible contributions that stiffness or friction may play in the mechanical properties of this epithelial tissue, we think this combination of experiments supports the conclusion that Anillin modulates the tensile energy stored (and recoil transmitted) across the apical surface of epithelial cells after laser ablation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers recommended additional experiments and textual changes for your manuscript:</p><p>A) Additional analyses and experiments</p><p>1) As the authors cautiously point out in the first paragraph of the subsection “Anillin increases junctional tension but reduces recoil of junction vertices after laser ablation”, depleting anillin not only reduces vinculin tension-sensor signal but also α-catenin, confounding the conclusions about tension-sensor levels.

Ratio and intensity scatter plots are shown below. Previously published data from our lab (Higashi et al., 2016) and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C are also provided for comparison. The Vinculin/α-catenin ratio (see first graph on left) shows a similar range but statistically significant increase for Anillin overexpression compared to controls. However, for Anillin knockdown, the Vinculin/α-catenin ratio is ~7x greater than controls. We believe this is because the normalized (compared to membrane) α-catenin intensity is near zero for many of the intensity measurements, while Vinculin intensity clusters around 0.5 (see graph on right). This results in a very high Vinculin/α-catenin ratio which could be interpreted as 1) dramatically increased tension or 2) reduced tension, where although there is less overall tension being applied to the junction, each remaining α-catenin is under increased load (as there are fewer α-catenins to bear the force), and thus the remaining α-catenins may be maximally saturated with Vinculin. Based on our previous results showing that when tension is increased by the cytokinetic contractile ring, the Vinculin/α-catenin ratio increases about 1.2x as the cleavage furrow ingresses (Higashi et al., 2016), we do not think the abnormally high Vinculin/α-catenin ratio (7x increase) when Anillin is knocked down represents increased tension. Therefore, we decided to present the Vinculin and α-catenin data in two separate graphs in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C so that the reader can appreciate that α-catenin is reduced in Anillin knockdown but unchanged in Anillin overexpression compared with controls. We have also modified the text to make it clear that we can only conclude that these data suggest increased tension when Anillin is overexpressed, but the data are inconclusive about the amount of tension when Anillin is knocked down. If the reviewers think it is necessary, we could include the Vinculin/α-catenin ratio graph or scatter plots as part of Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Ratio of junctional Vinculin to α-catenin when Anillin is perturbed.</title><p>(Left) Ratio of Vinculin to α-catenin.

Do individual cut recoils exhibit a rapid increase and gradual plateau? If not, perhaps the unusual shape of these recoil dynamics is a signature of the complex directionality of forces on the junction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that our recoil graphs look different from other published junction recoil dynamics. One reason for this is, as the reviewers noted, we chose to focus on the early portion of recoil because we found, at least in our system, that this is where the reproducible data about relative tension of the junctions is found. Shortly after 18 s, many of the cells begin to expel their cytoplasmic contents, and shortly after that, the surrounding cells can begin to extrude the ablated cells. Therefore, we chose to focus on the early recoil events that occur just after ablation. Five randomly selected individual recoil examples from each data set are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D. You can appreciate that there are several examples of delayed recoil (one in control, one in knockdown, and in all of the overexpressing examples), while the rest of the junctions recoil instantly. We are not sure what the cause of this delay is, but since the delay is commonly seen in Anillin overexpression, it may result from the complex directionality of the forces acting on the junctions, as the reviewers suggest, or from other effects that Anillin may have on cellular mechanics such as junctional stiffness.</p><p>Additionally, we were able to track recoil of vertices for the dataset out to 45 s and have included this graph below and in Figure 1—figure supplement 1E. This data shows the same trend where Anillin knockdown cells recoil more compared to controls, and Anillin overexpression cells recoil less. The curves appear to begin plateauing near ~40 s. However, accurate tracking of the junction vertices past 45 s was not possible because expelled cytoplasmic contents obstructed the field of view, or surrounding cells began to extrude the ablated cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A specific question about the unusual recoil kinetics is what happens between 20 and 46 seconds for a junction like the one shown in Figure 6G, which has totally opened (parallel) at 46 seconds, while the population average at 20 seconds in 6F shows only 0.2 microns of parallel recoil?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. We would like to clarify that junction recoil was not measured from the “tips” of the disintegrating junction, as this would be measuring both recoil and the disassembly of the junction. Instead, junction recoil was measured as the change in the position of the vertices after ablation. Thus, at 20 s, the junction in Previous Figure 6 noted by the reviewer has only recoiled 0.14 µm. See annotated figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> -previous Figure 6G from initial submission). We have now clarified how measurements were made throughout the figures by using red lines to indicate the initial position of the junction vertices (see updated Figure 7G), and when associated with a graph measuring vertex recoil, we placed green dots directly on the vertices and indicated in the figure legends that these were the sites measured (see updated Figure 1C).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Previous Figure 6G: Confocal images of an embryo expressing E-cad-3xGFP and treated with 20 µm jasplakinolide before and after laser ablation.</title><p>Blue boxes show the zoomed area for the ablation montage. Green dashed lines indicate the position of the vertices relative to the edge of the image, orange dashed line indicates the perpendicular separation between the two cells, grey dashed line indicates the space forming between the two cells, and blue arrows represent forces on junctions adjacent to the lower cell vertex. Notice that the lower vertex only begins to separate in the parallel direction after the forces perpendicular to the adjacent junction (blue arrows) lead to loss of adhesion between the two cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-39065-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The phenomenon reported in Figures 1F and 6G of perpendicular junctional dissociation needs to be quantified. Is there any separation in this perpendicular direction in control junctions or those depleted of anillin? These measurements for the population of cut junctions need to be reported. In addition, a control example, with comparable time-course, needs to be shown to accompany abnormal junction response.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion of quantifying the number of cells that recoil perpendicularly when their cell-cell junctions are ablated. We agree that it would be informative to quantify the distance of perpendicular separation in cells that exhibit this type of recoil; however, because E-cadheren-3xGFP was the only fluorescent protein expressed (in addition to Anillin-3xmCherry) in these experiments, we were not able accurately track this separation over time. This is because the junctions disintegrate over time after junctional laser ablation, making measurements of perpendicular separation in controls and Anillin knockdown (where no other fluorescent probe were expressed) inaccurate.</p><p>However, we were able to re-analyze the movies and count the instances of E-cadherin “splaying”, which we used as a readout for occurrence of perpendicular separation. E-cadherin splaying is defined as when the stubs of the junction left after laser ablation were separated in two. We found that control and Anillin overexpressing cells exhibited E-cadherin splaying about 55-60% of the time, whereas Anillin knockdown cells only showed splaying about 10% of the time. This data is now included in Figure 1—figure supplement 2B, C. Additionally, we added control time-course examples to accompany perpendicular separation data in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The contribution of anillin's various protein interaction domains is implicated by expressing truncation constructs and assessing apical actin network organization. However, as the authors report, many of the anillin truncations are not properly enriched in the apical actin network. Just as low expression level for a truncation construct prohibits the attribution of any failure of that truncation to replace function of full-length, the same is true if the truncation is not present/enriched in the subcellular structure of interest. The authors need to tone down their conclusions of the roles of anillin's various regions in organizing apical actin for constructs that do not normally localize. I would like to see both apical enrichment (numbers in 5C and 5G compared to cytoplasmic or other intensity?) and network organization quantified (likely with an open-source image analysis software) so that normalizing for anillin abundance could be attempted/done.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out that both local enrichment as well as protein interactions could impact Anillin’s ability to organize medial-apical F-actin into long bundles. Although it is a good suggestion, unfortunately we could not normalize the medial-apical Anillin signal to cytoplasmic intensity, as only the apical 2.5 µm of cells was imaged. Additionally, Anillin also localizes to the nucleus, so a full z-scan of the cells (~20 µm) would be required. Imaging this deeply is not possible with our live imaging setup, as the opaque nature of frog embryo cells mostly blocks light transmission at ~10 µm. In lieu of this, we have toned down our conclusions about the roles of Anillin’s binding regions in organizing apical actin in the Results section, particularly for the ΔC2 and ΔPH mutants, which did not localize with the same intensity as Anillin FL. The Δact mutant localized with the same intensity as the Δmyo mutant, which was able to form long bundles, so we argue that the inability of ∆act to promote long F-actin bundles suggests that Anillin’s actin-binding function is important.</p><p>To characterize the F-actin bundles, we attempted to use several open-source analysis plugins for ImageJ including “Skeleton” and “Ridge finder” but had little success. The noise to actin bundle ratio was often quite high, and these software options could not detect bundles that were easily detected by eye. Additionally, in control cells, medial-apical bundles were sometimes detected when they weren’t present. This led us to use the blinded fiber classification approach, where the data was blinded for the user, and the organization of the medial-apical actin network of each cell was classified as consisting of no bundles, short bundles, or long bundles. This approach gave consistent results across all three users for each dataset, so we believe it is an accurate and reliable method for assessing the F-actin organization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Does anillin contribute differentially to tension/contractility and stiffness in the medial-apical network? Here it might be informative to manipulate the medial-apical region directly, by making laser cuts in the medial apical cortex itself (e.g. Stephan Grill and the 1-cell C. elegans embryo).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting that medial-apical laser cuts would allow us to further investigate the contributions of tension/contractility across the apical surface of cells. After pilot studies to determine appropriate conditions for performing medial-apical laser ablation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, we found that cells overexpressing Anillin exhibited increased apical expansion, while Anillin knockdown cells showed decreased apical expansion after medial-apical laser cuts. This supports the hypothesis that Anillin is promoting storage of tensile/contractile energy across the apical surface. This data is now presented in the new Figure 3C-E (see above). In addition to quantifying the perpendicular or parallel expansion after laser ablation, we also used a strain mapping technique to analyze the medial-apical laser ablation movies. This data is now presented in the new Figure 3F-G (see above).</p><p>These changes in apical expansion after medial-apical laser cuts, combined with data showing that Vinculin strongly accumulates at junctions in Anillin overexpressing cells where F-actin bundles make perpendicular connections to the junction (new Figure 3A-B), demonstrate that force generated from the medial-apical cortex is transmitted to cell-cell junctions, and that Anillin influences the orientation of these forces. This data does not exclude potential contributions from the physical stiffness of the network, and we now mention in the Discussion that in the future it would be interesting to pursue more robust stiffness measurements at the apical surface using techniques such as atomic force microscopy or micro-aspiration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The reviewers wondered: Is the medial-apical network pulsatile? Is pulsatility affected by anillin overexpression (is it dampened)? If possible, measuring any pulses in the network contraction would allow the authors to add this as a part of their model for how anillin works.</p></disp-quote><p>We observe waves of F-actin and Myosin II that travel across the apical cortex of gastrula-stage <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos similar to those observed in the early oocyte (Bement et al., 2015). These waves of F-actin appear in control, Anillin knock down, and Anillin overexpressing embryos. Perhaps, since we aren’t directly investigating a developmental event that requires apical constriction in this study, we do not observe a pulsatile, ratchet-like mechanism occurring like in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ventral furrow formation. We thank the reviewers for their interest in this topic, and agree that examining Anillin’s role in controlling cortical excitability at steady state and in apically constricting cells is an interesting area to explore in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Analysis of actin stability in the overexpression of the delta-F-actin mutant should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers, and we performed the FRAP experiments with the Anillin Δact mutant in comparison with control and Anillin FL. We confirmed our previous results that in control cells, medial-apical actin is very dynamic, and when Anillin FL is overexpressed, actin is stabilized. We found that overexpression of Anillin Δact did not significantly change the stability (mobile fraction) of medial-apical F-actin compared to controls. These data are presented in Figure 7A-C, and demonstrate that Anillin is likely stabilizing F-actin through binding to F-actin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Textual changes:</p><p>1) Introduction.

They agreed that some of the experiments above may address these concerns as well. I think that it is very difficult to interpret these results without a mechanical model (or at least I find it very difficult). There are at least 3 levels of complexity that need to be considered. 1) Actomyosin can contribute to tension but also influence viscoelasticity. (Conceivably, a highly cross-linked actomyosin network might be very elastic but not actually generate much tension.) 2) As the authors note (and has been developed in some of e.g. Pierre-Francois Lenne's reviews) recoil is the product of tension divided by friction. It can't always be equated to tension; and this is potentially one of those cases, since the authors data indicate that tissue stiffness is increased. 3) Both the medial-apical and junctional networks may contribute and it is difficult to tease these apart. Looking at their videos, I would consider the possibility that the impact of anillin on the medial-apical network may be principally to increase stiffness in this region of the cell, rather than as a source of tensile force. This could explain the slower recoil of junctions when anillin is overexpressed, because a stiffer medial-apical network limits recoil of the junction. Of course, this implies that the junctions and medial-apical network are physically connected.</p><p>Also the reviewers agreed that this would help the manuscript, the authors thought that if this was not able to be added in the two month time frame, the experiments requested may also address these same concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that a mechanical model could be useful to tease apart the contributions of differentially-oriented contractile tensions and network stiffness. Such models have been applied in studying apical mechanics in <italic>Drosophila</italic> dorsal closure where the bulk of energy storage changes from junctional apical bundles to the medial-apical cell cortex (Ma et al., 2009; Hutson et al., 2009); however, given the time frame and the need to initiate a new collaboration to develop a complex model, we felt it was not feasible at this time. The data that we have now presented in Figure 3 showing that the medial-apical network stores contractile energy and that forces are transmitted from the cortex to the junction, supports our working model Figures 5 and 9. Our findings do not exclude the possible contributions of network stiffness or friction on the cellular mechanics of these epithelial cells. Indeed, we agree that these factors are likely contributors, given that Anillin stabilizes F-actin and stiffens the tissue, and we have further emphasized this point in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
