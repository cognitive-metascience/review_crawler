experience and learning, but the effects on specific cell types, including distinct inhibitory types, are not well understood. Here we investigated how excitatory and VIP inhibitory cells in layer 2/3 of mouse visual cortex were impacted by visual experience in the context of a behavioral task. Mice learned a visual change detection task with a set of eight natural scene images. Subsequently, during 2-photon imaging experiments, mice performed the task with these familiar images and three sets of novel images. Strikingly, the temporal dynamics of VIP activity differed markedly between novel and familiar images: VIP cells were stimulus-driven by novel images but were suppressed by familiar stimuli and showed ramping activity when expected stimuli were omitted from a temporally predictable sequence. This prominent change in VIP activity suggests that these cells may adopt different modes of processing under novel versus familiar conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>visual system</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Allen Institute for Brain Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garrett</surname><given-names>Marina</given-names></name><name><surname>Manavi</surname><given-names>Sahar</given-names></name><name><surname>Roll</surname><given-names>Kate</given-names></name><name><surname>Ollerenshaw</surname><given-names>Douglas R</given-names></name><name><surname>Groblewski</surname><given-names>Peter A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kiggins</surname><given-names>Justin T</given-names></name><name><surname>Casal</surname><given-names>Linzy</given-names></name><name><surname>Mace</surname><given-names>Kyla</given-names></name><name><surname>Williford</surname><given-names>Ali</given-names></name><name><surname>Leon</surname><given-names>Arielle</given-names></name><name><surname>Jia</surname><given-names>Xiaoxuan</given-names></name><name><surname>Mihalas</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><name><surname>Ponvert</surname><given-names>Nicholas D</given-names></name><name><surname>Ledochowitsch</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Buice</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name><name><surname>Wakeman</surname><given-names>Wayne</given-names></name><name><surname>Olsen</surname><given-names>Shawn R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>VIP inhibitory neurons are active in response to novel images but are suppressed by familiar stimuli and show ramping activity when expected stimuli are omitted.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural circuits are dynamically shaped by experience and learned expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Lange et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LeMessurier and Feldman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pakan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ranganath and Rainer, 2003</xref>).

Inhibitory interneurons likely play a key role in this process by dynamically regulating the flow of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hangya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang and Yang, 2018</xref>). Elucidating how different cell populations, particularly inhibitory cells, contribute to experience-dependent changes in sensory coding is critical to understand the dynamic nature of cortical circuits.</p><p>Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expressing cells comprise a major class of inhibitory neurons and are well-positioned to mediate top-down and neuromodulatory influences on local circuits in sensory cortex. VIP cells receive long-range projections from frontal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) as well as cholinergic and noradrenergic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alitto and Dan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). VIP cells are highly active during states of arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>), are modulated by task engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuchibhotla et al., 2017</xref>), and are responsive to behavioral reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krabbe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Letzkus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pi et al., 2013</xref>). In the local cortical circuitry, VIP cells primarily inhibit another major class of inhibitory interneuron, somatostatin (SST) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Munoz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pi et al., 2013</xref>), which can result in disinhibition of excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Letzkus et al., 2011</xref>). SST cells target the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>) and removal of this inhibition may facilitate the association of top-down and bottom-up input by pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larkum, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Makino and Komiyama, 2015</xref>). However, little is known about how VIP cell activity is modified by visual experience.</p><p>Here we investigated how long-term behavioral experience with natural scene images alters activity of cortical VIP inhibitory and excitatory pyramidal cells in layers 2/3 of mouse visual cortex. Mice were trained to perform a change detection task in which images were presented in a periodic manner and mice were rewarded for detecting changes in image identity. Mice learned the task with one set of eight natural images, which were viewed thousands of times and were thus highly familiar. During subsequent 2-photon imaging, these familiar images as well as three novel image sets were tested. Familiar images were associated with lower overall population activity in both excitatory and VIP cells. Notably, VIP inhibitory cells had distinct activity dynamics during sessions with familiar versus novel images. VIP cells were stimulus-driven by novel images but displayed ramping activity between presentations of familiar images and were suppressed by stimulus onset. These cells showed even greater ramping activity when an expected stimulus was omitted from the regular image sequence. Overall, these results show distinct experience-dependent changes in two cortical cell classes and suggest that VIP cells may adopt different modes of processing during familiar versus novel conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visual change detection task with familiar and novel images</title><p>We trained mice on a go/no-go visual change detection task with natural scene stimuli.

False alarms are quantified during âcatchâ trials when the image does not change. To test whether expectation signals exist in the visual cortex due to the temporal regularity of this task, we randomly omittedÂ ~5% of all image presentations (not including image changes to avoid interfering with behavior performance). These omissions appeared as an extended gray period to the mouse and corresponded to a gap in the periodic timing of stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Natural image change detection task with familiar and novel images.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of stimulus presentation during the task.

We also analyzed differences in pupil size across image sets to evaluate whether changes in pupil size around the time of stimulus onset could explain VIP activity dynamics.

This revealed several changes associated with training history. Extended experience with a set of images resulted in reduced overall activity levels in both excitatory and VIP cells. Strikingly, VIP cells exhibited distinct activity dynamics when tested with familiar versus novel images. Novel images drove stimulus-locked activity in VIP cells, whereas with familiar images VIP cells had ramping activity during the inter-stimulus interval and were suppressed by stimulus onset. Moreover, these ramping responses continued increasing when stimuli were omitted from the expected stimulus sequence.

Previous studies have shown reductions in activity with experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Makino and Komiyama, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mruczek and Sheinberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Woloszyn and Sheinberg, 2012</xref>), and also novelty enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamm and Yuste, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Homann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ranganath and Rainer, 2003</xref>). Reduced activity for highly familiar stimuli can efficiently code predictable stimuli, utilizing a smaller population of cells to represent learned information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LeMessurier and Feldman, 2018</xref>). On the other hand, enhanced activity for novel stimuli could aid detection of salient and behaviorally meaningful events by augmenting output to downstream targets and facilitating associative plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ranganath and Rainer, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Our results demonstrating reduced activity with long-term experience and enhancement with novelty are consistent with the predictive coding framework. Increased VIP activity in response to novel images may serve to disinhibit excitatory cell responses to novel stimuli (via the VIP-SST disinhibitory circuit). When stimuli are familiar, VIP cells are suppressed by image presentation, which may permit increased inhibition of excitatory neurons by SST or PV cells, thus increasing the sparseness of stimulus representations. Our observation that VIP cells show ramping activity between familiar images, reminiscent of anticipatory signals, further implicates them in predictive processing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Ramping activity in VIP cells</title><p>What does pre-stimulus and stimulus-omission ramping activity in VIP cells represent? One possibility is that this activity reflects the temporal structure of the behavioral task such that these signals encode predictions about stimulus timing or reward expectation, or serve as a temporal attention signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nobre and van Ede, 2018</xref>). Previous studies have described stimulus and reward expectation signals in the visual cortex of rodents. An early example showed that pairing visual stimulation with a temporally predictable reward produces reward timing signals in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shuler and Bear, 2006</xref>). A more recent study using a visual orientation discrimination task in mice found pre-stimulus ramping activity specifically in the subpopulation of excitatory cells that encoded the rewarded stimulus, suggestive of reward anticipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poort et al., 2015</xref>). In our task, each stimulus presentation is a potential opportunity to earn a reward if there is a stimulus change. VIP ramping during the inter-stimulus interval may be important for enhancing the responses of excitatory cells to an anticipated change stimulus and consequent reward.</p><p>Visual cortex has also been shown to learn experience-dependent stimulus predictions for repeated sequences of visual stimuli in the absence of association with reward. One study demonstrated anticipatory recall of an omitted stimulus in a learned spatiotemporal sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gavornik and Bear, 2014</xref>). In a virtual navigation paradigm in which mice locomote along a linear track, V1 neurons have been found to predict upcoming stimuli at specific locations, and to signal a deviation from expectation when stimuli are omitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fiser et al., 2016</xref>). In these studies, the predictive signal peaked at the expected time of the predicted event, whereas our results show a continued ramping past the expected time of stimulus onset on omission trials. This suggests that the ramping signals we observe may represent something other than a pure prediction of stimulus timing. It is also important to note that most prior studies documenting predictive or ramping activity reflect measurements from excitatory neurons, and thus may not be directly comparable to our results in VIP cells. Nonetheless, VIP cells may serve to gate the predictive or anticipatory signals documented in excitatory cells.</p><p>VIP cells in visual cortex have been shown to be modulated by locomotion and arousal in a context-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dipoppa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pakan et al., 2016</xref>). The ramping activity in VIP cells that we observe, however, is not simply a reflection of locomotion or arousal (as indexed by pupil diameter), since the differences in the dynamics of VIP cells cannot be explained by differences in the pattern of animal running behavior or changes in pupil diameter relative to stimulus and omission onset.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Role of VIP cells in learning and salience detection</title><p>Theoretical work suggests that VIP cells could mediate associative learning and experience-dependent signal routing via disinhibition of local excitatory populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang and Yang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilmes and Clopath, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Several lines of experimental evidence support this hypothesis. For example, VIP cells in auditory cortex respond to salient reinforcement signals including reward and punishment, and activation of VIP cells enhances the gain of auditory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Letzkus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pi et al., 2013</xref>). Inactivation of VIP cells in visual cortex impairs plasticity following monocular deprivation, while activating VIP cells enhances plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2017</xref>). In the amygdala, VIP cells are necessary for associative memory formation through disinhibition of local pyramidal cells during fear learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krabbe et al., 2019</xref>). Further, VIP cells are modulated by expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krabbe et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that VIP cells switch from a stimulus responsive to stimulus suppressed mode depending on past experience with an image set may be consistent with a role for VIP cells in enhancing the representation of salient events to facilitate learning and adaptive behavior. During sessions with novel images, VIP activity is strongly driven by stimulus presentation, potentially serving to increase the gain of stimulus evoked excitatory responses to salient, novel stimuli. When stimuli are familiar, other aspects of the task may become more relevant, such as the unexpected omission of stimuli from a predictable temporal sequence, and VIP cells switch from signaling the presence of a stimulus to signaling the absence of a stimulus.</p><p>VIP cells in the visual cortex of passively viewing mice are suppressed by high contrast stimuli and show direction selective responses at low contrast, leading to the proposal that VIP cells are involved in enhancing the gain of weak but salient stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Vries et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Millman et al., 2019</xref>). The inter-stimulus and omission ramping activity we observed, with a decay in the VIP response following onset of familiar images, is consistent with the phenomenon of contrast suppression. However our finding that VIP cells show robust stimulus-evoked responses to novel stimuli demonstrates that VIP responses are flexible and depend on experience. These seemingly divergent findings canÂ be unified under the view that VIP cells represent salient stimuli in a context-dependent manner. Novelty may put cortical circuits in a regime requiring high sensitivity, involving VIP signaling to enhance the gain of salient stimuli. When stimuli are familiar and the environment is more predictable, VIP cells may be more sensitive to unexpected events, such as stimulus omission or violations of temporal expectation. It remains an open question whether VIP activity switches from stimulus driven to stimulus suppressed following passive exposure to a novel set of images in the absence of reward, or whether active task performance and reinforcement are necessary to observe this context-dependent switch in temporal dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Future directions</title><p>Further modifications of our visual change detection task to include omitted rewards or variation in the predictability of the inter-stimulus interval could help to distinguish between coding of stimulus timing versus reward anticipation. Studies examining the evolution of activity in identified VIP cells across multiple behavior sessions as novel images become familiar are needed to determine the time course of the observed experience dependent effects. Concurrent recordings of VIP, excitatory, and other inhibitory cell classes including SST cells will be important to establish a direct link between VIP activity and disinhibition of local excitatory neurons during task learning. Finally, experiments examining the activity and impact of the diverse inputs to VIP cells, including neuromodulatory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Letzkus et al., 2011</xref>), thalamic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Williams and Holtmaat, 2019</xref>), and feedback projections from other cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), will be critical to establish the function of and mechanism behind the shift in VIP dynamics with experience.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Reagent (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="bottom">Designation</th><th valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th valign="bottom">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">Slc17a7-IRES2-Cre; Slc17a7+; Excitatory</td><td valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">Stock #:023527; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_61574">Addgene_61574</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25741722">25741722</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">VIP-IRES-Cre; VIP+; VIP Inhibitory</td><td valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">Stock #: 010908; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:4436915">MGI:4436915</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom">Dr. Z Josh Huang (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">CaMKII-tTA x Ai93-GCaMP6f</td><td valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">Stock #: 024108; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:024108">IMSR_JAX:024108</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22855807">22855807</ext-link>; PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25741722">25741722</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">Ai148-GCaMP6f</td><td valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">Stock #: 030328; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:030328">IMSR_JAX:030328</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30007418">30007418</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="bottom">numpy</td><td valign="bottom">NumPy</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008633">SCR_008633</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="bottom">scipy</td><td valign="bottom">SciPy</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008058">SCR_008058</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="bottom">matplotlib</td><td valign="bottom">MatPlotLib</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008624">SCR_008624</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="bottom">pandas</td><td valign="bottom">pandas</td><td valign="bottom">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3509134">10.5281/zenodo.3509134</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="bottom">seaborn</td><td valign="bottom">seaborn</td><td valign="bottom">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1313201">10.5281/zenodo.1313201</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All experiments and procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Allen Institute Animal Care and Use Committee.

Pre-operative injections of dexamethasone (3.2 mg/kg, S.C.) were administered at 12 hr and 3 hr before surgery. Mice were initially anesthetized with 5% isoflurane (1â3 min) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (Model# 1900, Kopf, Tujunga, CA), and isoflurane levels were maintained at 1.5â2.5% for surgery. An incision was made to remove skin, and the exposed skull was levelled with respect to pitch (bregma-lambda level), roll and yaw. The stereotax was zeroed at lambda using a custom headframe holder equipped with stylus affixed to a clamp-plate. The stylus was then replaced with the headframe to center the headframe well at 2.8 mm lateral and 1.3 mm anterior to lambda. The headframe was affixed to the skull with white Metabond and once dried, the mouse was placed in a custom clamp to position the skull at a rotated angle of 23Â° such that visual cortex was horizontal to facilitate the craniotomy. A circular piece of skull 5 mm in diameter was removed, and a durotomy was performed. A coverslip stack (two 5 mm and one 7 mm glass coverslip adhered together) was cemented in place with Vetbond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldey et al., 2014</xref>). Metabond cement was applied around the cranial window inside the well to secure the glass window. Post-surgical brain health was documented using a custom photo-documentation system and at one, two, and seven days following surgery, animals were assessed for overall health (bright, alert, and responsive), cranial window clarity, and brain health. After a 1â2 week recovery from surgery, animals underwent intrinsic signal imaging for retinotopic mapping, then entered into behavioral training.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Intrinsic signal imaging</title><p>Intrinsic signal imaging (ISI) was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Vries et al.

Mice were lightly anesthetized with 1â1.4% isoflurane administered with a somnosuite (model #715; Kent Scientific, CON). Vital signs were monitored with a Physiosuite (model # PS-MSTAT-RT; Kent Scientific). Eye drops (Lacri-Lube Lubricant Eye Ointment; Refresh) were applied to maintain hydration and clarity of eye during anesthesia.

A pair of Nikon lenses lens (Nikon Nikkor 105 mm f/2.8, Nikon Nikkor 35 mm f/1.4), provided 3.0x magnification (MÂ =Â 105/35) onto an Andor Zyla 5.5 10tap sCMOS camera. A bandpass filter (Semrock; FF01-630/92 nm) was used to record reflected red light from the brain.</p><p>A 24â monitor was positioned 10 cm from the right eye. The monitor was rotated 30Â° relative to the animalâs dorsoventral axis and tilted 70Â° off the horizon to ensure that the stimulus was perpendicular to the optic axis of the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oommen and Stahl, 2008</xref>). The visual stimulus for mapping retinotopy was a 20Â° x 155Â° drifting bar containing a checkerboard pattern, with individual square sizes measuring 25Â°, that alternated black and white as it moved across a mean-luminance gray background. The bar moved in each of the four cardinal directions 10 times.

A cost function, defined by the discrepancy between the properties of the matched areas, was minimized to identify the best match between visual areas in the experimental sign map and those in the atlas, resulting in an auto-segmented and annotated map for each experiment. Manual correction and editing of the results included merging and splitting of segmented and annotated areas to correct errors. Finally, target maps were created to guide in vivo two-photon imaging location using the retinotopic map. The center of retinotopic space was computed from azimuth and altitude maps and adjusted for variability in eye position relative to the monitor by zeroing to the anatomical center V1.

Prior to water restriction mice were weighed once daily for three days to obtain a stable, initial baseline weight. During the first week of water restriction mice were handled daily and habituated to increasing duration of head fixation in the behavior enclosure over a five-day period. Thus, the first day of behavior training occurred after 10 days of water restriction. Mice were trained 5 days per week and could earn as much water as possible during the daily one-hour sessions; supplemental water was provided if earned volume fell below 1.0 mL and/or body weight fell under 80â85% of their initial baseline weight. On non-training days mice were weighed and received enough water provision to reach their target weight of 80â85% (never less than 1.0 mL per day).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Apparatus</title><p>Mice were trained in custom-designed, sound-attenuating behavior enclosures.

Running behavior was measured by a rotational encoder. Water rewards were delivered using a solenoid (NResearch, Model #161K011) that allowed for a calibrated volume of fluid to pass through a blunted, 17 g hypodermic needle (Hamilton) positioned approximately 2â3 mm from the animalâs mouth.

Briefly, mice were trained to lick when the identity of a flashed visual stimulus changed. If mice responded correctly within a short, post-change response window (750 ms) a water reward (5â10 uL) was delivered. On Day 1 of the automated training procedure mice received a short, 15 min âopen loopâ conditioning session during which non-contingent water rewards were delivered coincident with 90 degree changes in orientation of a full-field, static square-wave grating. This session was intended to 1) introduce the mouse to the fluid delivery system, 2) provide the technician an opportunity to identify the optimal lick spout position for each mouse and 3) condition the association between stimulus changes and reward delivery. Each session thereafter was run in âclosed loopâ mode, and progressed through 3 stages of the operant task (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>): 1) static, full-field square wave gratings (changes between 0 and 90 degrees, spatial frequency 0.04 cycles per degree), 2) full-field square-wave gratings (changes between 0 and 90 degrees, spatial frequency 0.04 cycles per degree) presented for 250 ms with an 500 ms inter stimulus gray period, and 3) full-field natural scenes (eight natural images from the Allen Brain Observatory) presented for 250 ms with a 500 ms inter stimulus gray period between stimuli. Progression through each stage required mice to achieve a session maximum d-prime of 1 on two of the last three sessions. The shortest amount of time to reach the final stage of training was five sessions. Once in stage 3, mice were considered âready for imagingâ when 2 out of 3 sequential sessions had a d-primeÂ &gt;1 and mice performed at least 100 trials. However, many mice remained in stage 3 of behavior training until the 2-photon microscope became available.

Change-type was chosen based on predetermined frequencies such that GO and CATCH trials occurred with equal probabilities for sessions with two oriented gratings. For the natural image phase in which there were 64 change-pair possibilities, CATCH frequency was set to 12.5% (1/8 of the number of image transitions). To ensure even sampling of all stimulus transitions, a transition path is selected at random from a matrix of 1000 pre-generated paths. Each path takes a pre-determined route through each of the 64 possible transitions, including same-to-same, or catch, transitions. Once a transition path is completed, another path is chosen at random.</p><p>Change times were selected from an exponential distribution ranging from 2.25 to 8.25 s (mean of 4.25 s) following the start of a trial. Catch trial times were drawn from the same distribution such that false alarm rates were measured with the same temporal statistics as change trials, to account for any learning of the temporal distribution of change times. On trials when a mouse licked prior to the change or catch time, the trial was restarted with the same scheduled change or catch time. To prevent mice from getting stuck on a single trial, the number of times a trial could be repeated was limited to five. GO and CATCH trials, when combined with mouseâs licking response, yield HIT, MISS, FALSE ALARM, and CORRECT REJECTION trials. In addition to the four trial types described above, behavior sessions contained a subset of âfree rewardâ trials (GO trials followed immediately by delivery of a non-contingent reward). Behavior sessions across all phases began with five free-reward trials to help prime engagement with the task.

The monitor was placed in a fixed location relative to the behavior stage to ensure a consistent relationship between the mouseâs eye and the screen. Running speed, lick times, and reward delivery times were recorded on a NI PCI-6612 digital IO board and sampled at the frequency of the visual display (60 Hz).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Two-photon calcium imaging during behavior</title><p>Calcium imaging was performed using a Scientifica Vivoscope (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.scientifica.uk.com/products/scientifica-vivoscope">https://www.scientifica.uk.com/products/scientifica-vivoscope</ext-link>). Laser excitation was provided by a Ti:Sapphire laser (Chameleon Vision â Coherent) at 910 nm. Pre-compensation was set at â10,000 fs2. Movies were recorded at 30 Hz using resonant scanners over a 400 Î¼m field of view (512 Ã 512 pixels). Temporal synchronization of calcium imaging, visual stimulation, reward delivery and behavioral output (lick times and running speed) was achieved by recording all experimental clocks on a single NI PCI-6612 digital IO board at 100 kHz.</p><p>Behavior sessions under the two-photon microscope were 1 hr in duration, with task parameters identical to stage 3 of the behavior training procedure as described above. In addition, during most two-photon imaging sessions, 5% of stimulus presentations were randomly omitted, excluding the change presentation and the presentation immediately prior to the change. These omitted presentations were added to the experimental protocol partway into the experiment, resulting in 86/101 (85%) imaging sessions including omitted presentations. The 15 sessions without omitted presentations included data from one Slc17a7-IRES2;CaMKII-tTA;Ai93 mouse (four sessions in VISp), and two Vip-IRES-Cre;Ai148 mice (three sessions from VISal, and eight sessions from VISp). Sessions without omitted presentations were excluded from any analysis depending on stimulus omission.</p><p>Movies of fluorescence were acquired near the center of retinotopic space in VISp and VISal, using ISI target maps and vasculature images as a guide. Once a cortical region was selected, the objective was shielded from stray light coming from the stimulus monitor using opaque black tape. All recordings were made at a depth ofÂ ~175 um from the brain surface. Once a field of view was selected, a combination of PMT gain and laser power was selected to maximize laser power (based on a look-up table against depth) and dynamic range while avoiding pixel saturation (max number of saturated pixelsÂ &lt;Â 1000). Immersion water was occasionally supplemented while imaging using a micropipette taped to the objective (Microfil MF28G67-5 WPI) and connected to a 5 ml syringe via an extension tubing. At the end of each experimental session, a z-stack of images (Â±Â 30 Î¼m around imaging site, 0.1 Î¼m step) was collected to evaluate cortical anatomy and evaluate z-drift during experiment. Experiments with z-drift above 10 Âµm over the course of the entire session were excluded.</p><p>For each field of view, imaging and behavior sessions were conducted using each of the four image sets shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, including the familiar image set A used during behavior training, and three novel image sets first experienced by the mouse during the imaging phase of the experiment. On subsequent imaging days for a given field of view, we returned to the same location by matching (1) the pattern of vessels in epi-fluorescence with (2) the pattern of vessels in two photon imaging and (3) the pattern of cellular labelling in two photon imaging at the previously recorded location. Typically, only one field of view was imaged per mouse, however in 3 out of the 21 mice, fields of view were recorded in both VISp and VISal. In cases where an imaging session failed our QC criteria (for example for z-driftÂ &gt;10 um), the session was retaken. As a result, some sessions with ânovelâ image sets B, C or D were the second or third exposure (67% were first exposure, 27% were the second exposure, 6% were the third or fourth exposure). In contrast, mice were exposed to familiar image set A for an average of 17 Â±Â 14 sessions during training.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Pupillometry</title><p>Pupil tracking was performed under 850 nm infrared illumination (OSRAM SYLVANIA Inc, LZ1-10R602-0000 mounted to a Thorlabs LB1092-B-ML bi-convex lens) using a 30 Hz infrared sensitive camera (Allied Vision Technologies Mako G-032B) mated to a 0.73x, 130 mm WD lens (Infinity InfiniStix, part #213073) and a 845â855 nm bandpass filter (Semrock FF01-850/10-25). The camera and IR LED were mounted to the left of the animal and focused on a short-pass dichroic mirror (Semrock FF750-SDi02â25 Ã 66, cutoff frequencyÂ =Â 750 nm) positioned between the animal and the monitor, thus allowing tracking of the right (monitor facing) eye and pupil. Pupil diameter was extracted from raw video frames using a processing pipeline based on the DeepLabCut tracking algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, a model was fit using hand-annotated sample frames (12 points each from the perimeter of the pupil and eyelid) from multiple imaging rigs, subjects, and lighting conditions. The model was then applied to each frame of the 101 eye tracking videos acquired during imaging sessions, excluding 38 sessions for which frame timing information was incomplete. Points with a minimum confidence value of 0.8 (output by the DeepLabCut model) were used to fit separate ellipses to the eyelid and pupil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Halir and Flusser, 1998</xref>). Any frames with fewer than six high-confidence eye or pupil tracking points, which generally occurred during blinking/squinting, were not fit (replaced with NaN). Pupil area was then calculated as the area of a circle with a radius equal to the major axis of the ellipse fit. Frames with calculated areas greater than three standard deviations from the mean were excluded, as were the two frames immediately before and after any missing fits. Pupil area was interpolated across periods with missing fits.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quality control</title><p>All data streams were required to pass strict quality control criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Vries et al., 2020</xref>; see Supplementary Figure 16). For example, Z-drift of the 2-photon imaging plane over the 1 hr imaging session was quantified by performing phase correlation between the frames of a 100 um z-stack taken after the imaging session and a 500 frame average from the beginning of the 2-photon movie and a 500 frame average at the end of the movie. If the distance between the z-stack frames found to be most correlated with the beginning and end of the movie is greater than 10 um, the session failed QC and was retaken. Only imaging sessions passing all QC criteria were included in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data processing</title><p>Post-processing of 2-photon imaging data was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Vries et al. (2020)</xref>Â (see Supplementary Figures 19, 20, 22, 23). For each two-photon imaging session, the image processing pipeline included the following steps: (1) motion correction, (2) image normalization to minimize confounding random variations between sessions, (3) segmentation of ROIs, and (4) ROI filtering. Motion correction was performed using phase correlation and rigid translation. Segmentation was performed by morphological filtering on normalized periodic average images constructed from 400 frame blocks, followed by unification of masks across all blocks. ROI filtering was performed to remove segmented regions that were unlikely to correspond to cell somas, based on attributes including size and shape (for example, small ROIs likely corresponding to apical dendrites were removed).</p><p>Following identification of cell ROIs, the following steps were performed to obtain <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> traces and deconvolved event traces: (1) neuropil subtraction, (2) trace demixing, (3) <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> computation, (4) L0-regularized event detection.

If the cell trace decreasing during the window, the ramp index is negative.</p><p>The pre-stimulus and stimulus ramp indices were plotted against each other on a cell by cell basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and found to be correlated by least squares linear regression between the two measures (using scipy.stats.linregress). Cells with positive values of the stimulus ramp index were considered to be âstimulus drivenâ and cells with negative values of the stimulus ramp index were considered to be âstimulus suppressedâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). The fraction of cells that fell in each of these categories was calculated for each session, then averaged across sessions for each image set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The population average image response was created by averaging across all cells in each category, regardless of image set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>The population average image response was also computed separately for image presentations where mice were running versus stationary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Image presentations were classified as running if the mean running speed during the [â0.5, 0.75] second window around stimulus onset wasÂ &gt;5 cm/s and as stationary if the mean running speed wasÂ &lt;5 cm/s. To confirm this classification, and to evaluate any differences in locomotion and arousal across image sets, we also generated plots of average image triggered running speed and pupil area for stimulus presentations classified as running and stationary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1CâF</xref>). For both running speed and pupil area, traces aligned to the onset of stimulus presentations were first averaged within each session, then averaged across all sessions for each image set.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>, the ramp index was computed for two windows: the pre-stimulus window (400 ms prior to stimulus onset, comparing the first 120 ms with the last 120 ms) and the stimulus window (125 ms after stimulus offset, comparing the first 65 ms with the last 65 ms in the window) for the mean events trace for each cell across all stimulus presentations of all images. If the cell trace is increasing during the window, the ramp index is positive. If the cell trace decreasing during the window, the ramp index is negative.</p><p>The population average omission response was also computed separately for omissions where mice were running versus stationary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Image presentations were classified as running if the mean running speed in a Â±Â 2 s window around the time of omissionÂ &gt;5 cm/s, and as stationary if the mean running speed in the same window wasÂ &lt;5 cm/s. To confirm this classification, and to evaluate any differences in locomotion and arousal across image sets, we also generated plots of average omission triggered running speed and pupil area for omissions classified as running and stationary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1CâF</xref>). For both running speed and pupil area, traces aligned to the time where a stimulus would have been presented, first averaged within each session, then averaged across all sessions for each image set.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>For all statistical comparisons, ANOVA (scipy.stats.f_oneway) was used to test for an overall effect of image set within the excitatory or VIP inhibitory groups, followed by Welchâs two-sample t-test (scipy.stats.ttest_ind) for each image set pair, using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons to set significance level. p-values are reported throughout the text and figure legends, and significance of comparisons where p&lt;0.0083 (an alpha value of 0.05 divided by the number of pairwise comparisons) are indicated by asterisks in figure insets.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jerome Lecoq and Kevin Takasaki for technical help with the 2-photon microscope, Derric Williams for help with behavior and stimulus control software, Douglas Kim, Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, for providing GCaMP6f, and Saskia de Vries, Brian Hu, and Christof Koch for comments on the manuscript.

display a learnt response to an expected stimulus (overstrained image repetition), which takes the form of a temporal ramping of activity before the expected stimulus. This ramping is prolonged when the expected stimulus is omitted. These results indicate that VIP cells mediate some kind of predictive information within the circuit of visual cortex.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Experience shapes activity dynamics and stimulus coding of VIP inhibitory and excitatory cells in visual cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Brice Bathellier as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Georg B Keller (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work Garrett and colleagues investigate the effect of experience on the response of excitatory and VIP positive inhibitory neurons to repeated stimulus presentations. The key finding is that VIP interneurons exhibit anticipatory responses when the mouse has extensive experience with an image set. These anticipatory responses appear to be suppressed by the presentation of the expected image as they continue increasing when the image is omitted. In addition, the study shows that V1 neurons tend to decrease responsiveness to frequent stimuli as compared to more novel stimuli, a result that is expected and not novel.</p><p>The study by Garret et al., is elegantly designed, rigorous and compelling. The key observations are interesting and topical as not much is known about how experience (in this case visual experience) influences VIP activity and as they provide further evidence for the implementation of predictive-like codes in visual cortex. The paper is overall well written and clear, but would benefit from streamlining, to read less as a collection of results.</p><p>In addition, a number of points need to be addressed to strengthen the observations and their interpretation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper would profit from streamlining and condensing. Currently, it reads a bit like a random collection of findings of unclear relation. The authors should focus the paper on their main finding of ramping (and omission) responses.</p><p>2) &quot;change modulation index&quot; â Figure 4D. The authors' analysis would suggest that in VIP neurons the response to the 10th presentation is larger than the response to the 1st presentation. Given Figure 4C (right panel), potentially indicating that the stimulus driven response in VIP is also larger for the 1st presentation. The 10th presentation is simply riding on top of a slow decay (and hence appears larger when not baseline subtracted â the measure to quantify response to a stimulus using calcium imaging is stimulus-induced change in dF/F). This slow decay could be the result of sustained spiking activity, or a slower calcium decay kinetics. Unless the authors want to calibrate calcium decay differences between excitatory and VIP neurons, or redo all the experiments with inter-stimulus intervals that would allow for a calcium decay to baseline, they should rework or actually remove this analysis â the most likely explanation for this is a slower calcium decay.</p><p>3) The ramping effect in VIP neurons is observed in via calcium signals, which have a relatively slow time constant Tau (even if GCAMP6f is used) and which are not temporally deconvolved. Within a timescale of a few Tau's, constant firing will lead to a ramping of the calcium profile. It would be interesting that the authors either provide deconvolved versions of the observed ramping profile or at least simulations of the calcium signals for constant firing, given the range of time constants observed for GCAMP6f in pyramidal cell and VIP neurons. Clearly, the time constants are dependent on cell types, so it would be good to discuss to which extent ramping response could be confused with (nonetheless quite interesting) steady responses.</p><p>4) Although the behavior in which the animal is involved is well controlled, the authors do not provide data on saccades or pupil dilation. Could adaptation to known stimuli be related to pupil size / attentional processes? Is there a change of pupil size with novel stimuli? Or are there saccades related to stimulus change that could contribute to the larger responses? Ideally this should be checked with pupil tracking or at least discussed.</p><p>5) It is also important to sort the analysis based on locomotion state. It has been widely studied that locomotion is highly correlated with the activity of VIP neurons. Furthermore, in this manuscript (as in other studies) VIP cell activity is correlated with each other, and possibly triggered by locomotor activity. The authors mentioned that there is no overall changes in the locomotor activity between familiar, novel or omission trials, however it is possible that locomotor changes at specific periods during the trial impacts the activity of VIP cells and influence the interpretation of the results.</p><p>6) The authors provide a measure of reaction time as the time of the first lick after stimulus change. But in a supplementary figure they show that reaction times can also be measured based on running speed. It is important to show how similar are the values and if they both do not depend on stimulus novelty.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50340.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper would profit from streamlining and condensing.

We have removed analysis and figure panels that are ancillary to this main focus. Specifically, we removed the previous Figure 4 and associated text that described short-term adaptation of responses to repeated stimulation.

This should make the manuscript and our key results more digestible.

We used a published method for L0-regularized event detection to identify âeventsâ from the dF/F traces (Jewell and Witten, 2017). All the major results of our study are unchanged in this analysis. Importantly, the ramping activity of VIP cells during inter-stimulus intervals and during stimulus omission is clearly present in these deconvolved event traces. Since this event-based analysis provides a better estimate of the underlying spike rates compared to dF/F, we have replaced all figures with analysis performed on events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Although the behavior in which the animal is involved is well controlled, the authors do not provide data on saccades or pupil dilation.

We show in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 that pupil size is slightly increased in novel stimulus sessions relative to familiar sessions. In the Results section and Discussion section we describe how this could reflect a difference in arousal/attention and might contribute to the higher stimulus response magnitudes of excitatory and VIP cells in the novel image session (Figure 3). Importantly, however, a simple gain change cannot account for our main finding of a shift in VIP cell temporal dynamics between novel and familiar sessions (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is also important to sort the analysis based on locomotion state.

We show in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 that VIP cells exhibit inter-stimulus and omission ramping activity both during running and stationary periods. Thus, this phenomenon of ramping activity in VIP cells does not simply reflect locomotor behavior. Moreover, we examined stimulus-triggered (and omission-triggered) locomotor changes and found these are similar for novel and familiar sessions but VIP cell dynamics are different (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors provide a measure of reaction time as the time of the first lick after stimulus change.

In Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 we now show how changes in running speed correspond to lick reaction time. We find that reaction times based on running are quicker (that is, mice begin to slow before they lick). However, running reaction times are very similar for both novel and familiar images and so this cannot account for differences in VIP cell dynamics.</p></body></sub-article></article>
