PCDH15 transduces tip link tension into opening of a mechano-electrical transduction (MET) ion channel. PCDH15 also interacts with LHFPL5, a candidate subunit of the MET channel. Here we illuminate the PCDH15-LHFPL5 structure, showing how the complex is composed of PCDH15 and LHFPL5 subunit pairs related by a 2-fold axis. The extracellular cadherin domains define a mobile tether coupled to a rigid, 2-fold symmetric ‘collar’ proximal to the membrane bilayer. LHFPL5 forms extensive interactions with the PCDH15 transmembrane helices and stabilizes the overall PCDH15-LHFPL5 assembly. Our studies illuminate the architecture of the PCDH15-LHFPL5 complex, localize mutations associated with deafness, and shed new light on how forces in the PCDH15 tether may be transduced into the stereocilia membrane.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hair cell</kwd><kwd>cochlea</kwd><kwd>ear</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>x-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>hearing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIBIB intramural research program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuck</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Huaying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gouaux</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structures of a mouse PCDH15 and LHFPL5 complex, two proteins involved in converting sound into electrical signals, illuminate how mechanical stimuli are delivered to the membrane of inner ear hair cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The sensing of sound, movement and balance across the vertebrate kingdom originates within hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gillespie and Müller, 2009</xref>). In mammals, hair cells within the cochlea mediate our sensation of sound while the detection of movement and our sense of balance originates with hair cells of the utricle and saccule. Hair cells have a characteristic morphology and harbor actin-filled stereocilia ‘staircases’ in which the stereocilia are coupled by protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) molecules from one stereocilium linked with cadherin 23 (CDH23) molecules from an adjacent stereocilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kazmierczak et al., 2007</xref>). Upon movement of the stereocilia induced by fluctuations of the surrounding fluid, the PCDH15-CDH23 ‘tip links’ trigger the opening of a mechano-electrical transduction (MET) ion channel at the stereocilia tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beurg et al., 2009</xref>). While the molecular composition of the MET channel is enigmatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu and Müller, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corey and Holt, 2016</xref>), the fundamental role of PCDH15 in coupling the movement of the stereocilia to the gating of the MET channel is unambiguous and conserved throughout vertebrates, such as mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jaiganesh et al., 2017</xref>), birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmed et al., 2006</xref>) and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maeda et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, in vertebrates PCDH15 regulates the development and function of stereocilia in hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Webb et al., 2011</xref>) while its homolog in flies is essential for the microvilli morphology in follicle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">D'Alterio et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schlichting et al., 2006</xref>). In humans, mutations in <italic>PCDH15</italic> cause Usher syndrome type 1, an inherited deaf-blindness together with vestibular dysfunction and unintelligible speech, as well as nonsyndromic recessive hearing loss (DFNB23) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ahmed et al., 2008</xref>). These findings demonstrate the functional and pathological importance of PCDH15.</p><p>PCDH15 belongs to the cadherin superfamily and consists of 11 extracellular cadherin (EC) domains, an extracellular linker (EL) domain, a single transmembrane (TM) helix and a cytoplasmic domain. Three evolutionarily conserved PCDH15 splice isoforms differ in the C-terminal region of the cytoplasmic domains (CD1, CD2 and CD3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ahmed et al., 2008</xref>), but share a common region (CR) following the TM helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The complex of PCDH15 with CDH23 has been characterized by x-ray crystallography, revealing a ‘hand-shake’ antiparallel interaction of the two most N-terminal cadherin repeats of both proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sotomayor et al., 2012</xref>). Immunoprecipitation and two-hybrid experiments suggest that PCDH15 interacts with several likely MET channel components, including transmembrane channel-like protein 1 and 2 (TMC1, TMC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beurg et al., 2015</xref>), lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5, also known as TMHS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>), and transmembrane inner ear protein (TMIE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>), although none of these studies have isolated stable and biochemically well behaved complexes. Moreover, no structural information is available to illuminate the interactions of PCDH15 and these MET channel components.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38770.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PCDH15 and LHFPL5 form a stable and monodisperse complex.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of constructs used for interaction screening of PCDH15 and LHFPL5 by mcFSEC.

Of the three potential subunits, LHFPL5 showed favorable interaction with PCDH15<sub>4EC</sub>. PCDH15<sub>4EC</sub> alone displayed multiple peaks in the chromatogram, indicating that it was polydisperse when expressed in isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).

The micelle shows two protrusions ‘underneath’ the disk-shaped EC11-EL density. LHFPL5 contains four α-helices that cross the membrane, intracellular termini, and an extracellular β-strand rich domain that could account for these protrusions.

We were unable to fit this conformation of EC9-EC10 into our density map and therefore fitted EC8, EC9, and EC10 as independent rigid bodies, guided by the shape complementarity of the rigid-body docked domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2f and g</xref>). Furthermore, predicted <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation sites map into corresponding protrusions of the density map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). We observe a dimer interface between the two cadherin strands formed by the C-terminal half of EC9, largely defined by a loop between β1 and β2 strands and the <italic>N</italic>-terminus of the α-helix between β3 and β4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2h</xref>). This interface appears to stabilize the straight conformation.</p><p>A second group of particles shows the two cadherin chains bent away from one another, deemed the ‘split’ conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, red).

The density for the most distal cadherin domains is weak, likely due to conformational flexibility, thus precluding 3D reconstruction. Nevertheless, we found that fitting EC10 of the EC8-10 crystal structure into the density for EC10 in our reconstruction produces a conformation that has a striking similarity with 2D class averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2i</xref>). This indicates that in our construct the linking polypeptide between EC9 and EC10 can switch between the straight and L conformations. We estimate that the relative populations of the straight and split conformations are approximately equal.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-38770-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38770.009</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><p>Animation of 2D class averages of the PCDH15<sub>4EC</sub>/LHFPL5 complex demonstrating the “split” conformation.</p></caption></media><p>A third class of particles shows a dramatic bending of the entire extracellular domain relative to the micelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>, purple and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

The two ‘linkers’ connecting the EL domains to the PCDH15 TM helices act as a ‘hinge joint’, allowing the entire PCDH15 extracellular domains to swivel about an axis parallel to the axis connecting the two linkers, perhaps facilitating a tilted conformation of the PCDH15 extracellular domains upon formation of the mature tip link.</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-38770-video2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38770.010</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><p>Animation of 2D class averages of the PCDH15<sub>4EC</sub>/LHFPL5 complex demonstrating the “tilted” conformation.</p></caption></media><p>Careful inspection of all 2D classes also shows classes that are combinations of the split and tilted conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>).

In all likelihood, the split and tilted conformations are not two distinct conformations but rather represent views of a large ensemble of conformational states along a continuous range of motion. The observation that the straight population is sampled frequently enough to allow reconstruction of a 3D structure implies that the straight conformation is stabilized by the EC9 dimer interaction and perhaps by favorable interactions with LHFPL5.</p><media id="video3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-38770-video3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38770.011</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><p>Animation of 2D class averages of the PCDH15<sub>4EC</sub>/LHFPL5 complex demonstrating the bending of the cadherin chain in the “bend” conformation.</p></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Crystal structure of PCDH15 EC11-EL</title><p>Our understanding of the disk-like structure formed by the EC11 and EL domains in the 3D reconstruction of PCDH15<sub>4EC</sub> was hindered by the absence of sequence similarity of the EL domain to proteins of known structure.

A direct rigid-body fitting of the EC11-EL dimer, derived from the crystal structure, into the cryo-EM density map of the PCDH15<sub>4EC</sub>-LHFPL5 complex yields a correlation coefficient of 0.94 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The dimer has an oval, disk-like shape with long and short axes of 70 Å and 55 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Unlike the linear ‘top to bottom’ arrangement of cadherin domains, the EC11 and EL domains sit ‘side-by-side’, providing extensive interactions within each protomer and throughout the dimer interface. The interactions within each protomer are largely mediated by the β2a and β7 strands in EC11, and the β2 and β5 strands in EL, which together form a β-barrel like structure. A ‘major’ dimer interface is formed by contacts between EC11 and the EL domain of the symmetry related protomer (EL’). This interface is composed of β4, β5, and β3-β4 loop in EC11, and α1a and β2 in EL’ with a buried solvent accessible surface area of ~410 Å<sup>2</sup>. A ‘minor’ dimer interface is defined by contacts between EC11 on one protomer and EC11 on the second protomer (EC11’). The minor interface is formed by the guanidino group of Arg1163 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Asp1161 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>) burying 140 Å<sup>2</sup> of solvent accessible surface area. The C-terminus of the EL domain, which is composed of an α-helix and a loop, extends from the plane of the EC11-EL disk towards the membrane. Because the C-terminal loop in the soluble EC11-EL construct is not connected to a TM domain of PCDH15, its structure likely does not represent the conformation in an intact PCDH15 complex.</p><p>The EC11-EL structure displays a striking electrostatic potential distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c–h</xref>). EC11, with an isoelectric point (pI) of 9.4, mainly shows a positively charged surface, distinct from that of the EC8-10 domains, which have pIs ranging from 4.3 to 4.9. The EL domain has a pI of 5.1 and, accordingly, has a mainly negatively charged surface, except at the C-terminal extended helix, which forms a positive surface together with EC11. A top-down view of the EC11-EL dimer illustrates how residues from α1b and α2b of EL form a negatively charged cavity harboring a deafness mutation, Q1347K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ouyang et al., 2005</xref>), at the end of the α2b helix. We note that four conserved arginine residues and one lysine located at the bottom of EC11-EL form a highly positively charged area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). While the function of this basic patch is unknown, it may participate in interactions with other MET channel components.</p><p>We also note that there is a strong density in the x-ray maps with a ring-like feature located next to Ser1167, suggestive of O-linked glycosylation. We examined the fit of galactose, mannose and glucose to the density and found that mannose fit best (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Although the mannose moiety does not directly interact with other residues, it fills the EC11-EL dimer cavity and may help stabilize the dimer.</p><p>To measure the propensity of the isolated EC11-EL construct to dimerize, we determined the equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). Sedimentation coefficient distribution analysis showed clear transition of monomer to dimer as protein concentration increases from 0.1 to 58 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) and s<sub>w</sub> isotherm analysis using a simple monomer-dimer model yielded a K<sub>D</sub> of 5.7 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). We then attempted to estimate the dissociation rate constant by global analysis of data in three concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1i–k</xref>). The fitted k<sub>off</sub> shows a comparatively slow dissociation (3.5 × 10<sup>−4</sup> sec<sup>−1</sup>), which is consistent with the expectation from the c(s) overlays. While the micromolar dimer K<sub>D</sub> is relatively high, we note that the larger PCDH15<sub>4EC</sub>-LHFPL5 complex appears resistant to dissociation, even at submicromolar concentrations. We thus conclude that the transmembrane regions of the PCDH15-LHFPL5 complex substantially augment the stability of the dimer.</p><p>The diffraction of the EC11-EL domain crystals to 1.4 Å resolution, together with the formation of a dimer in solution, shows that the EC11-EL dimer is a robust and well-ordered structural motif. In micrographs of the PCDH15<sub>4EC</sub>/LHFPL5 complex we did not observe any particles that suggest separation of the EC11-EL dimer. In contrast, the dimer interface of EC9 appears to not form in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Araya-Secchi et al., 2016</xref>) and, in the PCDH15<sub>4EC</sub>-LHFPL5 complex, to readily dissociate. The EC11-EL domain, therefore, acts as a robust structural unit, forming a ‘collar’ that locks the bottom of the filament-like cadherin chains and accepts the pulling force from the cadherin domains. It might be critical to direct the force to the extended helix and loop of the EL domain, which then acts on the PCDH15 TM helix to gate the MET channel.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cryo-EM structure of PCDH15<sub>1EC</sub>-LHFPL5</title><p>To elucidate the structure of the transmembrane (TM) domains of the PCDH15-LHFPL5 complex we screened additional constructs by mcFSEC, negative stain EM, and cryo-EM. We discovered that a construct containing domains EC11 to CR, named PCDH15<sub>1EC</sub> hereafter, when coexpressed with full length LHFPL5 yielded a well behaved complex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Cryo-EM micrographs showed that this complex yielded near ideal particle distribution and ice thickness, allowing us to use higher magnification and collect micrographs without the use of the Volta phase plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>).

A 3D reconstruction at ~4.5 Å resolution displayed three layers of density: a top layer formed by the EC11-EL domain, well fitted with the previously described crystal structure; a middle layer formed by the β-strand region of LHFPL5 and the extended C-terminal helix of the EL domain; and a bottom layer formed by the TM domains of PCDH15 and LHFPL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2c–e</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

We carefully explored alternative fittings of the LHFPL5 model to the density map yet found no better fits, thus demonstrating that the two ‘central’ helical densities must belong to PCDH15. The two LHFPL5 protomers of the complex interact with one another, via contacts mediated by TM1 helices, which are arranged in a V-shape. The two central helices belonging to the PCDH15 dimer possess an inverted V-shaped architecture and insert into the V-shape formed by LHFPL5. We built an initial structure for the PCDH15 TM helices by rigid-body fitting an ideal α-helix into the density and then optimized the overall models manually and with the help of computational tools, as detailed in the methods section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). We were able to model all α-helical regions and most of the β-strands of LHFPL5 with the exception of a short loop between β-strands 1 and 2 as well as a long loop between TM helix 3 and β-stand 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2g and h</xref>). This latter loop contributes a strong density that covers the LHFPL5 β-sheet but is not well enough resolved to trace the peptide chain. While we based the amino acid sequence register on tryptophan residues in LHFPL5 and on prominent features in the TM helix of PCDH15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2g</xref>), we will not discuss details of side chain interactions here due to the limited resolution of present reconstruction. We also do not visualize the cytoplasmic C-terminus of PCDH15 that includes the CR region and thus are not able provide a structural model for interactions between the CR region and LHFPL5 found in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Within the TM region there are extensive interactions between PCDH15 and LHFPL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d and e</xref>). Each PCDH15 protomer makes more extensive interactions with one LHFPL5 protomer (1100 Å<sup>2</sup> buried surface area, BSA) compared to the other (LHFPL5’, 270 Å<sup>2</sup> BSA). We note that within the TM domains dimerization is primarily mediated by the interface of TM1 from LHFPL5 (487 Å<sup>2</sup> BSA) together with the interaction of PCDH15 with TM1 of LHFPL5’. While there is a small interface of interactions between the 2-fold related PCDH15 TM helices (126 Å<sup>2</sup> BSA), it likely is only a minor contributor to the stability of the complex.</p><p>The extracellular domain of PCDH15 is situated ‘on top’ of the LHFPL5 β-sheet, but only minor direct interactions are apparent. The closest distances are between the LHFPL5 β3-β4 loop and the β5-β6 loop in EC11, as well as between strand β4 of LHFPL5 and the β3-β4 loop of the EL domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). However, the closest Cα distances are 8.5 Å and 9 Å, respectively, indicating that the interface is likely not extensive. There is also an interaction between the LHFPL5 β-sheet and the helical area of the linker between the EL domain and the TM helix of PCDH15. The density for the PCDH15 linker region is not well defined, indicating that the linker is flexible.</p><p>To probe the register of the PCDH15 TM helix, we individually mutated every residue near the extracellular portion of PCDH15 to cysteine and tested for spontaneous formation of a redox dependent dimer by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2h and i</xref>). We found that residues 1373–1379 readily crosslinked, residues 1380–1382 allowed for partial crosslinking, and residues 1383–1386 did not crosslink. The lack of crosslinking of residues 1383–1386 is consistent with our model because these residues are separated by LHFPL5. While the crosslinking of the other residues is consistent with their close proximity in our model, the lack of a clearly defined periodicity indicates that the tip of the helices and the linker region are somewhat flexible. This result, together with the lack of substantial interactions between the extracellular domain and LHFPL5, as well as the weak density for the linker region, paints a picture of an extracellular domain that has the freedom to move substantially with regard to the transmembrane region, as observed in the tilted conformation of the PCDH15<sub>4EC</sub>-LHFPL5 complex structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Complete model of PCDH15<sub>4EC</sub>/LHFPL5 complex</title><p>By rigid body fitting the PCDH15<sub>1EC</sub> -LHFPL5 structure into the PCDH15<sub>4EC</sub> -LHFPL5 density we built an almost complete model of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The model shows that the 4 cadherin domains stretch 220 Å above the membrane, with the EC11-EL domain positioned ~27 Å above the TM region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The cadherin domains have a right handed twist of 23.9° from EC11 to EC8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref>), consistent with a right-handed coil of the tip link observed in high-resolution EM imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kachar et al., 2000</xref>). However, the observed twist is not enough to explain a 60 nm periodicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kachar et al., 2000</xref>), which would require a 120° turn over the length of the ~20 nm cadherin chain. It is possible that the degree of twist is stronger towards the <italic>N</italic>-terminus of the cadherin chain or that the twist is not formed spontaneously, but is instead the result of rotation of either end of the tip link. It is also probable that the observed stiffness is a unique property of the EC11-EC10 pair due to the embedding of EC11 into the EC11-EL collar.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38770.018</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Complete model of the PCDH15<sub>4EC</sub>/LHFPL5 complex.</title><p>(a) Complete model generated from fitting subunits into the PCDH15<sub>4EC</sub>/LHFPL5 map, shown together with the map.

This is caused by a 23° outward tilt of EC9, compared to the other cadherin domains that show substantially smaller tilts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). This tilt facilitates the dimer interaction of EC9. While these observations might be skewed by the relatively small proportion of particles in the final reconstruction or by the imposed C2 symmetry, the separation of EC8 and tilt of EC9 is apparent in 2D class averages of the straight as well as the tilted conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p>A striking feature of our model is the overall geometry of the linker connecting the PCDH15 transmembrane helix with the EL region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The two PCDH15 transmembrane helices come within 7 Å of one another at the extracellular side of the membrane. As the linkers transition toward the extracellular domain they separate, resulting in a distance of 21 Å of the Cα atoms at the <italic>N</italic>-terminal end of the linker α-helix. The main chain then connects to β-strand 6, which extends to the outside of the EL domain, resulting in a final separation of 62 Å. This suggests that a pulling force acting on the cadherin chain would pull the extracellular tips of the PCDH15 transmembrane helices apart. This architecture is consistent with a role of the EC11-EL collar in providing a local geometry of the polypeptide chain that could facilitate conversion of a pulling force into a conformational change that ultimately leads to an opening of the MET channel.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we demonstrate that PCDH15 forms a robust complex with LHFPL5 and that the assembly is composed of 2 copies of each protein, thus providing concrete evidence that the composition of PCDH15 in the tip link is a dimer. The conformationally mobile EC8-EC10 domains are poised to facilitate the search for CDH23 during tip link formation while the membrane proximal EC11-EL domain forms a robust, dimeric collar, which we speculate aids in transduction of force to the membrane-embedded PCDH15 TM helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The PCDH15 TM domains, in turn, are stabilized by extensive interactions with 2 LHFPL5 subunits, interactions that are consistent with LHFPL5 being important for assembly and trafficking of PCDH15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, deafness mutations in LHFPL5 do not affect the interaction of PCDH15 and LHFPL5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>) and in our structure do not localize to interaction sites of PCDH15 and LHFPL5, suggesting that LHFPL5 interacts with additional components of the mechanotransduction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beurg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Because the material obtained for structure determination is not purified from hair cells we cannot exclude the possibility that the unique cellular architecture, proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krey et al., 2017</xref>) or lipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>) of hair cells could influence the conformation of the complex and the observed interactions between the protein components.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38770.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Hypothesis for the role of the PCDH15<sub>4EC</sub>/LHFPL5 complex in mechanotransduction.</title><p>With the hair bundle of a hair-cell at rest the PCDH15 –LHFPL5 complex could either adopt the straight (<bold>a</bold>) or tilted-conformation (<bold>c</bold>), depending on whether the orientation of the membrane surrounding PCDH15 is perpendicular to the tip-link direction. Deflection of the hair bundle applies force to the PCDH15 cadherin domain chain (F<sub>c</sub>) (<bold>b, d</bold>). This might result in the conversion from the tilted (<bold>c</bold>) to the straight conformation (<bold>b</bold>) or from the straight conformation (<bold>a</bold>) to the tilted conformation (<bold>d</bold>). In the case of the straight conformation (<bold>b</bold>) F<sub>c</sub> is converted by the EC11-EL collar to a force on the linkers that, due to the local geometry, is no longer perpendicular to the membrane (F<sub>l</sub>). We speculate that this could pull the PCDH15 transmembrane helices apart (F<sub>t</sub>). White boxes with a dashed outline represent TMC, TMIE, or other so far unidentified proteins that could bind to either PCDH15 or LHFPL5 and sense this movement of the PCDH15 transmembrane helix or the change in membrane environment, ultimately leading to the opening of the MET channel.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-38770-fig6-v2"/></fig><p>The two linker regions connecting the PCDH15 collar with the TM domains might act as ‘ligaments’ of a hinge joint, allowing the tilting of the PCDH15 extracellular domains. Therefore, PCDH15 could accommodate a membrane orientation at the lower insertion point that is not perpendicular to the tip link (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It is also possible that PCDH15 will assume a straight conformation at rest and a tilted conformation under tension, or vice versa. Experiments that measure the angle between the PCDH15 extracellular domain and the membrane as a function of bundle deflection will be needed to address this question. Our observation that the PCDH15 extracellular domain only tilts along one direction could be related to the directional sensitivity of the hair bundle towards deflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shotwell et al., 1981</xref>). We speculate that force transduced through the PCDH15 cadherin domains leads to separation of the PCDH15 TM helices, near the extracellular side of the membrane, and potentially to the conversion between the straight and tilted conformations. These conformational changes could ultimately lead to the gating of the MET ion channel. Taken together, our studies define the architecture, stoichiometry and conformational dynamics of the PCDH15-LHFPL5 complex, thus providing insight into the trafficking, assembly and function of the MET channel of hair cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

C2 symmetry was used in the following processes. The refined particles were subjected to 3D local classification into four classes with a soft mask.

The refined particles were further classified into four classes with no alignment in RELION. One class showed obvious better features in the β-sheet area of LHFPL5 and transmembrane helices and was selected for final refinement.

The orientation of the C-terminal extended helix of the EL domain was adjusted by rigid-body fitting into the density. Density belonging to LHFPL5 was identified by rigid-body fitting the crystal structure of claudin-15 (PDB code: 4P79). The PCDH15<sub>1EC</sub> helix was constructed as an ideal helix and rigid-body fitted into the remaining density. An initial PCDH15<sub>1EC</sub>-LHFPL5 model was constructed using Rosetta-CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Song et al., 2013</xref>) using the initial model of PCDH15<sub>1EC</sub> and the crystal structures of claudin-4 (PDB code: 5B2G), claudin-15 (PDB code: 4P79), and calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit gamma 1 (PDB code: 5GJV) as templates. The best scoring models were manually inspected and the most reasonable model with a cross correlation coefficient of 0.815 (0.848 for backbone atoms) was used as a starting model. Tyr1377 in PCDH15<sub>1EC</sub> showing clear side chain density was used as a marker of the PCDH15<sub>1EC</sub> transmembrane helix register, together with Pro1395, which is located at the slight bend of the TM helix. Trp29, Trp132, and Trp177, each with substantial side chain densities, were used to inform the register of LHFPL5 transmembrane helices 1, 3, and 4, respectively. A disulfide bond composed of Cys114 on TM2 and Cys130 on TM3 was used to inform the register of LHFPL5 TM2. The densities corresponding to the extracellular region of LHFPL5 were not clear enough to show individual β-strands. The extracellular region of the crystal structures of claudin-15 and claudin-19 were then used to help guide the β-strand orientation and location. Individual β-strands of claudin-15 were rigid-body fitted into the density, mutated to LHFPL5 sequences based on multiple sequence alignments and manually refined in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>). A highly conserved disulfide bond, which also exists in all templates, was built between Cys68 on β3 and Cys79 on β4. The linkers between each β-strand were also manually built and refined in Coot. The loop between TM3 and the fifth β-strand of LHFPL5 (Asp153-Leu170) as well as the loop between the first and second β-strand (Ser55-Pro57) were not built due to lack of side chain densities in the region. Due to weak density, the terminal residues Val2-Tyr14 and Gly200-Val219 of LHFPL5 and residues Gln1411-His1462 of PCDH15<sub>1EC</sub> were not included in the model.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lawrence Shapiro (Reviewer #1); Anthony J Ricci (Reviewer #2); Gregory M Alushin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting and important piece of work that provides structural evidence for how two components of the tip link macromolecular structure interact and how these interactions might play into force transfer due to hair bundle motion. Using heterologous co-expression in mammalian cells and FSEC analysis, the authors identify a stable subcomplex of PCDH15 and LHFPL5, a putative component of the MET channel, with no direct interaction detected between PCDH15 and two other putative MET components (TMC1 and TMIE). They then perform an extensive structural analysis of this complex using a combined approach of cryo-EM of stable regions and X-ray crystallography of key domains, as well as supporting AUC and cysteine cross-linking experiments. In sum, their experiments identify a long, flexible PCDH shaft linked to a stable EC11-EL collar, which could transduce mechanical forces applied to the shaft into separation of transmembrane helices, potentially facilitating gating of the MET channel. This is a great start for a unique and critical channel that has resisted prior attempts at molecular characterization.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- In Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and the Results section, the authors claim that separation of β-strands and a well-defined α-helix in the density map validates their docking. These features should not be visible in an 11 Å resolution map: the fit should rather be guided by shape complimentarity of rigid-body docked domains (which is what the authors actually do). Furthermore, there is no visible α-helical density (or an α-helix in the model) in Figure 2—figure supplement 2G. It is recommended to remove this from the text.</p><p>- For all their model-map comparisons, the authors employ a FSC 0.25 criterion. There is no statistical basis for choosing this criterion: an FSC 0.5 is appropriate for model-map comparisons.

Please don't perpetuate this, unless the authors have a specific justification.</p><p>- The Discussion and Figure 6 would benefit from a discussion of the implications of the tilted conformations of the PCDH15 rod relative to the transmembrane/collar regions, a major observation which goes unmentioned in the model. The interpretation of the data should be left to the authors, but a few possibilities can be envisioned. One would be that tilting of the rod could also be an activation mechanism. Another would be that tilting encodes a directional preference to activation, as has been observed by Hudspeth and colleagues (e.g. the rod tilts if pulled in the wrong direction, preventing inappropriate channel opening). Obviously, the authors' data don't strongly support any model over another at this stage, but it could stimulate future work to acknowledge more possibilities than the straight conformation being the relevant one for activation.</p><p>- Stated in the Abstract as well as the Discussion is that new light is shed upon how force from PCDH15 is translated to the MET channel.

As the authors describe, while the overall architecture of the system for hearing perception is well understood, including the existence of a PCDH15-attached MET channel whose open probability is modulated by tension of the tip link, which in turn is modulated by auditory deflection of hair cell stereocilia, molecular knowledge of the system is sparse. While numerous putative components of the hair cell MET channel have been identified, these components have not been successfully reconstituted and the architecture of the MET complex remains unknown.</p><p>Here, Gouaux and colleagues begin to reconstitute the system through which auditory perception is mediated. Beginning with an extracellularly truncated PCDH15, the authors screen putative channel components, identifying a stable PCDH15/LHFPL5 complex, which they characterize and reconstruct by cryo-EM. This PCDH15 construct contains a non-cadherin &quot;EL&quot; domain downstream from EC11. They produce a high-resolution structure of this fragment, revealing the EL domain to form a collar around the dimeric PCDH15 ectodomain near the membrane insertion point. This high-resolution structure is used in interpretation of the cryo-EM reconstruction of the PCDH15 complex with LHFPL5, revealing two molecules of the claudin-like LHFPL5 to act as a clamp on the dimeric PCDH15 within the membrane.</p><p>Overall this is an excellent paper. While the results do not reveal the architecture of the MET channel, they do reveal the first &quot;layer&quot; of association, providing a jumping off point to assemble the rest of the channel. This is a great start for a unique and critical channel that has resisted prior attempts at molecular characterization. Overall, this is an excellent contribution, highly appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting and important piece of works that provides structural evidence for how two components of the tip link macromolecular structure interact and how these interactions might play into force transfer due to hair bundle motion. My comments are relatively minor and go largely at physiological relevance. These include:</p><p>1) Stated in the Abstract as well as the Discussion is that new light is shed upon how force from PCDH15 is translated to the MET channel. I don't see how data provided does this specifically. At best the work has implications for how force might be translated across the membrane but unless we know how the channel is integrated into the complex we cannot say how the force is presented to the channel can we?</p><p>2) The text in the second paragraph of the Introduction is a bit overstated about what we know and not particularly complete.

Does the expression system matter? Are there differences post-translationally that could alter interactions?</p><p>4) Although TMC1 was include as part of the pulldowns, the data was not discussed? How are these data interpreted? Is the interaction between PCDH15 and LHFPL5 altered by addition of other known proteins? Is it altered by the specific lipid environment that it was prepared in?</p><p>5) Subsection “Cryo-EM structure of PCDH15<sub>4EC</sub>-LHFPL5”, end of last paragraph – probably best to leave speculation in the Discussion, as you don't know the tension required to move between conformations or that the difference between states is tension dependent (although it might be) better to describe the idea along with the model diagrams at the end.</p><p>6) Subsection “Crystal structure of PCDH15 EC11-EL”, third paragraph – is there a Figure 5—figure supplement 1F?</p><p>7) Subsection “Cryo-EM structure of PCDH15<sub>1EC</sub>-LHFPL5”, third paragraph – how are the extensive interactions within the TM region likely affected by the lipid environment? Do you expect these interactions to be altered by the additional TM proteins found in this region?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In their manuscript &quot;Structure of protocadherin 15 of the stereocilia tip link in complex with LHFPL5&quot;, Ge, Elferich, and colleagues make an important step forward in defining the biophysical mechanism of mechanotransduction in hair cells, one of the abiding mysteries in this field. Using heterologous co-expression in mammalian cells and FSEC analysis, the authors identify a stable subcomplex of PCDH15 and LHFPL5, a putative component of the MET channel, with no direct interaction detected between PCDH15 and two other putative MET components (TMC1 and TMIE).

In sum, their experiments identify a long, flexible PCDH shaft linked to a stable EC11-EL collar, which could transduce mechanical forces applied to the shaft into separation of transmembrane helices, potentially facilitating gating of the MET channel.</p><p>While substantial future efforts will be required to define the full MET complex and its gating mechanism, this study makes an important contribution in defining a bona fide subcomplex and describing its detailed structure, which will guide future studies both in vivo and in vitro. Overall, the experimental work is extremely thorough and, to this reviewer, convincing. I believe this story adds up to a satisfying advance, and I think it is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> pending the address of minor concerns outlined below, without further experimental work.</p><p>Minor concerns:</p><p>- In Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and the Results section, the authors claim that separation of β-strands and a well-defined α-helix in the density map validates their docking.
