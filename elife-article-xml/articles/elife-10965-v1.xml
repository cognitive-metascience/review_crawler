To make a protein, the DNA within a gene is copied to produce molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) that are then used as templates to build proteins via a process called translation. This process – which involves protein machines called ribosomes binding to the start of the mRNA – is tightly regulated to control the amounts of particular proteins in cells. For example, in fruit fly ovaries, a protein called Bruno both represses and activates the translation of a gene known as <italic>oskar</italic>. To achieve this, Bruno binds to regions near the end of the <italic>oskar</italic> RNA known as Bruno response elements.</p><p>It is not clear how Bruno acts to control translation. However, because ribosomes begin translation near the start of the mRNA, while Bruno is bound to regions near the end of the mRNA, there must be long-range interactions between the two ends of the mRNA. It is generally assumed that such long-range interactions only occur between proteins that are bound to the same mRNA molecule. However, in 2010, researchers observed that Bruno response elements within one <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA could influence the translation of other <italic>oskar</italic> mRNAs. This is known as “regulation in <italic>trans”</italic>. Here, Macdonald et al. – including some of the researchers from the earlier work – investigated this observation in more detail in fruit flies.</p><p>In cells, multiple mRNA molecules and their associated proteins can assemble into particles. Macdonald et al. proposed that the close proximity of many mRNA molecules in these particles could allow <italic>trans</italic> regulation to take place. Indeed, the experiments found that blocking the assembly of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA into particles inhibited <italic>trans</italic> regulation as expected. Macdonald et al. also asked if <italic>trans</italic> regulation can occur between mRNAs that encode different proteins. The experiments show that <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA could block the translation of an mRNA produced by the <italic>gurken</italic> gene, even when <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA was not being translated. More work is needed to find out how widely <italic>trans</italic> regulation is used to control translation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10965.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10965.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>translational regulation</kwd><kwd>regulation in trans</kwd><kwd>RNP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM096730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Macdonald</surname><given-names>Paul M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Regulatory elements in an mRNA that act in <italic>cis</italic> to influence translation can also exert their effects in <italic>trans</italic>, in a process dependent on assembly of the mRNAs into particles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Translation happens when a ribosome assembles productively on an mRNA. A number of molecular interactions influence the proper convergence of these parts, often involving RNA elements or factors at the opposite ends of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). For example, Poly(A) binding protein (PABP) binds to the poly(A) tail at the 3’ end of an mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mangus et al., 2003</xref>) and enhances translation through its interaction with eIF4G, a protein associated with the 5’ cap of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tarun et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sonenberg and Dever, 2003</xref>). Similarly, many repressors of translation bind to elements in the 3’ untranslated regions (3’ UTRs) of mRNAs and interfere with the normal action of initiation factors at the 5’ end of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gebauer and Hentze, 2004</xref>). Such long-range protein-protein interactions, spanning the full length of the mRNA, are generally assumed to occur only in <italic>cis</italic>: PABP bound to the tail of one molecule of mRNA is expected to bind only the eIF4G associated with the other end of the same mRNA. In principle, however, inter-transcript interactions are also possible, and their likelihood depends on the concentration of the mRNAs. When mRNAs are dilute, intra-transcript interactions will predominate, but as the local density of mRNAs increases, inter-transcript interactions become more likely.</p><p>Previously, we described an example involving the <italic>Drosophila oskar (osk</italic>) mRNA, in which control elements on one transcript influenced translation of another transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reveal et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>osk</italic> mRNA is expressed during oogenesis, and is subject to multiple forms of post-transcriptional control. Following transcription in the nurse cells of each egg chamber, <italic>osk</italic> mRNA is transported through cytoplasmic connections to the transcriptionally-silent oocyte. Eventually, as oogenesis proceeds, <italic>osk</italic> mRNA localizes to the posterior pole of the oocyte, and only then does Osk protein begin to accumulate. Translation of <italic>osk</italic> mRNA is highly regulated: repression prevents premature translation from unlocalized mRNA, and activation turns on translation of the localized mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim-Ha et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Markussen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rongo et al., 1995</xref>). Both types of regulation rely on binding sites for Bruno (Bru) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reveal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim-Ha et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Webster et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reveal et al., 2011</xref>). These sites, BREs and others, reside in two clusters - the AB and C regions - near the opposite ends of the 3’ UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All the BREs contribute to translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim-Ha et al., 1995</xref>), and the C region BREs also play a role in translational activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reveal et al., 2010</xref>). Strikingly, defects in either repression (from mutation of all BREs in <italic>osk ABC BRE<sup>-</sup></italic>) or activation (from mutation of the C BREs in <italic>osk C BRE<sup>-</sup></italic>) can be rescued by the presence of another <italic>osk</italic> mRNA, one that itself cannot make Osk protein but has all regulatory elements intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reveal et al., 2010</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10965.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rescue of <italic>osk</italic> expression in <italic>trans</italic> is not limited to Bru-dependent regulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the <italic>osk</italic> mRNA showing sites of mutations discussed in the text.

A proposed mechanism for translational repression by Bru relies on such a long-range interaction. Bru binds Cup, a protein that competes with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E, the 5’ cap-binding protein. Cup engagement of eIF4E at the expense of the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction blocks translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakamura et al., 2004</xref>). In our model, the Bru/Cup complex bound to the rescuing mRNA would bridge to eIF4E bound to the cap of the mRNA unable to bind Bru, thereby conferring translational repression. We hypothesized that assembly of <italic>osk</italic> mRNAs into ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) places the mRNAs in close proximity, thus increasing their concentration and facilitating inter-transcript interactions to allow 'regulation in <italic>trans'</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reveal et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>If this hypothesis is correct, several features of 'regulation in <italic>trans'</italic> are expected. First, the rescuing (donor) mRNA should have the regulatory element that the rescued (recipient) mRNA lacks. Second, rescue in <italic>trans</italic> should not be Bru-specific, but should extend to other forms of regulation that also rely on long-range protein-protein interactions. Finally, rescue in <italic>trans</italic> would depend on the <italic>cis</italic>-acting <italic>osk</italic> mRNA elements and <italic>trans</italic>-acting proteins that mediate RNP assembly.</p><p>Several participants in <italic>osk</italic> RNP assembly are known - Polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB), Bru and an RNA dimerization motif - and all are candidates to support rescue in <italic>trans</italic>. PTB binds <italic>osk</italic> mRNA to form RNPs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Besse et al., 2009</xref>). PTB also mediates association of <italic>osk</italic> mRNAs in vivo, as shown by the effects of loss of PTB on hitchhiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Besse et al., 2009</xref>), the phenomenon in which localization-competent <italic>osk</italic> mRNAs can assist other mRNAs in moving to the posterior pole of the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hachet and Ephrussi, 2004</xref>). Similarly, Bru mediates in vitro oligomerization of RNAs with an unusually high density of Bru binding sites and could also oligomerize <italic>osk</italic> mRNA in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chekulaeva et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, <italic>osk</italic> mRNA undergoes direct RNA dimerization, relying on a dimerization motif in the 3’ UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jambor et al., 2011</xref>). Elimination of one or more types of <italic>osk</italic> RNP assembly would be expected to block rescue in <italic>trans</italic> if our hypothesis is correct.</p><p>Here, we show that all these expectations for the 'regulation in <italic>trans'</italic> model are met. Disruption of individual contributions to RNP assembly reveals that PTB has a critical role in rescue in <italic>trans</italic>, with direct RNA dimerization being much less important. Furthermore, we provide evidence that regulation imposed by embedded <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in <italic>osk</italic> mRNA spreads to the another mRNA bound by PTB, the <italic>gurken (grk)</italic> mRNA, thus revealing a community effect in translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Many, but not all, <italic>osk</italic> regulatory mutants can be rescued in <italic>trans</italic></title><p>Previously, we found that translational regulatory defects associated with mutation of Bru binding sites were rescued in <italic>trans</italic>. To determine if rescue in <italic>trans</italic> is a property unique to Bru-dependent regulation, or more general, we have now identified and tested additional regulatory mutants.</p><p>The <italic>osk</italic> gene produces two Osk isoforms, Long Osk and Short Osk, from two translation start codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Markussen et al., 1995</xref>). The <italic>oskM1R∆121–150</italic> mutant lacks the start codon for Long Osk and has a 30 nt deletion in the 5’ UTR for Short Osk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This mutant is largely defective in Short Osk protein production, in addition to making no Long Osk because of the M1R mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kanke and Macdonald, 2015</xref>). Although coexpression with <italic>osk<sup>54</sup></italic> (a protein null mutant with a short DNA insertion, introducing a stop codon at the end of the first exon) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim-Ha et al., 1991</xref>) strongly rescues the activation defect of <italic>osk C BRE<sup>-</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), no significant rescue of the <italic>oskM1R∆121–150</italic> activation defect was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Therefore, the <italic>oskM1R∆121–150</italic> mutant is not sensitive to rescue in <italic>trans</italic>.</p><p>Mutations positioned close to the 3’ end of the <italic>osk</italic> mRNA also disrupt Osk expression. Mutants <italic>osk3’977–981</italic> and <italic>osk3’984–988</italic> (numbering indicates position in the <italic>osk</italic> 3’ UTR) have almost no <italic>osk</italic> patterning activity and are strongly defective in Osk protein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ryu and Macdonald, 2015</xref>). Mutant <italic>osk3’1004–1008</italic>, in which an A-rich sequence is disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kanke et al., 2015</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), also had strongly reduced <italic>osk</italic> patterning activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although these mutations are positioned close to Bru-binding sites in the <italic>osk</italic> 3’ UTR C region, they have little or no effect on Bru binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim-Ha et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ryu and Macdonald, 2015</xref>). Instead, the 977–980 and 984–988 mutations disrupt binding of BSF protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ryu and Macdonald, 2015</xref>), while the sequence affected by mutation 1004–1008 is a binding site for Poly(A) binding protein (PABP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vazquez-Pianzola et al., 2011</xref>). The patterning defects of all three of these mutants were strongly rescued by coexpression of <italic>osk<sup>54</sup></italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ryu and Macdonald, 2015</xref>]).

Notably, by the model of 'regulation in <italic>trans'</italic> only the former type of regulatory element should be sensitive to rescue in <italic>trans</italic>, consistent with the results.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Many mutant <italic>osk</italic> mRNAs can act as donors for rescue in <italic>trans</italic></title><p>Thus far, <italic>osk<sup>54</sup></italic> has been used as the donor for rescue in <italic>trans</italic> of <italic>osk</italic> mRNA regulatory defects.

In a more selective approach, the <italic>osk</italic> mRNA is modified, mutating elements involved in RNP assembly. With donor <italic>osk</italic> transgenes defective in one or more types of RNP assembly, any change in the ability to rescue the activation defect of the <italic>osk::GFP C BRE<sup>-</sup></italic> recipient mRNA can be monitored.</p><p>Testing the role of Bru-mediated <italic>osk</italic> mRNA oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chekulaeva et al., 2006</xref>) is problematic, as the Bru sites are also required to provide the missing regulatory element for <italic>osk C BRE<sup>-</sup></italic> (above). However, the other contributions to assembly - mRNA dimerization and PTB-dependent RNP assembly - can be manipulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Direct <italic>osk</italic> mRNA dimerization requires a RNA element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jambor et al., 2011</xref>), which is deleted in mutant <italic>osk3’∆665–685</italic> (labeled as <italic>dimer<sup>-</sup></italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

These sites are spread throughout the <italic>osk</italic> mRNA 3’ UTR (as shown by RNA binding assays), although individual sites have not been defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Besse et al., 2009</xref>). However, because the binding specificity of <italic>Drosophila</italic> PTB is likely to be very similar or identical to that of the highly conserved mammalian homolog, for which binding sites have been characterized by a combination of approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pérez et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xue et al., 2009</xref>), candidate sites can be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mutating all the candidate sites (consisting of pyrimidine tracts or PTs) is the simplest strategy to disrupt PTB binding, but introducing so many mutations increases the probability of an inadvertent effect on rescue in <italic>trans</italic>. To strike a balance between these design considerations, a subset of the PT sequences was mutated (<italic>osk3’PT<sup>mut</sup></italic>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), focusing on those with features associated with the strongest sites for mammalian PTB binding, while avoiding mutations that might also disrupt <italic>osk</italic> mRNA dimerization or Bru binding. A UV crosslinking competition binding assay was used to determine if the PT mutations affected PTB binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Remarkably, the type of <italic>osk</italic> mRNA present did affect Grk protein levels.

Importantly, none of the <italic>osk</italic> mRNAs in these experiments produce any Osk protein at these stages of oogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that <italic>osk</italic> mRNA, not Osk protein, influences Grk expression.

Similarly, neither IBE mutant restored protein expression of the <italic>osk::GFP C BRE<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, data not shown). Failure to rescue strongly was not due to insufficient mRNA, as both IBE mutant <italic>osk</italic> mRNAs were present at high levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

We made two new mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>), each affecting a subset of IBEs implicated in activation of <italic>osk</italic> translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Munro et al., 2006</xref>). In mutant <italic>osk 11-13-,</italic> the 3’-most IBEs (subset D) were altered. Instead of mutating the central position in the UUUAY pentamer from U to G (as in the original <italic>osk IBE<sup>-</sup></italic>mutants), each nucleotide of each pentamer was changed, and so a stronger defect in binding - to Imp or to the unknown factor - is expected. Notably, the <italic>osk 11-13-</italic> mutant had normal Osk accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). For mutant <italic>osk 3'∆83–116</italic>, the entire region encompassing the 5’-most IBEs (subset A) was deleted. Again, this mutant is expected to more strongly disrupt Imp/unknown binding than the corresponding <italic>osk IBE-</italic> mutant, but it had normal Osk accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, the original IBE mutations appear to disrupt translational activation of <italic>osk</italic> mRNA not by removing a binding site, but by creating a novel type of element, such as a binding site for another factor.</p><p>The new mutants lacking subsets of IBEs were also tested for the ability to act as donors for rescue in <italic>trans</italic>. The activation-defective <italic>osk:GFP C BRE-</italic> was used as the recipient, and we monitored GFP to determine if activation was rescued. The original <italic>osk IBE-</italic> mutant did not substantially rescue translation of the recipient mRNA. By contrast, both <italic>osk 3'∆83–116</italic> and <italic>osk 11-13-</italic> mutants strongly rescued translational activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). It seems likely, then, that the gain-of-function property of the original IBE<sup>-</sup> mutations not only disrupts <italic>osk</italic> mRNA translation, but also interferes with the ability of the mRNA to participate in rescue in <italic>trans</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Long-range interactions involving structures or factors associated with the different ends of an individual mRNA are required for translation. Such interactions are not inherently intra-transcript, and a factor bound to the 5’ end of one mRNA could engage a factor bound to a 3’ region of another mRNA. Nevertheless, inter-transcript interactions have generally not been considered in models of translation or its regulation. The <italic>osk</italic> mRNA is an exception, displaying the notable property of rescue of regulatory mutations in <italic>trans</italic>. We suggested that this phenomenon results from inter-transcript interactions, with the participating mRNAs placed in close proximity in RNPs to facilitate the interactions. The work described here establishes parameters for this rescue in <italic>trans</italic>, shows that conditions which reduce RNP assembly diminish rescue in <italic>trans</italic> and provides evidence that regulation imposed on the <italic>osk</italic> mRNA influences the expression of <italic>grk</italic> mRNA by a similar <italic>trans</italic> effect. Our results are fully consistent with and lend considerable support to the model of 'regulation in <italic>trans'</italic>.</p><p>We have now asked which regulatory defects in the recipient mRNAs can be rescued in <italic>trans</italic>, and what features are required in the donor mRNAs to allow rescue. Learning more about the underlying rules can provide support for, or argue against, the model of 'regulation in <italic>trans'</italic>.</p><p>We first consider the recipient mRNAs. In the context of the proposed model, mutations affecting long-range regulatory interactions should be susceptible to rescue in <italic>trans</italic>, while other types of regulatory defects would not. Testing new regulatory mutants as recipients, we found that three mutants with mutations in the 3’ UTR could be rescued in <italic>trans</italic>, while a mutant with defects in the 5’ region of the mRNA could not. Sensitivity of the 3’ UTR regulatory elements to rescue in <italic>trans</italic> is consistent with their participation in long-range interactions to activate translation. In particular, the <italic>osk3’1004–1008</italic> mutant is defective in an A-rich element, which likely serves to bind PABP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vazquez-Pianzola et al., 2011</xref>). PABP interacts with the translation initiation factor eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tarun et al., 1997</xref>), associated with the mRNA 5’ cap, and this interaction has the potential to occur between different transcripts. As for the 5’ region mutant which is not rescued in <italic>trans</italic>, why activation of translation is defective is not understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kanke and Macdonald, 2015</xref>), but the position of the mutations suggests a local, rather than long-range, effect on initiation of translation.</p><p>Experiments addressing the requirements for an mRNA to act as a donor in rescue in <italic>trans</italic> lead to several conclusions. First, we find that the element missing from the recipient must be provided by the donor, as predicted by the model of 'regulation in <italic>trans'</italic> [but also consistent with other models - see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wilusz and Wilusz, 2010</xref>)]. Second, although the missing element is required in the donor, it is not sufficient, and additional 3’ UTR sequences must be present to obtain a substantial degree of rescue. These results are also consistent with 'regulation in <italic>trans'</italic>, with the additional sequences presumably acting to promote interactions between the different transcripts and thus allow the missing regulatory element to act in <italic>trans</italic>. Third, many <italic>osk</italic> mRNAs can act as donors for rescue in <italic>trans</italic>; this appears to be the default property. Even if an <italic>osk</italic> mRNA is not receptive to rescue in <italic>trans</italic>, this does not exclude the possibility that it can act as a donor. For example, the <italic>oskM1R∆121–150</italic> mutant cannot be rescued in <italic>trans</italic> but is a strong donor. Again, these observations are consistent with 'regulation in <italic>trans'</italic>, in which the donor mRNA need not itself be translated, it needs only to contain the regulatory element missing from the recipient as well as sequences that mediate association of the different mRNAs. Fourth, there are mutations which interfere with the ability of an <italic>osk</italic> mRNA to act as a donor for rescue in <italic>trans</italic>. These fall into two groups, the enigmatic IBE mutant, and the mutants designed to disrupt RNP assembly.</p><p>The IBE mutant is completely defective in activation of <italic>osk</italic> mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Munro et al., 2006</xref>) and cannot be rescued in <italic>trans</italic>. As a donor, the IBE mutant confers only very weak rescue of other regulatory defects. New mutants targeting the IBEs, which more substantially alter or eliminate the IBE motifs, have no regulatory defects and are strong donors for rescue in <italic>trans</italic>. Thus, the original IBE mutations appear to cause a dominant gain-of-function defect, perhaps by serendipitous formation of a binding site for an unknown factor. Why do the original IBE mutations in one subset of IBE motifs, the B group, have no consequences? Notably, the B group IBEs are embedded in a cluster of Bru-binding sites. We suggest that bound Bru could occlude binding of the unknown factor, thus avoiding the adverse effects. In any event, the original IBE mutants are clearly unusual and need to be considered separately from mutants which disrupt bona fide regulatory elements. Learning how the IBE mutant inhibits rescue in <italic>trans</italic> may well provide important insights into the mechanism, and will be the focus of future work.</p><p>Finally, mutants designed to disrupt RNP assembly also fail to rescue in <italic>trans</italic>. Mutation of many PTs in the donor mRNA most dramatically disrupted rescue in <italic>trans</italic>, with lesser defects from mutating subsets of these PTs. The additive nature of the PT mutations is fully consistent with the notion that they serve as binding sites for PTB, which assembles <italic>osk</italic> mRNA into RNPs in vitro and is required for association of <italic>osk</italic> mRNAs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Besse et al., 2009</xref>). As an independent test of the role of PTB in rescue in <italic>trans</italic>, we also monitored the effects of reducing PTB gene dosage when the donor and recipient <italic>osk</italic> mRNAs had intact PTB-binding sites. Consistent with 'regulation in <italic>trans'</italic>, lowering the activity of PTB diminished rescue of the translational activation defect, leading to a lower level of Osk protein. PTB is implicated in translational repression of <italic>osk</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Besse et al., 2009</xref>), and so a reduced level of PTB could also influence Osk protein levels more directly. However, a lower efficiency of repression would increase, not lower, the level of Osk protein, and the effect we observe is more reasonably attributed to 'regulation in <italic>trans'</italic>.</p><p>By the model of 'regulation in <italic>trans'</italic>, almost any mRNA should be susceptible to inter-transcript interactions influencing its translation. In practice, such effects would be most likely for mRNAs in close proximity to one another, either because of an overall high mRNA concentration or because of coassembly in RNPs. To consider this possibility, we focused on the <italic>grk</italic> mRNA, which shares with <italic>osk</italic> mRNA patterns of subcellular distribution as well as association with PTB. Remarkably, removing candidate PTB-binding sites from <italic>osk</italic> mRNA led to elevation of Grk protein levels early in oogenesis. Because translation of <italic>osk</italic> mRNA is strongly repressed at this developmental stage, association of the <italic>osk</italic> and <italic>grk</italic> mRNAs could lead to some degree of translational repression of <italic>grk</italic>. Disrupting this association would reduce repression of <italic>grk</italic>, leading to higher Grk protein levels, as we observed. It is also possible that reducing the amount of PTB bound to <italic>osk</italic> mRNA would increase the pool of PTB available for binding to <italic>grk</italic>. However, if this occurs, given the evidence that PTB acts in the cytoplasm as a repressor of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Besse et al., 2009</xref>), the expected outcome would be enhanced repression of <italic>grk</italic> mRNA and less Grk protein, not more.</p><p>Our evidence that translational regulation can occur in <italic>trans</italic>, with inter-transcript interactions affecting the translation of participating mRNAs, raises the question of whether this phenomenon is unusual, or more widespread but unappreciated. Unless a mechanism exists to specifically exclude inter-transcription interactions, there is no compelling reason why such interactions would not occur, and their probability may be dictated by mRNA concentrations. The absence of other reports of this phenomenon may be misleading, as detecting <italic>trans</italic> effects is not straightforward. For <italic>osk</italic> mRNA, rescue in <italic>trans</italic> was discovered by comparing the effects of <italic>cis</italic> regulatory mutations in the presence or absence of other <italic>osk</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reveal et al., 2010</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, this approach is not common. Furthermore, it requires an RNA null allele for the regulated gene, a reagent not always available. Despite the absence of direct tests for rescue in <italic>trans</italic>, recent advances in understanding how mRNAs are localized may be relevant. Often, localized mRNAs are subject to translational regulation to ensure that the protein is only synthesized at the appropriate time or location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jung et al., 2014</xref>).

At least three assays were done for each mRNA.

Antibodies for immunodetection: rabbit anti-Osk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reveal et al., 2010</xref>), 1/3000; mouse anti-HA (Covance), 1/300; mouse anti-Grk 1D12 [Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB)], 1/10; and mouse anti-Hts 1B1 (DSHB), 1/1. TO-PRO-3 Iodide (Invitrogen)(1:1,000) was used to stain nuclei. For immunodetection, and for detection of GFP from fusion proteins, samples in comparison groups (corresponding to sets of data in outlined boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) were from flies grown in parallel and aged in well-yeasted vials. They were dissected, fixed, and stained in parallel, and imaged in a single session using identical confocal settings in which the fluorescence signals were not saturated.</p><p>For quantitation of posterior Osk::GFP in late stage oocytes, we first determined how reliably an optical section could be visually identified as having the maximum signal intensity. Note that all late stage oocytes, having a high anterior/posterior to dorsal/ventral axial ratio, are positioned with the anterior/posterior axis parallel to the plane of the slide. This orientation ensures that a z series of images is comparable for all oocytes. A z position appearing to have the highest level of Osk::GFP signal was noted, and then a z series of images roughly centered on that position was collected. Signal intensities were determined (as described below), and plotted across the z dimension. As shown in the two oocyte examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, this approach was adequate to identify a z position having a signal intensity within 2% of the maximum measured intensity. To measure signal intensity of the posterior crescent of Osk::GFP, the posterior peripheral region of each oocyte was traced in FIJI using a Wacom Intuos tablet. Because oocytes differ in shape, a single standardized trace outline could not be used. When the Osk::GFP signal intensity was strong, the region to be traced was readily identified, with the boundaries of the traces extending well beyond the anterior-most signal. When Osk::GFP signal intensity was low or undetectable, a region similar in shape and size was traced. Within the traced region for each oocyte, the total signal was measured. Other options for quantitation of the posterior crescent of Osk::GFP are to determine average or maximum signal intensity. Neither provides a reliable estimate of total Osk::GFP. For an average intensity to be reliable, the area scored must be identical for all oocytes. Given the variation in oocyte shape, tracing areas identical in size is not practical. For a maximum signal intensity to be reliable, there must be a point source of Osk::GFP. This is not the case. To evaluate the consistency of the assay, a single biological sample was divided into two portion, and each was mounted on a separate slide. Both slides were imaged in a single session. Quantitation using the approach described showed a high level of consistency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Quantitation of Grk protein in early oocytes presents different challenges and a different approach was used. Within early oocytes Grk protein is roughly uniform in distribution, except that the protein is excluded from the nucleus. Because all samples in these experiments contain readily detectable Grk, the position of the nucleus (unstained) is obvious and the cytoplasm can be easily traced. Given the uniform distribution of Grk in the cytoplasm, measuring an average signal intensity is appropriate. By contrast, measuring the total amount of signal does not provide a reliable estimate of Grk levels, as the area of the oocyte varies substantially depending on z position. For these images, additional steps were taken to obtain similar data from all samples. First, only egg chambers oriented in a roughly horizontal position were analyzed. This ensures that the position of the nucleus (lacking Grk), and the region of the oocyte it occupies, are similar for all samples. Second, the focal plane was chosen to include the oocyte nucleus, thus avoiding the peripheral regions of the oocyte. Near the periphery, only a small portion of the oocyte is included in an optical section, which causes high variability in average signal intensity. Limiting the analysis to the more central region yielded only minor variation in measured signal intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), much less than the differences observed in the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>RNA binding</title><p>A maltose-binding protein-PTB fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Besse et al., 2009</xref>) was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21/pLysS and affinity purified on amylose resin (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturers protocol.

The assigned values were used to calculate average number of denticles bands and standard deviations, from which effect size and power were determined in G*Power.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Community effects in regulation of translation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Both reviews on the manuscript have been completed and there is general concordance on several points. First, both reviewers feel that the work is of broad interest in taking earlier observations by your group showing that BREs' can be rescued in <italic>trans</italic> by another mRNA transcript, and extending these observations to show that other <italic>osk</italic> mutations can also be rescued in a manner potentially dependent on the PTB protein (and its binding sites). And, while both reviewers are inclined to think that indeed this idea is correct (if not the complete story), both reviewers feel that additional experiments are needed to support this specific claim. Most importantly, the distribution of the mutant RNA needs better characterization in the presence and absence of PTB (i.e. in the presence of PTB binding site mutations and with diminished PTB levels). One of the reviewers proposes the use of FISH to help support the proposed mechanism – two color FISH should help correlate the observed regulatory effects with colocalization. The second reviewer proposes some IP style experiments to address a similar point (where the amount of RNAs recovered correlate with the predicted strengths of the PTB binding sites, etc.). There were other experiments proposed to ask whether the nature of the mRNA interaction was reciprocal, and whether co-regulation happens in both directions. The reviewers agree that this would be interesting, but perhaps beyond the scope of the present work.</p><p>In light of the broad agreement of the reviewers, we would be happy to receive a revised manuscript should there be additional experiments provided to support the proposed model that PTB binding is critical for both colocalization and coregulation, demonstrated more directly through biochemistry/visualization, and not simply through genetic approaches.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript is a follow up of the previous 2010 Developmental Cell paper (Dual Functions of BREs in Translational Regulation), the authors found that mutation of <italic>osk</italic> 3' UTR Bruno Recognition Element (BRE) results in developmental defects (measured in the number of cuticles in embryos). Coexpression of a second, protein null <italic>osk</italic> transcript (<italic>osk<sup>54</sup></italic>) is able to rescue the developmental defects.</p><p>The authors carried out more mutations in the donor and the recipient <italic>osk</italic> mRNAs to try to understand what factors/elements are important for the rescue in <italic>trans</italic>. The authors characterized developmental defects and used GFP reporters to monitor rescue. There are two new conclusions from the paper. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) PTB dependent mRNP assembly is essential for rescue in <italic>trans</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) The translation regulation can affect other RNAs in the same RNP. Both of these are consistent with their in <italic>trans</italic> regulation model. The authors also perform an experiment on the IMP binding element mutant, which is not very conclusive. The second conclusion is novel and shows a potential physiological role of <italic>trans</italic> regulation. However, there are a few elements worth further clarification, especially with the first conclusion.</p><p>1) By deletion of nt121-150, the mutant cannot be rescued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The authors conclude that the 5' UTR is not important for being-rescued in trans. Since the deletion not only disrupts the long form Osk protein, but also the 5' UTR of short form <italic>osk</italic> RNA, the transcript (D121-150) itself might have problems for translation regulation. In order to make a strong statement that the 5' UTR is not important for rescue of a recipient mRNA, additional mutations or experiments will be needed.</p><p>2) It looks like that the RNP assembly is crucial for <italic>trans</italic> rescue. The mechanism proposed is that the donor and the acceptor mRNA need to be packaged together into an mRNP for this to happen. The authors showed development defects with GFP reporter expression. However, many mutations might result in defects in RNA localization or RNA assembly. Therefore, the distribution of the mutant RNA needs better characterization, for example, by FISH to donor and recipient, not just by qPCR to measure the total amount.</p><p>3) The authors argue that PTB dependent RNP assembly is crucial for the <italic>trans</italic> rescue. It is likely that the RNP assembly is necessary for the rescue. There are many ways that RNP assembly could be disrupted by the mutants. The point is how to prove it is PTB dependent. The authors mutated a set of PTB binding sites and showed rescue defects. There are two points the authors might want to show. First, these mutations may result in no or decreased PTB binding. The second might be hard to prove: so many mutations might disrupt something else. The authors also used a heterozygous mutant PTB to reduce the PTB level (is that true?). But as the author notes, PTB is essential for many RNA functions and might have indirect effects on <italic>osk</italic>.</p><p>4) The inclusion of data from IBE mutations is puzzling and doesn't help the manuscript. It is idiosyncratic, as the authors suggest. I would remove it.</p><p>Recommendation:</p><p>The novelty of the paper lies in showing a mechanism for rescue in <italic>trans</italic>. The authors provide data that PTB is part of this mechanism but this requires further work. Part of the problem is that they rely almost exclusively on genetics, which leads to uncertainty about epistatic mechanisms leading to their observations. For instance, the increase in Gurken is interesting, but phenomenological. While the proposed mechanism of rescue is likely correct, it needs validation before the manuscript is acceptable. FISH experiments may help to support the proposed mechanism. Two color FISH will help correlate rescue with colocalization. Furthermore, this will show the importance of homotypic clustering in the granules (an approach recently described by the Lehmann lab, 2015, Nature Communications). If the FISH experiments yield the predicted result, they will suggest a mechanism where homotypic interactions are necessary for rescue.

First, both reviewers feel that the work is of broad interest in taking earlier observations by your group showing that BREs' can be rescued in trans by another mRNA transcript, and extending these observations to show that other osk mutations can also be rescued in a manner potentially dependent on the PTB protein (and its binding sites). And, while both reviewers are inclined to think that indeed this idea is correct (if not the complete story), both reviewers feel that additional experiments are needed to support this specific claim. Most importantly, the distribution of the mutant RNA needs better characterization in the presence and absence of PTB (i.e. in the presence of PTB binding site mutations and with diminished PTB levels). One of the reviewers proposes the use of FISH to help support the proposed mechanism – two color FISH should help correlate the observed regulatory effects with colocalization. The second reviewer proposes some IP style experiments to address a similar point (where the amount of RNAs recovered correlate with the predicted strengths of the PTB binding sites, etc.). There were other experiments proposed to ask whether the nature of the mRNA interaction was reciprocal, and whether co-regulation happens in both directions. The reviewers agree that this would be interesting, but perhaps beyond the scope of the present work. In light of the broad agreement of the reviewers, we would be happy to receive a revised manuscript should there be additional experiments provided to support the proposed model that PTB binding is critical for both colocalization and coregulation, demonstrated more directly through biochemistry/visualization, and not simply through genetic approaches.</italic> </p><p>I will address these main points here, and then respond in the context of the individual reviews to more detailed issues raised by the reviewers.</p><p>To provide biochemical evidence in support of the role for PTB in rescue/ regulation in <italic>trans</italic> we tried two approaches. The first was that suggested by reviewer 2, doing IPs of PTB to assess binding to the various mRNAs. Unfortunately, using the only anti-<italic>Drosophila</italic> PTB antibodies of which we are aware (Besse et al. Genes Dev 23, 195-207), we were unable to IP PTB. In the second approach, suggested by reviewer 1, we performed RNA binding assays with recombinant <italic>Drosophila</italic> PTB. In the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> we show that binding of PTB to the complete <italic>osk</italic> 3’ UTR is substantially reduced by the full set of PT mutations. In the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we include two types of UV crosslinking binding assays. In one set of assays we used short segments of the <italic>osk</italic> 3’ UTR to ask if the PT sites within each segment mediated PTB binding. Using these short RNAs in the binding assay allows us to focus primarily on the PT sites mutated, in the absence of residual PTB binding to the remainder of the 3’ UTR. The results demonstrate that each subset of PT mutations does indeed reduce PTB binding. The second type of assay was designed to ask how strongly each subset of PT mutations disrupts PTB binding to the entire <italic>osk</italic> 3’ UTR, similar to the situation in vivo with the transgenes bearing the same subsets of mutations. Because we expected weaker effects (many PTB sites remain intact in the context of the full 3’ UTR), we used competition binding assays. The results show that subsets of the PT mutations do disrupt PTB binding. The degree to which PTB binding is reduced by each subset of mutations parallels the degree to which rescue in <italic>trans</italic> is reduced, at least in the sense that the subset of mutations with the greatest effect on PTB binding has the greatest effect on rescue in <italic>trans</italic>. The other subsets of mutations have lesser effects on both PTB binding and rescue in <italic>trans</italic>, but the differences within this group are relatively small and not statistically significant, and it seems unrealistic to think that we would obtain compelling evidence of a perfect correlation within this group between small differences in overall PTB binding and in rescue in <italic>trans</italic>. I think these experiments address the need for biochemical evidence to support the genetic data, and I hope you agree.</p><p>The imaging experiments are less straightforward. It seems that there are two types of information that the reviewers may want. One is confirmation that the various mRNAs are in the appropriate positions within the egg chamber to allow interactions (concentrated in the oocyte for the <italic>osk/grk</italic> interaction, and localized to the posterior pole of the oocyte to allow the <italic>osk/osk</italic> interactions). The second is superresolution imaging to visualize discrete particles in which interacting mRNAs are predicted to co-reside, and which might be disrupted when PTB binding is reduced.</p><p>The former type of experiment is simple. We have included a new supplemental figure to show that the mutations introduced into <italic>osk</italic> mRNA to interfere with RNP assembly do not prevent posterior localization of the mRNA, and so the <italic>osk</italic> mRNAs under study are colocalized. Published work from the Ephrussi lab (Besse et al. Genes Dev 23, 195-207) shows that <italic>osk</italic> mRNA localization is somewhat delayed but otherwise completely normal in egg chambers homozygous mutant for <italic>heph</italic>, the gene that encodes PTB. Because this is a more extreme situation than mutants heterozygous for <italic>heph</italic>, we cite their work but do not include experiments to monitor <italic>osk</italic> mRNA distribution in the <italic>heph</italic> heterozygotes. As for overlap in the distribution of <italic>osk</italic> mRNA and the GFP reporter mRNAs with <italic>osk</italic> 3’ UTR segments, multiple studies have shown that such reporters with the complete <italic>osk</italic> 3’ UTR are localized to the posterior pole of the oocyte just like <italic>osk</italic> itself (e.g. Besse et al. Genes Dev 23, 195-207). There is no strong posterior localization for the GFP reporters with only parts of the 3’ UTR, but the level of rescue in <italic>trans</italic> is extremely low for these transgenes, being detectable only in the indirect embryonic patterning assays. Thus, a low level of overlap in mRNA distributions could explain the observed rescue. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows that <italic>osk</italic> and <italic>grk</italic> are both highly enriched in early stage oocytes, with <italic>osk</italic> filling the entire oocyte. Thus, <italic>osk</italic> and <italic>grk</italic> have the potential to interact.</p><p>The superresolution experiments are not so simple. These appear to be what</p><p>reviewer 1 would like us to include, modeled on work recently reported from the Lehmann lab (Trcek et al., Nat Commun 6, 7962) in which the relative distributions of mRNAs localized to germ granules in embryonic pole cells were monitored. In particular, the reviewer suggests that we do 2 color FISH to test for colocalization of donor and recipient mRNAs, with the expectation that there will be homotypic clustering of mRNAs in discrete particles and that donor/recipient combinations that do not support rescue in <italic>trans</italic> will not show colocalization. To respond to these comments, it is useful to first explain what was done by Trcek et al. in their paper.</p><p>Trcek et al. did 2 color FISH, but the results did not demonstrate homotypic clustering of the germ granule mRNAs. Instead, the simultaneous detection of two mRNAs revealed extensive colocalization for most pairwise combinations. This colocalization is documented in Trcek et al. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, with a further example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. The evidence for homotypic clustering comes from modeling, using data from different imaging experiments in which VasaGFP (protein) and single mRNAs were detected (not 2 color FISH). The modeling provides a prediction of the average distribution of mRNAs based on distance from VasaGFP, and does not exclude colocalization of fractions of the individual mRNAs. The overall conclusion from the work, which is best discerned from the Results section of Trcek et al., is that certain localized mRNAs have a bias towards homotypic clustering, but it is only a bias and is not absolute. For example, Trcek et al. state that “<italic>pgc</italic> mRNAs preferred to co-organize with other <italic>pgc</italic> mRNAs rather than mix with <italic>nos</italic> or <italic>gcl</italic> mRNAs.” Although a reader might be left with the impression that Trcek et al. found that different species of localized mRNAs were segregated one from another by homotypic clustering, the data do not show such a strong partitioning effect.</p><p>In the context of our work, the only experimental result that would disprove the regulation in <italic>trans</italic> model would be clear evidence that a combination of donor/recipient mRNAs that DOES display rescue in DOES NOT have any overlap in mRNA distributions. Thus, even if we obtained results comparable to the modeling of Trcek et al. (i.e. predicting some degree of homotypic clustering but not excluding colocalization), this would not disprove the model. Despite this argument that such experiments are unlikely to be conclusive, we would do them if they were practical. However, this would be a substantial project on its own. First, for the 2 color FISH we would have to generate an additional set of transgenic flies, so that both donor and recipient <italic>osk</italic> mRNAs each have their own unique sequence tags for detection (with our current transgenes, only the recipient has the unique GFP tag, while the donor mRNAs would have to be detected with an <italic>osk</italic> probe which would also detect the recipient mRNA). More significantly, we would have to establish a complex imaging system and develop novel reagents. It is worth noting that the Trcek et al. work involved collaboration of the Lehmann lab with two imaging labs, highlighting the technical sophistication and challenges of their approach. Furthermore, we would not simply be reproducing their assay system, as there are many differences between the tissues (embryos vs egg chambers) and the types of particles to be examined (assembled germ granules in embryos vs. the more diffuse and less highly organized germ granule precursors in developing oocytes). Notably, the reagent used for the Trcek et al. modeling studies – VasaGFP – is not suitable for our work. Vasa protein is a component of germ granules, but it is recruited by Osk protein and thus requires Osk expression (and activation of <italic>osk</italic> mRNA translation) as a prerequisite for assembly. We would need to develop an alternate reagent that could be used as a reference point for defining spatial organization, and it isn’t clear what molecule would have the required properties. The best candidate would be Osk protein itself, but this isn’t a viable option given that our experiments involve effects on Osk protein expression. We can’t simply add an Osk::GFP marker, as getting the protein expressed at the right position would require that it have the normal osk regulatory elements, which would then influence the expression of the mRNAs we are studying.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p> <italic>This manuscript is a follow up of the previous 2010 Developmental Cell paper (Dual Functions of BREs in Translational Regulation), the authors found that mutation of osk 3' UTR Bruno Recognition Element (BRE) results in developmental defects (measured in the number of cuticles in embryos).

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) The translation regulation can affect other RNAs in the same RNP. Both of these are consistent with their in trans regulation model. The authors also perform an experiment on the IMP binding element mutant, which is not very conclusive. The second conclusion is novel and shows a potential physiological role of trans regulation.

The authors conclude that the 5' UTR is not important for being-rescued in trans. Since the deletion not only disrupts the long form osk protein, but also the 5' UTR of short form osk RNA, the transcript (D121-150) itself might have problems for translation regulation. In order to make a strong statement that the 5' UTR is not important for rescue of a recipient mRNA, additional mutations or experiments will be needed.</italic> </p><p>There is a misunderstanding here about the experiments with the <italic>osk</italic> transcript with mutations in the 5’ UTR. We have shown two things. First, we find that the regulatory defect of this mutant transcript cannot be rescued in <italic>trans</italic>. Second, we show that this mutant transcript can, nevertheless, act as a donor for rescue in <italic>trans</italic> of other regulatory defects. We did not reach the conclusion noted by the reviewer, namely, that the <italic>osk</italic> 5’ UTR is not important for the ability of the mRNA to provide rescue in <italic>trans</italic>.</p><p>Our experiments do not directly address a possible contribution of this part of the mRNA (for example, by providing PTB binding sites to promote RNP assembly).

This is why we took two approaches to ask if reduced PTB binding was an underlying cause of reduced rescue in <italic>trans</italic>. The logic behind these approaches is discussed in the manuscript, and the results provide very strong support for the conclusion that PTB binding to <italic>osk</italic> mRNA is required for rescue in <italic>trans</italic>. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that the PT mutations have an additional effect on rescue in <italic>trans</italic>, but this does not weaken the main conclusion about the importance of PTB.</p><p>The use of heterozygous <italic>heph</italic> mutants (<italic>heph</italic> encodes PTB) to reduce PTB activity avoids the complication of indirect effects due to loss of PTB activity.

At early stages of oogenesis no Osk protein can be detected because repression is strong, while Grk protein is present (and is required) and so must be translated. There may be some degree of translational repression of <italic>grk</italic> mRNA (and Bru binds to <italic>grk</italic> mRNA, but much more weakly than Bru binds <italic>osk</italic> mRNA; Kim-Ha et al.

Consistent with this, a GFP reporter mRNA with the <italic>grk</italic> 3’ UTR attached retains very strong GFP expression (our unpublished data), while adding either part of the <italic>osk</italic> 3’ UTR with BREs to the same GFP reporter largely eliminates GFP expression (Reveal et al. Dev Cell 18,496-502). Consequently, there is only a low level of direct repression of <italic>grk</italic> mRNA that has the potential to be exerted in <italic>trans</italic>, and this would be a very minor amount relative to the already strong repression of <italic>osk</italic> mRNA translation conferred in <italic>cis</italic> by the BREs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
