membrane structure. We address the organization and functional roles of MICOS and identify two independent MICOS subcomplexes: Mic27/Mic10/Mic12, whose assembly is dependent on respiratory complexes and the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin, and Mic60/Mic19, which assembles independent of these factors. Our data suggest that MICOS subcomplexes independently localize to cristae junctions and are connected via Mic19, which functions to regulate subcomplex distribution, and thus, potentially also cristae junction copy number. MICOS subunits have non-redundant functions as the absence of both MICOS subcomplexes results in more severe morphological and respiratory growth defects than deletion of single MICOS subunits or subcomplexes. Mitochondrial defects resulting from MICOS loss are caused by misdistribution of respiratory complexes in the inner membrane. Together, our data are consistent with a model where MICOS, mitochondrial lipids and respiratory complexes coordinately build a functional and correctly shaped mitochondrial inner membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07739.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07739.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07739.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Structures called mitochondria provide energy that cells need to live and grow. To do this, mitochondria convert energy stored within sugars and other carbon-rich compounds into the energy currency of cells, a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (called ATP for short). Defective mitochondria can cause cells to starve and also cause severe human diseases.</p><p>A double membrane surrounds each mitochondrion. The outer membrane allows proteins and other substances to enter, while the inner membrane is elaborately folded and contains several groups of proteins—or complexes—including the respiratory complexes that generate ATP. Proper inner membrane folding is critically important. The membrane folds are held in place by structures called cristae junctions, which may also help to restrict proteins to particular areas of the inner membrane.</p><p>A large inner membrane complex of proteins known as MICOS is important for organizing the inner membrane into folds, although exactly how it does so is not fully understood. MICOS consists of at least six different proteins, most of which are found across yeast and animal species. Friedman et al. have now analyzed how the MICOS complex assembles on the inner membrane in yeast cells using a combination of fluorescence and electron microscopy, proteomics and biochemistry. This revealed that in yeast, MICOS is made up of two independent sub-complexes bridged together by a protein called Mic19, which additional experiments suggest controls the number and positions of the cristae junctions that hold the folds of the inner membrane in place.</p><p>As part of the approach to understand MICOS complex organization, Friedman et al. removed the six MICOS proteins from yeast cells. Inside these cells, the inner mitochondrial membrane was misfolded. Furthermore, the respiratory complexes did not work normally and as a consequence the cells were unable to grow normally, suggesting that the correct distribution of respiratory complexes in the inner membrane is important for ATP production and depends on MICOS.</p><p>These results indicate that MICOS stabilizes the structure of the inner membrane and organizes it into an efficient energy-generating machine. In many human mitochondrial diseases, the inner membrane of mitochondria folds incorrectly, in similar ways to the misfolding seen in the yeast cells that did not contain the MICOS complex. Therefore, the MICOS complex may also influence how these diseases develop.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07739.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07739.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>MICOS</kwd><kwd>cristae</kwd><kwd>respiratory complex</kwd><kwd>cardiolipin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM062942</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nunnari</surname><given-names>Jodi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>Jonathan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM097432</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nunnari</surname><given-names>Jodi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM106019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nunnari</surname><given-names>Jodi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A conserved mitochondrial inner membrane complex called MICOS works together with the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin and respiratory complexes to direct the position, copy number and stabilization of cristae structures for efficient respiration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria are double membrane-bound organelles whose shape is instrumental to their function in diverse cellular processes such as metabolism and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Labbe et al., 2014</xref>). The inner mitochondrial membrane has the highest density of protein in the cell and is differentiated into three distinct interconnected domains: the boundary region, which are flattened membranes that lie in close apposition to the outer membrane; cristae membranes, which are lamellar invaginations with highly curved edges; and cristae junctions, which are relatively narrow tubules that connect cristae to the boundary membrane and may act as a physical partitioning mechanism that prevents and/or regulates the intermixing of proteins between cristae and the boundary domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mannella et al., 1994</xref>). Compositionally, the boundary membrane is enriched for import and assembly machinery for the mitochondrial proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wurm and Jakobs, 2006</xref>). In contrast, cristae membranes house assembled electron transport chain protein complexes and ATP synthase, which function together to synthesize ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. Specific combinations of electron transport chain complexes further assemble into large mega-Dalton supercomplexes in cristae in a manner dependent on the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin and act to facilitate electron transport, and likely as diffusion traps to promote their sorting into cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cruciat et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pfeiffer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acehan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lapuente-Brun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilkens et al., 2013</xref>). ATP synthase also assembles in a regulated manner into dimers and dimer oligomers, whose unique structure generates and/or stabilizes the high curvature at the edges of lamellar cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahams et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paumard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Strauss et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The proper differentiation of the mitochondrial inner membrane into separate domains is critical for mitochondrial function. Indeed, a hallmark feature of mitochondrial diseases is aberrant mitochondrial ultrastructure and shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zick et al., 2009</xref>). Inner membrane structure is also a critical feature of apoptosis, where cristae junctions are remodeled to facilitate the release of the cell death mediator, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scorrano et al., 2002</xref>). Internal mitochondrial architecture may also interface with the external mitochondrial environment, including contacts with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as nucleoids associate with both mitochondrial cristae and mitochondrial division sites, which are marked by sites of ER contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kopek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murley et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, proper mitochondrial ultrastructure is critical for a multitude of mitochondrial and cellular functions.</p><p>The mechanisms by which inner membrane domains are established and maintained are poorly understood. In addition to respiratory supercomplexes, ATP synthase oligomers and mitochondrial lipid composition, the inner membrane fusion dynamin, Mgm1/OPA1, and scaffolding proteins such as prohibitins have been proposed to play roles in inner membrane structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frezza et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meeusen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Merkwirth et al., 2008</xref>). These factors are interdependent—for example, cardiolipin is required for both respiratory supercomplex assembly and Mgm1/OPA1 self-assembly and function and the prohibitins are required to maintain normal mitochondrial lipid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeVay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Osman et al., 2009</xref>). This interdependency suggests that inner membrane differentiation is a highly cooperative process, however, exactly how these determinants work together to correctly shape and organize the mitochondrial membrane to ultimately lead to proper respiratory function is also not understood.</p><p>The recently identified MICOS complex (previously named MitOS or MINOS) has been proposed to act as a master regulator/integrator of mitochondrial inner membrane shape and organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">von der Malsburg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alkhaja et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pfanner et al., 2014</xref>). Consistently, MICOS interacts both physically and functionally with cardiolipin, import machinery, and respiratory complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rabl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohnert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Korner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zerbes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harner et al., 2014</xref>). The MICOS complex is also embedded in the inner membrane with domains facing the intermembrane space that mediate the formation of heterologous structures localized to the inner boundary membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>). It is comprised of six core subunits in yeast: Mic60, Mic10, Mic19, Mic27, Mic26, and Mic12, that, with the exception of Mic12, have mammalian homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Darshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Head et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alkhaja et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">An et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weber et al., 2013</xref>). Single MICOS subunit deletion causes a characteristic mitochondrial inner membrane morphological defect in cells, consisting of extended, stacked, lamellar inner membranes and a reduction of the number of cristae junctions, with a consequent lamellar mitochondrial shape defect. The common cellular phenotypes of single MICOS subunit deletions indicate that they perform a shared function. However, expression analysis indicates that Mic60 and Mic10 function uniquely as ‘core components’ that direct a hierarchal MICOS assembly as <italic>MIC60</italic> deletion causes Mic19 instability and <italic>MIC10</italic> deletion causes Mic27 instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">von der Malsburg et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, specific pairwise combinations of MICOS subunit deletions can produce either positive or negative genetic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>), indicating that although MICOS subunits act cooperatively, they also perform non-redundant roles within mitochondria. For example, Mic60 plays a role in import independently of the MICOS complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">von der Malsburg et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Here we examine the role of MICOS in the lateral organization of the mitochondrial inner membrane by examining how MICOS is assembled and how MICOS cooperates with the surrounding mitochondrial environment. Using yeast cells deficient for all six components of MICOS, we identify two major MICOS organizing centers, Mic60 and Mic27/Mic10/Mic12. Our data indicate that Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 assembles at cristae junctions in a respiratory complex- and cardiolipin-dependent manner. In contrast, Mic60 assembles and organizes independently of other MICOS subunits, cardiolipin, and the respiratory machinery, suggesting that Mic60 assemblies may intrinsically mark nascent cristae junctions. MICOS subcomplexes are bridged together by Mic19, which our data indicates controls the copy number and position of cristae junctions within mitochondria. Together, our findings demonstrate how the MICOS complex works with respiratory complexes and the mitochondria lipid environment to establish inner membrane architecture, organization and function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The MICOS complex is required for oxidative phosphorylation and normal mitochondrial ultrastructure and morphology</title><p>To address the functional roles and organization of MICOS, we generated a yeast strain lacking all core MICOS components using a Cre-<italic>lox</italic> recombination system, which allowed for sequential MICOS subunit gene deletion and selection marker rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guldener et al., 1996</xref>). Using this approach, we constructed ∆MICOS—a strain containing ‘clean,’ unmarked deletions of all six MICOS genes. In contrast to single MICOS subunit deletions, ∆MICOS cells displayed a severe respiratory growth defect, as assessed by growth on the non-fermentable carbon source, glycerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel). Importantly, reintroduction of four of six MICOS genes at their native loci complemented the growth defect, validating the ∆MICOS strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The mitochondrial morphology defect of the ∆MICOS strain, as assessed by fluorescence microscopy using the matrix-targeted fluorescent protein, mito-DsRed, was also more penetrant as compared to mitochondria in individual MICOS deletion cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although the predominant lamellar shape phenotype present in single MICOS deletion mutants was observed (56% of ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells vs 21% of ∆MICOS cells), a majority of ∆MICOS cells also had bulbous mitochondrial structures with a beads on a string appearance, and hollow, large spherical structures that were sometimes continuous with the bulbous structures (11% of ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells vs 59% of ∆MICOS cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These spherical structures are consistent with what have previously observed in a relatively small fraction of ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Itoh et al., 2013</xref>). EM analysis of ∆MICOS cells revealed mitochondrial features analogous to those observed by fluorescence microscopy, including extended lamellar cristae, septated inner membranes, mitochondria with larger diameter structures, and hollow mitochondria, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07739.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The MICOS complex is required for oxidative phosphorylation and normal mitochondrial ultrastructure and morphology.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Serial dilutions of the indicated yeast cells were plated on media containing glucose (left) and the non-fermentable carbon source, glyercol (right).

Mic60, however, uniquely localized to discrete foci in a majority of ∆MICOS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,F</xref>), indicating that Mic60 localizes to substructures independent of its interaction with the MICOS complex, suggesting that Mic60 may have an intrinsic ability to self-assemble.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07739.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mic60 self-assembles independently and its inner membrane distribution is regulated by Mic19.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Z-projections of representative deconvolved fluorescence microscopy images are shown from wild type yeast cells expressing the indicated integrated GFP-tagged MICOS protein and mito-DsRed.

The mild overexpression of Mic60 as a consequence of two genomic copies did not interfere with the ability of pMic60-EGFP to localize to foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Purification of Mic60 from cross-linked extract from these cells using either α-FLAG or α-GFP antibodies specifically co-purified both tagged Mic60 versions by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To rule out the possibility that Mic60 foci represent insoluble aggregates, we solubilized mitochondria isolated from wild type and ∆MICOS cells expressing Mic60-EGFP using the non-ionic detergent, Triton X-100, under relatively low ionic conditions and subjected extracts to ultracentrifugation. As in wild type cells, Mic60-EGFP expressed in ∆MICOS cells remained soluble, indicating that Mic60 foci represent assembled structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These data indicate that Mic60 self-interacts in the absence of other MICOS members and suggest that Mic60 foci in ∆MICOS may represent self-assemblies.</p><p>To test the relationship of Mic60-labeled structures to MICOS, we examined the effect of expression of other MICOS complex subunits re-integrated at their respective loci on Mic60 localization. Expression of Mic10, Mic12, Mic26, or Mic27 had no apparent effect on Mic60 foci formation or frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, expression of Mic19 caused Mic60 to become more distributed within mitochondria as compared to the matrix marker, with only 20% of ∆MICOS + Mic19 cells possessing Mic60-EGFP foci as compared to 80% in cells expressing Mic60-EGFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,F</xref>). The unique dependence on Mic19 for Mic60 distribution in ∆MICOS cells is consistent with the dependence of Mic19's stability on Mic60 in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">von der Malsburg et al., 2011</xref>). To gain insight into the molecular basis of the effect of Mic19 on Mic60 distribution, we performed purifications using α-FLAG antibody and mass spectrometry analysis from cross-linked cell extracts of ∆MICOS strains expressing Mic60-FLAG and untagged Mic19, or Mic19-FLAG and untagged Mic60, expressed from their endogenous loci. In each purification, we identified both Mic60 and Mic19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), suggesting that Mic19 interacts directly with Mic60 independently of other MICOS subunits and that Mic19, in part, functions within MICOS to regulate the distribution of Mic60 along the inner membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mic10, Mic12, and Mic27 form a second independent MICOS organizing center</title><p>Given that Mic60 is able to label discrete structures independently of other MICOS complex members, we tested whether Mic60 was required for the focal distribution of other MICOS subunits. Consistent with the requirement of Mic60 for wild type Mic19 expression, Mic19 in ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells, as detected using fluorescence microscopy, was relatively faint and uniformly labeled the mitochondrial membrane as compared to the matrix marker mito-DsRed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the absence of Mic60, Mic26 also localized uniformly, similar to the matrix marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, Mic12 and Mic27 both localized in a non-uniform pattern within mitochondria; this phenotype was most prominent for Mic27, which localized to distinct and relatively bright punctate structures in a majority of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, marked by arrows, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

In the case of ∆<italic>mic26 and</italic> ∆<italic>mic12</italic> cells, Mic27 had similar non-uniform mitochondrial labeling as observed in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In ∆<italic>mic10</italic> cells, Mic27 uniformly labeled mitochondria and the fluorescence signal was relatively weaker than in wild type cells, consistent with the observation that Mic10 is required for Mic27 stability. However, in addition to ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells, Mic27 localized to bright foci in ∆<italic>mic19</italic> cells, in which there is stable Mic60 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harner et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, marked by arrows). This observation is consistent with our data suggesting that Mic60 and Mic19 form a complex and function together in a cooperative manner within MICOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). More significantly, because Mic60 is required for Mic19 stability, it seems likely that the altered localization of Mic27 to more pronounced mitochondrial foci/substructures is a direct consequence of a loss of Mic19 and suggests that these structures represent a second MICOS organizing center.</p><p>The formation of the Mic27 substructures requires other MICOS subunits as these structures were not observed when Mic27 is expressed alone in ∆MICOS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To determine the minimal MICOS proteins required for Mic27 substructure formation, we re-integrated unmarked MICOS subunits into ∆MICOS cells expressing Mic27-EGFP at its endogenous locus. Consistent with the requirement of Mic10 for Mic27 stability in wild type cells, the addition of Mic10 was sufficient for Mic27 substructures to form, however, their frequency was significantly less than that observed in either ∆<italic>mic19</italic> or ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Expression of Mic12 in addition to Mic10, however, supported the formation of Mic27-EGFP substructures at a frequency almost equal to that observed in ∆<italic>mic19</italic> or ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,3F</xref>). Thus, MICOS subunits Mic10 and Mic12 are sufficient for Mic27 substructures to form, suggesting that these three proteins exist as an independent MICOS subcomplex.</p><p>To further test this idea, we asked whether Mic10 or Mic12 were required for Mic27 substructure formation in ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells. Mic27 substructures were largely undetectable in ∆<italic>mic60</italic> ∆<italic>mic10</italic> cells, consistent with the requirement of Mic10 for Mic27 stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). We also observed that Mic12 plays a role in Mic27 substructure formation, as the percentage of cells containing Mic27 foci was significantly lower in the absence of Mic12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, together our data indicate that Mic10 and Mic12 are both necessary and sufficient for Mic27 substructure assembly and suggest that these proteins form an independent MICOS subcomplex.</p><p>To directly test this possibility, we purified EGFP-tagged Mic27 from cross-linked lysates of wild type and ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells using α-GFP antibody and identified MICOS subunits by mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Consistent with previous results, proteomic analysis of purifications of Mic27-EGFP in wild type cells robustly identified the entire MICOS complex as assessed by both the number of peptide spectral counts and percent coverage of MICOS subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). To examine Mic27 substructure composition, we directly compared spectral counts of MICOS subunits by normalizing the total number of Mic27 peptide spectral counts purified from ∆<italic>mic60</italic> extracts relative to wild type extracts. As expected, purification of Mic27-EGFP from ∆<italic>mic60</italic> extracts did not identify Mic60 or Mic19; however, significant relative peptide spectral counts were observed for Mic10, and to a lesser extent, for Mic12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). In total, the data indicate that there are two distinct MICOS organizing centers: Mic60, which may have an intrinsic self-organizational capacity and interacts with Mic19, and a complex containing Mic27, which is dependent on Mic12 and Mic10 for assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mic27 assemblies mark cristae junctions</title><p>Because of the severe respiratory defect of the ∆MICOS strain and the interrelationship between respiratory complexes and MICOS for generating mitochondrial inner membrane shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>), we tested whether respiratory complexes are required for Mic60 and Mic27 assembly formation. To block the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, we generated strains that lack mtDNA (rho<sup>0</sup>) and examined the distribution of the two MICOS subcomplexes as marked by either Mic60 foci (in ∆MICOS + Mic60-EGFP cells) or Mic27 foci (in ∆<italic>mic60</italic> + Mic27-mCherry cells). We observed that Mic60 foci in ∆MICOS persisted in a majority of rho<sup>0</sup> cells (foci in 80% of rho<sup>+</sup> cells vs 64% of rho<sup>0</sup> cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). In contrast, although steady state expression level of Mic27 in ∆<italic>mic60</italic> rho<sup>0</sup> cells was similar to in rho<sup>+</sup> cells, Mic27 assemblies were absent in rho<sup>0</sup> cells (foci in 86% of rho<sup>+</sup> cells vs 3% of rho<sup>0</sup> cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The loss of Mic27 subcomplex interactions is due specifically to the combination of mtDNA loss and the absence of Mic60, as Mic27 co-purified with the entire MICOS complex in wild type rho<sup>0</sup> cells as assessed by mass spectrometry analysis of Mic27 purifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 4—source data 1B</xref>). These data reveal that the Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 subcomplex is selectively dependent on the presence of mtDNA, suggesting a critical role of respiratory complexes in the assembly and/or stabilization of this MICOS subcomplex.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07739.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mic27 assemblies mark cristae junctions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Z-projections of confocal fluorescence microscopy images of (left) ∆MICOS cells expressing Mic60-EGFP at the <italic>MIC60</italic> locus and mito-DsRed or (right) ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells expressing Mic27-mCherry at its endogenous locus and mito-GFP.

Deletion of each respiratory complex assembly factor caused a significant decrease in the percentage of cells containing Mic27 foci (from 86% to 44–63%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This observation indicates that individual respiratory complexes contribute to Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 subcomplex formation/stability, but are not essential. Together, our data indicate that respiratory complexes function in a somewhat redundant manner in the assembly/stability of Mic27/Mic10/Mic12.</p><p>The complete absence of respiratory complexes in rho<sup>0</sup> cells corresponds to a loss of detectable characteristic cristae as assessed by EM analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, we considered the possibility that the Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 subcomplex marks cristae junctions. Previously, we observed that cells harboring individual MICOS deletions have a 3–10-fold reduction in the frequency of cristae junctions, but that junction architecture is not altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the relatively discrete nature and low copy number of Mic27 assemblies in ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells relative to the abundant assemblies in wild type cells is also consistent with its localization at cristae junctions. A direct assessment of whether Mic27-EGFP localizes to cristae junctions in ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells by thin section immuno-EM was not successful due to technical challenges posed by the low copy number of cristae junctions. As an alternative, we utilized fluorescent protein fusions of respiratory complex constituents that selectively localize to cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wurm and Jakobs, 2006</xref>). In wild type cells, functional markers for Complex III (Qcr2-mCherry) and ATP synthase (Atp2-mCherry) were relatively uniformly distributed as compared to the matrix marker, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wurm and Jakobs, 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–3B</xref>). In contrast, in ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells, both Qcr2-mCherry and Atp2-mCherry possessed a non-uniform distribution and concentrated in discrete subregions of mitochondria as compared to the matrix marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). In addition, Atp2-EGFP fluorescence signal marked edges of Qcr2-mCherry-labeled subregions of ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D–3E</xref>). EM analysis of ATP synthase localization in different cell types indicates that it selectively localizes in multimeric ribbons to the curved edges of cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Strauss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acehan et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the localization patterns of Atp2 in subregions marked by Qcr2 strongly suggests that these are lamellar, stacked cristae as visualized by EM in ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells.</p><p>We tested whether Mic27 structures were localized adjacent to cristae by examining whether Mic27 foci were spatially linked to Qcr2-labeled subregions in ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells. Significantly, we observed that a majority of Mic27 foci were adjacent to regions labeled by Qcr2 in ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells (96% of Mic27 foci were localized close to Qcr2, which marked less than 40% of the mitochondrial perimeter, n = 15 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Mic27 foci also were spatially linked to Atp2 labeled subregions in ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Taken together our data strongly suggest that independently of Mic60, at the boundary membrane, the Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 subcomplex is positioned at cristae junctions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Cardiolipin is required for Mic27 assemblies</title><p>We examined the role of the mitochondrial lipid environment on MICOS.

In addition, members of the MICOS complex have a strong negative genetic interaction with members of the cardiolipin synthesis pathway, further suggesting that MICOS and cardiolipin act together to maintain mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore asked whether cardiolipin affected the assembly/stability of the Mic27 subcomplex in mitochondria. We examined both the localization of Mic27 and mitochondrial morphology in wild type cells and cells lacking the mitochondrial cardiolipin synthesis enzyme, Crd1. Deletion of <italic>CRD1</italic> led to minor mitochondrial morphology and respiratory growth defects in cells, consistent with published observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,D,E</xref>). In ∆<italic>crd1</italic> cells, the non-uniform localization pattern of Mic27 was similar to wild type cells and consistently, mass spectrometry analysis of purifications of Mic27 from ∆<italic>crd1</italic> cell extracts indicated that the MICOS complex was intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).

Consistently, mitochondrial morphology of ∆<italic>mic60 ∆crd1</italic> cells was more severely affected than that observed in ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells and had similar characteristics to those observed in ∆MICOS cells, with a substantial increase in the percent of cells with bulbous morphology (9% of ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells compared to 36% ∆<italic>mic60</italic> ∆<italic>crd1</italic> cells) and a corresponding decrease in the percent of cells with tubular and lamellar morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,E</xref>). Together, these data indicate that in cells the absence of both Mic60 and cardiolipin partially phenocopies deletion of the entire MICOS complex and suggest that cardiolipin, in addition to its role in the assembly of respiratory chain supercomplexes, acts to promote the assembly of Mic27 into the Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 subcomplex and its localization to cristae junctions. Importantly, the genetic interaction between <italic>CRD1</italic> and <italic>MIC10</italic> differs from that of <italic>CRD1</italic> and <italic>MIC27</italic>, suggesting that there are complex interactions both within and between each MICOS subcomplex and their mitochondrial environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Respiratory complex III and IV contribute to ∆MICOS phenotypes</title><p>To understand the role of MICOS in mitochondrial respiratory function, we explored the basis of the ∆MICOS respiratory growth defect.

Likewise, both ATP synthase dimerization and activity were unaffected in either single MICOS deletions or ∆MICOS as assessed by an in gel activity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Using two-dimensional gel analysis, we determined that the composition of respiratory complexes in ∆<italic>mic60</italic> and ∆MICOS cells was indistinguishable from wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These data indicate that in the absence of the MICOS complex, respiratory complexes can assemble, but do not function optimally. It is possible that in the absence of the MICOS complex, the respiratory defect results from a severe decrease in cristae junctions and consequent disorganization of the inner membrane structure.

Specifically, we asked whether mitochondrial morphology was altered in ∆MICOS rho<sup>0</sup> cells, which lack mitochondrial respiratory complexes. Strikingly, ∆MICOS rho<sup>0</sup> cells exhibited relatively normal, tubular mitochondrial morphology as assessed by fluorescence microscopy of matrix-targeted dsRed as compared to ∆MICOS rho<sup>+</sup> cells (10% rho<sup>+</sup> cells vs 95% rho<sup>0</sup> cells exhibited tubular mitochondrial morphology; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,G</xref>). As expected, by electron microscopy, the inner membrane of ∆MICOS rho<sup>0</sup> cells lacked detectable cristae and were frequently septated, suggesting that mitochondrial inner membrane fusion is compromised likely as a secondary consequence of reduced respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sauvanet et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, in the absence of the MICOS complex, expression of respiratory complexes causes inner membrane disorganization, and consequently, severe and diverse abnormal mitochondrial morphologies. Consistently, loss of ATP synthase was previously shown to suppress the predominant lamellar mitochondrial morphology defect of ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether deletion of individual respiratory complexes alleviated the ∆MICOS mitochondria morphological defect by deleting genes for essential assembly factors of Complex III (∆<italic>cbs1</italic>), Complex IV (∆<italic>mss51</italic>), and ATP synthase (∆<italic>atp10</italic>) from ∆MICOS. As in ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells, deletion of ATP synthase assembly selectively suppressed the abnormal mitochondrial lamellar phenotype of ∆MICOS, but the bulbous or spherical morphologies were still present in the cell population. Only 25% of ∆MICOS ∆<italic>atp10</italic> cells had normal tubular morphology, compared to 10% in ∆MICOS alone, suggesting distinct morphological phenotypes present in ∆MICOS are caused by separate factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,G</xref>). Consistent with this, deletion of either Complex III or IV assembly factors more significantly alleviated all types of ∆MICOS morphological defects, as ∼75% of ∆MICOS ∆<italic>cbs1</italic> or ∆MICOS ∆<italic>mss51</italic> cells had normal tubular mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,G</xref>). These observations, together with the reduced Complex IV activity in ∆MICOS cells, suggest that assembled respiratory Complex III and IV are not properly organized and/or positioned in ∆MICOS, leading to morphological and respiratory growth defects.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Mic19 mediates the interaction between the Mic60 and Mic27 assemblies at cristae junctions</title><p>Our data indicate that, although there is functional redundancy within the MICOS complex, there are functional interrelationships between the Mic60 and Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 MICOS subcomplexes, respiratory complexes, and cardiolipin that are required for proper inner membrane organization, mitochondrial morphology, and respiratory function.

Mic60 assembles independently of the MICOS complex and its interactions with other MICOS members are significantly reduced in ∆<italic>mic19</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig7">Figures 2B, 7A</xref>). Consistent with these data, we observed that Mic60 localizes to focal assemblies in ∆<italic>mic19</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We tested the relationship between Mic60 and Mic27/Mic12/Mic10 assemblies in ∆<italic>mic19</italic> cells expressing Mic60-EGFP and Mic27-mCherry. We found that the focal localization of Mic60 and Mic27 overlapped, suggesting Mic60 assemblies also mark cristae junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, see arrows). Consistently, Mic60 assemblies in ∆<italic>mic19</italic> cells localized adjacent to discrete mitochondrial subregions labeled by the cristae markers Qcr2 and Atp2, further supporting their localization to cristae junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Mic60 assemblies in ∆<italic>mic19</italic> cells persist in the absence of mtDNA and cardiolipin synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, while it is possible that the co-localization of Mic60 with Mic27 in ∆<italic>mic19</italic> cells is due to direct interactions between the Mic60 and Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 subcomplexes, the behavior of Mic60 assemblies in ∆<italic>mic19</italic> cells is consistent with that of Mic60 assemblies in ∆MICOS cells. These observations suggest that Mic60 structures may independently mark cristae junctions in cells. Their persistence in ∆MICOS rho<sup>0</sup> cells, which lack detectable cristae further suggests that Mic60 functions upstream of the Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 subcomplex to position nascent sites of cristae junction formation within mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figures 4A, 6F</xref>). In the context of our data supporting a role of Mic19 as a MICOS subcomplex regulator and connector, we propose that Mic19 coordinately regulates the assembly of MICOS to dictate the copy number and distribution of cristae in the inner membrane.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our analysis indicates that MICOS consists of two subcomplexes, which localize to cristae junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Examination of the assembly pathways for each subcomplex has illuminated their relative roles in cristae biogenesis. The Mic27/Mic12/Mic10 subcomplex is dependent on the inner membrane phospholipid cardiolipin and on the expression of respiratory complexes. The second MICOS subcomplex consists of a Mic60 multimer, which assembles in a manner independent of cardiolipin, respiratory complexes, and other MICOS proteins. Although each subcomplex assembles independently, the cardiolipin- and respiratory complex-independent nature of Mic60 assemblies suggest that there is a hierarchical nature to MICOS assembly, where Mic60 functions upstream of the Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 subcomplex in MICOS assembly. In this context, we observed Mic60 assemblies in cells without mtDNA, which lack detectable cristae by electron microscopic analysis. These observations suggest that Mic60 assemblies direct the position of nascent cristae junction sites.</p><p>The underlying molecular basis for how Mic60 assemblies are positioned within mitochondria is not currently understood, but is likely critical for inner membrane organization. One possibility is that outer membrane-associated determinants direct the biogenesis and/or placement of Mic60 assemblies. Consistent with this, Mic60 independently interacts with components of the mitochondrial import and sorting machinery complex (SAM/TOB) through its conserved ‘mitofilin’ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Korner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zerbes et al., 2012</xref>). These interactions may allow Mic60 to facilitate proper spacing between the inner boundary and outer membranes and/or to organize these specific outer membrane components relative to inner membrane cristae. Mitochondrial internal determinants may also contribute to the assembly and position of Mic60, such as the mtDNA-independent replisome, which could function to coordinate cristae biogenesis with nucleoid placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meeusen and Nunnari, 2003</xref>). Alternatively, but not exclusively, it is possible that Mic60 assembles at mitochondrial lipid sub-domains positioned, for example, by contacts between mitochondria and the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kornmann et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The role of the Mic27/Mic12/Mic10 subcomplex is suggested by its dependence on cardiolipin and respiratory complexes. Cardiolipin is also required for the assembly and activity of respiratory complexes and for the formation of respiratory supercomplexes, which are processes that do not depend on MICOS. Thus, our observations suggest that Mic27/Mic12/Mic10 may instead directly sense cardiolipin-rich subdomains of mitochondria to coordinate the non-redundant actions of MICOS and cardiolipin in the respiratory complex-dependent formation of cristae junctions. Consistent with this, Mic26 and Mic27 both share a conserved Apolipoprotein O-like domain, which in other contexts bind to lipids. We could not detect a role for Mic26 in MICOS subcomplex assembly, although its domain architecture suggests it may also function to coordinate MICOS with the mitochondrial lipid environment. In addition, although we failed to generate a functional Mic10 fluorescent protein to directly examine its localization and behavior, the observation that Mic10 is required for Mic27 stability suggests that it plays a central role in directing the formation and function of the Mic27/Mic12/Mic10 subcomplex.</p><p>The dependence of the Mic27/Mic12/Mic10 subcomplex on respiratory complexes indicates that in addition to direct roles in cristae biogenesis, they also intrinsically contribute to this biogenesis pathway via MICOS assembly. The reciprocal is not true as we find that MICOS is not required for respiratory supercomplex assembly. However, in the absence of MICOS, the activity of cytochrome-<italic>c</italic> oxidase Complex IV is somewhat reduced and, more importantly, cells lacking MICOS exhibit a severe respiratory defect. One explanation for this severe defect is that MICOS's role in the regulation of cristae copy number is important for producing an optimal distance within cristae between the electron transporting Complex III/IV supercomplexes, localized at lamellar regions, and ATP synthase oligomers localized to the curved edges for efficient oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rieger et al., 2014</xref>). Our data also implicate Complex III and IV directly in the nucleation of cristae and in the process of cristae biogenesis. This is supported by the requirement of Complex III and IV for the generation of aberrant mitochondrial morphology in the absence of MICOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The basis for this observation may lie in the ability of Complex III and IV to form large cardiolipin-dependent supercomplexes, which could act as diffusion traps for the cristae proteome and lipidome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilkens et al., 2013</xref>). Recent work also implicates a role for the inner membrane fusion dynamin, OPA1, in the regulation of mitochondrial inner membrane shape and respiratory supercomplex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cogliati et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, future work will be required to understand the mechanistic relationships between MICOS and respiratory complexes and OPA1 in the process of inner membrane organization.</p><p>Our analysis provides insight into the underlying mechanism of cristae copy number and distribution control. A typical wild type mitochondrion possesses many cristae positioned and distributed along the mitochondrial boundary inner membrane. We find that the only soluble MICOS protein, Mic19 functions as the key component directing the inner membrane distribution of each MICOS subcomplex. We propose that through this distributive action and its role as a connector/adaptor, Mic19 regulates the copy number of the MICOS complex and, consequently, the copy number and position of cristae junctions. In this context, it is interesting to note that Mic19 has two mammalian homologs (MIC19 and MIC25), with conserved coiled-coil-helix motifs, consistent with a role as a key regulatory component of MICOS and suggesting a structural basis for its role as a connector.</p><p>Our data indicate that the primary function of MICOS is to stabilize, position and control the copy number of cristae junctions to organize the inner membrane into an efficient respiratory machine. Aberrant cristae morphology, very similar to what we observe in cells devoid of MICOS, is a defining feature of a diverse array of human diseases and of aging, and cristae reorganization is a central facet of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release in the mediation of apoptotic cell death. Thus, our observations suggest that MICOS will play a significant role in human pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>All yeast strains described were constructed in the W303 genetic background (<italic>ade2–1</italic>; <italic>leu2–3</italic>; <italic>his3–11, 15</italic>; <italic>trp1–1</italic>; <italic>ura3–1</italic>; <italic>can1–100</italic>).

All yeast transformations were performed by the lithium acetate method and transformants were selected on the appropriate media and verified by PCR, and where appropriate, gene expression. Haploid strains containing multiple tags, deletions, or combinations thereof were generated either by mating and sporulation, or by sequential PCR-based homologous recombination.

First, the kanMX6, TRP1, or HIS3MX6 selection cassettes were introduced after the stop codon of a MICOS ORF in a wild type strain using PCR-based targeted homologous recombination. Then, genomic DNA was prepared from these strains, and the entire cassette containing the MICOS ORF, selection cassette, and regions upstream and downstream of the ORF was PCR-amplified and reintroduced into the ∆MICOS strain.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and two peer reviewers, one of whom, Richard Youle, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers and editors. Based on our discussions, we find that your manuscript, albeit of considerable interest, cannot be accepted for publication in its current form. You will need to provide new data to support your proposal, but if you are able to address the concerns in a timely manner we would request the same reviewers for their recommendation.</p><p>Four major issues were raised by the reviewers that would need to be resolved experimentally:</p><p>1) The work would benefit from more EM or super resolution analyses of MICOS protein localizations relative to predicted cristae junctions. Currently, protein localization assessments are indirect (near Ox Phos complex proteins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) and of low resolution. An important conclusion is that the Mic27/Mic10/Mic12 complex localizes to cristae junctions independent of Mic60. This is based on the correlated locations of Mic27 and respiratory complexes presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D and E</xref>. At least a quantification (which is admittedly a challenge on its own) of the proximity of Mic27 to Qcr2 and Atp2 and addressing whether they are more adjacent to each other than to some other mitochondrial substructure (nucleoids?) is needed to support this conclusion. This would assure that not everything is close together within mitochondria visualized at this low resolution. However, immune-Ems would be the best solution.</p><p>2) One related issue is the identification of MICOS “subcomplexes” found when subsets or individual components of MICOS are expressed in delta MICOS cells. Could the Mic60 foci in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> be misfolded aggregates? Perhaps expression of Mic19 stabilizes Mic60 allowing it to fold more normally. Immuno-EM may allow the authors to support the claim that Mic60 labels discrete structures (cristae junctions?) rather than forming nonspecific aggregates. Or perhaps blue native gels would support the contention that Mic60 forms discrete substructures. It would be important to back up or substantiate the authors’ conclusion at the end of the subsection headed “Mic10, Mic12, and Mic27 form a second independent MICOS organizing center” that Mic60 “has an intrinsic self-organizational capacity” above and beyond self-aggregation. Self-aggregation may also explain why Mic60 foci form in Rho0 cells. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> shows that Mic60 forms focal assemblies in Mic19 null cells that overlap with Mic27. This supports the authors’ idea that Mic60 is localized to actual substructures but in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (relative to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) location of Mic60 may be influenced by other MICOS proteins and prevent aggregation.</p><p>3) The authors describe that alterations in cardiolipin affect Mic27/10/12 assembly, but not the Mic60/19 sub complex, which is consistent with the previous notion that mammalian Mic27 binds cardiolipin. However, loss of cardiolipin leads to disassembly of respiratory chain super complexes, which have been linked to cristae morphogenesis. It remains unclear how the authors distinguish between a direct effect of cardiolipin on Mic27 from that caused by an assembly defect of respiratory chain super complexes (even more as they observe that impaired assembly of respiratory complexes affects MICOS sub complexes).</p><p>4) Based on in-gel assays of respiratory chain complexes the authors propose that the loss of MICOS complexes does not affect assembly, but localization/positioning of respiratory complexes and thus impair their activity. This is highly speculative. Is it possible that complex IV lacks accessory factor(s) in MICOS-deficient cells? The authors should at least perform EM analysis to examine whether deletions of CBS1 or MSS51 restore cristae in the absence of Mic60 or MICOS.</p><p>Two more minor issues were also raised that would be valuable to address:</p><p>A) The point made in the Abstract that MICOS subunits have non-redundant functions has already been reported by the authors and others (Dev. Cell 21:694, 2011; FEBS J. 280:4943, 2013). For thoroughness, these prior papers describing non-redundant import related functions of Mic60 should be cited to high light the non-redundant genetic interactions (Hoppins 2011).</p><p>B) The dependence of Mic27/10/12 assemblies on mitochondrial DNA and their functional link to respiratory complexes is very intriguing. However, it is unclear how MICOS complexes affect mtDNA and vice versa. Restoration of cristae structures upon loss of the ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>) or upon the loss of mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Itoh et al., 2013</xref>) has been described and the reported findings do not provide significant new insight into the molecular basis of these observations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07739.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The work would benefit from more EM or super resolution analyses of MICOS protein localizations relative to predicted cristae junctions.

Data supporting this conclusion include the dependence of Mic27 foci formation on the presence of cristae as well as the adjacent localization of Mic27 foci to cristae-localized respiratory complex proteins <italic>∆mic60</italic> cells. We agree that more equivocal support would include immuno-EM data demonstrating more directly the localization of Mic27 to cristae junctions. However, immuno-EM analysis of Mic27 in <italic>∆mic60</italic> cells, as mentioned in the manuscript, proved too technically challenging because of the low abundance of both cristae junctions and Mic27 foci in <italic>∆mic60</italic> cells and the difficulty associated with visualizing cristae junctions in thin section. However, in order to determine if this problem was specific to <italic>∆mic60</italic> cells, we performed immuno-labeling of Mic60 in both <italic>∆mic19</italic> cells and ∆MICOS cells. We obtained images of gold particle clusters specific for Mic60 at the edges of mitochondria (as observed for Mic27 immuno-gold labeling), which likely correspond to the focal appearance we observe by fluorescence. However as seen previously for Mic27, we could not determine whether these were spatially linked to cristae junctions because of the morphology of the mitochondrial membranes in these thin sections.</p><p>Given the importance of this conclusion, however, we further analyzed our light imaging data by quantitatively assessing the proximity of Mic27 and Mic60 foci to substructures labeled by Qcr2 and Atp2, proteins previously demonstrated to be enriched in cristae. Per the reviewers’ request, we acquired higher resolution images using a CMOS camera with ∼2x greater pixel density (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-4E</xref>, Figure 4–figure supplement 5-6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D-7E</xref>, and Figure 7–figure supplement 3). We think these images convincingly demonstrate the localization of both Mic27 and Mic60 foci immediately adjacent to submitochondrial-concentrated regions of Qcr2 and Atp2. Thus, to further test this, we developed an unbiased quantitative analysis method of these higher resolution images, which indicates that the localization pattern of Mic27 foci adjacent to Qcr2-labled cristae is non-random (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4–supplement 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) One related issue is the identification of MICOS</italic> “<italic>subcomplexes</italic>” <italic>found when subsets or individual components of MICOS are expressed in delta MICOS cells.

Specifically, we solubilized mitochondria from wild type and ∆MICOS cells expressing Mic60-EGFP using 100mM NaCl and 1% TX-100 and performed a 50,000g spin for 1h, which is sufficient to pellet protein aggregates 60S or greater (equivalent to ∼2 MDa 60S ribosome). Under these conditions, Fcj1-GFP in both the wild type (sized at 0.6 to 1.5 MDa in published work) and in ∆MICOS mitochondrial extracts was quantitatively recovered in the supernatant fraction. These data indicate that Mic60-EGFP foci in ∆MICOS cells do not represent non-specific aggregates, and are likely self-assemblies or form as a consequence of another determinant.</p><p><italic>3) The authors describe that alterations in cardiolipin affect Mic27/10/12 assembly, but not the Mic60/19 sub complex, which is consistent with the previous notion that mammalian Mic27 binds cardiolipin. However, loss of cardiolipin leads to disassembly of respiratory chain super complexes, which have been linked to cristae morphogenesis. It remains unclear how the authors distinguish between a direct effect of cardiolipin on Mic27 from that caused by an assembly defect of respiratory chain super complexes (even more as they observe that impaired assembly of respiratory complexes affects MICOS sub complexes)</italic>.</p><p>In our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>)we include the possibility that the effect of cardiolipin on respiratory supercomplex assembly may indirectly influence Mic27 subcomplex assembly, In our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), we include the possibility that the effect of cardiolipin on respiratory supercomplex assembly may indirectly influence Mic27 subcomplex assembly. However, while decreases in cardiolipin are linked to disassembly of respiratory chain super complexes, to date there is no link between cristae morphogenesis and supercomplex formation in yeast cells, with the exception of ATP synthase dimerization, which is not altered by loss of cardiolipin in cells. However, it is possible that cardiolipin synthesis may indirectly regulate Mic27 subcomplex assembly through an effect on respiratory complex assembly, but not through defects in cristae morphogenesis. An equally probable possibility suggested by our data is that Mic27 subcomplexes may directly sense cardiolipin through its apolipoprotein-like domain. We have made sure not to overstate this conclusion.</p><p><italic>4) Based on in-gel assays of respiratory chain complexes the authors propose that the loss of MICOS complexes does not affect assembly, but localization/positioning of respiratory complexes and thus impair their activity. This is highly speculative. Is it possible that complex IV lacks accessory factor(s) in MICOS-deficient cells? The authors should at least perform EM analysis to examine whether deletions of CBS1 or MSS51 restore cristae in the absence of Mic60 or MICOS</italic>.</p><p>Our data do not definitively determine the cause of the respiratory defect in the absence of MICOS, Our data do not definitively determine the cause of the respiratory defect in the absence of MICOS, beyond noting that there is a subtle defect in complex IV activity. However, our analysis also indicates that respiratory complexes and supercomplexes are intact in ∆MICOS cells. In order to test the status of respiratory complex composition more thoroughly, we performed 2D native SDS-PAGE gel analysis of detergent-solubilized purified mitochondria (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These data show no apparent defects in the composition of assembled respiratory complexes in either ∆mic60 or ∆MICOS cells, indicating that ∆MICOS cells do not lack complex IV accessory factor(s). We are currently delving into the cause of the respiratory deficiency in ∆MICOS cells by examining suppressors, but we think that this is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p>The reviewers also suggest that we perform EM analysis on cells deficient for Complex III or IV assembly factors to test if cristae are restored in ∆MICOS cells in their absence. Based on this suggestion, the reviewers likely misunderstood our data from ∆MICOS rho0 cells. Specifically, in ∆MICOS cells only aberrant mitochondrial morphology is restored upon loss of respiratory complexes (rho0), not cristae structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Indeed, restoration of morphology correlates with loss of cristae in rho0 cells, which indicates that the aberrant cristae, observed by light imaging of Qcr2, causes mitochondrial morphological defects in ∆MICOS, a finding we previously published for single MICOS subunit deletion cells (Hoppins et al. JCB 2011). Thus, while deletion of CBS1 and MSS51 partially restore tubular morphology in ∆MICOS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and 6G</xref>), this is not mediated through restoration of cristae morphology.</p><p><italic>Two more minor issues were also raised that would be valuable to address</italic>:</p><p><italic>A) The point made in the Abstract that MICOS subunits have non-redundant functions has already been reported by the authors and others (Dev.

For thoroughness, these prior papers describing non-redundant import related functions of Mic60 should be cited to high light the non-redundant genetic interactions (Hoppins 2011)</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have now specifically highlighted the MICOS-independent import-related function of Mic60 in the Introduction. While the FEBS J reference the reviewer suggested shows a Mic60-specific role in accumulation of mutant Sod1, this is not necessarily an import-related function of Mic60, and thus we do not cite it here.</p><p><italic>B) The dependence of Mic27/10/12 assemblies on mitochondrial DNA and their functional link to respiratory complexes is very intriguing. However, it is unclear how MICOS complexes affect mtDNA and vice versa. Restoration of cristae structures upon loss of the ATP synthase (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20"><italic>Hoppins et al., 2011</italic></xref><italic>) or upon the loss of mtDNA (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21"><italic>Itoh et al., 2013</italic></xref><italic>) has been described and the reported findings do not provide significant new insight into the molecular basis of these observations</italic>.</p><p>As stated above for point 4, loss of ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>) or loss of mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Itoh et al., 2013</xref>) have been shown to alleviate mitochondrial morphology defects in the absence of MICOS components, however, neither work shows a restoration of normal cristae morphology. Our data indicate that mitochondrial DNA is maintained in ∆MICOS cells (though nucleoids often appear mis-distributed) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and correspondingly, respiratory complexes are still expressed and assembled in ∆MICOS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, as stated for in our response to point 4 above, in ∆MICOS cells, deletion of respiratory complex assembly factors or loss of mtDNA causes loss of cristae, which is what is correlated with the suppression of mitochondrial morphological defects, not the restoration of cristae structure. The link between the presence of respiratory complexes and Mic27/10/12 assemblies but not Mic60 assemblies is a conceptual advance because it suggests that Mic60 marks nascent cristae sites and that Mic27/10/12 assemblies are recruited/assembled following cristae biogenesis driven by ATP synthase and respiratory complexes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
