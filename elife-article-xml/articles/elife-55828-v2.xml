orchestrated process but how double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) are initially recognized is unclear. Here, we show that polymerized SIRT6 deacetylase recognizes DSBs and potentiates the DDR in human and mouse cells. First, SIRT1 deacetylates SIRT6 at residue K33, which is important for SIRT6 polymerization and mobilization toward DSBs. Then, K33-deacetylated SIRT6 anchors to γH2AX, allowing its retention on and subsequent remodeling of local chromatin. We show that a K33R mutation that mimics hypoacetylated SIRT6 can rescue defective DNA repair as a result of <italic>SIRT1</italic> deficiency in cultured cells. These data highlight the synergistic action between SIRTs in the spatiotemporal regulation of the DDR and DNA repair in humans and mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group

endogenous and exogenous agents. Upon detection of damage, the DNA damage response (DDR) is immediately elicited to regain genomic integrity via chromatin remodeling, signaling transduction and amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>). Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most severe type of DNA lesion; they are recognized by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex, which recruits and activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) or ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR). H2AX is then rapidly phosphorylated (γH2AX) by ATM/ATR, and serves as a platform to localize repair proteins near to the DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Celeste et al., 2003</xref>). Simultaneously, various histone-modifying enzymes, heterochromatin factors and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers work cooperatively to relax the chromatin structure and ensure that additional repair factors have access to the DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Price and D'Andrea, 2013</xref>). Despite all these advances in understanding the DDR, how DSBs are initially and precisely recognized is largely unknown.</p><p>NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent sirtuins belong to class III histone deacetylases (HDACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Houtkooper et al., 2012</xref>). Seven sirtuins (SIRT1-7) with various enzymatic activities and physiological functions are expressed in mammals. SIRT1, 6 and 7 localize in the nucleus and seem to be most relevant to the DDR as their depletion causes growth retardation, a defective DDR and DNA repair and premature aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mostoslavsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vazquez et al., 2016</xref>). Upon DNA damage, SIRT1 redistributes on chromatin, co-localizes with γH2AX, and deacetylates XPA, NBS1 and Ku70 to regulate nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yuan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fan and Luo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jeong et al., 2007</xref>).

Despite their rapid mobilization to DNA breaks, the triggers for sirtuin recruitment are obscure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vazquez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dobbin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Toiber et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we aimed to delineate the mechanisms underlying DSB recognition. We found that SIRT6 polymerizes and directly recognizes DSBs via a putative DNA-binding pocket consisting of N- and C-termini from two adjacent molecules.

We thus reasoned that SIRTs might directly sense DNA breaks, especially DSBs. To test our hypothesis, we established a molecular docking simulation using AutoDock Vina software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Trott and Olson, 2010</xref>).

Both the N-termini and C-termini are essential for SIRT6 to associate with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tennen et al., 2010</xref>). To gain biochemical evidence for SIRT6 polymerization, we employed a biomolecule fluorescence compensation system (BiFC). In brief, we cloned <italic>SIRT6</italic> cDNA into either the N-terminal or C-terminal of a yellow fluorescence protein (YFP), herein termed N-SIRT6 and C-SIRT6. The yellow fluorescence was detectable by FACS only when N-SIRT6 directly interacted with C-SIRT6. After co-transfecting these constructs into HEK293 cells, we detected a strong fluorescence signal by FACS in &gt;24% cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting a direct interaction between the two SIRT6 molecules. By contrast, fluorescence signal was rarely detected in BiFC analysis of N-SIRT6 and C-SIRT3 or non-tagged SIRT6 and C-SIRT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To confirm this SIRT6 polymerization event, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) in HEK293 cells in which we had co-overexpressed FLAG-SIRT6 and HA-SIRT6. Consistently, we detected FLAG-SIRT6 but not FLAG-SIRT3 in the anti-HA-SIRT6 immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>The DSB phosphate backbone is negatively charged. The positive-charged environment of SIRT6 thus favors its binding to DSBs. Indeed, one of our predicted DSB-binding pockets formed by two adjacent molecules in SIRT6 hexamer consisted of six positively charged residues at the edge, namely four arginine (R32/39) and two lysine (K33) residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Acetylation is the most redundant post-translational modification that converts positively charged K to neutral Kac. This property is utilized by proteins with a lysine-rich domain (KRD), for example Histones, Ku70 and p53, for mediating dynamic interactions with proteins harboring an acidic domain like SET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). The heterodimerized Ku70 and Ku80 complex directly senses DSBs via a flexible C-termini containing multiple K residues, and regulates NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore examined whether SIRT6 is (de)acetylated on these K residues thus sensing DSBs. We immunoprecipitated FLAG-SIRT6 with an anti-FLAG antibody and then probed the immunoprecipitate with anti-Kac antibodies. As shown, Kac was detected in the precipitated FLAG-SIRT6 immunocomplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We then purified FLAG-SIRT6 and performed high-resolution LC-MS/MS to identify which K residues are acetylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We identified K15 and K33 in the N-terminus. To confirm these acetylated K residues, we generated K15R and K33R point mutants, with K17R serving as a negative control. While neither K15R nor K17R affected the FLAG-SIRT6 acetylation level, K33R significantly inhibited it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), supporting that K33 is dynamically (de)acetylated.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SIRT6 K33 (de)acetylation regulates DSB binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The acetylation levels of FLAG-SIRT6 WT and K33R were assessed by western blotting with pan-acetyl antibodies in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates in HEK293T cells.

We thus monitored the occupancy of SIRT6 on chromatin surrounding these induced DSBs, by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and quantitative PCR, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Soutoglou et al., 2007</xref>). Both the K33Q and H133Y mutations compromised SIRT6 recruitment to the sites of damage, whereas SIRT6 K33R recruitment was comparable to that of SIRT6 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p>Upon DNA damage, the acetylation levels of H3K9 and H3K56 decline, and after repair, goes back to the original level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tjeertes et al., 2009</xref>).

One possible explanation is that PARP1 is first recruited to DSBs; then, SIRTs are later recruited directly by DSBs and facilitate PARP1 stabilization and expansion in the surrounding region.</p><p>The sirtuin family members share similar functions in the DDR and in DNA repair; upon DNA damage, both SIRT1 and SIRT6 are rapidly mobilized to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vazquez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dobbin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Toiber et al., 2013</xref>). SIRT1 redistributes on chromatin and deacetylates XPA, NBS1 and Ku70 to promote DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yuan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fan and Luo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jeong et al., 2007</xref>). Recently, an elegant study demonstrated that PAR recruits SIRT1 and BRG1 to DSB sites and promotes HR efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Other studies reported that SIRT6 mono-ribosylates PARP1 to enhance its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mao et al., 2011</xref>), and SIRT6 facilitates the subsequent recruitment of SNF2H, H2AX and DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atsumi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McCord et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Van Meter et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we revealed a synergistic action between two nuclear SIRTs in DDR−SIRT1 deacetylates SIRT6 to promote its mobilization to DSBs. A K33R mutant, mimicking the hypo-acetylated SIRT6, can rescue DNA repair defects in <italic>SIRT1</italic> null cells. Both BRG1 and SNF2H are chromatin remodeling ATPases, responsible for open chromatin architecture. It is reasonable to speculate that these early DDR responding factors like PARP1, SIRT1, SIRT6, SNF2H and BRG1 are quickly and sequentially stimulated by DSBs, wherein they constitute a super complex to potentiate DDR and DNA repair; posttranslational modifications like deacetylation and mono-ADP ribosylation empower the complex to recruit other repair factors more efficiently. Interestingly, SIRT6 phosphorylation at S10 by JNK promotes subsequent recruitment itself and PARP1 upon oxidative stress, also supporting an essential role of the SIRT6 N terminus for DSB-recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Van Meter et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with the cooperative action between SIRT1 and SIRT6, independent studies have revealed an interaction between SIRT1 and SIRT7, showing that SIRT1 recruits SIRT7 to promote cancer cell metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Malik et al., 2015</xref>), and that SIRT1 and SIRT7 antagonistically regulate adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The acetylation levels of H3K9 and H3K56 decrease upon detecting DSBs and then return to basal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tjeertes et al., 2009</xref>). SIRT1 and SIRT6 are H3K9ac and H3K56ac deacetylases; both are recruited to DSBs, indicating that SIRT1 and/or SIRT6 might contribute to reducing H3K9ac and H3K56ac levels. Although mechanistically unclear, H3K9ac and H3K56ac levels negatively correlate with γH2AX levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tjeertes et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we found that while γH2AX is not required for initial SIRT6 recruitment, it is indispensable for retaining SIRT6 on the local chromatin surrounding DSBs. This finding is consistent with reports that γH2AX is dispensable for initial reorganization of DNA breaks but rather serves as a platform to stabilize DNA repair factors, such as NBS1, 53BP1 and BRCA1. SIRT6 deacetylates H3K9ac and H3K56ac surrounding DSBs, in this way bridging γH2AX to chromatin remodeling. While the in vivo data demonstrated that SIRT6 K33Q deacetylation activity toward histone H3 was compromised, the in vitro deacetylation assay using a synthesized acetyl H3 peptide showed negligible effect. It is speculated that the initial DSB recognition and chromatin retention might potentiate the deacetylase activity of SIRT6 toward local histones, for example H3K9ac and H3K56ac; the impaired DSB recognition and chromatin retention might compromise the deacetylase activity of SIRT6 K33Q on local histone proteins. Putting together the findings provide a scenario as to how γH2AX and histone modifiers coordinate to amplify the DDR.</p><p>SIRT6 and SNF2H cooperate to stabilize γH2AX foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atsumi et al., 2015</xref>). Here we found that γH2AX in-fact anchors SIRT6 to DSBs, providing a positive feedback regulatory loop between SIRT6 and γH2AX. This finding is consistent with reports showing a distinct reduction of γH2AX and an improper DDR in <italic>Sirt6<sup>–/–</sup></italic> and <italic>Sirt1<sup>–/–</sup></italic> cells. Recent work also suggests that an electrostatic force between a negatively charged phosphate group and a positively charged lysine groups is a novel form of protein–protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). We thus consider it plausible to speculate that (de)acetylation might act as a switch to modulate such an interaction between SIRT6 and γH2AX.</p><p>Known as longevity-associated genes, SIRT6 and SIRT1 are redundant in DNA repair but not replaceable. In this study, we have identified that SIRT6 directly binds to DNA breaks and have elucidated a physical and functional interaction between SIRT6 and SIRT1. SIRT6 rescues DNA repair defects imposed by SIRT1 deficiency. Overall, these data highlight a synergistic action of nuclear SIRTs in the spatiotemporal regulation of the DDR and DNA repair.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>SIRT6</italic></td><td valign="top">National Center for Biotechnology Information</td><td valign="top">Gene ID: 51548</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>SIRT1</italic></td><td valign="top">National Center for Biotechnology Information</td><td valign="top">Gene ID: 23411</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>H2ax</italic></td><td valign="top">National Center for Biotechnology Information</td><td valign="top">Gene ID: 15270</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>H2AX</italic></td><td valign="top">National Center for Biotechnology Information</td><td valign="top">Gene ID: 3014</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK293</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">ATCC CRL-1573</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HeLa</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">ATCC CRM-CCL-2</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MEF</td><td valign="top">Dr Linyu Lu (Zhejiang University, China)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>H2ax-/-</italic> MEF</td><td valign="top">Dr Linyu Lu (Zhejiang <break/>University, China)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">SIRT6 (rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam (Cambridge, UK)</td><td valign="top">Cat# ab62738, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_956299">AB_956299</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Applications: WB;

deal of effort to succinctly demonstrate a synergistic interaction between two predominant proteins involved with DNA repair. These two sirtuins are of great interest in several fields, including cancer, aging, and genome stability.

This manuscript provides some much needed insight into the relationship between sirtuins and how they manage the critical process of DNA repair.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Synergy between SIRT1 and SIRT6 helps recognize DNA breaks and potentiate the DNA damage response and repair&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Matthew Simon as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Overall, the work was well received and the reviewers are quite positive that the work will be impactful to the field once the requested revisions are addressed.

This, in turn, helps to recruit repair proteins and stabilize SIRT6 at DNA damage sites. The authors demonstrate that SIRT6 is able to directly recognize DNA DSBs which supports a recent study published in <italic>eLife</italic> (Toiber et al., 2020). Interestingly, the authors describe a novel mechanism whereby SIRT6 needs to be deacetylated in order to recognize DNA DSBs and that this deacetylation is performed by SIRT1. Through the use of SIRT6 acetyl mutants, the authors map the acetylation site to K33 and demonstrate through several robust experiments the interaction between this site and SIRT1. The authors then describe experiments that suggest the DNA damage-induced histone mark gH2AX is dispensable for the initial recruitment of deacetylated SIRT6, but required for its retention at DSB sites. The authors finalize the manuscript by suggesting that expression of a hypoacetylated SIRT6 (K33R) is able to overcome DNA repair defects caused by SIRT1 deficiency.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 2C, the authors suggest that SIRT6 K33R does indeed have increased DSB affinity when compared to the K33Q mutant, and that this is supportive of the data presented in Figure 2B. Whilst it is true that K33R binds DNA more efficiently in this assay then K33Q, it is not possible to interpret the significance of the hypoacetylation for this binding without WT SIRT6. The authors need to repeat this experiment including recombinant WT SIRT6 as a control. One would expect that wild type SIRT6 DNA binding affinity should be somewhere in between the two mutants.</p><p>2) In the text the authors state that the enzymatic activity of the SIRT6 K33Q is unaffected. However, based on the IF data in Figure 2 as well as the histone acetyl western blots in Figure 2—figure supplement 3, this does not seem to be the case. Can the authors please rationalize the differences seen in the IF and immunoblot experiments compared to their enzymatic activity assay described in Figure 2—figure supplement 3C.</p><p>3) For Figure 3G, the authors need to address the lack of pull down of the c-terminal peptide. The authors concluded that N terminus of SIRT6 is crucial for SIRT1-SIRT6 interaction. However, in Figure 3G, both SIRT6ΔN and ΔC fail to interact with SIRT1. Although the authors claimed that the result arises from the nuclear location signal is located in C terminus, a more direct evidence such as in vitro immunoprecipitation of SIRT6ΔC with SIRT1 is recommended.</p><p>4) The biochemistry experiments performed in Figure 3 are nicely done. Do the authors see an increase in the interaction between SIRT6 and SIRT1 upon DNA damage (e.g. Ionizing Radiation)? This would be a strong experiment to include.</p><p>5) Figure 4 needs some clarification with labeling and constructs being used. Labeling in 4A is unclear. In Figures 4C and 4D the authors ectopically express Flag-tagged SIRT1 and SIRT6 constructs. They then perform a Flag IP to isolate SIRT6 to determine the acetylation levels of SIRT6 in the presence of wild type SIRT1, enzymatically inactive SIRT1 or in the presence of inhibitors (Figure 4D). This makes interpretation of this data difficult, as it's not clear how the authors know which sirtuin is being immunoprecipitating when both are flag-tagged and the immunoprecipitation is being performed using a flag antibody. These experiments need to be repeated with a different tag on either SIRT1 or SIRT6 if this is the case. In Figure 4E, is the flag immunoblot the input or the IP? Going by the labelling, it appears as if this is the input. If this is the case, then there is no FLAG IP immunoblot shown and interpretation of the AcK immunoblot is inhibited without this data. Please provide the Flag IP immunoblot for this experiment.</p><p>6) Explain the elevated γH2AX level in the absence of CPT in Input of Figure 5B.</p><p>7) Several gel images need to be repeated for clarity, as the conclusions drawn from them are critical to the thesis, but the ability to discern the accuracy of the gel images is weak. In particular, Figure 2G, 4D, 5E and 7A. Figure 7A, in particular, is very unclear (SIRT1 <sup>-/-</sup> bands look to be different sizes compared to the other lanes).</p><p>8) Many gel images and subsequent assays lack quantification. All images and laser experiments should include quantification to more accurately present the observations, as well as to provide the statistical rigor used. The graphics of Western blot need to have a uniform format (some with borders, some without). In regards to statistics, the authors need to clarify the n-values used for the vast majority of their experiments.</p><p>9) Using the ISce1 system, the authors demonstrate that K33R is as effective as recognizing DNA DSBS as wild type SIRT6, and far superior to K33Q and HY mutants. One would therefore expect that the DNA repair kinetics of K33R is far superior to K33Q and HY mutants, and at least comparable to SIRT6 wild type. Can the authors show this by performing immunofluorescence staining/foci analysis for key DNA repair proteins (e.g. H2AX, 53BP1, BRCA1, Rad51) following ionizing radiation? (This will support experimental data from both Figure 2 and Figure 7, as well as providing critical support for a role of this acetylation in the physiological DDR). Figure 7F should be backed up with the HR assay they used earlier.</p><p>10) In Figure 7E, overexpression of SIRT6 WT and K33R in SIRT1 KO cells can both rescue the genomic stability to a similar extent. Does it mean that only a small fraction of SIRT6 is acetylated in normal conditions? The authors should make some discussions.</p><p>11) A previous study demonstrated that PAR mediated recruitment of SIRT1 could also improve HR repair through deacetylating the chromatin remodeler BRG1 (PMID: 31291457). Also, SIRT6 activates PARP1 to promote HR and alt-NHEJ. In this study, SIRT6 was proved to be able to rescue deficient DNA repair caused by SIRT1 KO. The authors should comment on the regulatory loop</p><p>12) Please can the authors improve the clarity of their labelling on all figures and ensure sufficient information is provided in the figure legends.</p><p>13) In Figures 5F-G the authors describe experiments that suggest gH2AX is required for chromatin retention of SIRT6. Indeed in H2AX<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs, SIRT6 is rapidly recruited to damage chromatin but is not retained at later time points. This is an interesting finding, although the quality of the IFs is questionable. Can the authors quantify these images? Since the experiment takes advantage of overexpressed H2AX proteins (which could cause artifacts), could the authors, as an alternative approach, also recapitulate this finding in WT MEFs in the presence of ATM/ATR inhibitors. ATM/ATR inhibition should reduce H2AX phosphorylation and therefore should mimic what is seen in Figure 5G.</p><p>14) In Figure 7A, an immunoblot for SIRT1 is required. In Figure 7B, an immunoblot is required showing the levels of expression of the SIRT6 constructs when re-expressed in the SIRT6 KO cells. This is critical for the interpretation of the comet assay. Indeed, it is somewhat surprising that the tail moment is not reduced to a greater extent when WT SIRT6 is re-introduced. Perhaps expression levels can explain this? This needs to be addressed by the authors.</p><p>15) In Figure 7C, can the authors mention the % of GFP expressing cells, rather than the relative levels? It is known that low-efficiency in GFP expression could lead to differences between samples that do not reflect true differences in HR.</p><p>16) In Figure 7D and E, the authors use an ectopic expression model in HeLa cells to test the ability of SIRT6 mutant expressing cells to form colonies in the absence and presence of ionizing radiation. This experiment needs to be repeated in the context of endogenous SIRT6 knockout background (like the SIRT6 HEK293KO cells they used in 7B). The reason for this is that the lack of difference seen with K33R could simply be that endogenous SIRT6 wild type levels are sufficient for colony formation and survival in these cells. Moreover, we absolutely need to see an immunoblot showing the expression levels of these mutants in these cells.</p><p>17) In Figure 7F the authors attempt to link the roles of SIRT1 and SIRT6 in the DNA damage response, suggesting that a SIRT6 mutant that cannot be acetylated at K33 is sufficient to overcome the effects of SIRT1 depletion. There is some difficulty in reconciling the result they got when re-expressing SIRT6 wild type in this experiment. If SIRT6 needs to be deacetylated in order to be recruited to DNA DSBs, then one would expect that overexpression of wild type SIRT6 in the absence of SIRT1 (SIRT1<sup>-/-</sup> 293Ts) would have no impact on the ability of cells to repair DNA damage because it will still be acetylated at K33 and therefore not recruited to DNA DSBS. One would expect SIRT6 wild type to have comparable levels of DNA damage as the vector control, however the authors see a complete rescue of the phenotype when expressing WT SIRT6, raising concerns as to the significance of that acetylation. This needs to be explained/rationalized by the authors as this is somewhat contradictory to the model proposed by the authors. Again, we also need to see an immunoblot showing the expression levels of the SIRT6 mutants, as well as the successful re-expression of wild type SIRT1 into the SIRT1 <sup>-/-</sup> MEFS.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55828.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 2C, the authors suggest that SIRT6 K33R does indeed have increased DSB affinity when compared to the K33Q mutant, and that this is supportive of the data presented in Figure 2B.

The in vivo cellular data (revised Figures 2I and Figure 2—figure supplement 3A) showed that SIRT6 K33Q deacetylase activity towards histone H3 was compromised, while the in vitro deacetylation assay using the bacterially-purified SIRT6 proteins and synthesized acetyl H3 peptides showed negligible difference (revised Figure 2—figure supplement 3C). We reasoned that the initial recognition of DSB and retention on chromatin facilitated histone deacetylation mediated by SIRT6; the compromised DSB recognition and chromatin retention of K33Q inhibited SIRT6 deacetylase activity towards local histone, e.g. H3K9ac and H3K56ac. We have discussed this possibility in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) For Figure 3G, the authors need to address the lack of pull down of the c-terminal peptide.

As suggested, we repeated the IP experiment with anti HA antibodies in cells expressing HA-labeled SIRT6 and FLAG-labeled SIRT1 WT or HY mutant, showing that while FLAG-SIRT1 WT deceased the acetylation level of HA-SIRT6, FLAG-SIRT1 HY failed both in cell system and in vitro (revised Figures 4C and 4D).

Less γH2AX foci was noticed in Hela cells transfected ectopic SIRT6 WT or K33R compared to K33Q or H133Y at 8h after IR (revised Figure 7—figure supplement 4), indicating that deacetylation of SIRT6 K33 is crucial for DNA repair.

A recent study demonstrated that PAR recruits SIRT1 and BRG1 to DSB sites and promotes HR efficiency (Chen et al., 2019). Other studies reported that SIRT6 mono-ADP ribosylates PARP1 to stimulate its activity (Mao et al., 2011) and is required for the recruitment of SNF2H to DSBs (Toiber et al., 2013). Both BRG1 and SNF2H are chromatin remodeling ATPases, responsible for opening the chromatin architecture. Our data revealed that both SIRT1 and SIRT6 mobilized to DSBs within seconds and SIRT1 deacetylates SIRT6 to promote its recognition of DSBs, highlighting their synergistic function in the early stage of DDR. Although the regulation loop is obscure, there might be one possibility that these early responding factors like PARP1, SIRT1, SIRT6, SNF2H and BRG1 are sequentially stimulated by DSBs, wherein they constitute a super complex to potentiate DDR and DNA repair; posttranslational modifications like deacetylation and mono-ADP ribosylation might empower the complex to recruit other repair factors more efficiently.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Please can the authors improve the clarity of their labelling on all figures and ensure sufficient information is provided in the figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, figure legends with more details were provided in revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) In Figures 5F-G the authors describe experiments that suggest gH2AX is required for chromatin retention of SIRT6.

Also, we used ATM/ATR inhibitor caffeine and performed the recruitment assay of SIRT6. The data showed that caffeine inhibited γH2AX. While the recruitment of SIRT6 to DSBs was merely affected at 2 min after laser-induced DNA damage, the retention of SIRT6 at DSBs was significantly compromised at 10 min after DNA damage in MEFs (revised Figure 5—figure supplement 1), supporting that γH2AX is required for SIRT6 retention surrounding DSBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) In Figure 7A, an immunoblot for SIRT1 is required.
