To decipher this genomic regulatory code, and to investigate the developmental relevance of noncoding transcription, we compared genome-wide promoter activity throughout embryogenesis in 5 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. Core promoters, generally not thought to play a significant regulatory role, in fact impart restrictions on the developmental timing of gene expression on a global scale. We propose a hierarchical regulatory model in which core promoters define broad windows of opportunity for expression, by defining a range of transcription factors from which they can receive regulatory inputs. This two-tiered mechanism globally orchestrates developmental gene expression, including extremely widespread noncoding transcription. The sequence and expression specificity of noncoding RNA promoters are evolutionarily conserved, implying biological relevance. Overall, this work introduces a hierarchical model for developmental gene regulation, and reveals a major role for noncoding transcription in animal development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Genome</kwd><kwd>Drosophila</kwd><kwd>Melanogaster</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Watson School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Florence Gould Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Batut</surname><given-names>Philippe J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gene expression timing during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development is specified by multiple classes of RNA polymerase II core promoters, and the embryonic transcriptome includes thousands of evolutionarily conserved long noncoding RNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Development in metazoans is orchestrated by complex gene regulatory programs encoded in the sequence of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lewis, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levine and Davidson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peter and Davidson, 2011</xref>).

Sequences that bind transcriptional activators and repressors, known as enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerji et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerji et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zinn et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Small et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schaffner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benoist and Chambon, 1980</xref>), are generally thought to be the primary determinants of gene expression specificity. Sequences that serve as docking sites for the basal transcription machinery, the core promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lenhard et al., 2012</xref>), are usually assumed to be structural elements that contribute little or no regulatory information.</p><p>Indeed, core promoters contain sequence motifs (e.g., TATA boxes) that serve as a platform for RNA Pol II initiation at transcription start sites (TSSs), but are not by themselves sufficient to induce transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lenhard et al., 2012</xref>). Sequence-specific activators and repressors, collectively designated as transcription factors (TFs), bind to enhancers and foster the assembly of the basal transcription machinery at associated core promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lenhard et al., 2012</xref>). Beyond these general principles, the syntax of the code, and in particular the functional relationship between these two classes of elements, remains obscure. Interacting core promoter-enhancer pairs may be directly adjacent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zinn et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benoist and Chambon, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zabidi et al., 2015</xref>), or may be located hundreds of kilobases apart in metazoan genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lettice et al., 2003</xref>), and the rules enforcing specific interactions are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lenhard et al., 2012</xref>). There is evidence that core promoters can influence the expression specificity of some genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zabidi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goodrich and Tjian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haberle et al., 2014</xref>), but so far this has not been systematically studied in the context of development. Understanding the basis of transcriptional control requires parsing out these complex interactions.</p><p>In addition to delineating the rules of gene regulation, it is necessary to expand the concept of gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerstein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gingeras, 2007</xref>) to include all the noncoding loci that may control developmental processes. Indeed, it has become increasingly clear that noncoding transcription is very prevalent in Eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kapranov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Djebali et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Graveley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerstein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Young et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Derrien et al., 2012</xref>), and both genetic and biochemical studies have unambiguously established long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as functional components of the cellular machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ulitsky and Bartel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guttman and Rinn, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ponting et al., 2009</xref>). Exhaustively annotating noncoding transcripts, and identifying those with biologically relevant functions, is crucial to our understanding of development.</p><p>Deciphering the meaning of regulatory sequences, or assessing the biological relevance of lncRNA genes, are daunting tasks that require innovative strategies. The use of genome-wide functional assays in a phylogenetic framework is a powerful and general approach to such questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsankov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stefflova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">He et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, direct measurements of complex genome functions in multiple species provide a sort of genomic Rosetta Stone from which the underlying code can begin to be parsed out.</p><p>Here, we used high-throughput TSS mapping in tightly resolved time series to establish genome-wide promoter activity profiles throughout embryonic development in 5 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species spanning 25–50 million years (MY) of evolution. Combining TSS identification at single-nucleotide resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batut et al., 2013</xref>) with quantitative measurements of developmental expression patterns, we uncovered unique features of expression timing and core promoter structure to generate novel insights into transcriptional regulation.</p><p>We report that distinct types of core promoters are selectively active in three broad phases of embryonic development: specific combinations of core motifs mediate transcription during Early, Intermediate and Late embryogenesis. Each individual class of core promoters is functionally associated with distinct sets of transcription factors. We propose a two-tier model of transcriptional control in which core promoters and enhancers mediate, respectively, coarse-grained and fine-grained developmental regulation.</p><p>We also show that noncoding transcription is far more widespread than anticipated in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, with 3973 promoters driving the expression of lncRNAs during embryogenesis. The analysis of these core promoters, most of which are currently unannotated, shows that they largely share the structural and functional properties of their counterparts at protein-coding genes. Through the analysis of their fine structure and sequence conservation, we demonstrate that evolutionarily conserved lncRNAs promoters are under strong purifying selection at the levels of primary sequence and expression specificity. We functionally characterize the <italic>FBgn0264479</italic> locus, which expresses a lncRNA in a highly conserved spatiotemporal pattern suggestive of a role in early dorsoventral patterning.</p><p>In summary, these results uncover a major active role for core promoters in regulating transcription, by defining windows of opportunity for activation by enhancer sequences. They also reveal a vastly underappreciated aspect of developmental transcriptomes, by showing that noncoding transcription is extremely prevalent, tightly regulated and, crucially, deeply conserved.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Global multispecies profiling of developmental promoter activity</title><p>To explore the genome-wide dynamics of transcriptional regulation and their evolution, we generated developmental transcriptome profiles at both very high temporal resolution (1 hr) and high sequence coverage (137–180 million read pairs per species) for 5 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species spanning 25–50 million years of evolution: <italic>D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. erecta, D. ananassae</italic> and <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; total of 120 samples).

It offers unprecedented specificity and detection sensitivity for TSSs, and its multiplexing capabilities allow for the seamless acquisition of high-resolution developmental time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batut et al., 2013</xref>). Since eukaryotic promoters often allow productive transcription initiation from multiple positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batut et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carninci et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Valen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>), we use a dedicated peak-calling algorithm to group neighboring TSSs into TSS clusters (TSCs) corresponding to individual promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batut et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batut and Gingeras, 2013</xref>).</p><p>For each species, we identified 2.2 × 10<sup>4</sup> to 2.7 × 10<sup>4</sup> high-confidence TSCs.

Three major classes emerge, within which motif enrichments are relatively homogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, these three classes define distinct temporal phases of embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). The Early expression class, enriched for DRE and Ohler-1/5/6/7 motifs, consists of the promoters for maternally deposited transcripts, including the housekeeping cluster. The Intermediate class, enriched for Initiator (INR), MTE and DPE motifs, mediates transcription throughout a broad phase of mid-embryogenesis, from the onset of zygotic expression to the end of organogenesis. The Late class, enriched for TATA boxes, drives transcription around the transition to the first larval stage. Notably, expression clusters with vastly different specificities (e.g., D1 and D2) share the same promoter structure trends.</p><p>Importantly, clustering core motifs by their tendency to co-occur within the same promoters, regardless of expression timing, recapitulates the same three main motif groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). It does, however, also uncover a finer data structure, which suggests that there are a variety of promoter subtypes. In addition, we were able to train a classifier with substantial predictive power to distinguish the three promoter classes based solely on core motif scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together, our observations show that specific sets of core promoter elements are preferentially associated with transcriptional activity during distinct phases of development. This suggests a possible mechanistic role for core promoter elements in defining windows of opportunity for promoter activity during distinct periods of development.</p><p>Sequences proximal to the three core promoter classes are also enriched for different sets of TFBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The Early class preferentially harbors binding sites for Dref and Dfd, while the Intermediate class favors Trl (GAGA motif) and Adf-1. The Late class is enriched in pan, srp and pnr sites. The presence of most core promoter motifs and TFBSs is conserved between species far beyond random expectations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), which validates the overall quality of our motif predictions. Interestingly, TFBSs are often specific for only a subset of expression clusters within a class (e.g., Dfd or GAGA), and tend to co-occur in stereotypical combinations, suggestive of widespread combinatorial encoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The analysis of favored pairings between individual TFBSs and core promoter motifs suggests a possible synergy in the specification of expression patterns. Indeed, some TFBSs appear to be strongly associated with specific sets of core promoter motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Binding sites for the mesodermal factors srp and twi, for instance, which often tend to be found together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), have a robust association with DRE and Ohler-7 core motifs. These strong affinities suggest that core motifs may tune the ability of a promoter to respond to specific sets of transcription factors. They may do so by recruiting different sets of general transcription factors (GTFs) that functionally interact with distinct groups of activators. Such a mechanism may channel various regulatory inputs to limited subsets of promoters and thus limit crosstalk between parallel pathways.</p><p>We found that the three promoter classes display markedly different profiles of sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, this analysis only includes those promoters for which we have detected transcriptional activity in all five species, and we can therefore categorically rule out differences in rates of promoter gain/loss as an explanation. These observations suggest that the three promoter classes indeed have intrinsic structural differences that make them subject to distinct regimes of natural selection and sequence evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Selection on expression specificity shapes promoter sequence evolution</title><p>To further explore the selective pressures acting on regulatory sequences, we investigated quantitative relationships between the evolution of promoter structure (primary sequence) and function (expression specificity).

Therefore, we conclude that our strategy accurately and robustly detects promoter gain and loss events. Consistent with this, we can reconstruct the known species phylogeny by treating the presence or absence of individual TSCs as binary discrete characters in a standard parsimony framework (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Although a rigorous comparison between such disparate data types is delicate, this shows that promoters and TFBSs do not turn over on vastly different timescales.</p><p>Our data also reveals the existence of several thousand novel promoters that cannot be assigned to any annotated genes. Many of those may drive the expression of long noncoding transcripts, and it has long been a matter of debate to what extent this transcriptional activity plays meaningful biological roles. Hence we analyzed their rates of gain and loss to explore the selective pressures they may be subject to. We found a stark contrast in the degree of functional conservation of the two classes, with novel non-genic promoters evolving at a substantially higher rate than genic ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). There is, however, a very substantial proportion of non-genic promoters that is deeply conserved (i.e., active in all five species analyzed), suggesting the possibility of widespread functionality. The discrepancy between the classes may be due to a larger proportion of noncoding transcripts being devoid of biological roles and evolving neutrally. Alternatively, it may instead reflect a more pronounced tendency for noncoding transcription to take on lineage-specific roles and thereby be a driver of adaptation, as has been suggested before. To gain a better understanding of these questions, we sought to investigate in more depth the evolution of noncoding transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Deep conservation of long noncoding RNA promoters</title><p>The prevalence and biological relevance of noncoding transcription have long been major areas of contention.

In addition, to verify that the transcripts expressed from these TSCs are indeed independent and devoid of any significant protein-coding potential, we built transcript models from a recently published RNA-seq developmental time course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Graveley et al., 2011</xref>). We successfully generated transcript models for 16,105 TSCs, including 1475 lncRNA TSCs. Most of them appear to correspond to full-length transcripts, and the vast majority of putative lncRNAs do not overlap annotated protein-coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

We conclude that the vast majority of candidate transcripts are likely to be genuine lncRNAs.</p><p>The expression profiles of lncRNA promoters have unique properties that set them apart. As a class, they tend to be substantially more stage-specific than their protein-coding gene counterparts, as measured by the Shannon entropy of their activity profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Comparing their developmental expression timing to that of protein-coding gene promoters suggests a broad diversity of potential developmental functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>The detection of lncRNA TSCs is highly reproducible across <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

In order to investigate whether lncRNA promoters are under purifying selection, we focused on an extremely stringently selected set of 631 TSCs that are active in all five species. This set includes well-known essential noncoding transcription units, such as <italic>bithoraxoid</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lipshitz et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petruk et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>) and <italic>roX1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Franke and Baker, 1999</xref>). Overall, the level of sequence conservation at these functionally preserved lncRNA promoters is similar to that observed at protein-coding gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Their developmental expression specificity is also more constrained than that of many protein-coding gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Both observations taken together argue strongly for sustained selective pressure on these 631 lncRNA promoters for 25–50 million years. Furthermore, many TSCs of interest were excluded from this analysis simply because of the poor quality of genome assemblies, and this is therefore an extremely conservative set. Therefore, to place a more reasonable lower bound on the true number of conserved lncRNA promoters, we focused on those shared between the 3 species of the <italic>melanogaster</italic> subgroup. These 1529 promoters similarly display a high degree of sequence conservation within the subgroup, and their expression specificity also appears constrained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Still, it remains that lncRNA promoters as a class evolve much faster than those of protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), and it has been a matter of debate whether this reflects lineage-specific functions or merely neutral evolution.

Surprisingly, they display the same degree of sequence conservation as the protein-coding gene promoters that are shared throughout the subgroup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). The assessment of conservation at orthologous sequences in outgroup species confirms that the selective constraints are indeed lineage-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>).

Through nucleotide-resolution mapping of TSSs and quantitative measurements of expression kinetics, our study yields new insights into the transcriptional regulatory code. We find that distinct classes of core promoters drive transcription in three broad phases of embryonic development. Each class is defined by a characteristic set of core motifs, and is associated with regulation by specific groups of transcription factors. Of note, we successfully detected in vivo some functional associations between Dref and housekeeping promoters, and between Trl and some developmentally regulated promoters, that were recently described in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zabidi et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Our analysis generalizes the concept of specific interactions between core promoters and enhancer sequences, and demonstrates for the first time its global relevance in a developmental context.</p><p>We propose a hierarchical model for transcriptional regulation in which core promoter syntax defines broad temporal windows of opportunity for activation, and precise expression timing is subsequently refined by the binding of sequence-specific activators and repressors at enhancers. Core promoters may restrict regulatory inputs by recruiting different sets of general transcription factors (GTFs) that functionally interact with distinct groups of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goodrich and Tjian, 2010</xref>). Some GTFs have been shown to shape the expression specificity of individual promoters, and it is known that different activators and repressors have distinct requirements for cofactors and GTFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zabidi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goodrich and Tjian, 2010</xref>). Such a mechanism may channel regulatory inputs to limited subsets of promoters, and thus limit crosstalk between promoters and enhancers across the genome. Notably, what applies to time may also apply to space, and it is possible that similar core promoter/enhancer interplay hierarchically specifies gene expression in broad developmental lineages and individual cell types.</p><p>Evolutionary analysis of developmental expression specificity further supports this model. First, the three major classes of core promoters defined here show drastically different patterns of sequence evolution, suggesting substantial differences in their underlying structure and functional interactions with the transcriptional machinery. At a finer scale, the conservation of expression specificity across species correlates with the degree of sequence conservation at canonical core promoter elements, such as TATA boxes and Initiator motifs. This is highly suggestive of an instructive role for these sequence elements, once thought generic, in defining developmental gene expression patterns.</p><p>Approximately 4000 promoters were found to drive the expression of lncRNAs during embryogenesis, a strikingly high number for this very brief developmental period. Our findings likely apply to other developmental stages as well, as we previously reported the existence of 7421 putative lncRNA promoters in an analysis of the whole <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batut et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, we detected the expression of only 205 of 1119 recently identified lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Young et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that we are only beginning to scratch the surface of lncRNA biology in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Importantly, we show here that vast numbers of these promoters are under strong selective pressure, at the levels of both promoter sequence and expression specificity. A <italic>melanogaster</italic> subgroup core set of at least 1529 is under substantial selective constraint, and most of those are therefore highly likely to have biologically relevant activities.</p><p>In agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Derrien et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haerty and Ponting, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kutter et al., 2012</xref>), we find that lncRNA genes evolve faster than their protein-coding counterparts. It has been an unresolved debate so far whether this reflects neutral evolution or lineage-specific functions. Our observation that lineage-specific lncRNAs are also under substantial selective pressure reveals that noncoding transcription may be a major driver of phenotypic diversification and organismal adaptation. We recently showed that transposable elements play an important role in the evolutionary gain of promoters, and in particular of lncRNA promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batut et al., 2013</xref>). We propose that transposon proliferation is a major mechanism favoring the neofunctionalization of intergenic regions as sources of biologically active noncoding transcripts.</p><p>To open a window into the biology of developmentally regulated lncRNAs, we focused on <italic>FBgn0264479</italic>, a deeply conserved yet never-before characterized gene. We experimentally validate the existence and expression kinetics of the FBgn0264479 transcript, and demonstrate that both its promoter sequence and its developmental expression specificity are deeply conserved across drosophilids. Interestingly, this lncRNA is expressed in a spatial profile highly similar to that of the <italic>schnurri</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arora et al., 1995</xref>), which is part of the Dpp (TGF-β/Smad) signaling pathway and plays an essential role in the establishment of dorsoventral embryo polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arora et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dai et al., 2000</xref>). The punctate cytoplasmic localization pattern of the FBgn0264479 lncRNA is reminiscent of the targeting of multiple Dpp pathway components to endosomes in larval wing discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bökel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coumailleau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">González-Gaitán, 2003</xref>). Endosomes localize apically in the late embryonic blastoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fabrowski et al., 2013</xref>), and mutants for <italic>Sara</italic>, the Smad endosome-targeting factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bökel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">González-Gaitán, 2003</xref>), die early in embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bökel et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that endosome-based signaling is also essential at that stage. This raises the intriguing possibility of a role for the FBgn0264479 lncRNA in TGF-β signaling, a crucial pathway in all animals that plays a major role in human disease, including cancer.</p><p>In recent years, it has become clear that noncoding transcription serves a myriad of molecular functions in Eukaryotes, and plays a part in virtually every known biological process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ulitsky and Bartel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guttman and Rinn, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ponting et al., 2009</xref>).

Each library was sequenced on one lane of an Illumina HiSeq 2000.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Genome references and annotations</title><p>All reference sequences and annotations were obtained from Flybase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org">http://flybase.org</ext-link>). <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> release 5.49, <italic>D. simulans</italic> r1.4, <italic>D. erecta</italic> r1.3, <italic>D. ananassae</italic> r1.3, <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> r2.9.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Primary data processing</title><p>Reads were mapped to the appropriate reference genomes using the STAR aligner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>).

We used parameters optimized to yield good TSS specificity with respect to annotations and comparable numbers of peaks for all species. All peaks overlapping FlyBase-annotated rDNA repeats were filtered out.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>TSC conservation</title><p>Functional conservation was assessed for all peaks with ≥15 RAMPAGE tags that did not map to heterochromatic regions or chr4 in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, or orthologous regions in other species. We translated the genomic coordinates of each peak in each species to coordinates in the multiple sequence alignment of all genomes (15-way MultiZ alignment from UCSC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm3/multiz15way">http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm3/multiz15way</ext-link>). To be considered for analysis, each peak was required to have a unique syntenic alignment in all other species considered, defined as follows: both ends of an 800 bp window centered on the middle of the peak had to map to the same strand of the same chromosome or scaffold, 50% of bases had to be aligned (i.e., not in assembly gaps), and 25% of bases had to align to orthologous bases (not alignment gaps). Raw 5’ signal for each genome was also translated into multiple alignment coordinates. For each peak from each species, functional conservation was assessed by counting the number of RAMPAGE tags in each species. A peak was considered absent in a target species if it had at least a 100-fold lower signal than in the reference species. Peaks with &lt;100 tags in the reference species were considered absent if they had no detectable signal in a target species.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Phylogeny reconstruction</title><p>The peaks from all species were merged and collapsed in multiple alignment space to generate a non-redundant set of all peaks in the clade. The conservation of these peaks was assessed as described above.

Depending on the subclade of interest, some species were excluded from the alignment for certain analyses. Pre-computed phastCons scores for the full 15-way alignment were downloaded from UCSC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm3/phastCons15way">http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm3/phastCons15way</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Core promoter motifs</title><p>For analyses of motif composition, we only considered <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> TSCs that were functionally conserved across all five species.

Peaks for which the maximum position could not be aligned to all genomes were excluded from the analysis. A custom script was used to search for matches to previously characterized core promoter motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">FitzGerald et al., 2006</xref>) within a 301 bp window centered on the main TSS. Consensus sequences for sets of peaks with matches to individual motifs were computed using MEME v4.9.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://meme.nbcr.net/meme">http://meme.nbcr.net/meme</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Time series alignment</title><p>Z-score transformed gene expression time series from all species were registered to one another using the GTEM suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goltsev and Papatsenko, 2009</xref>) according to the recommendations of the software documentation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flydev.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/GTEM/index.html">http://flydev.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/GTEM/index.html</ext-link>). One-to-one orthology calls from Flybase (2012 release 2) were used to match gene expression profiles between species. We pre-processed pairs of datasets (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and another species) to compensate for differences in annotation quality and peak calling between species. We identified orthologs of TSCs that had detectable expression (≥10 tags) but initially failed to be called in one species. In addition, when a functionally conserved TSC had been attributed to an annotated gene in one species but not the other, we corrected this discrepancy by attributing it to the gene in both species. For the <italic>D. ananassae</italic> dataset, the 8<sup>th</sup> time point failed to yield acceptable data, and was excluded from the analysis. All time series were upsampled 5-fold and smoothed with a 2 hr window size using RZ-Smooth v4.1. Optimal global alignment paths between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and the other datasets were computed with T-Warp v3.2 with Pearson distance matrices (3 hr window). M-Align v2.8 was used to align each series to the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> reference and smooth the final aligned series (1 hr window). The expression profiles of individual TSCs were registered to one another with M-Align, using the optimal alignment path computed for gene expression profiles.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. One of the three reviewers, James Bentley Brown, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Batut and Gingeras have collected and analyzed transcription start site data across the developmental time course for five <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. This large resource of transcription start site usage obtained at base resolution with a technology developed a few years ago by the authors (RAMPAGE). The results correspond to a temporal resolution of 1 hour of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development 5 species: <italic>D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. erecta, D. ananassae</italic> and <italic>D.</italic> </p><p><italic>pseudoobscura</italic> (120 samples). The analyses are based is a many as 2.7104 Transcription Start Clusters.</p><p>An analysis of the TSCs demonstrated that specific sets of core promoter sequence elements are associated with sets of TSCs that are activated at distinct times during development. This finding suggests that core promoter elements contribute to the temporal regulation of gene expression during differentiation.</p><p>The authors also reveal the presence of many TSCs that seem likely to be associated with lncRNAs and might be activated at a specific point in development.</p><p>Overall, the paper brings interesting resource to the transcription and <italic>Drosophila</italic> developmental communities that will contribute to the discussion of the role of core promoters in transcription regulation.</p><p><italic>Comments and required revision</italic> </p><p>There are a number of aspects that require clarification. The most critical ones are points 1, 14, 17, 21, 24, 26, and 27. In general, the tone of some of the claims has to be moderated and adjusted to the actual observations.</p><p>1) The alignment of developmental profiles is crucial to the science that follows. Tried and true methods have been used to conduct the alignment, and it would also be good to generate a figure somehow visualizing the time-warping distance between the species across the developmental profile. I believe there was something similar to this between worm and fly in Gerstein et al. Nature. 2014 from modENCODE. You could also try improving on the modE graphic by making the connections between species' time-series heatmaps. You could arrange them in accordance with the phylogeny and then just show the pairwise mappings between neighboring species.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, meant to be a graphical abstract, is confusing – it seems to relate a developmental profile directly to a specific genomic locus with arrows that point at the transcribed genome… very odd. I recommend refactoring to make it clear what was done. Or even just scrap it – the project description is very clearly written, not sure a graphical abstract is needed.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> looks strange. Does it make sense to use the figure to show a single pick. In any case the figure requires a better introduction (Same for 1A)</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> is very beautiful, but may be over-smoothed – looks worse than the data actually is. It will be better re-doing the smoothing with a narrower bandwidth.</p><p>5) A better explanation of how clade and subclades are defined will help to understand the significance of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>6) Expression profiles are overall tightly conserved across species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>), but with substantial gene-to-gene variability:&quot; It is not obvious from the figure.</p><p>7) The quantification of expression specificity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, is peculiar. Will be helpful to show the error bars, number of cases involved and significance of the differences plotted in the figure.</p><p>8) The paragraph &quot;The high similarity of biological replicates, the accuracy of inter-species alignments for well known developmental genes, and the biological features of evolutionary divergence patterns, together confirm our ability to accurately quantify promoter expression and its variation across species. Our observations also highlight the central importance of systems level selective constraints, such as those acting on gene function and developmental stages, in shaping the evolution of gene expression.&quot; Contains affirmation that I find difficult to follow in the data shown: accuracy of alignments for developmental genes? Importance of systems-level selective constraints? Evolution of gene expression?</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> The 3462 promoters where divided in housekeeping and developmentally regulated, but the number of developmentally regulated genes is again 3462 (817+2047+598), implying that the H genes are all early, but how many are they?</p><p>10) Are the same clusters shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and 3C</xref>? (&quot;their tendency to co-occur 186 within the same promoters, regardless of expression timing, recapitulates the same three main motif groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).&quot;)</p><p>11) &quot;Taken together, our observations suggest that core promoter elements play a significant role in restricting windows of opportunity for expression during distinct periods of development.&quot; Would not be more accurate to say that the analysis of the distribution of core promoters shows some differences in distribution than the general promoter expression? Or, otherwise, justify where the &quot;restricting windows of opportunity for expression&quot; has been deduced from?</p><p>12) Similar problems with the following affirmation &quot;TFBSs are often specific for only a subset of expression clusters within a class (e.g., Dfd or GAGA). This suggests a model in which core promoter structure defines broad developmental periods of expression potential, and precise expression timing is then refined by sequence-specific transcription factors.&quot; This seems to be an anecdotal observation transformed in an important conclusion. Can the solid evidence supporting the very important claim on the general role of core promoters be pointed out clearly?</p><p>13) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>., represents the conservation of core promoter motif between two species that substantiates a claim about conservation and validation of the motif prediction (&quot;conserved between species far beyond random expectations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), which validates the overall quality of our motif predictions&quot;) Why only two species, what happen with the clades and subclades? By the way, the font size is too small to be read in a print. Same for other figures too.</p><p>14) &quot;Indeed, some TFBSs appear to be strongly associated with specific sets of core promoter motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Dref sites, for instance, are preferentially found along DRE and Ohler-1/6/7 core motifs.&quot; I cannot see this in the mentioned <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>. DRE is associated to oh1-oh5 mte and tata. I do not know if there is mistake in the text or my interpretation of the figure is wrong, but text and figure should be reconciled. In any case, the evidence presented in the figure seems to be very light to support the claim (&quot;individual TFBSs and core promoter motifs suggests a possible mechanism to mediate this 2-step specification of expression patterns.&quot;)</p><p>15) In subsection “Global multispecies profiling of developmental promoter activity”: The GO term analysis seems to suggest that differential rates of cell proliferation across the 5 species may drive the signal, which would be consistent with previous modENCODE results. Any chance that you already have data from which you could quantify rates of cell duplication, or even just look at approximate cell counts and then do a simple regression to confirm? No pressure, but would put this one to rest once and for all.</p><p>16) The clustering analysis is somewhat reminiscent of promoter structure analysis in zebrafish. Might be good to cite: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4820030/</p><p>17) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> is key. The analysis by profile conservation quantile seems a little be of a strange choice, where the rest of the paper is based on continuous measurements. It will be good to read the justification of the authors on this point.</p><p>18) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-D</xref>. The positive selection panel (4D) is really not very demonstrative, is it? In any case, it needs a better explanation.</p><p>19) The results are show tendencies for three promoter elements: Initiator, DPE and TATA elements. Is justify to generalize to others (&quot;This is consistent with the idea that core promoter motifs are indeed key determinants of this specificity&quot;)?</p><p>20) In subsection “Promoter birth and death are widespread and dynamic”; the statement that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows that the FDR on promoter gain/loss events is less than 0.1% is not clear, from which data does this follow? Please clarify.</p><p>21) The second part of the papers deals with the analysis of non-genic promoters. &quot;We found a stark contrast in the degree of functional conservation of the two classes, with novel non genic promoters evolving at a substantially higher rate than genic ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). There is, however, a very substantial proportion that is deeply conserved, suggesting the possibility of widespread functionality&quot; Given the importance of this observation some quantification will be interesting. Is the 20% of non-genic promoters conserved between D. pse and D. mel, what the authors understand by &quot;deeply conserved&quot;. How many of the 3682 non-genic promoters are &quot;deeply&quot; conserved? Is there an analysis of those promoters in comparison with the genic ones? How similar or different are they from the additional 291 promoters of lncRNAs added to the analysis?</p><p>22) It follows with the key question of this second part of the paper, namely: &quot;The discrepancy between the classes may be due to a larger proportion of noncoding transcripts being devoid of biological roles and evolving neutrally. Alternatively, it may instead reflect a more pronounced tendency for noncoding transcription to take on lineage-specific roles and thereby be a driver of adaptation, as has been suggested before.&quot;</p><p>23) The analysis of the expression reveals complex heterogeneous patters that are positively interpreted as representing possible roles of the lncRNAs, obviously following the paragraph above the opposite interpretation is equally plausible. The analysis of conservation across species has to be the central argument in this paper and this is what is proposed: &quot;Of all <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> lncRNA TSCs, 2,016 can be aligned to the D. pseudoobscura genome assembly and 1,111 are functionally conserved&quot; (what is functionally conserved in this context?). Does this information solve the question? Is 1111 out of 2016 significant? Is the analysis of the 631 or 1529 promoters conserved across species the best solution? Would not be better a pair-wise comparison between the five species? (All what does not detract from the interesting findings regarding the conservation of the properties of the set of 631 conserved promoters of lncRNAs).</p><p>24) What is less convincing is the final argument based on the analysis of the lncRNA TSCs that are specific to the <italic>melanogaster</italic> subgroup based the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, that shows some similarity between with the conservation profiles of protein coding gene promoters. It seems to be a little be exaggerated, based on the data presented, to conclude &quot;Taken together, our observations show that a vast proportion of lncRNAs are indeed under purifying selection for biological functions relevant to embryonic development.&quot;</p><p>25) The arguments on the role of the lncRNA TSCs, based on conservation of a subset of them, are not sufficiently strong to close the debate on the actual role of the lncRNA, even if they may serve to point to the function of some specific cases in development control. Along this line, the argument in the final paragraph of the Discussion section, that the work unambiguously demonstrates the relevance of lncRNAs to development is also a bit strong. The work is highly suggestive, but careful knockouts or other perturbation experiments would be needed to &quot;unambiguously demonstrate&quot; – and even then proving that it isn't actually some short ORF would be tough. I recommend softening this language a bit to avoid raising the hackles of the lncRNA and/or the smORF communities.</p><p>26) In the third paragraph of subsection “schnurri-like RNA: A deeply conserved, developmentally regulated lncRNA gene”; the claim that the expression pattern is similar to shn seems odd. The gene shn is expressed throughout much of development (certainly through stage 16), it is not restricted to a 3 hour period as with this lncRNA. Here are the in situs of shn: http://insitu.fruitfly.org/cgi-bin/ex/report.pl?ftype=1&amp;ftext=FBgn0003396. Do the authors mean just at this developmental period? If so, a comparison to many other expression profiles, e.g. from the BDGP, would be needed to support the association between this lncRNA and shn – is shn really the &quot;most&quot; similar at this period?</p><p>27) Further, the statements in the final paragraph of subsection “schnurri-like RNA: A deeply conserved, developmentally regulated lncRNA gene” that the authors have &quot;confirmed it's noncoding nature&quot; is too bold. The data is consistent with a non-coding transcript, but it is far from &quot;confirmed&quot;. Absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence. And on the contrary, doesn't it look quite cytoplasmic in the FISH? It encodes several ORFs &gt; 20aa – I recommend softening this statement a bit. It looks non-coding, it's probably non-coding, but it could also encode a short ORF – to go the extra mile on this would require targeted quantitative proteomics. Not necessary for publication of course, but without it, the statement should be softened.</p><p>28) The TGF-β link is also quite a leap – it would be good to strengthen this portion of the paper with a bioinformatics analysis of the in situ imaging data against the BDGP database.</p><p>29) The observation that specific core promoter elements are associated with TSCs that are activated at specific points during development was made using the subset of TSCs that are functionally active in all species. If the analysis is performed on all TSCs observed in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, are the same trends observed? Or is this observation specific to conserved TSCs?</p><p>30) Are the same core promoter element/TFBS trends seen for the non-coding TSCs? In other words, do you see a relationship between the promoter sequence elements for non-coding TSCs and their timing of activation?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29005.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The alignment of developmental profiles is crucial to the science that follows.

This paragraph has been revised as follows: “The high similarity of biological replicates, the accuracy of inter-species alignments for well-known developmental genes, and the biological features of evolutionary divergence patterns, together confirm our ability to accurately quantify promoter expression and its variation across species. Our observations also highlight the role of systems-level selective constraints, such as those acting on particular functional gene classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), in shaping the evolution of gene expression.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> The 3462 promoters where divided in housekeeping and developmentally regulated, but the number of developmentally regulated genes is again 3462 (817+2047+598), implying that the H genes are all early, but how many are they?</p></disp-quote><p>As defined by our filtering criteria, we are considering n=3,222 developmentally regulated promoters, and n=240 defined as housekeeping (further details in Materials and methods section).

Analyzing sequence motif enrichments in the promoters previously clustered by expression profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) reveals particular motifs associated with the 3 expression classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). An independent analysis of motif co-occurrence within individual promoters, uninformed by developmental expression data, yields the same groups of motifs (INR/MTE/DPE, DRE/Ohler-1/5/6/7, and TATA). This confirms the conclusion drawn from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> that there are indeed 3 major classes of promoters that are distinguished by their motif composition. This is further corroborated by the predictive power of motif composition in classifying promoters into the 3 main expression classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) &quot;Taken together, our observations suggest that core promoter elements play a significant role in restricting windows of opportunity for expression during distinct periods of development.&quot; Would not be more accurate to say that the analysis of the distribution of core promoters shows some differences in distribution than the general promoter expression? Or, otherwise, justify where the &quot;restricting windows of opportunity for expression&quot; has been deduced from?</p></disp-quote><p>This passage has been modified as follows:</p><p>“Taken together, our observations show that specific sets of core promoter elements are preferentially associated with transcriptional activity during distinct phases of development. This suggests a possible mechanistic role for core promoter elements in defining windows of opportunity for promoter activity during distinct periods of development.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Similar problems with the following affirmation &quot;TFBSs are often specific for only a subset of expression clusters within a class (e.g., Dfd or GAGA).This suggests a model in which core promoter structure defines broad developmental periods of expression potential, and precise expression timing is then refined by sequence-specific transcription factors.&quot; This seems to be an anecdotal observation transformed in an important conclusion. Can the solid evidence supporting the very important claim on the general role of core promoters be pointed out clearly?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and thus for clarity and balance, speculation on mechanistic interpretations of our findings has been moved to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>., represents the conservation of core promoter motif between two species that substantiates a claim about conservation and validation of the motif prediction (&quot;conserved between species far beyond random expectations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), which validates the overall quality of our motif predictions&quot;) Why only two species, what happen with the clades and subclades? By the way, the font size is too small to be read in a print. Same for other figures too.</p></disp-quote><p>This analysis is intended merely as a technical validation of our motif predictions, rather than as a basis for any interesting statement about patterns of promoter evolution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> shows that hits for the motifs of interest are more conserved that hits for shuffled versions of themselves, which suggests that our predictions are enriched for biologically relevant sequences. The use of the 2 most distant species was just a rather obvious choice for this analysis, because it maximizes the sequence divergence for the regions analyzed.</p><p>As suggested, we have also modified the font size in figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) &quot;Indeed, some TFBSs appear to be strongly associated with specific sets of core promoter motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

DRE is associated to oh1-oh5 mte and tata. I do not know if there is mistake in the text or my interpretation of the figure is wrong, but text and figure should be reconciled. In any case, the evidence presented in the figure seems to be very light to support the claim (&quot;individual TFBSs and core promoter motifs suggests a possible mechanism to mediate this 2-step specification of expression patterns.&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this. This was indeed a mistake in the text. This passage has been edited and condensed as follows:</p><p>“Indeed, some TFBSs appear to be strongly associated with specific sets of core promoter motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Binding sites for the mesodermal factors srp and twi, for instance, which often tend to be found together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>), have a robust association with DRE and Ohler-7 core motifs.”</p><p>Here as well, we have moved this conjecture to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) In subsection “Global multispecies profiling of developmental promoter activity”: The GO term analysis seems to suggest that differential rates of cell proliferation across the 5 species may drive the signal, which would be consistent with previous modENCODE results. Any chance that you already have data from which you could quantify rates of cell duplication, or even just look at approximate cell counts and then do a simple regression to confirm? No pressure, but would put this one to rest once and for all.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we are not aware of any existing datasets that would allow us to conduct this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) The clustering analysis is somewhat reminiscent of promoter structure analysis in zebrafish.

The analysis by profile conservation quantile seems a little be of a strange choice, where the rest of the paper is based on continuous measurements. It will be good to read the justification of the authors on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>This was indeed not clear from the text, but the correlations between sequence and expression profile conservation were actually computed in a promoter-wise fashion, using continuous measurements. The grouping by quantiles was used only for display purposes, as it does a better job than scatterplots at showing these subtle correlations. All correlation tests were conducted on the full population of promoters, regardless of quantile groupings, and the p-values in this figure reflect these analyses.</p><p>For clarity, the figure legend has been edited as follows:</p><p>“(b) Correlation between expression profile and promoter sequence conservation. For each of the subregions depicted as shaded areas in A (except Downstream), there is a significant correlation between expression profile conservation and phastCons score across all promoters analyzed (*** pvalue &lt; 10<sup>-8</sup> for Pearson correlation testbetween profile conservation and sequence conservation; ** p &lt; 10<sup>-4</sup>; * p &lt; 10<sup>-2</sup>; <italic>n.s.</italic> not significant; Upstream region runs from -300 to -50bp). For graphical display, promoters were grouped into expression conservation quantiles, and the boxplots show the distribution of phastCons scores for each quantile.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-D</xref>. The positive selection panel (4d) is really not very demonstrative, is it? In any case, it needs a better explanation.</p></disp-quote><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C and 4D</xref> offer complementary analyses of the distinct roles of negative (purifying) and positive (diversifying) selection in shaping promoter evolution.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> shows a positive correlation between the conservation of expression profiles and the number of sites under purifying selection. This suggests that purifying selection plays a significant role in constraining promoter expression divergence.</p><p>As might have been expected, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> shows a much more modest, yet significant, negative association with positive selection as well. This is particularly clear for the Upstream subregion, which is the largest one and thereby offers the most statistical power for this analysis. This observation at least raises the possibility that there may be a subpopulation of fast-evolving promoters whose expression divergence is driven by diversifying selection, which seems worth noting.</p><p>The figure legend has been edited as follows:</p><p>“(d) Proportion of bases under positive selection – <italic>i.e.</italic>, evolving faster than neutral sequences (phyloP score &lt;-0.1) – at promoter subregions for each profile conservation quantile.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) The results are show tendencies for three promoter elements: Initiator, DPE and TATA elements. Is justify to generalize to others (&quot;This is consistent with the idea that core promoter motifs are indeed key determinants of this specificity&quot;)?</p></disp-quote><p>Here we are not attempting to formally generalize this conclusion to all core promoter motifs: we’re merely raising the possibility that core promoter motifs – at least some of them – may shape promoter expression specificity.</p><p>This sentence has been edited as follows:</p><p>“This is consistent with the idea that some core promoter motifs could play a role as key determinants of developmental expression specificity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) In subsection “Promoter birth and death are widespread and dynamic”; the statement that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows that the FDR on promoter gain/loss events is less than 0.1% is not clear, from which data does this follow? Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>The procedure to assess TSC functional conservation is described in detail in the Materials and methods section, in the “TSC conservation” subsection.</p><p>However, for clarity, the figure legend has been edited as follows:</p><p>“(a) Proportion of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> TSCs reproducibly detected in biological duplicates (first pair of bars) and functionally conserved in all species of subclades of increasing sizes. A TSC called in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Replicate 1 is deemed lost in another species (or replicate) if the orthologous region shows ≥100-fold reduced signal across the time course (see Materials and methods). Subclades include all descendants of a common ancestor, and are designated by the species that is most distantly related to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) The second part of the papers deals with the analysis of non-genic promoters. &quot;We found a stark contrast in the degree of functional conservation of the two classes, with novel non genic promoters evolving at a substantially higher rate than genic ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). There is, however, a very substantial proportion that is deeply conserved, suggesting the possibility of widespread functionality&quot; Given the importance of this observation some quantification will be interesting. Is the 20% of non-genic promoters conserved between D. pse and D. mel, what the authors understand by &quot;deeply conserved&quot;. How many of the 3682 non-genic promoters are &quot;deeply&quot; conserved? Is there an analysis of those promoters in comparison with the genic ones? How similar or different are they from the additional 291 promoters of lncRNAs added to the analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>By “deeply conserved”, we mean promoters that are functionally conserved (see Materials and methods, “TSC conservation”) in all 5 species analyzed. The sentence above has been edited to clarify this: “There is, however, a very substantial proportion of non-genic promoters that is deeply conserved</p><p>(<italic>i.e</italic>., active in all 5 species analyzed), suggesting the possibility of widespread functionality. “Roughly a third of all <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> non-genic TSCs are “deeply conserved” by this definition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> presents multiple comparative analyses of genic <italic>vs</italic>. non-genic promoters and the transcripts that are produced from them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22) It follows with the key question of this second part of the paper, namely: &quot;The discrepancy between the classes may be due to a larger proportion of noncoding transcripts being devoid of biological roles and evolving neutrally. Alternatively, it may instead reflect a more pronounced tendency for noncoding transcription to take on lineage-specific roles and thereby be a driver of adaptation, as has been suggested before.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This passage simply puts forward the 2 alternative interpretations for this observation, which are further investigated in what follows in the next section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23) The analysis of the expression reveals complex heterogeneous patters that are positively interpreted as representing possible roles of the lncRNAs, obviously following the paragraph above the opposite interpretation is equally plausible.</p><p>The analysis of conservation across species has to be the central argument in this paper and this is what is proposed: &quot;Of all D. melanogaster lncRNA TSCs, 2,016 can be aligned to the D. pseudoobscura genome assembly and 1,111 are functionally conserved&quot; (what is functionally conserved in this context?). Does this information solve the question? Is 1111 out of 2016 significant? Is the analysis of the 631 or 1529 promoters conserved across species the best solution? Would not be better a pair-wise comparison between the five species? (All what does not detract from the interesting findings regarding the conservation of the properties of the set of 631 conserved promoters of lncRNAs.)</p></disp-quote><p>The highly stage-specific expression patterns of lncRNA promoters are simply described here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and 6D</xref>), they are not interpreted in any way so as to imply biological functionality. Conclusions about functionality are exclusively drawn from analyses of evolutionary conservation at the levels of sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) and expression specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p><p>The procedure to assess TSC functional conservation is described in detail in the Materials and methods section, “TSC conservation” subsection.</p><p>The proportion of lncRNAs that is functionally conserved does not, in and of itself, resolve any question – it is just a descriptive statistic.</p><p>Asking whether 1,111 conserved TSCs out of 2,016 is significant would in some way test the hypothesis that <italic>all</italic> lncRNA TSCs in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are functional, which is not the one we are interested in here.</p><p>Instead, we are asking whether those lncRNA promoters that are functionally conserved across all species are functional. We are formally testing this hypothesis with analyses of evolutionary conservation at the levels of promoter sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) and expression specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Both show clear hallmarks of negative selection, implying functionality.</p><p>The decision to focus on TSCs conserved in all 5 species is largely technical: it gives us maximal power to accurately estimate expression profile divergence (by comparing expression profiles for more species) and sequence divergence (by computing sequence conservation scores from more genomes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>24) What is less convincing is the final argument based on the analysis of the lncRNA TSCs that are specific to the melanogaster subgroup based the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, that shows some similarity between with the conservation profiles of protein coding gene promoters. It seems to be a little be exaggerated, based on the data presented, to conclude &quot;Taken together, our observations show that a vast proportion of lncRNAs are indeed under purifying selection for biological functions relevant to embryonic development.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The observations described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and 6G</xref> show that, as a class, the lncRNA TSCs that are conserved in all 5 species are under negative selection (just as much as the TSCs of conserved protein-coding genes).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> (and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>) shows that, as a class, lineage-specific lncRNA TSCs are under lineage specific negative selection (just as much as the TSCs of conserved protein-coding genes). Based on this, we feel it is legitimate to postulate that a large proportion of lncRNA TSCs must be functional.</p><p>However, as we indeed cannot provide an exact estimate of the proportion of these that are indeed under selection – all our analyses are inherently class-based – this sentence has been edited as follows:</p><p>“Taken together, our observations raise the possibility that a substantial proportion of lncRNAs may indeed be under purifying selection for biological functions relevant to embryonic development.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>25) The arguments on the role of the lncRNA TSCs, based on conservation of a subset of them, are not sufficiently strong to close the debate on the actual role of the lncRNA, even if they may serve to point to the function of some specific cases in development control. Along this line, the argument in the final paragraph of the Discussion section, that the work unambiguously demonstrates the relevance of lncRNAs to development is also a bit strong. The work is highly suggestive, but careful knockouts or other perturbation experiments would be needed to &quot;unambiguously demonstrate&quot; – and even then proving that it isn't actually some short ORF would be tough. I recommend softening this language a bit to avoid raising the hackles of the lncRNA and/or the smORF communities.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewers’ concerns, this sentence has been edited as follows:</p><p>“Our work provides evolutionary evidence for a broad biological relevance of noncoding transcription to developmental processes, and establishes <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> as a powerful model for exploring the diverse functions of lncRNAs with targeted genetic and molecular studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>26) In the third paragraph of subsection “schnurri-like RNA: A deeply conserved, developmentally regulated lncRNA gene”; the claim that the expression pattern is similar to shn seems odd. The gene shn is expressed throughout much of development (certainly through stage 16), it is not restricted to a 3 hour period as with this lncRNA. Here are the in situs of shn: http://insitu.fruitfly.org/cgi-bin/ex/report.pl?ftype=1&amp;ftext=FBgn0003396. Do the authors mean just at this developmental period? If so, a comparison to many other expression profiles, e.g. from the BDGP, would be needed to support the association between this lncRNA and shn – is shn really the &quot;most&quot; similar at this period?</p></disp-quote><p>The analogy with <italic>shn</italic> was indeed based on the similarity of expression profiles at the late blastoderm stage only: http://insitu.fruitfly.org/insitu_image_storage/img_dir_117/insitu117893.jpe.</p><p>We make no claims that this is the most similar expression pattern observed – it just happens to be similar to that of a well-known gene – and the main text has been modified to move all speculative references to shnurri to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>27) Further, the statements in the final paragraph of subsection “schnurri-like RNA: A deeply conserved, developmentally regulated lncRNA gene” that the authors have &quot;confirmed it's noncoding nature&quot; is too bold. The data is consistent with a non-coding transcript, but it is far from &quot;confirmed&quot;. Absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence. And on the contrary, doesn't it look quite cytoplasmic in the FISH? It encodes several ORFs &gt; 20aa – I recommend softening this statement a bit. It looks non-coding, it's probably non-coding, but it could also encode a short ORF – to go the extra mile on this would require targeted quantitative proteomics. Not necessary for publication of course, but without it, the statement should be softened.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a thorny issue, and we agree with the reviewers’ concerns. We cannot exclude that this locus does encode a short peptide, or even that this peptide may itself serve a biological function in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. However, based on our analyses – and particularly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref> – we are making the case that a smORF-associated function cannot account for the conservation of the promoter, as the smORFs themselves are clearly not conserved. This implies the existence of a smORF-independent function that is itself the target of purifying selection. The cytoplasmic localization of the lncRNA in no way detracts from the possibility of a non-coding (possibly cytoplasmic) function.</p><p>However, we agree that the language should be modified to more accurately reflect that this constitutes inference, not formal proof. The sentence has been edited as follows:</p><p>“Although further characterization will be required to decipher the precise biological role of this transcript, our observations definitively establish its developmental expression specificity, clearly point to a non-protein-coding function, and provide strong evidence that it has been under strong purifying selection over at least 25-50 million years.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>28) The TGF-β link is also quite a leap – it would be good to strengthen this portion of the paper with a bioinformatics analysis of the in situ imaging data against the BDGP database.</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware that the paper would be measurably strengthened with the analyses suggested. However, these analyses would require expertise we do not currently possess. Thus, collaborations would be needed. A fuller functional study of this lncRNA is planned but is outside the scope of this paper due to the departure from my laboratory of the graduate student whose thesis work is the subject of this manuscript. Therefore, we are restricting suggestions of a TGF-β pathway link strictly to the Discussion section, merely as speculation about the possible function of the transcript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>29) The observation that specific core promoter elements are associated with TSCs that are activated at specific points during development was made using the subset of TSCs that are functionally active in all species. If the analysis is performed on all TSCs observed in Drosophila melanogaster, are the same trends observed? Or is this observation specific to conserved TSCs?</p></disp-quote><p>The question raised by the reviewers is reasonable but the analysis required is not straightforward, particularly regarding the initial classification of promoters – this would require substantial new coding and testing of the results to determine the confidence level of the outcomes, and whether they are comparable to the ones presented here. Furthermore, this classification is chiefly interesting as the basis for the evolutionary analyses that follow, which show that this code is conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F-G</xref>).</p><p>We propose to raise this topic in the Discussion as an interesting point to be pursued in subsequent studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>30) Are the same core promoter element/TFBS trends seen for the non-coding TSCs? In other words, do you see a relationship between the promoter sequence elements for non-coding TSCs and their timing of activation?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, our attempts to conduct this type of analysis were stymied by the fact that there are too few highly-expressed lncRNA TSCs (for which expression divergence can be accurately measured) for us to have any power for the promoter motif analysis. This issue will be resolved in the future with deeper transcriptome data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
