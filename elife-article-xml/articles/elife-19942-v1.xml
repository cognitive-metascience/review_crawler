Here we stimulated fly neurons with different paradigms and identified ARGs using high-throughput sequencing from brains as well as from sorted neurons: they included a narrow set of circadian neurons as well as dopaminergic neurons. Surprisingly, many ARGs are specific to the stimulation paradigm and very specific to neuron type. In addition and unlike mammalian immediate early genes (IEGs), fly ARGs do not have short gene lengths and are less enriched for transcription factor function. Chromatin assays using ATAC-sequencing show that the transcription start sites (TSS) of ARGs do not change with neural firing but are already accessible prior to stimulation.

This activity-dependent gene regulation is important as it affects the ability of an animal to convert transient stimuli into long-term changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kandel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nestler, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spitzer et al., 2000</xref>). Hundreds of IEGs, including those specific to tissues and stimulation paradigms, have been identified in mammals since the discovery of the first neuronal IEG, c-<italic>fos,</italic> by Greenberg and his colleagues in 1986 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenberg et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herschman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spiegel et al., 2014</xref>). Expression of these IEGs are induced within an hour, usually with big amplitudes (over 10 fold), and many IEGs are shared between different types of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spiegel et al., 2014</xref>). Functionally, these IEGs are highly enriched for transcription factors, which subsequently trigger a secondary transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spiegel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">West and Greenberg, 2011</xref>). The secondary response genes (SRGs) in contrast take longer to induce (a typical assay is 6 hr post-stimulation), are involved in many different processes, are more neuron-specific and function at least in part to promote neuron survival, dendritic morphogenesis and regulate synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloodgood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lin et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Not all IEGs respond to all types of stimulations, even the most robust ones like <italic>c-fos, Egr1</italic> and <italic>Arc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bepari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fields et al., 1997</xref>). For example, different stimulation paradigm-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry routes initiate different downstream pathways and lead to induction of distinct IEGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">West and Greenberg, 2011</xref>). Stimulations other than neural firing like growth factors also induce IEG expression, many of which are the same as those induced with neural firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tullai et al., 2007</xref>). Depending on the induction dynamics, Tullai <italic>et al.</italic> divided the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced IEGs in human T98G glioblastoma cells into primary response genes (PRGs) and delayed response genes (DRGs). Dramatic differences were shown between the two categories in terms of their functions, gene lengths, chromatin accessibility and RNA polymerase II occupancy at promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fowler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tullai et al., 2007</xref>). PRGs are usually optimized for rapid induction (such as shorter gene length and more permissive chromatin at promoters), whereas DRGs are not different from other genes in the genome. Notably, PRGs and DRGs are induced independent of protein-synthesis (âcycloheximide-insensitiveâ), whereas SRGs are protein-synthesis dependent (âcycloheximide-sensitiveâ).</p><p>IEGs, or activity-regulated genes (ARGs; they are defined here as induced rapidly with neuronal activity, i.e., mostly within an hour, but without regard to de novo protein synthesis) are poorly defined in organisms other than mammals. Only three genes to date have been identified as responding to increased neural activity in insects: <italic>kakusei</italic> (in honey bee), <italic>stripe</italic> (abbreviated as <italic>sr,</italic> in honey bee) and <italic>hr38</italic> (in silkmoth and the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kiya et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lutz and Robinson, 2013</xref>). Moreover, only one genome-wide study using microarrays had been performed more than a decade ago to identify seizure-induced ARGs from fly heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guan et al., 2005</xref>). More high-throughput studies on <italic>Drosophila</italic> ARGs are therefore needed, not only for identification and to provide mechanistic insight but also to design new tools to serve as indicators of neuronal activity.</p><p>Here, we identified ARGs in a genome-wide manner, in fly brains as well as in sorted neurons; they included dopaminergic neurons (DA) and a subset of circadian-related neurons (PDF+ neurons). Fly ARGs vary with the individual stimulation paradigm and are surprisingly cell type-specific. Fly ARGs are also more functionally diverse and have longer gene lengths compared to mammalian ARGs. Chromatin at transcription start sites (TSS) of fly ARGs is more accessible at baseline than other expressed genes but does not change with stimulation. Lastly, we used bioinformatics to identify key transcription factors that mediate ARG activation. Based on these factors, we generated novel luciferase reporters for in vivo monitoring of neuronal firing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide identification of firing-induced ARGs in fly brains</title><p>To identify ARGs in fly neurons in a genome-wide manner, the pan-neuronal driver <italic>Elav-GAL4</italic> was used to drive expression of <italic>UAS-ChR2-XXL</italic>, to artificially fire neurons by illuminating flies with a blue LED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawydow et al., 2014</xref>).

There is a weak anti-correlation, suggesting that longer genes are indeed more slowly induced on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This is not because overall induction amplitudes are smaller for longer genes, since the correlation disappears if fold changes between 0 and 60 min (FC60/0) are compared to gene lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>To gain more insight into these dynamics, nascent RNA and mRNA libraries were constructed in parallel from fly heads using the same stimulation paradigm. Heads rather than brains were used because of technical considerations: the much larger amounts of starting material required for nascent RNA preparation are difficult to obtain with brain dissections.</p><p>Although <italic>hr38</italic> and <italic>sr</italic> mRNA levels peak at 60 min with little or no changes evident at 15 min and even at 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>), the nascent RNA data indicate that the enhanced transcription of both genes is obvious at the first 15 min time point and peaks at 30 min, 30 min before the peak time of mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). For shorter genes such as <italic>CG14186</italic> (5.7 kb), the stimulation-induced increases are smaller at the nascent RNA level, presumably because much less time is required for transcription elongation and polyadenylation. More importantly and unlike the longer genes, there is no delay between the nascent and mRNA peak times for the shorter genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). The data taken together indicate that the long gene lengths of some prominent ARGs reduce the mRNA induction rates due to the time required for nascent events like transcriptional elongation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ARGs induced by two additional stimulation paradigms</title><p>To test whether these ARGs are universal and respond to different stimulation regimens, we employed two additional paradigms: <italic>dTrpA1-</italic>mediated firing and high KCl-induced depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). <italic>UAS-dTrpA1</italic> was overexpressed under the control of <italic>Elav-GAL4</italic>, and flies were stimulated in vivo by shifting the temperature from 18Â°C to 29Â°C to stimulate the temperature-sensitive <italic>dTrpA1</italic> cation channel.

Because many more ARGs (107 genes in total) were significantly induced and had bigger induction amplitudes at 90 min compared to 60 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 3âsource data 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), this 90 min time point was compared with the other two induction methods.</p><p>Only 12 ARGs are shared by all the three paradigms (including <italic>hr38</italic> and <italic>sr</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 3âsource data 4</xref>). To verify this conclusion, qPCR was used on 6 of these shared genes, and the results of all six are qualitatively consistent with the high-throughput RNA sequencing results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>The overlap between the three different pairwise combinations is larger: 13 genes are shared between <italic>dTrpA1</italic> (13% of <italic>dTrpA1-</italic>induced ARGs) and KCl (12% of KCl<italic>-</italic>induced ARGs), and 24 genes between <italic>ChR2-XXL</italic> (25% of <italic>ChR2-XXL-</italic>induced ARGs) and KCl (22% of KCl<italic>-</italic>induced ARGs).

In addition, we tested by qPCR whether some of the KCl-specific ARGs are due to the ex vivo condition only used for the KCl-stimulation: 4 out of 4 tested are not induced by the other two stimulation paradigms performed under the same ex vivo condition, i.e., exposure of dissected brains to the LED or to temperature shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4A</xref>).

However, they do indicate that the strategy is sound and should work for other activity-activated transcription factors and for the design of additional reporters, including for cell-specific neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using high-throughput sequencing, we identified ARGs in fly brains in response to <italic>ChR2-XXL</italic>, <italic>dTrpA1</italic> and KCl-induced neural firing. Each stimulation paradigm induced expression of about 100 genes, and there is substantial overlap between the 3 sets of ARGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The most robust ARGs are the two known genes identified previously, <italic>hr38</italic> and <italic>sr</italic>; they are induced dramatically by <italic>ChR2-XXL</italic> and <italic>dTrpA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). They are also induced with KCl albeit with smaller amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). 10 additional genes are also induced by all three protocols, and even more genes are induced by at least two paradigms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Although the results dramatically increase the number of common ARGs, there are also a large number of specialized ARG candidate genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Not surprisingly perhaps, KCl has the most different ARGs. This is presumably because it is the only in vitro stimulation paradigm and stimulates the whole brain including non-neuronal cells and tissues.</p><p>We also used the <italic>dTrpA1</italic> paradigm to identify ARGs in sorted neurons. Many of them are specific to neuron type, and even the most robust brain ARGs are not necessarily induced by firing in every region of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>,Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This is in contrast to heat-induced genes, most of which are shared by the three sources of RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>.).</p><p>Heat-induced gene expression unfortunately creates a complicated situation: some putative specific ARGs are also induced with the 18Â°C to 29Â°C shift in control (no <italic>dTrpA1</italic>) samples. These genes are thus excluded from the ARG list because they are defined as heat-induced by the cutoffs used in the analysis. Because it is possible that the temperature shift can lead to neuronal firing, e.g., by activating endogenous <italic>dTrpA1</italic>, there is currently no clear distinction between heat- and firing-induced genes. Future experiments with other tools like <italic>ChR2-XXL</italic> may be able to provide more information. In any case, the neuron-specific ARGs probably contribute to different physiological responses, which contribute in turn to distinct behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ueno et al., 2012</xref>). The results also provide good candidates as neural activity markers, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and suggest that multiple genes should be tried, to accommodate cell type as well as firing heterogeneity.</p><p>Although the in vivo nature of our most important stimulation paradigms precluded using inhibitors to assay the dependence of ARGs on de novo protein synthesis (data not shown), the induction time scales of these fly ARGs, 60â90 min, resemble those of mammalian IEGs. A comparison between fly ARGs with mammalian IEGs therefore seems appropriate.</p><p>Whereas mammalian IEGs are highly enriched in transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spiegel et al., 2014</xref>), they are less enriched in the fly brain and sorted neuron ARGs: <italic>ChR2-XXL</italic> induced ARGs contain only seven transcription factors among 96 genes; this is a much smaller fraction than in mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). KCl-induced ARGs show no enrichment in functions, and <italic>dTrpA1-</italic>induced ARGs in the cell types have a weak enrichment in different functions, such as steroid hormone receptor activity in brains, imaginal disc growth factor receptor binding in DA neurons and organic anion transmembrane transporter activity in PDF+ neurons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The weak enrichment suggests diverse ARG functions, which resemble more closely mammalian DRGs or SRGs rather than PRGs (see below).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19942.033</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Gene ontology analysis on <italic>dTrpA1-</italic>induced ARGs in different tissues with GOrilla.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19942.033">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19942.033</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top"><p>Functions</p></th><th valign="top"><p>p-value</p></th><th valign="top"><p>Genes</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p>Brains</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Steroid hormone receptor activity</p></td><td valign="top"><p>0.000536</p></td><td valign="top"><p>3</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>DA</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Imaginal disc growth factor receptor binding</p></td><td valign="top"><p>0.000843</p></td><td valign="top"><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>PDF+</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Organic anion transmembrane transporter activity</p></td><td valign="top"><p>0.000742</p></td><td valign="top"><p>5</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Less transcription factor activity and more diverse functions are consistent with the fact that fly homologues of the two most universal mammalian IEGs <italic>c-fos</italic> and <italic>c-jun, kayak</italic> and <italic>jra</italic> respectively, are not induced or poorly induced under most conditions.

A similar weak induction of seizure-induced genes was previously reported in fly heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guan et al., 2005</xref>). As only the first 60â90 min after stimulation was assayed, it is possible that the small fold-changes reflects a slower induction time course in flies than in mammals. Another possibility is that the nature of the firing, e.g., firing rate, has an impact on the induction amplitudes, time courses and even the genes induced. The differences between the three stimulation paradigms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) indicate that this possibility may have some merit. Nonetheless and taken together with the stimulation-paradigm and cell type-specific induction of ARGs, the modest fold-changes at 60â90 min helps explain the long-standing failure to identify <italic>bona fide</italic> and well-accepted ARGs in flies.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19942.034</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Fold changes distribution of all ARGs.</title><p>X-axis indicates fold changes (log2) at 60 or 90 (for KCl) min.

Several robust ARGs are above 10 kb with large first introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). For example, <italic>hr38</italic> isÂ ~31 kb and shares high protein sequence identity with the mammalian protein encoded by <italic>Nr4a2</italic>; it spans onlyÂ ~16.8 kb. <italic>sr</italic>, the shorter isoform of which is induced by firing, spansÂ ~11.7 kb, whereas EGR3, the mouse gene that encodes a protein with high identity to SR, is onlyÂ ~5.2 kb in length. Considering the much smaller genome size and gene size of flies compared to mammals and the potential slower transcription elongation rates in flies, the long gene lengths and large first introns of fly ARGs may counterintuitively serve to significantly slow down induction rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ardehali and Lis, 2009</xref>). Another possibility is that the large gene size reflects important regulatory elements for firing-mediated transcription embedded in the introns of these genes. Perhaps they are relevant to the diversity and cell type specificity of most fly ARGs.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19942.035</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Gene length distribution of all annotated genes and ARGs.</title><p>All indicates all annotated genes.

Mammalian IEGs are largely shared between different types of neurons such as excitatory and inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spiegel et al., 2014</xref>), but fly ARGs like SRGs appear quite tissue-type specific, i.e., many genes are only induced in one of the tissue types tested despite similar baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mardinly et al., 2016</xref>). This is in line with the fact that fly neurons appear quite heterogeneous, e.g., they have distinct transcript enrichment and electrophysiological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nagoshi et al., 2010</xref>). Although unlikely in our view, it remains possible that PDF+ and DA neurons are outliers and that ARGs in most other neurons are less cell type-specific. Nonetheless, we hypothesize that specific ARGs are an important feature of neuronal identity and play a role in neuron-specific physiological properties. As an example, preliminary analysis indicates that the PDF cell-ARGs are a subset of the mRNAs that undergo circadian oscillations within these neurons ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kula-Eversole et al., 2010</xref>] and data not shown).</p><p>The non-identical ARGs with the different paradigms also suggest different mechanisms for responding to different modes of stimulation. A less stereotyped response may be generally characteristic of invertebrates. Even non-mammalian vertebrates may be quantitatively if not qualitatively different from mammals. For example, induction of IEGs like <italic>fos</italic> and <italic>egr1</italic> was also observed in birds and zebrafish but with smaller increases (about 4 to 6-fold) than human and mice (usually well above 10-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">BÃ©bien et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burmeister and Fernald, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lopes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mokin and Keifer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moore and Whitmore, 2014</xref>). However, more high-throughput data are required to determine if the non-mammalian vertebrates resemble more closely flies or mammals. In addition, different stimulation paradigms were employed in the non-mammalian vertebrate studies, making the data less comparable. In any case, one can imagine that mammals need a more potent initial transcriptional system than flies to respond to firing. Not only are mammalian neurons bigger with more and longer processes, but they also have much larger genomes (longer genomic DNA and more enhancers to bind); both of these factors may require higher levels of transcripts to generate a required higher abundance of transcription factors. The increase may be required to activate the thousands of enhancers in mammals rather than the hundreds in flies, and/or more structural proteins are needed to change the morphology of âgiantâ mammalian neurons.</p><p>Nonetheless, one feature shared by fly ARGs and mammalian IEGs is the relatively permissive state of the TSS chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fowler et al., 2011</xref>). ATAC-seq shows that the chromatin accessibility of the ARG TSS is higher than that of other genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), and chromatin architecture contributes to gene expression regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu, 1997</xref>). Although no further opening is observed with firing, it is possible that more subtle changes such as histone modifications occur and are not detectable with ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In the cases of mammals, histones around IEGs promoters are modified to be more accessible to transcription factors at baseline; the modification levels could be even higher with firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). In any case, the data taken together suggest some blurring of the distinction between IEGs and SRGs in fly ARGs: open chromatin and rapid induction but a diverse set of neuron-specific functions.</p><p>Finally, we successfully generated luciferase reporters for in vivo neural activity monitoring based on the <italic>ChR2-XXL</italic> data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Rather than using the regulatory region of a single gene to construct a reporter, we generalized a previous strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tanenhaus et al., 2012</xref>) and used enriched transcription factor binding sites combined with FRT sites for cell type specific expression and a short-lived luciferase gene. This was not only to amplify the signal but also to avoid the situation in which a particular promoter is only responsive in certain neurons or to certain types of stimulation. We thought this was likely considering that ARGs are stimulation paradigm- and cell type-specific. Indeed, we tried many Janelia Research Campus GAL4 drivers, which use different regions of the <italic>hr38, sr</italic> and <italic>cbt</italic> promoters for neural activity monitoring, but they were all either unresponsive or generated very low luciferase levels (data not shown).</p><p>Two of the three positive reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) work well for circadian monitoring of neuronal activity in PDF+ neurons (data not shown),Â suggesting the signal to noise ratio is sufficient for monitoring small subsets of neurons. This result and others indicate that our strategy as well as these specific reporters can provide the temporal and spatial resolution for in vivo monitoring of small numbers of specific neurons. The strategy also builds a foundation for future elaboration and optimization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/FlyBase_FBst1021211">FlyBase_FBst1021211</ext-link>) were reared on standard cornmeal/agar medium supplemented with yeast under 12 hr LD cycles at 25Â°C. <italic>Elav-GAL4</italic> (C155) was obtained from Bloomington Stock Center. <italic>UAS-ChR2-XXL</italic> was a kind gift from Kittel Lab. <italic>UAS-dTrpA1</italic>was from Dr. Paul Garrity. <italic>TH-GAL4</italic> was described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Pdf-GAL4</italic> was described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>UAS-mCD8GFP;Pdf-GAL4</italic> was described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nagoshi et al., 2010</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and two reviewers, one of whom, Hugo Bellen, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Chen et al. used three different neuronal stimulation methods and RNAseq to systematically identify Activity-Regulated Genes (ARGs) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The study identified 12 ARGs (including previously known ARGs, hr38 and striped) that overlap in the three paradigms but also revealed a large number of stimuli-specific ARGs, suggesting that neurons may respond differently to different stimuli. The authors further performed RNAseq on small groups of neurons isolated by cell sorting (Dopaminergic and Pdf neurons, stimulated by the dTrpA1-strategy) and found that although there were some overlaps, many genes were cell type specific. In addition, the authors investigated the chromatin accessibility of the ARGs pre- and post-stimulation and found that in contrast to mammalian IEGs that show some changes in chromatin structure upon stimulation, the fly ARGs are in an open chromatin state to begin with. Together with the findings that fly ARGs are not enriched for transcription factors and small genes, the authors find an interesting difference between mammalian IEGs and <italic>Drosophila</italic> ARGs, and conclude that fly ARGs are more similar to mammalian secondary response genes (SRGs) or delayed response genes (DRGs). Finally, using the information from these experiments, the authors generated five Luciferase-based reporters and show that three of them show some stimulation induced activation in vivo.</p><p>Overall, we feel that the manuscript is well conceived and well written. Identification of new ARGs and showing a proof-of-principal that this information can be used to generate new tools is valuable. In addition, pan-neuronal and subtype specific transcriptomic profiles of neurons treated with different stimulations are also unique and interesting datasets that can be further mined to extract interesting biological information. The finding that, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, activity-induced transcription happens downstream of the level of chromatin accessibility will also allow researchers to begin to study the similarities and differences in the mechanism of activity-dependent gene activation between different model organisms. Finally, although not optimized yet, construction of several luciferase based neuronal activity reporter further adds value to this paper. As such, it is likely to be of broad interest and appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>; however, there are a few issues that must first be addressed:</p><p>Essential revisions (requiring experimental studies):</p><p>1) In all of the figures regarding expression profiling, there are no data confirming that the primary findings in RNAseq can be verified by other methods such as qPCR. We assume that the RNAseq was performed on biological replicates (although we cannot find such info in the Materials and methods). Even so we feel that having independent sets of data to backup these primary findings are critical. The authors should take several genes (top candidates from each of the stimulation paradigms that are shared and are unique) and perform qPCR or other assays to detect RNA transcripts (or protein if there is a change) to demonstrate that their findings are reproducible and can be verified by independent methods.</p><p>2) The authors find that although there are overlapping genes, ARGs found in different stimulation paradigms are significantly different. The authors speculate this could be reflecting some gene expression changes in non-neuronal cells (glia etc.), global changes that happen independent of neuronal activation (light-response, heat-shock response) or the difference in in-vivo versus ex-vivo experiments. One possibility that the authors do not discuss is the strength and duration of the stimulation. Based on the Methods section, the ChR2 paradigm stimulates the flies only for 30 seconds at the beginning and follow transcriptional changes, while dTrpA1 and high K<sup>+</sup> paradigms continuously activate the neurons for the entire duration (up to 60/90min). If the authors perform a longer stimulation in ChR2 flies, they may see more genes that overlap with the other 2 paradigms. Also, in order to determine if the difference between high-K<sup>+</sup> stimulation and the other two paradigms are simply due to differences in-vivo and ex-vivo sample preparation, the authors can perform an ex-vivo experiment for the ChR2 and dTRPA1 flies as well and see how that may affect the list of ARGs. Considering that additional RNAseq may require significant time, effort, and cost, the authors can select several high-confident hits from each of the paradigms (see major point 1) and test them via qPCRs or other methods.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the authors show that 3 reporters they generated respond to ChR2-mediated neuronal activation. However, they do not show how these reporters behave in the other two stimulation paradigms (dTrp1A, high K<sup>+</sup>). Was there a reason the author only focused on ChR2-ARGs? Is the binding site of Lola, Eip78 and Relish enriched in ARG genes activated by the other two paradigms? How do these reporters (and the two that didn't respond to ChR2-activation) behave when stimulated with dTrp1A and high-K<sup>+</sup>? Since a key conclusion that the authors draw from their RNAseq data is that stimulation paradigms make a big difference, the authors should test their reporter under different stimulation conditions. In addition, the authors should comment on whether their reporter signal is strong enough that they can be used to visualize neuronal activity in all (e.g. elav-GAL4) or subpopulation (e.g. TH-GAL4, Pdf-GAL4) of neurons.</p><p>Additional revisions (Textural changes/clarification):</p><p>1) Do any of the ARG genes the authors identified have known roles in neuronal plasticity? If so, what portion? This should be included in the Discussion.</p><p>2) We cannot find the information of how many flies or brains were used for each experiment. Also, were all of the flies of the same sex or a mix? How old were the flies when these experiments were performed? The authors should provide enough information so that others can replicate the findings.</p><p>3) For ChR2-flies, the authors state &quot;A 30-second 10 Hz LED exposure was sufficient to induce a uniform seizure within seconds, and all flies were able to recover within 15 min.&quot; For the dTrpA1 experiments, however, no phenotypic descriptions are provided. Did the dTrpA1 flies also show a similar seizure phenotype? If the flies do not show seizures or show a different behavioral defect during the stimulation, the two stimuli maybe acting on different neuronal populations (despite the two proteins being expressed pan-neuronally with elav-GAL4) leading to a difference in the ARG list.</p><p>4) The authors should state the amount/concentration of ATR that was fed to theChR2 flies.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, Is the 'weak anti-correlation' between change in gene expression and relative gene length significant?

We added this detail, text and figures, so that the reviewers and editor can examine the results. However, we find the addition rather cumbersome. So we are happy to refer to these PCR data as data not shown if editor/reviewers agree. On the other hand, we are more than willing to keep all this information in the manuscript. This is your choice.</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the authors show that 3 reporters they generated respond to ChR2-mediated neuronal activation.

In addition, the authors should comment on whether their reporter signal is strong enough that they can be used to visualize neuronal activity in all (e.g. elav-GAL4) or subpopulation (e.g. TH-GAL4, Pdf-GAL4) of neurons.</italic> </p><p>The reporters were originally generated based on the bioinformatics on the ChR2-XXL induced ARG list, and therefore tested only with that same paradigm. The ChR2-ARGs were chosen because we think this is a more physiological way to fire neurons than the other two paradigms, which involved heat and high K<sup>+</sup> depolarization. For dTrpA1 at least, the data back this up with lots of heat shock genes induced by the temperature shift even without dTrpA1. We later found that the 3 positive transcription factors are also enriched for the other two stimulation paradigms. We didnât test the reporters by monitoring ex vivo brains with the KCl paradigm. First, we are somewhat fixated on awake-behaving flies as we are developing these reporters and currently using them as a real time monitoring tool for living animals (see below). In addition, and from a more practical point of view, our top counter machine although very sensitive is not well-adapted to ex vivo monitoring.</p><p>In contrast and also as suggested, we tried the reporters with the TrpA1 paradigm (Experimental flies: Elav-GAL4;UAS-dTrpA1;UAS-FLP;reporters, control flies: Elav-GAL4;UAS-FLP;reporters). Somewhat surprisingly perhaps, all reporters including the two negative ones responded to the 21Â°C to 30Â°C temperature shift, without UAS-dTrpA1 as well as with (data not shown), suggesting that heat may increase the activity of many transcription factors. Although heat can also fire some neurons, the induction here is more likely due to heat alone since the levels of induction are indistinguishable between the experimental and control flies for all reporters. The observation also suggests that these reporters are not exclusively responsive to neuronal firing. However, we cannot at present exclude the possibility that this is an artifact, for example a temperature effect on luciferase reporter activity. We cannot sort this out within the time frame of returning the manuscript, so the assay of the reporters remains restricted to ChR2 in this paper, where fortunately we have convincing negative controls.</p><p>On the other hand, the three reporters have been tested under the control of Pdf-GAL4 since submitting this manuscript. We could not easily combine them with ChR2 in the PDF cells for complicated genetic reasons. However, a clear circadian pattern can be observed for both rel and lola but not eip78C, suggesting low EIP78C levels or activity in PDF+ cells. Importantly, the pattern is indistinguishable from our in vivo Ca++ reporter system (Guo et al. 2016). This indicates that the reporters âworkâ in small numbers of neurons and even respond to more natural firing conditions. These results will be reported soon in experiments that describe the firing patterns of different circadian neurons. We now make a bare bones âdata not shownâ statement in the revised manuscript to indicate that the reporters work in PDF neurons.</p><p><italic>Additional revisions (Textural changes/clarification):</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Do any of the ARG genes the authors identified have known roles in neuronal plasticity? If so, what portion? This should be included in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>Many fly genes are involved in plasticity, with functions from regulating chromatin structure to post-translational modification. There are for sure some hits, but it is hard to say accurately what fraction they are.</p><p><italic>2) We cannot find the information of how many flies or brains were used for each experiment.

No seizures were observed. However, shifting to an even higher temperature causes seizures, suggesting a similar or overlapping set of neurons are stimulated in both cases. However, we avoided shifting to above 30Â°C to minimize effects from heat and stress. Although it is possible that the TrpA1 paradigm is not as strong as the ChR2-XXL paradigm, similar levels of induction were observed for the genes in common between the two paradigms.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should state the amount/concentration of ATR that was fed to theChR2 flies.</italic> </p><p>The concentration was and still is mentioned in the Methods section.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, Is the 'weak anti-correlation' between change in gene expression and relative gene length significant?

Although.13 is low, it is still 4 times higher than.03. In addition, the low numbers suggest that gene length is not the only factor that determines induction rate. We suspect that the low numbers are also influenced by the many genes with low fold-changes. Nonetheless, we recognize that this figures is marginal and are of course willing to remove it if that is the reviewer/editorial consensus.</p><p><italic>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, there appears to be a second peak of luciferase activity at the end of recording with the eip78C reporter.

As mentioned (also added to the text), the reporters are a little noisy, which may indicate that they also respond to spontaneous firing. In addition, we have evidence that the reporters are regulated by other factors such as circadian rhythms (see above). We truncated the last time point of this graph in the revised manuscript so it looks less confusing. The 1<sup>st</sup> time point with low values was generated by a program error in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>, which is now also removed.

In response to heat shocks, they also show similar induction amplitudes. Lastly, the chromatin structure of CyO flies at baseline is also similar to the TrpA1 flies. Therefore, we believe that the CyO flies are not distinguishable from the gene expression point of view from our dTrpA1 flies.</p><p><italic>8) In the second paragraph of the subsection âPromoter Regions of ARGs are at Permissive State Prior to Stimulationâ, what do you mean when you refer to &quot;all annotated genes&quot;?
