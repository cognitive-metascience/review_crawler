unfolded protein response (UPR). In the ER lumen, accumulation of unfolded proteins activates the transmembrane ER-stress sensor Ire1 and drives its oligomerization. In the cytosol, Ire1 recruits <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA, mediating its non-conventional splicing. The spliced mRNA is translated into Hac1, the key transcription activator of UPR target genes that mitigate ER-stress. In this study, we report that oligomeric assembly of the ER-lumenal domain is sufficient to drive Ire1 clustering. Clustering facilitates Ire1's cytosolic oligomeric assembly and <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA docking onto a positively charged motif in Ire1's cytosolic linker domain that tethers the kinase/RNase to the transmembrane domain. By the use of a synthetic bypass, we demonstrate that mRNA docking per se is a pre-requisite for initiating Ire1's RNase activity and, hence, splicing. We posit that such step-wise engagement between Ire1 and its mRNA substrate contributes to selectivity and efficiency in UPR signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05031.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05031.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05031.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are built based on instructions in template molecules called messenger RNAs (or mRNAs), which are copied from the DNA of genes. As they are made, proteins must fold into a specific three-dimensional shape and some proteins pass into a compartment in the cell, called the endoplasmic reticulum, in which they fold. So-called molecular chaperone proteins assist this folding process. From the endoplasmic reticulum, most proteins travel to other destinations within or outside of the cell.</p><p>If the molecular chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum are overwhelmed by their protein folding task, unfolded proteins accumulate; a situation that can be harmful to the cell. In eukaryotic cells including yeast, a sensor protein called Ire1 detects when unfolded proteins build up in the endoplasmic reticulum. As a result, the Ire1 sensor proteins join together to form clusters and an mRNA molecule called <italic>HAC1</italic> is specifically recruited to the Ire1 clusters. The portions of the Ire1 protein that extend out from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cell proper then bind to <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA and cut a piece out of it. This edited mRNA encodes the instructions to build a protein that in turn boosts the expression of various components—including the appropriate molecular chaperones—that are needed to alleviate the stress caused by an excess of unfolded proteins.</p><p>Within clusters, individual Ire1 proteins interact through the portions of the protein found on the inside of the endoplasmic reticulum. Now, van Anken et al. show that these interactions are sufficient for forming and maintaining clusters. The interactions between the portions of the Ire1 proteins outside of the endoplasmic reticulum are needed for editing the <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA but not for forming and maintaining the clusters or for recruiting the <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA molecule to bind to Ire1. Instead, van Anken et al. discovered an mRNA binding site on the Ire1 clusters, which is separate from the part of the Ire1 protein that cuts the mRNA molecules. The Ire1 protein needs to first bind the <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA molecule at this binding site before it can cut it; van Anken et al. suggest that this two-step process helps ensure accurate and efficient editing of the <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA by Ire1. This process could also help to minimize the chance of other mRNA molecules being edited by mistake.</p><p>It will be of interest to investigate if similar safety measures are key for endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling mechanisms in humans, and whether these newly discovered steps can be targeted by drugs to treat disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05031.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05031.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>stress signaling</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>mRNA targeting</kwd><kwd>mRNA processing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rubicon Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Anken</surname><given-names>Eelco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006781</institution-id><institution>Giovanni Armenise-Harvard Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Development Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Anken</surname><given-names>Eelco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pincus</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Coyle</surname><given-names>Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Osman</surname><given-names>Christof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Korennykh</surname><given-names>Alexei V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad (Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gómez Puerta</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Selective docking of <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA on Ire1 clusters at a site separate from the Ire1 RNase domain is key for endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteins that travel along the secretory pathway first enter the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as unfolded polypeptides. Assisted by ER-resident enzymes, they undergo oxidative folding, modification, and assembly reactions. When properly folded, they are packaged into ER exit vesicles and travel to their final destination in the endomembrane system, on the cell surface or, after secretion, outside of the cell. Proteins that do not reach maturity are degraded by the proteasome after retrotranslocation into the cytosol (via ER-associated degradation) or by autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van Anken and Braakman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernales et al., 2006</xref>). Homeostasis in ER protein folding is achieved by fine-tuning the balance between the protein folding load and the protein folding capacity in the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mori, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kimata and Kohno, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In yeast, Ire1 is the only known ER-stress sensor that responds to an accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen and transduces this information across the ER membrane. On the cytosolic side, Ire1 activation results in the non-conventional splicing of <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA, which is cleaved by Ire1's RNase domain at two splice sites, releasing a single intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sidrauski and Walter, 1997</xref>). Upon ligation of the severed exons, the spliced mRNA is translated to produce the Hac1 transcription activator that drives expression of UPR target genes to mitigate ER-stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Travers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). Ire1 is activated through higher-order oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kimata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aragón et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korennykh et al., 2009</xref>). Two ER-lumenal domain (LD) interfaces, IF1<sup>L</sup> and IF2<sup>L</sup> (‘L’ for lumenal), which were identified in the crystal structure of yeast Ire1 LD and validated by mutagenesis, mediate oligomeric assembly of the LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Credle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kimata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aragón et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>). Dimerization via IF1<sup>L</sup> yields a composite groove extending across the LDs of two Ire1 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Credle et al., 2005</xref>). Unfolded stretches of polypeptides bind within this groove of Ire1 LD, causing its oligomerization in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>). Proximal activation of the UPR in vivo coincides with the dissociation of Kar2 (the yeast homolog of the ER-lumenal hsp70 chaperone BiP) from Ire1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kimata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pincus et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). Yet, Ire1 mutants with impaired Kar2 binding still respond to ER-stress, although the threshold for activation is lowered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kimata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pincus et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). Thus, misfolded proteins likely are direct ligands that activate Ire1, while Kar2 fine-tunes the signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pincus et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>).</p><p>On the cytosolic side of the ER membrane, Ire1 contains both a kinase and an RNase domain, which are tethered to the transmembrane domain via a linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mori, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kimata and Kohno, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). Three cytosolic assembly interfaces, IF1<sup>C</sup>, IF2<sup>C</sup>, and IF3<sup>C</sup> (‘C’ for cytosolic), were identified from the crystal structures of Ire1 kinase/RNase oligomers. IF1<sup>C</sup> creates back-to-back dimers of the kinase/RNase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korennykh et al., 2009</xref>) that stack onto each other with an axial rotation via IF2<sup>C</sup> and IF3<sup>C</sup> to form filaments with a helical arrangement of seven Ire1 dimers per turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korennykh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). The lumenal and cytosolic domain filaments predicted by the crystal structures have a different pitch and thus for steric reasons cannot be collinear. Instead, a two-dimensional arrangement of the two filaments, featuring ∼20–30 Ire1 molecules, provides a model for the higher-order assembly in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korennykh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This model is compatible with the size of Ire1 foci observed by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aragón et al., 2009</xref>) and is sterically feasible despite the twists of the filaments on either side of the planar membrane, owing to the flexibility and length (&gt;100 Å) of the linker domains on either side of the membrane, which can relieve the strain. Alternatively and not mutually exclusive, Ire1 clusters may be dynamic, such that constant rearrangements of the Ire1 molecules in clusters sustain transient intermittent oligomerization events on either side of the membrane.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05031.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Oligomerization of Ire1's cytosolic domain is required for UPR signaling but not for Ire1 cluster formation or <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA recruitment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ire1.

The 24 Ire1 molecules are labeled (A–H) A′–H′, and A′′–H′′. IF1<sup>C</sup>-mediated back-to-back dimers are between A &amp; B and C &amp; D, etc. IF2<sup>C</sup>, is formed between Ire1 molecules A and D, C and F, and so on. The third interface, IF3<sup>C</sup>, is stabilized by a phosphate in the activation loop resulting from Ire1 trans-autophosphorylation. Dimerization via IF3<sup>C</sup> is therefore directional from B → D → F and from E → C → A, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korennykh et al., 2009</xref>).

The <italic>HAC1</italic> open reading frame (ORF) is divided into two exons (black). The intron (gray) base pairs with the 5′ UTR (gray), causing stalling of ribosomes. Ire1 cleaves the intron at the splice sites indicated by blue arrowheads. The 3′ UTR (gray) harbors a stem-loop structure with the 3′ BE (red) that facilitates recruitment of the <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA to Ire1 foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aragón et al., 2009</xref>).

Middle: the green bar depicts the GFP ORF (green) that replaces part of the <italic>HAC1</italic> sequence in the splicing reporter (SpR). Translation of GFP only occurs when the intron is spliced from the mRNA, because removal of the intron by Ire1's endonuclease activity lifts a translational block caused by base pairing between the intron and the 5′ UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pincus et al., 2010</xref>).

To analyze the role for the [+]-box in Ire1 function in vivo, we first truncated Ire1 further such that the [+]-box was deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Since we could not obtain a centromeric plasmid of this construct, as it was toxic for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, we created <italic>ire1Δ</italic> strains with a genomic copy of the <italic>ire1ΔKR</italic> or <italic>ire1ΔKR/Δ[+]-box</italic> mCherry-tagged transgenes in the <italic>LEU2</italic> locus. As expected, Ire1 clustering and mRNA recruitment were still at wild-type levels for <italic>ire1ΔKR</italic> when genomically integrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), similar to what we observed when <italic>ire1ΔKR</italic> was expressed from a centromeric plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,F</xref>). Further removal of the [+]-box did not affect Ire1 clustering but markedly reduced mRNA recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This finding suggests that the [+]-box is key for the docking of mRNA onto Ire1 clusters. Moreover, given that the extent of clustering of the <italic>ire1 (ΔKR/Δ[+]-box)</italic> mutant was similar to wild-type, we conclude that Ire1 clustering is driven by the lumenal domain alone: neither cytosolic oligomeric assembly (as facilitated by the kinase/RNase domains) nor mRNA docking (as facilitated by the [+]-box) is required for Ire1 foci formation.</p><p>Next, we set out to explore the role of the [+]-box in the context of the full-length Ire1 using the mutants and truncations depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. The experiments presented so far employed Ire1 variants bearing GFP or mCherry modules in the linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aragón et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pincus et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rubio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). To avoid interference with mutations in the linker, we relocated the fluorescent modules to the αF–αEF loop in the Ire1 kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). By contrast to the activation loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which becomes hyperphosphorylated due to Ire1's kinase activity, the αF–αEF loop is poorly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and dispensable for Ire1 activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korennykh et al., 2009</xref>). Accordingly, despite the insertion of a fluorescent protein module into the αF–αEF loop, Ire1 still faithfully formed foci and recruited SpR<sup>U1A</sup> mRNA under ER-stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,G</xref>) and was indistinguishable from untagged wild-type Ire1 in splicing efficiency and growth under ER-stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Removal of the [+]-box abolished splicing and growth under ER-stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goffin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, ‘Δ[+]-box’), as did replacement of lysines and arginines within the [+]-box with glutamines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, ‘Q-box’). These mutants were expressed at similar levels as the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, extensive truncation of the rest of the linker (‘Δ55’)—to a length comparable to the shortest among all Ire1 homologs (61 amino acids; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>)—had no effect on growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The [+]-box was shown previously to act as a nuclear import signal when inserted into heterologous proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goffin et al., 2006</xref>). For Ire1, however, such a role is unlikely, since tampering with the [+]-box had no effect on the distribution throughout the ER on either of non-clustered Ire1 in the absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) or of Ire1 foci in the presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) of ER-stress. Conversely, removal or mutagenesis of the [+]-box did affect the co-localization of the SpR<sup>U1A</sup> mRNA to Ire1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Shortening of the linker, while leaving the [+]-box intact, did not impact on co-localization of the mRNA with Ire1 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Thus, the splicing and growth defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) correlated with impairments in mRNA recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

Since the [+]-box is unlikely to contribute to the core enzymatic function of Ire1, as it is not conserved in all eukaryotes, we reasoned that the docking mechanism itself is important to initiate splicing activity. To test this idea, we created a synthetic bypass for [+]-box mediated docking by inserting the U1A RNA binding module into the αF–αEF loop of the <italic>ire1(Δ[+]-box)</italic> mutant. We reasoned that the insertion of the U1A module would allow direct interaction of the Ire1–U1A fusion protein with <italic>HAC1</italic><sup>U1A</sup> mRNA via the U1A-binding hairpins that we had introduced into the 3′ UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), which we thus far employed in the mRNAs for visualization purposes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Thus, docking of the mRNA per se to a site distinct from the kinase/RNase domain is key for the mRNA to be processed by Ire1.

In particular, the [+]-box encompasses a conserved arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) motif, which in the form of repeats adorns several RNA binding protein families, including snRNPs, hnRNPs, and snoRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Godin and Varani, 2007</xref>). Via combined low-affinity interactions, RGG boxes synergize in the assembly of RNA–protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Godin and Varani, 2007</xref>). Along these lines it is plausible that when Ire1 is monomeric, the [+]-boxes of individual Ire1 molecules may not sustain RNA binding, which can explain the lack of mRNA recruitment under non-ER-stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aragón et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Clustering of [+]-boxes, resulting from Ire1 LD-driven oligomerization, would generate the required synergistic avidity, such that only clustered [+]-boxes form a docking platform for the mRNA.</p><p>We found that residual targeting of <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA occurs even in the absence of recognizable features conserved among Ire1 proteins at the cytosolic side of the membrane (<italic>ire1</italic>ΔKR/Δ[+]-box).

These data indicate that 3′ BE-mediated <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA targeting operates independently from [+]-box-mediated mRNA docking. In the well-studied example of <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA targeting to the bud tip in yeast, three steps can be distinguished: mRNA particle formation (which requires the She2 and She4 proteins), mRNA transport into the bud (which requires the She1, Myo4, and She3 proteins), and finally mRNA anchoring at the bud tip (which requires the She5, Bni1, Bud6, and Aip3 proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beach and Bloom, 2001</xref>).

This mechanism limits diffusion of the mRNA substrate to the two-dimensional plane of the membrane and thus may present an evolutionary bypass for docking via the [+]-box, functionally equivalent to the synthetic U1A bypass we describe here. Alternatively, membrane targeting in metazoans may represent the first targeting step that precedes a more specific docking event. Intriguingly, plants may employ both strategies: the unspliced substrate mRNA encodes a protein containing a hydrophobic membrane anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deng et al., 2011</xref>), allowing pre-recruitment to the ER-membrane, while the conserved basic linker motif in plant Ire1 homologs may serve as a dedicated mRNA docking site for further selectivity in the recruitment process.</p><p>The step-wise reaction in which mRNA targeting and docking are staged and intertwined with Ire1 activation may help ascertain that Ire1 recognizes <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA as its privileged substrate, even though at least 50 consensus sequence splice site motifs are present in the yeast transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gonzalez et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Niwa et al., 2005</xref>).

In brief, samples for microscopy were taken from yeast that was kept in early log-phase for at least 16 hr in 2× synthetic media before imaging. Microscopy of laser-excited mCherry or GFP was performed with a Yokogawa CSU-22 spinning disc confocal on a Nikon TE2000 microscope, controlled with µmanager and ImageJ. Images were captured with a 100×/1.4 NA Plan Apo objective on a Cascade II EMCCD and selected for analysis to contain significant signal above background but no saturated pixels. For display, images were processed in ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop such that the linear range of signals was comparable. Foci of Ire1 variants were determined and the co-localization index for U1A–GFP decorated SpR<sup>U1A</sup>, SL-<italic>PGK</italic>-3′ <italic>hac1</italic><sup>U1A</sup>, or SpR Δ3′ BE<sup>U1A</sup> mRNA recruited to those foci was scored by using a customized MatLab script, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aragón et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank K.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three comment on the significance of the work and mark it as a worthwhile advance. The review process also uncovered several deficiencies in your paper that should be remedied before publication. These are listed below.</p><p>The authors state: “Surprisingly, we found that residual targeting of HAC1 mRNA occurs even in the absence of recognizable features conserved among Ire1 proteins at the cytosolic side of the membrane (ire1ΔKR/Δ[+]-box), as long as the mRNA contained the 3' BE motif and was translationally repressed.” It is debatable if dependence on the 3'BE and on translational repression has been rigorously demonstrated. It would be important to show that the residual targeting is diminished when Hac1 mRNA lacks the 3'BE.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows that the U1A-mediated targeting of Hac1 to Ire1 can partially compensate for the loss of the (+) box in Ire1 (comparing lanes 4 and 5). But even in this context the 3'BE is doing something to enhance splicing (lanes 5, 6). Given the focus of the paper on the interplay of RNA and protein motives in Hac1 mRNA targeting, it would be important to establish if U1A targeting can also compensate for the loss of the 3'BE: what does the splicing/tuni sensitivity look like for delta-3'BE when the U1A is not present in Ire1? Is splicing completely blocked (as with the delta+ box?)?</p><p>mRNA reporter assays and foci formation assays were done in the presence of 2 mM or 10 mM DTT while survival/growth assay were done in the presence of tunicamycin. Authors should provide the survival assays in the presence of DTT and foci formation and mRNA reporter assay in the presence of tunicamycin to determine if the phenomena is specific to DTT or is a general mechanism of ER stress resolution.

It would be important to show that the residual targeting is diminished when Hac1 mRNA lacks the 3'BE</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are correct that the present study does not rigorously demonstrate the dependence on the 3'BE and translational repression. However, we demonstrated this fact rigorously in our previous publication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figure 2i and 4</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aragon et al. (2009)</xref>). Consistent with these previous findings, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> of the present study we observed no mRNA recruitment even for WT Ire1 in the absence of the 3'BE. Since recruitment is already down to background levels for WT Ire1, it is not plausible that <italic>ire1</italic> ΔKR/Δ[+]-box might recruit an mRNA lacking the 3'BE. We have further clarified this point in the text.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>shows that the U1A-mediated targeting of Hac1 to Ire1 can partially compensate for the loss of the (+) box in Ire1 (comparing lanes 4 and 5).

Is splicing completely blocked (as with the delta+ box?)?</italic></p><p>The reviewers are correct that this is a very important point. In fact, we performed the exact experiment the referees suggest in our previous publication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,e</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aragon et al. (2009)</xref>): a strain expressing WT Ire1 and <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA lacking the 3’BE has a growth defect in ER stress conditions compared to WT. The reduction in splicing efficiency we now see upon removal of the 3’BE with the U1A ‘bypass’ is commensurate with the reduction seen for WT Ire1 upon removal of the 3’BE from <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA. We now clarify and stress this point in the text.</p><p><italic>mRNA reporter assays and foci formation assays were done in the presence of 2 mM or 10 mM DTT while survival/growth assay were done in the presence of tunicamycin.

Importantly, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aragon et al. (2009)</xref> Figure S2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, we monitored clustering in the presence of tunicamycin and DTT, and we showed that both stressors induce similar foci, though with different kinetics. There are three reasons we use 5 mM DTT for imaging and biochemical assays and 0.2 μg/ml tunicamycin for survival assays:</p><p>1) Since tunicamycin affects only newly synthesized proteins as it blocks <italic>de novo</italic> N-glycosylation, it takes longer to induce ER stress than DTT, which breaks disulfide bonds of already-synthesized ER clients. Thus, for assessing foci formation DTT is more suitable.</p><p>2) For the survival assay, strong ER stress will not reveal differences in UPR signaling efficiency. If we were to use 5 mM DTT in plate assays even the WT would be dead. The survival is measured after 3 days, whereas the clustering is measured after 1 hr. The 0.2 μg/ml tunicamycin concentration has been used widely in the field as it has been empirically established as a concentration at which ER stress is tolerable to WT cells but toxic to UPR mutants.</p><p>3) DTT in plate survival assays is not ideal as it oxidizes over time unless the medium is kept at a low pH. Tunicamycin in contrast is stable over longer periods of time. Using stabilized DTT would impose an acidic shock on top of the ER stress.</p><p>We now stress in the Methods that we established empirically that 5 mM DTT gives robust ER stress that is ideal for assessing clustering and mRNA recruitment, while 0.2 μg/ml tunicamycin is most suitable to score how mutants in UPR signaling efficiency affect growth.</p><p>Dr Peter Rodgers adds:</p><p><italic>“We feel that the following title would be more understandable:</italic></p><p><italic>Specificity in endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling entails a step-wise engagement of HAC1 mRNA to clusters of the stress sensor Ire1”</italic></p><p>We have changed the title according to Peter Rodgers’ excellent suggestion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
