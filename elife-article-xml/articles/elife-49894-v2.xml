modulates host cells, downregulating &gt;900 human proteins during viral replication and degrading ≥133 proteins shortly after infection. The mechanism of degradation of most host proteins remains unresolved, and the functions of many viral proteins are incompletely characterised. We performed a mass spectrometry-based interactome analysis of 169 tagged, stably-expressed canonical strain Merlin HCMV proteins, and two non-canonical HCMV proteins, in infected cells. This identified a network of &gt;3400 virus-host and &gt;150 virus-virus protein interactions, providing insights into functions for multiple viral genes. Domain analysis predicted binding of the viral UL25 protein to SH3 domains of NCK Adaptor Protein-1. Viral interacting proteins were identified for 31/133 degraded host targets. Finally, the uncharacterised, non-canonical ORFL147C protein was found to interact with elements of the mRNA splicing machinery, and a mutational study suggested its importance in viral replication. The interactome data will be important for future studies of herpesvirus infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>systems virology</kwd><kwd>human cytomegalovirus</kwd><kwd>host-pathogen interaction</kwd><kwd>immune evasion</kwd><kwd>protein-protein interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>108070/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weekes</surname><given-names>Michael P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/L018373/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Eddie CY</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilkinson</surname><given-names>Gavin WG</given-names></name><name><surname>Stanton</surname><given-names>Richard J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P001602/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Eddie CY</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilkinson</surname><given-names>Gavin WG</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT090323MA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Eddie CY</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilkinson</surname><given-names>Gavin WG</given-names></name><name><surname>Stanton</surname><given-names>Richard J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UU_12014/3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davison</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U24 HG006673</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huttlin</surname><given-names>Edward L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/S00971X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Eddie CY</given-names></name><name><surname>Stanton</surname><given-names>Richard J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) interactome systematically characterises high-confidence viral-viral and viral-host protein interactions in HCMV-infected cells, facilitating multiple novel insights into HCMV and herpesviral function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) persistently infects the majority of the worldwide population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mocarski et al., 2013</xref>). Following primary infection under the control of a healthy immune system, a latent infection is established that persists lifelong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reeves et al., 2005</xref>). In immunocompromised individuals, particularly transplant recipients and AIDS patients, virus reactivated from latency to induce lytic infection is capable of affecting almost any organ system and causing serious disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nichols et al., 2002</xref>). HCMV infection in utero is a leading cause of deafness and intellectual disability in newborns, affecting ~1/200 pregnancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mocarski et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Small-molecule disruption of critical virus-virus or virus-host protein interactions could provide novel therapeutic strategies. Indeed, disruption of interactions between antiviral restriction factors (ARFs) and viral antagonists can facilitate endogenous inhibition of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nathans et al., 2008</xref>). Systematic characterisation of all viral protein interactions thus has important implications for antiviral therapy, and is particularly important for HCMV, for which only a few drugs are available.</p><p>HCMV encodes 170 canonical protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gatherer et al., 2011</xref>), and a substantial number of non-canonical open reading frames (ORFs) that potentially encode additional proteins have been identified by ribosomal footprinting and proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nightingale et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>). During productive infection in vitro, HCMV gene expression is conventionally divided into immediate-early, early and late phases over a replication cycle lasting ~96 hr. Five temporal classes of viral protein expression have been defined by measuring viral protein profiles over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weekes et al., 2014</xref>). Latent infection with HCMV occurs in a restricted range of cell types, and may involve a somewhat more limited range of viral gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goodrum and McWeeney, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwartz and Stern-Ginossar, 2019</xref>). However, at least some viral proteins function similarly during both productive infection and latency. For example, UL138, which plays roles in the establishment and maintenance of latent infection, downregulates Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 1 (MRP1) during both phases of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Weekes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weekes et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The functions of many canonical HCMV proteins remain poorly understood, and it is not yet clear how many, if any, non-canonical ORFs encode functional polypeptides. We have shown previously that &gt;900 host proteins are downregulated &gt;3 fold over the course of HCMV infection, with 133 proteins degraded in the proteasome or lysosome during the early phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nightingale et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weekes et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is not yet known which viral factors target these proteins, and certain proteins, including MHC class I molecules and natural killer cell ligands, can be targeted by more than one viral factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fielding et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van der Wal et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wilkinson et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Here, an examination of each canonical and a subset of non-canonical HCMV proteins in infected cells revealed an extensive network of &gt;3400 high confidence virus-host and &gt;150 virus-virus interactions. This provided insights into the functions of multiple uncharacterised or partly characterised viral proteins. The data enabled identification of individual viral factors that target 31 host proteins for degradation. Novel interactions between selected viral and host protein domains were also tested experimentally. In addition, the study provided the first evidence for a functional role for a non-canonical HCMV ORF in viral infection. The extensive interactome data generated in this study predicts viral proteins important in key cellular pathways, and may lead to the development of new antiviral therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construction of the HCMV-host interactome</title><p>To build a global picture of all HCMV virus-host and virus-virus protein interactions, 170 stable cell lines were generated from immortalised primary human fetal foreskin fibroblasts (HFFF-TERTs), each expressing a single, canonical HCMV ORF with a C-terminal V5 tag to facilitate immunoprecipitation (IP). Two non-canonical ORFs, ORFL147C and ORFS343C, were also included on the basis of either high or low expression respectively, relative to all other viral ORFs detected previously by proteomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – Figure Supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fielding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weekes et al., 2014</xref>). Prior to profiling by IP-mass spectrometry (IP-MS), expression of each tagged viral ‘bait’ protein was validated by immunoblotting (IB), MS or RT-qPCR, apart from UL136 which could not be detected by any method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – Figure Supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). To examine the full range of virus-virus interactions in addition to virus-host interactions, IP was performed in cells infected with Merlin strain HCMV at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2 for 60 hr. Merlin contains a full length genome and expresses all HCMV genes apart from UL128 and RL13. All detectable viral proteins are expressed at 60 hr post-infection (PI) with this strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weekes et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). A schematic and details of the IP-MS strategy are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of the IP strategy.</title><p>IP samples were generated and analysed in technical duplicate, using the method originally described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huttlin et al. (2017)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huttlin et al. (2015)</xref> and discussed in detail in the Materials and methods section. For 153 baits with zero or one transmembrane (TM) region predicted by Uniprot, an NP40-based lysis buffer was used; for 18 baits with &gt;1 TM region, a digitonin-based buffer was used, as this has previously been demonstrated to improve identifications of interacting proteins (‘prey’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babu et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). Each dataset was scored separately using the CompPASS algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huttlin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sowa et al., 2009</xref>) to better model detergent-specific variation in IP-MS background. Data reported for each prey protein in every IP include: (a) the number of peptide spectral matches (PSMs), averaged between technical replicates; (b) an entropy score, which compares the number of PSMs between replicates to eliminate proteins that are not detected consistently; (c) a z-score, calculated in comparison to the average and standard deviation of PSMs observed across all IPs; and (d) a normalised WD (NWD) score. The NWD score addresses whether (i) the protein is detected across all IPs, and (ii) whether it is detected reproducibly among replicates. It was calculated as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrends et al. (2010)</xref> using the fraction of runs in which a protein was observed, the observed number of PSMs, the average and standard deviation of PSMs observed for that protein across all IPs, and the number of replicates (1 or 2) containing the protein of interest. NWD scores were normalised so that the top 2% earned scores of ≥1.0. Stringent filters were applied to remove inconsistent and low-confidence protein identifications across all IPs and thus minimise both false protein identifications and associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huttlin et al., 2015</xref>). These included: (a) a minimum PSM score of 1.5 (i.e. ≥3 peptides per protein across both replicates); (b) an entropy score of ≥0.75; and (c) an NWD or z-score in the top 2%. Previous studies have estimated a 5% false discovery rate when employing a similar strategy with a top NWD score cutoff of 2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sowa et al., 2009</xref>). Interactions passing these criteria are named ‘high confidence interacting proteins’ (HCIPs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2B</xref>), and were used in all subsequent analyses. For added stringency, the supervised learning algorithm CompPass Plus was employed. This additionally assessed batch variations, overall spectral counts, unique peptide counts and protein detection frequency. Shannon entropy quantified a protein’s consistency of detection across technical duplicate LC-MS analyses, removing inconsistent protein identifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huttlin et al., 2017</xref>). CompPass plus was developed for interactomes with ≥96 baits and in the present study was only applied to the 153 baits solubilized in NP40. Interactions that passed CompPass filters, had CompPass Plus p(Interactor)&gt;0.75 and in which the prey was identified by ≥2 unique peptides were considered as very high confidence interacting proteins (VHCIPs). These are indicated in green shading in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2B</xref>. To facilitate global analysis of all data, and because digitonin-solubilised interactions were not analysed using CompPass plus, HCIPs as opposed to VHCIPs were examined for the remainder of this study. The identification of an interacting protein as a VHCIP nevertheless adds additional confidence that the interaction observed is likely to be genuine.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49894-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Further details of the interactome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Abundance of 127 quantified canonical and non-canonical HCMV ORFs.

For the nine baits whose expression was only ever observed by RT-qPCR, four were small proteins of 47–111 amino acids, with 1–4 theoretically observable peptides. None of these four proteins were previously detected in two systematic proteomic analyses of HCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nightingale et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weekes et al., 2014</xref>). In the same studies, a further 4/9 viral proteins were only detected by a median of 0–2 peptides, and 2/4 had multiple transmembrane domains, suggesting that detection may have been limited by protein abundance or hydrophobicity. Nevertheless, known protein prey of these nine viral baits were detected in the interactome, for example the interaction between the small capsomere-interacting protein UL48A and major capsid protein UL86, and membrane protein US18 and natural killer cell cytotoxicity receptor 3 ligand 1 (NCR3LG1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fielding et al., 2017</xref>).

(<bold>D</bold>) Reproducibility of interactome analyses. In this interactome, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huttlin et al., 2015</xref>), biological replicates were pooled and samples analysed in technical duplicate to solve certain technical issues. Specifically, due to the potential for carry-over of peptides between adjacent injections of different IP samples (even with two washes between each sample), it was necessary to use consistency of detection of prey as a measure of confidence in bait-prey interaction. To electronically filter out carry-over contaminants, an entropy score (described in ‘Data analysis’ in Materials and methods) compared the number of peptide-spectrum matches (PSM) between replicate injections and eliminated prey that were not detected consistently. It was therefore important that replicate injection material was as similar as possible to ensure that this filter was efficacious (see also Materials and methods). The CompPass algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huttlin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sowa et al., 2009</xref>) was developed based on this specific protocol. To gain a measure of variability between biological replicate samples, six IP-MS experiments were repeated with independent analysis of each biological replicate. In this figure, PSM are shown for HCIPs predicted by the interactome for each of the baits. For example, the interactome predicted four HCIPs for RL1: CUL4A, CUL4B, DDA1 and RL1 itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2, Supplementary File 2B</xref>).

Interactome data confirmed that UL87 interacted with UL79, UL91 and UL95 but did not detect an interaction with UL92.

Additionally, UL25 interacted with two other human proteins and the viral tegument protein UL26.

Using three orthogonal proteomic/transcriptomic screens to quantify protein degradation, 133 proteins were shown to be degraded in the proteasome or lysosome during early phase infection, which were enriched in novel antiviral restriction factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nightingale et al., 2018</xref>). To facilitate the mapping of viral gene functions, a final screen employed a panel of HCMV mutants, each deleted in contiguous gene blocks dispensable for virus replication in vitro. However, this screen did not confidently identify the genetic loci that targeted 121/133 degraded proteins. Furthermore, even for 12/133 confidently identified loci, characterization of which individual viral genes degraded cellular targets often proved arduous. For example, to identify UL145 as the gene within the UL133-UL150 block that targeted HLTF to the proteasome, 19 single viral gene deletion mutants required testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nightingale et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Interactome data revealed viral baits for 31/133 degraded prey (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).

In addition to ITCH, UL42 interacted with Neural Precursor Cell Expressed, Developmentally Down-Regulated 4 (NEDD4)- family E3 ligases NEDD4 and NEDD4-like (NEDD4L), which were degraded during early HCMV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nightingale et al., 2018</xref>).

More broadly, we discovered that HCMV devotes multiple proteins to interactions with the ubiquitin conjugation pathway, with 18 viral proteins interacting with two or more E3 ligases (defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Medvar et al., 2016</xref>) and 51 viral proteins interacting with one or more E3 ligase. Details of such interactions can potentially identify viral mechanisms of cellular protein degradation. For example, UL25 interacted with the adaptor protein WD Repeat Domain 26 (WDR26), which can recruit substrates to the Cullin-4 RING ubiquitin ligase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Higa et al., 2006</xref>). UL25 interacted with UL26, which itself interacted with 9 out of 10 members of the CTLH complex, a homologue of the yeast glucose-induced degradation-deficient machinery. This complex has inherent E3 ligase activity, but so far substrates have not been well defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Francis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Salemi et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, UL26 also interacted with other ligases and scaffolds, such as Cullin three and SMAD Specific E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase 2 (SMURF2). Future work is likely to identify whether UL25 or UL26 prey are degraded, and which of these cellular pathways are employed.</p><p>The present study also highlights other viral ‘hubs’ of protein degradation. For example, HCMV UL20 was previously found to be rapidly degraded, with the suggestion it may target unidentified cellular proteins to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jelcic et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we identify candidate cellular targets. For example, UL20 interacted with Interleukin 6 Signal Transducer (IL6ST), the neonatal Fc receptor (FCGRT), Ephrin A2 (EPHA2), and Interferon Gamma Receptor 1 (IFNGR1), all of which we have previously shown are rescued from degradation by application of the lysosomal protease inhibitor Leupeptin. Interestingly, all four proteins were also rescued by targeted deletion of members of the viral US12-US21 family of paralogous genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fielding et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that there may be cooperativity between the US12-US21 proteins and UL20, possibly with UL20 acting in a final common pathway.</p><p>All systematic interactomes of this type include false discoveries and fail to detect certain genuine interactions. However, a particular advantage of considering multiple interactions simultaneously in comparison to isolated IP-MS experiments is a much lower false discovery rate (estimated ~5%), as non-specific interacting proteins can be excluded because they are commonly identified in multiple different IPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sowa et al., 2009</xref>). The present study also identified a subset of VHCIPs by employing two distinct filtering strategies, which will assist future investigations based on our data. It is difficult to estimate a true false negative rate, since there is no gold standard for assessing true interactions, and the published literature also suffers from false discoveries. One factor that may contribute to missed identifications is the abundance of the prey protein. The present study clearly has the ability to identify some interacting proteins present at low cellular abundance, exemplified by identification of the interaction between US10 and LRFN3. LRFN3 was below the limit of detection in two unbiased quantitative proteomic studies of &gt;8000 proteins from whole cell lysates of HFFFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref>). However, 36% of previously described interactions that were not identified in the present study were also unquantified in whole cell lysates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), suggesting that protein abundance may play a significant role in interaction discovery. Furthermore, degradation of human prey proteins during HCMV infection may also impact the limit of detection by MS. For example, although RL1 interacted with the Cullin four scaffold and two associated proteins, no other high confidence RL1 prey were identified. It will therefore be important to repeat this interactome in the presence of lysosomal and proteasomal inhibition to identify such targets. Additionally, for future investigations of our data, validation of interactions in which the prey protein has low cellular abundance as indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2B</xref> may be best performed by overexpression studies as opposed to attempts to co-IP the endogenous protein.</p><p>Overexpression of each bait throughout the course of infection may have led to temporal dysregulation of the expression of other viral proteins, and may have facilitated interactions that would usually commence earlier or later than 60 hr of infection. However, as 153/153 quantified viral ORFs were expressed at 60 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weekes et al., 2014</xref>), the observed interactions should occur at this phase of infection even if either bait or prey protein or both were not maximally expressed. Stable overexpression of the viral bait might have enabled false positive interactions. However, certain proteins endogenously expressed by HCMV are already under the control of strong promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mocarski et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, the abundance of certain stably expressed proteins may actually have been lower than the abundance of the same proteins expressed during HCMV infection. From our IBAQ analysis of host and viral protein abundance averaged across 24, 48 and 72 hr of HCMV infection, the most abundant viral protein (UL83) was expressed ~2.4 fold more than the most abundant host protein (Galectin-1), and the least abundant viral protein ~62 fold more than the least abundant host protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref>), suggesting that the range of expression of viral proteins was already shifted towards the higher end of host protein expression. Prior human interactome studies have found no correlation between bait protein expression and the number of HCIPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sowa et al., 2009</xref>). Alternative strategies to conduct an interactome study would also suffer from potential confounding issues. For example, introduction of a tag into the viral genome prior to or after each coding sequence may facilitate expression of the bait at the same time and level as during infection with unmodified virus. However, due to the occurrence of polycistronic transcription of viral genes and overlapping viral ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>), introduction of a tag may disrupt expression of neighbouring genes.</p><p>A large number of noncanonical ORFs were identified by ribosome profiling as potentially being translated (RP-ORFs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>), and 13 novel ORFs from a six-frame translation of the HCMV genome sequence were recognised as being represented in MS data (6FT-ORFs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nightingale et al., 2018</xref>). However, these studies produced no evidence that any of these ORFs encode functional proteins. The present study identified three RP-ORFs and 2/13 6FT-ORFs as interactors of canonical HCMV proteins, and identified seven additional interacting 6FT-ORFs for the first time. There is thus a case for functional investigations of a modest number of additional ORFs, and initial prediction of these functions can be achieved by interaction analysis. For example, although the precise function of ORFL147C remains to be determined, we validated interactions with proteins involved in mRNA splicing including MBNL1 and CELF1. Other interactors with roles in RNA binding, such as Ribonucleotide PTB-binding 1 (RAVER1) modulates alternative splicing events. Spliced transcripts have long been recognized from HCMV at all times post infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rawlinson and Barrell, 1993</xref>), and more recently up to 100 splice junctions have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balázs et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gatherer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Only three drugs are currently available to treat HCMV infection, and all suffer from significant side effects and the threat of the development of resistance. In the context of the increasing frequency of transplantation, innovative therapeutic strategies are required. The identification of key interactions in virus-virus or virus-host protein complexes may be important in this regard, since small molecule inhibitors may be able to disrupt these interactions or restore endogenous antiviral restriction by preventing host protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nathans et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pery et al., 2015</xref>). To identify bait-prey pairs amenable to straightforward therapeutic interruption, it is desirable to identify factors targeted by a single viral protein, for example members of the CNOT complex by UL72. In addition to the interaction between UL72 and individual CNOT members, CNOT effector function could also be an antiviral target, for example employing inhibitors of the CNOT7 deadenylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maryati et al., 2014</xref>). Ideally, similar interactions involving several distinct pathways might be targeted simultaneously to inhibit viral replication in a way that is refractory to resistance. As an additional strategy, the recent identification of putative ligands for the viral GPCRs may facilitate approaches to targeting cytotoxins exclusively to infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krishna et al., 2017</xref>). These considerations illustrate the potential of the interactome data in the present study for identifying biologically important protein-protein interactions and developing antiviral therapies based on their disruption.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (HCMV)</td><td valign="top">HCMV Merlin</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stanton et al., 2010</xref></td><td valign="top">RCMV1111</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (HCMV)</td><td valign="top">HCMV Merlin UL36-GFP deltaORFL147C</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">RCMV2697</td><td valign="top">Available from Dr Michael Weekes’ lab, University of Cambridge</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (HCMV)</td><td valign="top">HCMV Merlin UL36-GFP</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nightingale et al., 2018</xref></td><td valign="top">RCMV2582</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>E. coli</italic>.

A second control vector coding for GFP was cloned from the adenoviral template library as described above. Neither the ‘GAW Control’ nor GFP were tagged with V5.</p><p>For HA-tagged human genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), primers were designed to recognise the 3’ end and 5’ end of each gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1F</xref>). In addition to the gene-specific sequence, the reverse primer also contained a 6 bp linker region, followed by the coding sequence for an HA tag and a stop codon. Both primers had flanking Gateway attB sequences.</p><p>PCR employed PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA polymerase (Agilent). Constructs were subsequently cloned into the pDONR223 entry vector, then into the lentiviral destination vector pHAGE-pSFFV using the Gateway system (Thermo Scientific). pHAGE-pSFFV has a spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) promoter replacing the HCMV promoter in pHAGE-pCMV to prevent promoter inactivation during HCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nightingale et al., 2018</xref>). For UL48, which is 6.7 kbp long, it was not possible to express the whole construct via lentiviral transduction alone, probably due to inefficient transduction. UL48 contains a predicted α-helix from residues 540–1500, but no predicted secondary structure between residues 1501–1509. The gene was therefore divided into two segments, one of 4.5 kbp (1–1504 aa) terminating in a stop codon, and one of 2.2 kbp (1505–2241 aa), with an additional start codon. Both segments were stably expressed in different cell lines, and HCMV-infected cellular lysates were combined prior to IP. Full sequencing of all genes was conducted in the pDONR223 vector using standard primers and additional internal primers as required (Key Resources Table). All pHAGE-pSFFV vectors underwent sequencing of the first ~700 nucleotides from the 3’ end of the SFFV promoter to verify that the viral construct had recombined correctly.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Stable cell line production</title><p>Lentiviral particles were generated through transfection of HEK293T cells with the lentiviral transfer vector and four helper plasmids (VSVG, TAT1B, MGPM2, CMV-Rev1B), using TransIT-293 transfection reagent (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nightingale et al., 2018</xref>). Viral supernatant was harvested 48 hr post-transfection and cell debris was removed with a 0.22 μm filter. To facilitate stable, constitutive expression of the viral transgene, target cells were transduced for 48 hr and then subjected to antibiotic selection for two weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunoblotting to confirm viral bait expression</title><p>Lysates for each HFFF-TERT cell line expressing a viral bait were tested for transgene expression by IB for the V5 tag. Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling) containing Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 10 min. Protein concentration was measured by BCA (Pierce) using the manufacturer’s protocol. Lysates were reduced with 6X Protein Loading Dye (375 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 12% w/v sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 30% v/v glycerol, 0.6 M dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.06% w/v bromophenol blue) for 5 min at 95°C. 20 μg of protein for each sample was separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using 4–15% TGX Precast Protein Gels (Bio-rad), then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes using Trans-Blot Systems (Bio-rad). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-V5 (MA5-15253, Thermo) and anti-Calnexin (CANX, LS-B6881, LifeSpan BioSciences). Secondary antibodies were IRDye 680RD goat anti-rabbit (926–68071, LI-COR) and IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse (926–32210, LI-COR). Fluorescent signals were detected using a LI-COR Odyssey, and images were processed using Image Studio Lite (LI-COR).</p><p>Where viral baits could not be detected by IB, IP-MS was used with uninfected cellular lysates as described below in ‘IP and protein digestion for proteomic experiments’.

Primers targeting HCMV genes or GAPDH (as an internal control) are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1E</xref>. The PCR program started with activation at 95°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 5 s and annealing/extension at 60°C for 30 s. The amplification products were then separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified (QIAquick Gel Extraction, Qiagen) and sequenced to confirm viral bait expression. For UL146 and UL148D, this procedure failed to generate sequenceable amplicons, and UL136 failed to generate any PCR product despite the use of primers that recognized both a short and full-sized amplicon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1E</xref>). For UL146 and UL148D, whole gene amplicons (189–363 bp) were generated by PCR with PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA Polymerase (Agilent), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Sequencing of the amplified product confirmed expression of the correct gene in each case.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Virus infections for IP-MS proteomic experiments</title><p>Each batch of viral infections included eight cell lines stably expressing different viral baits in duplicate. For each cell line, 6 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were plated in DMEM/FBS/PS in each of two 150 cm<sup>2</sup> dishes.

After 24 hr, the medium was changed to DMEM containing the requisite volume of HCMV strain Merlin stock to achieve MOI 2.

For soluble and single-pass transmembrane (TM) baits, cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% v/v NP40, 1 mM DTT and Roche protease inhibitor cocktail. Baits with two or more TM domains were solubilized in 1% w/v digitonin (Merck Millipore) in TBS (Sigma) and Roche protease inhibitor cocktail. Transmembrane predictions were derived from Uniprot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org">www.uniprot.org</ext-link>) for canonical HCMV proteins, and generated using TMHMM for the two novel proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krogh et al., 2001</xref>). Samples were tumbled for 15 min at 4°C and then centrifuged at 16,100 g for 15 min at 4°C. Lysates were then clarified by filtration through a 0.7 µm filter and incubated for 3 hr with immobilised mouse monoclonal anti-V5 agarose resin (Sigma). Duplicate samples were combined for resin washes. Samples lysed in NP40-containing buffer were washed seven times with lysis buffer, followed by seven PBS pH 7.4 washes. Samples lysed in digitonin-containing buffer were washed once with lysis buffer, twice with 0.2% (w/v) digitonin in TBS and then once with TBS. Subsequently, proteins bound to the anti-V5 resin were eluted twice by adding 200 µl of 250 μg/ml V5 peptide (Alpha Diagnostic International) in PBS at 37°C for 30 min with agitation. Finally, proteins were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), washed once with 10% TCA, washed three times with cold acetone and dried to completion using a centrifugal evaporator. Samples were resuspended in digestion buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 10% acetonitrile (AcN), 1 mM DTT, 10 ug/ml Trypsin) and incubated overnight at 37°C with agitation. The reaction was quenched with 50% formic acid (FA), subjected to C18 solid-phase extraction, and vacuum-centrifuged to complete dryness. Samples were reconstituted in 4% acetonitrile/5% formic acid and divided into technical duplicates prior to LC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Lumos. To minimise variability in sample preparation, all samples were lysed with aliquots from the same batch of lysis buffer. Similarly, several batches of the anti-V5 agarose resin used for immunoprecipitation were pooled and this pool was used for all samples. In addition, all V5 peptide used for protein elution was derived from the same manufacturer’s batch, and all protein digests were performed with aliquots from the same stock of digestion buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>LC-MS/MS for IP-MS experiments</title><p>Peptides for each sample were analysed in technical duplicate, with the run order reversed from one batch of replicate analyses to the next to ensure that any carry-over was different in each case. Two washes were used between each sample to further minimise carry-over (i.e. Run 1: Sample A, wash, wash, Sample B, wash, wash, Sample C…; Run 2: …Sample C, wash, wash, Sample B, wash, wash, Sample A). Individual batches included 16–22 samples. To ensure consistent performance by the mass spectrometer between batches, an identical aliquot of a control IP of uninfected cells stably expressing the viral UL123 gene with a C-terminal V5 tag was included with each batch. The number of peptides in total, from the bait and from known UL123 prey were very similar between batches.</p><p>The major reason for pooling the biological replicates and analysing samples in technical duplicate was to solve certain technical issues. Specifically, due to the potential for carry-over of peptides between adjacent injections of different IP samples, it was necessary to use consistency of detection of prey as a measure of confidence in bait-prey interaction. To electronically filter out carry-over contaminants, an entropy score (described below in ‘Data analysis’) compared the number of peptide-spectrum matches (PSM) between technical replicate injections and eliminated prey that were not detected consistently. In addition, this form of replicate analysis also enabled false positive interactions to be minimised since the same random incorrect interaction was unlikely to appear twice in two different runs. It was therefore important that replicate injection material was as similar as possible to ensure that this filter was efficacious. These issues are well understood and examined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huttlin et al. (2015)</xref>; the CompPass algorithm (described below) was developed based on this specific protocol.</p><p>To directly examine biological variability, six of the IP-MS experiments were re-run, with independent analysis of each replicate.

ORFs from the six-frame translation (6FT-ORFs) were named as follows: 6FT_Frame_ORFnumber_length, where Frame is numbered 1–6, and length is in amino acid residues. The combined database was concatenated with a reverse database composed of all protein sequences in reversed order. Searches were performed using a 20 ppm precursor ion tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haas et al., 2006</xref>). Product ion tolerance was set to 0.03 Th. Oxidation of methionine residues (15.99492 Da) was set as a variable modification.

Peptide spectral matches (PSMs) were filtered to an initial peptide-level false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% with subsequent filtering to attain a final protein-level FDR of 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). PSM filtering was performed using linear discriminant analysis as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huttlin et al., 2010</xref>). Filtering was implemented in R using the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) function in the package MASS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/</ext-link>). This distinguishes correct from incorrect peptide identifications in a manner analogous to the widely used Percolator algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Käll et al., 2007</xref>), although employing a distinct machine-learning algorithm. The following parameters were considered: XCorr, ΔCn, missed cleavages, peptide length, charge state, and precursor mass accuracy. Peptides shorter than seven amino acids in length or with XCorr less than 1.0 were excluded prior to LDA filtering. Peptides were then assembled into proteins and the resulting protein IDs were scored probalistically and filtered to a 1% protein-level FDR.</p><p>For MS3-based TMT, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nightingale et al., 2018</xref>), TMT tags on lysine residues and peptide N termini (229.162932 Da) and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (57.02146 Da) were included as static modifications. Proteins were quantified by summing TMT reporter ion counts across all matching peptide-spectral matches using'MassPike’, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McAlister et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, a 0.003 Th window around the theoretical m/z of each reporter ion (126, 127 n, 128 n) was scanned for ions, and the maximum intensity nearest to the theoretical m/z was used. An isolation specificity filter with a cutoff of 50% was employed to minimise peptide co-isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McAlister et al., 2014</xref>). Peptide-spectral matches with poor quality MS3 spectra (more than 3 TMT channels missing and/or a combined S:N ratio of less than 100 across all TMT reporter ions) or no MS3 spectra at all were excluded from quantitation. Peptides meeting the stated criteria for reliable quantitation were then summed by parent protein, in effect weighting the contributions of individual peptides to the total protein signal based on their individual TMT reporter ion yields. Protein quantitation values were exported for further analysis in Excel.</p><p>For protein quantitation, reverse and contaminant proteins were removed, then each reporter ion channel was summed across all quantified proteins and normalised assuming equal protein loading across all channels. For further analysis and display in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, fractional TMT signals were used (i.e. reporting the fraction of maximal signal observed for each protein in each TMT channel, rather than the absolute normalised signal intensity).

Peptides within replicates were reassembled into proteins following the principles of parsimony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huttlin et al., 2010</xref>). Where all PSMs from a given HCMV protein could be explained either by a canonical gene or a non-canonical ORF, the canonical gene was picked in preference. In four cases (UL24/ORFL71C_(UL24), UL31/ORFL87W_(UL31), UL150A/ORFL321W, UL44/ORFL112C_(UL44)), PSMs assigned to a non-canonical ORF were a mixture of peptides from the canonical protein and the ORF. This occurred where the ORF was a 5’-terminal extension of the canonical protein (thus meaning that the smallest set of proteins necessary to account for all observed peptides included the ORFs alone). In these cases, the peptides corresponding to the canonical protein were separated from those unique to the ORF, generating two separate entries.</p><p>CompPASS scoring was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huttlin et al., 2015</xref>), in two analyses that were subsequently combined, one for NP40-based IPs and the other for digitonin IPs. These data were treated separately to better model detergent-specific differences in IP-MS background. Data reported for each protein in every IP in the dataset include: (a) the number of peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) averaged between technical replicates; (b) an entropy score, which compares the number of PSM between replicates to eliminate proteins that are not detected consistently; (c) a z-score, calculated in comparison to the average and standard deviation of PSMs observed across all IPs; and (d) an NWD score, which reflects (i) how frequently this protein was detected and (ii) whether it was detected reproducibly. NWD scores were calculated as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrends et al. (2010)</xref> using the fraction of runs in which a protein was observed, the observed number of PSMs, the average and standard deviation of PSMs observed for that protein across all IPs, and the number of replicates (1 or 2) containing the protein of interest. NWD scores were normalised so that the top 2% earned scores ≥ 1.0. For NP40-based IPs, the top 2% of z-scores were &gt;6.676, and for digitonin-based IPs they were &gt;4.329.</p><p>As the set of digitonin-based IPs was necessarily smaller than the set of NP40-based IPs (18 compared to 153 viral genes examined respectively), additional control IPs were included. Biological duplicates of cells transduced with empty vector controls (‘GAW control’), and biological duplicates of cells transduced with a vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) were included in the digitonin set. A single replicate of the GAW control was included in the NP40 set. These controls had the effect of increasing the number of IPs that identified non-specific interacting proteins, thus decreasing NWD and z-scores for these proteins. Mass spectrometry RAW files from control UL123 IPs included to ensure batch-to-batch consistency were not included in the final data analysis, to avoid modification of NWD and z-scores for the infected UL123-expressing sample.</p><p>Following CompPASS analysis, a series of filters were applied to remove inconsistent and low-confidence protein identifications across all IPs and minimise both false protein identifications and associations. These included: (a) a minimum PSM score of 1.5 (i.e. a minimum of 3 peptides per protein across both replicates); (b) a minimum entropy score of 0.75; (c) a top 2% NWD or z-score. Previous studies have estimated a 5% false discovery rate when employing a similar strategy with a top 2% NWD score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sowa et al., 2009</xref>). Interactions passing these criteria are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2B</xref>, and used in all subsequent analyses throughout this work. As found in prior human interactome investigations, certain known interactions fell just below the stringent top 2% NWD or z-score cutoffs. Proteins were therefore also included with top 5% NWD or z-scores (&gt;0.434 and &gt;3.688, respectively), if they had been reported to interact with the bait in a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gallegos et al., 2016</xref>). For protein UL133 (2 TM regions), an initial digitonin-based AP-MS analysis failed to generate any interactors after filtering. This IP was repeated using the NP40-based lysis buffer.</p><p>For added stringency with baits solubilised in NP40, the supervised learning algorithm CompPass Plus was employed. This identifies HCIPs whilst minimising both false positive protein IDs and background proteins as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huttlin et al., 2017</xref>). The CompPass Plus model was trained using known HCMV protein interactions drawn from BioGRID, IntAct, Uniprot, MINT, and Virus Mentha; incorrect protein IDs were modeled using the target-decoy method. Results reported from this algorithm include p(Interactor), the probability that a given prey is a specific interactor. We considered interactions that passed CompPass filters, had p(Interactor) values of &gt;0.75 from CompPass Plus and in which the prey was identified by at least two unique peptides as a VHCIP. These are also indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2B</xref>. Cytoscape ver 3.7.1 was employed to display protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>IBAQ analysis</title><p>The IBAQ method was adapted from the original description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schwanhäusser et al., 2011</xref>) for two independent whole cell analyses of wild-type (WT) HCMV strain Merlin infection at 24, 48 and 72 hr PI. These included: (a) WCL3 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weekes et al. (2014)</xref> (conditions examined were 0, 24, 48, 72, 96 hr PI with WT Merlin with or without the viral DNA synthesis inhibitor phosphonoformate); (b) proteomic series three from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fielding et al. (2017)</xref> (0, 24, 48, 72 hr PI with WT Merlin with or without the lysosomal inhibitor leupeptin, or with an HCMV recombinant having a block deletion in the US12-US21 region). The maximum MS1 precursor intensity for each quantified peptide was determined for each experiment, and a summed MS1 precursor intensity for each protein across all matching peptides was calculated. To determine the proportion of the summed intensity that arose at 24, 48 and 72 hr PI, the summed intensity was adjusted in proportion to normalised TMT values: (24 hr + 48 hr + 72 hr PI) / ∑(all quantified times or conditions). Adjusted intensities were divided by the number of theoretical tryptic peptides from each protein between 7 and 30 amino acid residues in length to give an estimated IBAQ value. The same calculation was used to estimate IBAQ abundances for viral proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>, columns C-E) and human proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref> columns E-G). Viral and human IBAQ values in these columns can be directly compared to examine the relative abundances of HCMV and host proteins.</p><p>Where PSMs had been assigned to a non-canonical viral ORF but were redundant to a canonical viral protein, peptides corresponding to the canonical protein were separated from those unique to the ORF, generating two separate entries as described in ‘Interactor Identification with CompPASS’. For the non-canonical ORF, the number of theoretical peptides from the non-canonical protein fragment were used in the IBAQ calculation.</p><p>Values were separately normalised for HCMV and human proteins by the sum of all IBAQ values within each experiment, and average and range of the normalised values calculated and plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref> columns F-I, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref> columns H-K).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Interaction database comparisons</title><p>For purposes of comparison, lists of physical interactions between viral proteins and human proteins were downloaded in October 2018 from: BioGRID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chatr-Aryamontri et al., 2013</xref>), IntAct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Orchard et al., 2014</xref>), Uniprot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org">www.uniprot.org</ext-link>), MINT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Licata et al., 2012</xref>), and Virus Mentha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calderone et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Domain association analysis</title><p>Domain enrichments were calculated by mapping Pfam domains drawn from Uniprot onto human and HCMV amino acid sequences.

immunoprecipitation-based mass spectrometry, revealing an extensive network of over 3400 high confidence interacting proteins and over 150 virus-virus protein interactions after IP mass spec experiments with 170 stable human cell lines derived from immortalized primary human fetal foreskin fibroblasts, each expressing a single V5 tagged-HCMV protein. The methods, data and results presented in the manuscript, are of high quality and of high value to people in the virology field and biologists overall. All comments raised by the reviewers have been answered in detail. This work provides a tremendous and comprehensive resource for future studies of this and related pathogens.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Human cytomegalovirus interactome analysis identifies degradation hubs, domain associations and viral protein functions&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Piet Maes as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Moriah L Szpara.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Luis Nobre and colleagues used a combination of stable cell lines expressing tagged viral proteins, native infection by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and immunoprecipitation (IP)-based mass spectrometry (MS) to collect data on human and viral proteins interacting with ~160 HCMV proteins. Peptides detected by IP-MS were subjected to extensive bioinformatics analyses thereafter, to detect high-confidence interactions, and to provide insights into the pathways and cellular programs impacted by those interactions. A small number of &quot;wet bench&quot; follow-up analyses provided confidence in the IP-MS interactions detected, and demonstrates an approach for further studies of specific interactions and pathways. The data quality is excellent, as is the subsequent analysis provided by the authors. The work provides a tremendous and comprehensive resource for future studies of this and related pathogens.</p><p>The reviewers raise a number of concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted. Some of the required revisions will likely require further experimentation within the framework of the presented study and used techniques.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers raised concerns about the approach described wherein the authors use pooled biological replicates for mass spec. Is averaging out biological variability a good approach? Pooling and then splitting would essentially average out the data. The only real significance in doing that approach would be to assess the instrument's reliability, which is not a major problem with mass spec, especially not with the newer instruments. Treating the biological replicates separately, running each one independently on the mass spec. would be better. This way, the reproducibility of the experiments for each bait is truly measured. If possible, we would recommend to rerun a small subset of the IP-MS/MS experiments, analysing each replicate independently, to demonstrate the robustness, reproducibility and reliability of the experiments.</p><p>2) Is the SFFV promoter used constitutive, and/or driving higher than usual expression? If so, can the authors comment on the potential implications of this for their data? The Discussion includes mention of the potential for missed interactions due to low levels of prey proteins. However the over-abundance, and/or temporal dysregulation of viral protein expression, might also be enabling interactions that wouldn't normally take place at that time point in infection. To what degree is that an issue? While this issue is not large enough to undercut the high value of the manuscript, it likely belongs in the Discussion.</p><p>3) The authors explain that HCMV has 5 distinct temporal gene expression classes, spanning over 96 hours post-infection, while the interactome described was determine at 60 hours post-infection. The authors make it clear why 60 hours post-infection was selected, but I would like to hear more from the authors about how the timing of viral protein expression may influence the interactome so that the data could be put into a more natural biological context. It would be very useful and potentially insightful to show what interactions viral proteins have as a function of time. For example, (a) are there major differences in the human protein networks interacting with viral proteins from each Tp stage, (b) does the nature of the human protein networks found to interact with proteins from each Tp stage help explain the viral life cycle, (c) how are the virus-virus protein interactions found to evolve as a function of the Tp stage – are they any of these interactions that do not make temporal sense?</p><p>4) I understand why the authors have attempted to validate protein-protein interactions identified by the IP-MS experiments, but I have concerns about the manner in which the experiments were performed. In my opinion, Co-IP Western blots to validate selected interactions should be done either using non-tagged proteins (if possible) or done using either a different epitope tag or placing the original tag at the opposite end of the bait protein. Otherwise, using the same tagged bait construct to &quot;validate&quot; what was already seen in the IP-MS experiments appears redundant, unnecessary, and does not address if the original interaction observed could have been due to an artefact of the system. The mass spec is perhaps the best way to determine if a protein is present and is often times more quantitative and sensitive than a Western blot, so essentially re-doing to IP-MS using an overexpressed, tagged prey protein, in my opinion, doesn't offer much validation. I understand that it may not be possible to re-do all of the validation experiments, but I would like to see, at least for the most important interactions the authors seek to validate, that these experiments be repeated using either a different tag on the bait or by using the V5 tag on the N-terminus instead.</p><p>5) With regards to the UL42 protein interactions with various E3's and the experiments shown to demonstrate that UL42 expression results in a decrease in NEDD4 protein levels, I have a couple of questions/comments. First, the authors show data that NEDD4 levels are decreased to a new steady state by 24 hours post-infection. Could the authors please comment on when UL42 is normally expressed after HCMV infection to clarify if normal UL42 expression correlates with the decrease in NEDD4 levels? My question is the same regarding NEDD4L as well. Second, the authors offer no explanation for how UL42 alters NEDD4 and NEDD4L levels – is this through the UPS, the lysosome, etc.? Adding some simple additional experiments could help shed some light on this (for example, does blocking the proteasome rescue NEDD4/4L loss?).</p><p>6) In the ORFL147C experiments, the authors suggest that the impairment to viral replication when ORFL147C is mutated could be due to its interaction with host cell splicing or transcriptional mechanisms. From the data shown, it appears that loss of ORFL147C (I would have liked to have a seen a WB, if possible, to show that ORFL147C is in fact no longer expressed) does decrease viral replication, but it is not at all clear if that has anything to do with the suggested host cell splicing or transcriptional mechanisms. In fact, given the large HCIP network for ORFL147C, there are a number of potential reasons for this phenotype. I agree that this protein appears to significantly effect viral replication, but I feel that the authors should specifically say that the mechanism of how ORFL147C plays a role in HMCV replication remains unknown.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49894.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers raised concerns about the approach described wherein the authors use pooled biological replicates for mass spec.

Rather, there were two distinct rationales:</p><p>i) To solve specific technical issues of (a) the potential for carry-over of peptides between adjacent injections of different IP samples to the mass spectrometer and (b) to use consistency of detection of prey as a measure of confidence in bait-prey interaction (which is encapsulated in the ‘entropy’ score). Both of these issues are well understood and examined in Huttlin et al., 2015; the CompPass algorithm was developed with this specific protocol in mind. In our manuscript, carry-over was minimised by interspersing two ‘wash’ injections between adjacent samples, however particularly abundant peptide species in a given sample nevertheless had the potential to contaminate subsequent injections. The run order was therefore reversed from one batch of replicate analyses to the next to ensure that any carry-over was different in each case (i.e. Run 1: Sample A, wash, wash, Sample B, wash, wash, Sample C…; Run 2: …Sample C, wash, wash, Sample B, wash, wash, Sample A). To electronically filter out carry-over contaminants, the entropy score compared the number of peptide-spectrum matches (PSM) between technical replicate injections and eliminated prey that were not detected consistently. In addition, this form of replicate analysis also enabled false positive interactions to be minimised since the same random incorrect ID was unlikely to appear twice in two different runs. It was therefore important that replicate injection material was as similar as possible to ensure this filter was efficacious.</p><p>ii) To solve biochemical issues of sufficiency of the amount of injected material to ensure that enough was present for MS analysis after all purification steps had been completed. If true biological replicates had been used, technical replicates of each biological replicate would also have been required for the entropy score, which would have doubled the required MS instrument time (already 472 hours of injection plus 531 hours of washes) and doubled the required amount of virus.</p><p>We have added detail above to both the Materials and methods section and Figure 1—figure supplement 1D legend. To directly examine biological variability, we have re-run six of the IP-MS experiments as suggested, with independent analysis of each replicate. We found that there was very good correlation between the number of PSM from each identified prey protein between biological replicates, and have added this data to Figure 1—figure supplement 1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is the SFFV promoter used constitutive, and/or driving higher than usual expression? If so, can the authors comment on the potential implications of this for their data? The Discussion includes mention of the potential for missed interactions due to low levels of prey proteins. However the over-abundance, and/or temporal dysregulation of viral protein expression, might also be enabling interactions that wouldn't normally take place at that time point in infection. To what degree is that an issue? While this issue is not large enough to undercut the high value of the manuscript, it likely belongs in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The SFFV promoter used did facilitate constitutive expression of the viral transgene, and we have modified the text in the Materials and methods section to make this explicitly clear. We agree that a potential caveat of the approach we employed is enabling interactions that might not usually take place at 60 h of infection. However, we attempted to minimise this possibility by selecting a time-point of infection at which we have good data suggesting every viral protein is expressed at some level, from our previous proteomic studies (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E). Temporal dysregulation of viral protein expression secondary to stable bait expression throughout the course of infection might also lead to observation of interactions at 60 h of infection that usually occurred at a different infection time point. These interactions would nevertheless be anticipated to take place at some point during viral infection, as their ‘survival’ as high-confidence interacting proteins after filtering is strongly suggestive of a genuine interaction.</p><p>Stable overexpression of the viral bait might similarly enable false interactions. However, for viral interactomes, certain proteins that are endogenously expressed by the virus (as opposed to the host) are already under the control of strong promoters (for example, Mocarski et al., 2013). Indeed, some viral bait proteins expressed using the lentiviral system may actually be expressed at a lower level in comparison to during HCMV infection. From our IBAQ analysis of host and viral protein abundance averaged across 24, 48 and 72 h of HCMV infection, the most abundant viral protein (UL83) was expressed at an ~2.4-fold greater level than the most abundant host protein (Galectin-1), and the least abundant viral protein at a ~62-fold greater level than the least abundant host protein (Supplementary file 1A and 1C) suggesting that the range of expression of viral proteins was already shifted towards the higher end of host protein expression.</p><p>Previous interactome studies have found no correlation between bait protein expression and the number of HCIP. For example, Sowa et al., 2009 found “Flag-HA-Dub expression varied over a wide range, yet no correlation was observed between Dub protein levels and their number of HCIPs …. (a correlation would be expected if overexpression consistently led to increases in non-physiological interactions)”.</p><p>Alternative strategies to conduct an interactome study would also suffer from potential confounding issues, albeit different ones. For example, introduction of a tag into the viral genome prior to or after each coding sequence may facilitate expression of the bait at the same time and level as during infection with unmodified virus. However, due to the frequent occurrence of polycistronic transcripts and overlapping ORFs (Stern-Ginossar, 2012), introduction of a tag may disrupt expression of neighbouring genes.</p><p>We have modified the Discussion to reflect these points:</p><p>“Overexpression of each bait throughout the course of infection may have led to temporal dysregulation of the expression of other viral proteins, and may have facilitated interactions that would usually commence earlier or later than 60 h of infection. […] However, due to the occurrence of polycistronic transcription of viral genes and overlapping viral ORFs (Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012), introduction of a tag may disrupt expression of neighbouring genes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors explain that HCMV has 5 distinct temporal gene expression classes, spanning over 96 hours post-infection, while the interactome described was determine at 60 hours post-infection.

We have now conducted DAVID enrichment analysis of human HCIPs for each of the five Tp classes of viral protein expression, in comparison to all HCIPs for the whole interactome. Interestingly, there is a clear relation to functions required at different stages of the viral life-cycle. For example, Tp1 and Tp2 protein HCIPs are enriched in NuRD complex members, proteins involved in histone deacetylation and proteins with SANT domains (which function in chromatin remodelling). Tp3 HCIPs are enriched in functions required for viral genomic replication and immune evasion, whilst Tp5 HCIPs are enriched in functions directed at intracellular trafficking and secretion. Furthermore, we have analysed viral HCIPs to determine whether viral-viral protein-protein interactions predominantly derive from the same Tp class. Two patterns emerged – (a) interaction of viral proteins within the same temporal class, or between adjacent classes; (b) interaction of proteins from the largest class (Tp5) with members of all of the different classes of viral protein. For example, Tp1 and Tp2 class proteins UL29 and UL38 interacted, as previously reported (Supplementary file 3, Figure 2). Tp1-class tegument proteins US23 and US24 interacted. The majority of Tp5 interactions were with other Tp5 proteins, 15/37 of which were tegument-tegument, capsid-capsid or tegument-capsid protein interactions (new Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, new Supplementary file 4C). Certain interactions between proteins in different temporal classes have also been reported; for example, between the Tp5 DNA polymerase accessory protein UL44 and Tp2 DNA polymerase UL54. Clearly, other novel interactions additionally exist between quite distinctly expressed proteins, for example between the functionally unknown Tp2-class membrane protein UL14 and two Tp5-class proteins: membrane protein UL121 and envelope glycoprotein UL4. We have added all of this data to a new supplementary figure, Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-B and Supplementary file 4C-D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I understand why the authors have attempted to validate protein-protein interactions identified by the IP-MS experiments, but I have concerns about the manner in which the experiments were performed.

The V5 tag itself is only 14aa long and as such is unlikely to provide substantial steric hindrance to protein-protein interactions, although clearly has the potential to inhibit interactions involving the tagged bait C-terminus. To validate some of our most important interactions as requested, we have repeated a subset of co-IP immunoblots using N-terminally V5-tagged baits for UL42 and UL72, and have included the UL42 data in Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Unfortunately, in the time available for revisions, N-terminally tagged UL72 itself could not be detected by immunoblot either in the input or IP samples. Nevertheless, CNOT2 was still detected in the UL72 IP (but not either control), suggesting that V5-UL72 was expressed albeit at low level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, representative of n=2 experiments). For this reason, we have not included the figure in the manuscript. Of note, we have already validated interaction of UL72-V5 both with CNOT2-HA, CNOT7-HA and both endogenously-expressed CNOT proteins, further increasing confidence in these observations (Figures 3A-B).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49894-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) With regards to the UL42 protein interactions with various E3's and the experiments shown to demonstrate that UL42 expression results in a decrease in NEDD4 protein levels, I have a couple of questions/comments.

Adding some simple additional experiments could help shed some light on this (for example, does blocking the proteasome rescue NEDD4/4L loss?).</p></disp-quote><p>We have not been able to detect UL42 protein in any of our published or unpublished proteomic experiments, likely at least partly due to the presence of only a single lysine, and only five arginine residues in the 125 amino acid protein. We did not quantify UL42 transcript in our previous RNAseq experiment during HCMV infection (Nightingale et al., 2018). No anti-UL42 antibody is commercially available. However, UL42 transcript was detected by Stern-Ginossar et al. in their 2012 Science manuscript (data added to Figure 5C). Although expression of this transcript peaked at 72 h of infection, it was nevertheless clearly detectable at 5 and 24 h post infection suggesting that UL42 protein is likely to be expressed contemporaneously with degradation of NEDD4 and NEDD4L.</p><p>Expression of NEDD4 and NEDD4L were rescued by application of both MG132 and Leupeptin during HCMV infection, as we show in Figure 5B. MG132 is known to affect lysosomal cathepsins in addition to the proteasome (Wiertz et al., 1996), and leupeptin is a naturally occurring protease inhibitor that can inhibit some proteasomal proteases in addition to the lysosome, making it difficult to definitively characterise the pathway of degradation from this data.</p><p>Unfortunately in the time available for revisions, we were unable to rescue expression of either NEDD4-HA or NEDD4L-HA with inhibitors of the proteasome or lysosome, in HFFF-TERTs stably expressing UL42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>, representative of n=4 experiments). This was despite optimisation both of timing of the analysis and inhibitor concentration.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49894-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>This finding is consistent with results from Koshizuka et al., 2016, who characterised the degradation of ITCH by UL42 and found “In order to elucidate the stability of UL42, recombinant HCMV-infected cells were treated with chloroquine and MG132. HA-UL42 was increased in the presence of chloroquine, a lysosome inhibitor, but not in the presence of MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor, indicating that UL42 was degraded by the lysosome (Figure 6C). However, the band pattern of Itch was not significantly changed even in the presence of the inhibitors’. We have therefore added to the Results section “The route of degradation of each of the UL42 targets requires further characterisation. MG132 and leupeptin both inhibited degradation of each protein (Figure 5B), which may correspond to the known effects of MG132 on lysosomal cathepsins in addition to the proteasome (Wiertz et al., 1996), or effects of leupeptin on certain proteasomal proteases in addition to lysosomal proteases.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the ORFL147C experiments, the authors suggest that the impairment to viral replication when ORFL147C is mutated could be due to its interaction with host cell splicing or transcriptional mechanisms.

No ORFL147C antibody is available, however we are routinely able to detect this protein using proteomic approaches. We conducted a 3-plex tandem mass tag-based experiment comparing infection with mock, wild-type virus or the ORFL147C deletion mutant (48 h, MOI = 2). ORFL147C was expressed at the level of noise in mock- and ORFL147C-infected cells confirming deletion of this gene in the mutant. We have added this data to Figure 6G. We have added detail as suggested to say that the mechanism of how ORFL147C plays a role in HCMV replication remains unknown.</p></body></sub-article></article>
