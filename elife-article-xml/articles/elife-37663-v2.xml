Here, we used tandem mass tag labeling coupled with mass spectrometry to reveal that changing the mRNA decay landscape, as frequently occurs during viral infection, results in subcellular redistribution of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in human cells. Accelerating Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay through expression of a gammaherpesviral endonuclease drove nuclear translocation of many RBPs, including poly(A) tail-associated proteins. Conversely, cells lacking Xrn1 exhibited changes in the localization or abundance of numerous factors linked to mRNA turnover. Using these data, we uncovered a new role for relocalized cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in repressing recruitment of TATA binding protein and RNA polymerase II to promoters. Collectively, our results show that changes in cytoplasmic mRNA decay can directly impact protein localization, providing a mechanism to connect seemingly distal stages of gene expression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37663.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The nucleus of a cell harbors DNA, which contains all information needed to build an organism. The instructions are stored as a genetic code that serves as a blueprint for making proteins – molecules that are important for almost every process in the body – and to assemble cells. But first, the code on the DNA needs to be translated with the help of a ‘middle man’, known as messenger RNA. These molecules carry information to other parts of the cell, wherever it is needed.</p><p>Messenger RNA is produced in the nucleus of a cell, and then exported into the material within a cell, called the cytoplasm, as a template to produce proteins. Once this process has finished, the template is destroyed. The rate at which the messenger RNA is made affects the flow of genetic information.</p><p>However, recent evidence suggests that the speed at which messenger RNA is destroyed in the cytoplasm can influence how much of it is made in the nucleus, i.e., if high levels of RNA are destroyed, the production is stopped. For example, it has been shown that certain viruses possess proteins that speed up the destruction of messenger RNA to gain control over the host cell.</p><p>Here, Gilbertson et al. wanted to find out more about how the breakdown of RNA can signal the nucleus to stop producing these molecules. Messenger RNAs are coated with proteins, which are released when the RNA is destroyed. To test if some of those proteins travel back to the nucleus to influence the production of messenger RNA, proteins in human cells grown in the laboratory were labeled with specific trackers. RNA destruction was induced, in a way that is similar to what happens during a virus attack. The experiments revealed that many RNA-binding proteins indeed return to the nucleus when RNA is destroyed. One of these proteins, named cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein, played a key role in transmitting the signal between the cytoplasm and the nucleus to control the production messenger RNA.</p><p>The amount of messenger RNA can change in many ways throughout the life of a cell. For example, viral infections can lower it and limit the growth and health of cells. A drop in these molecules could act as an early warning of ill health in cells and trigger responses in the nucleus. This new link between messenger RNA destruction and production may help to shed new light on how cells use different signals to control the production of their own genes while restricting pathogens from taking over. A next step will be to determine how these signals communicate with the RNA production machinery in the nucleus and how certain viruses can subvert this process to activate their own genes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA binding proteins</kwd><kwd>RNA decay</kwd><kwd>viruses</kwd><kwd>RNA Polymerase II</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA136367</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glaunsinger</surname><given-names>Britt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glaunsinger</surname><given-names>Britt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM114141</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cristea</surname><given-names>Ileana M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Messenger RNA degradation alters protein trafficking to control transcription.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>mRNA decay is a critical stage of gene expression that regulates the abundance and lifespan of cellular mRNAs. Many viruses including alpha and gammaherpesviruses, influenza A virus, and SARS coronavirus accelerate host mRNA degradation through the use of viral proteins that trigger endonucleolytic cleavage of mRNAs in the cytoplasm. Each of these viral proteins bypasses the rate-limiting deadenylation step of the basal decay pathway, resulting in cleaved mRNAs that are rapidly degraded by the major cellular 5’−3’ exonuclease Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Covarrubias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaglia et al., 2012</xref>). This process, termed ‘host shutoff’, allows viruses to rapidly restrict cellular gene expression in order to blunt immune responses and liberate resources for viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abernathy and Glaunsinger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgess and Mohr, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaglia and Glaunsinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rivas et al., 2016</xref>). Viral endonucleases have also served as tools for deciphering how cells sense and respond to large changes in mRNA abundance.</p><p>While mRNA decay is often considered the terminal stage of gene expression, the rate of mRNA decay has recently been shown to influence transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in both yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abernathy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun and Young, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haimovich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). In yeast, a buffering system exists in which Xrn1 plays a major role in connecting mRNA synthesis and decay, presumably allowing cells to maintain an appropriate overall mRNA abundance. Mammalian cells also have a mechanism to sense mRNA levels, though the pathway appears to operate differently than in yeast. Here, accelerated cytoplasmic mRNA degradation does not lead to a compensatory increase in mRNA synthesis, as might be predicted by the homeostatic model, but instead decreases cellular RNAPII promoter recruitment, thereby amplifying the restrictive gene expression environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abernathy et al., 2015</xref>). Significant transcriptional repression as measured by nascent mRNA production was reported to occur at approximately 9% of host genes, although validation experiments suggested this number is likely to be an underestimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abernathy et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The mRNA decay-transcription feedback pathway is activated in mammalian cells infected with gammaherpesviruses like Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), as well as upon expression of virally encoded mRNA endonucleases in uninfected cells. Herpesviral endonucleases, including the muSOX protein of MHV68, cleave mRNA but do not impact the abundance of noncoding RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) or III (RNAPIII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Covarrubias et al., 2011</xref>). Correspondingly, muSOX-induced mRNA decay elicits a significant decrease in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment to cellular promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abernathy et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, depletion of Xrn1 from muSOX-expressing cells prevents the ensuing RNAPII transcriptional repression. This suggests that the initial mRNA cleavage and translational inactivation are insufficient to restrict RNAPII recruitment, and that subsequent exonucleolytic degradation of the cleaved mRNA fragments is a critical signaling step.</p><p>Little is currently known about this pathway linking cytoplasmic mRNA decay to RNAPII activity in mammalian cells, including the nature of the signal that is transmitted between the two cellular compartments. An attractive hypothesis is that one or more RNA binding proteins (RBPs) differentially traffics between the cytoplasm and the nucleus when basal rates of mRNA decay are perturbed, thereby conveying global mRNA abundance information. Recent analyses indicate that mammalian cells contain hundreds of RBPs that bind polyadenylated mature mRNAs, and proteins within this group have been shown to regulate all stages of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerstberger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitchell and Parker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller-McNicoll and Neugebauer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Singh et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, RBPs frequently display nucleocytoplasmic shuttling behavior.</p><p>Here, we charted global alterations in protein localization that occur specifically in response to increased or decreased Xrn1 activity. This revealed a set of mammalian RBPs that preferentially move from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during accelerated mRNA decay, as well as components of the 5’−3’ decay machinery and other RBPs whose subcellular distribution is altered in cells lacking Xrn1. Poly(A) tail associated proteins are overrepresented among the RBPs that accumulate in the nucleus under conditions of global mRNA decay, offering an explanation for how RNAPII could be selectively sensitive to mRNA abundance. Indeed, we uncovered a new role for cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein (PABPC) in mediating mRNA decay-driven repression of RNAPII promoter recruitment. Furthermore, we show that the recruitment of TATA binding protein (TBP) to promoters is also impaired in response to PABPC nuclear translocation, indicating that cytoplasmic mRNA decay impacts early events in preinitiation complex assembly. Our results reveal how mRNA levels exert significant influence on RBP localization and suggest that select RBPs transmit mRNA abundance information from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to broadly influence gene expression, particularly under conditions of cellular stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNA binding proteins translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in cells undergoing enhanced cytoplasmic mRNA decay</title><p>To chart mRNA decay-driven movement of proteins between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, we used a quantitative liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS)-based approach. Specifically, following subcellular fractionation, proteins from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were labeled with isobaric tandem mass tags (TMT). TMT labeling enables multiplexing of up to 11 samples per run and was proven to improve the analytical power for quantitation during viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McAlister et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jean Beltran et al., 2016</xref>). We used HEK293T cells expressing the MHV68 muSOX endonuclease to create a condition of accelerated, Xrn1-dependent cytoplasmic mRNA decay. We previously demonstrated that muSOX expression in these cells activates the mRNA decay-RNAPII transcription feedback pathway similar to virally infected fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abernathy et al., 2015</xref>). Pure populations of cells expressing either WT muSOX or the catalytically dead D219A muSOX point mutant were generated using Thy1.1-based cell sorting. Here, muSOX was fused to the cell surface glycoprotein Thy1.1 with an intervening self-cleaving 2A protease, causing release of Thy1.1 from muSOX for cell surface expression and selection. Three biological replicates of control, WT, and D219A muSOX expressing cells were then separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, and trypsin-digested proteins from each fraction were differentially TMT labeled prior to LC/MS-MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37663.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RNA binding proteins are translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in cells undergoing enhanced cytoplasmic mRNA decay.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram depicting the experimental setup.

We then removed from further analysis proteins that were simultaneously increased in the cytoplasm in muSOX expressing cells to remove proteins that increase in overall abundance, as well as proteins displaying significant differences between the D219A catalytic mutant and the empty vector control. These filtering steps yielded a final list of 67 proteins that were differentially enriched in the nucleus under conditions of accelerated mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, Table S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Notably, 22 of the 67 proteins (33%) are annotated as RBPs (Pantherdb) in line with the expectation that mRNA-bound proteins in particular should be impacted during widespread mRNA degradation. In addition, 31 of the 67 proteins (46%) are listed as localized both to the cytoplasm and nucleus according to the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), supporting the idea that they are shuttling factors. As an independent validation of these results, we evaluated 12 of the top hits by western blotting of fractionated cell lysates in control or muSOX-expressing cells, 10 of which recapitulated the MS results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Proteins associated with the poly(A) tail display robust mRNA decay-dependent nuclear translocation</title><p>The poly(A) tail is a defining mRNA feature and during basal mRNA decay, deadenylation is the initiating step that licenses subsequent decapping and exonucleolytic degradation of an mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schoenberg and Maquat, 2012</xref>). Thus, the binding state of poly(A) tail associated proteins could theoretically serve as a readout to distinguish the overall abundance of mRNA over other forms of RNA in the cytoplasm. Notably, nuclear relocalization of PABPC has been observed during infection with multiple viruses that promote mRNA decay, supporting the idea that poly(A) tail associated proteins may be particularly sensitive to mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harb et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee and Glaunsinger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Piron et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Salaun et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, an overrepresentation analysis using Pantherdb revealed that poly(A) binding proteins, poly(U) binding proteins, and mRNA 3’UTR binding proteins were significantly overrepresented among the 67 differentially expressed proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>).

We confirmed that PABPC1 and LARP4 also translocate to the nucleus in NIH3T3 cells infected with WT MHV68, but not in cells infected with an MHV68 muSOX mutant virus (R443I) with impaired mRNA cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richner et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, poly(A) associated proteins preferentially move from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to muSOX-activated mRNA decay in both transiently transfected and virally infected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Nuclear translocation of RNA binding proteins is dependent on mRNA degradation by Xrn1</title><p>Xrn1 is the major 5’−3’ exonuclease in mammalian cells and is responsible for the degradation of 3’ RNA fragments generated upon cleavage by muSOX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaglia et al., 2012</xref>). In the absence of Xrn1, muSOX-induced repression of RNAPII promoter occupancy does not occur, suggesting that Xrn1 activity should be required for release and subsequent nuclear translocation of RBPs involved in this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abernathy et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore used Cas9-based genome editing to generate Xrn1 knockout clones in HEK293T cells and confirmed that muSOX expression in these cells failed to reduce RNAPII promoter occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

Importantly, this did not lead to broad changes in gene expression (see below). Given that Xrn1 is a central component of the mammalian mRNA decay machinery, only low passage versions of these cells were used to decrease the likelihood of compensatory changes occurring in other decay components. Using the same TMT-LC/MS-MS strategy described above, we analyzed nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from three biological replicates of Xrn1 knockout cells expressing muSOX or an empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

This did not appear to be the case in the TMT data, as the majority of known Xrn1 protein partners were expressed at normal levels in the absence of Xrn1. However, there was a significant increase in the cytoplasmic levels of UPF1, a mediator of nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Similarly, DNASE2, a nuclease which contributes to the degradation of DNA in dying cells, had increased cytoplasmic abundance. Secernin-2 (SCRN2), a protein involved in exocytosis, translocated to the nucleus in the absence of Xrn1. Conversely, PABPC4 levels were decreased in both compartments, and two centrosomal proteins CEP152 and CEP128 were reduced in the nucleus.</p><p>Finally, we considered the possibility that upon loss of Xrn1, cells might upregulate other components of the mRNA decay machinery. Perhaps surprisingly, out of all 5994 detected proteins, only three were significantly upregulated in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of Xrn1 knockout cells: GW182, Galectin-3, and BAG1. Among these, GW182 stands out because it is a member of the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) involved in recruitment of deadenylases to initiate degradation of target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This increase in GW182 abundance, along with the changes to DCP2, DDX6, and PABPC4, were independently validated by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To determine whether the increases in the whole cell protein abundance of GW182 and in the nuclear protein abundance in DDX6 and PATL1 occurred at the mRNA level or were a result of translational regulation, we measured steady-state mRNA expression for each of these factors by RT-qPCR. In each case, the mRNA abundance was increased in Xrn1 knockout cells compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Importantly, the increases appeared specific to these transcripts and not due to generalized mRNA abundance changes in the absence of Xrn1, as there was no significant difference in <italic>gapdh</italic> or <italic>actB</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these data suggest that there are not broad increases in cellular proteins in response to inhibition of 5’−3’ mRNA decay.

Alternatively, translocation could occur indirectly via interactions with other proteins that contain nuclear transport signals. To test for this latter possibility, we first plotted the network of known interactions among the list of proteins that relocalized in cells undergoing accelerated mRNA decay using the STRING database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). There were significantly more interactions among this set of proteins than would be predicted for a random group of proteins of similar size (p=0.0496), with many of the interactions involving PABPC. This enrichment suggests that these proteins are biologically related, confirming what was seen in the GO term analysis. We examined the relocalization mechanism for one of the PABPC interacting proteins, LARP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). We reasoned that if LARP4 relocalization involved direct interactions with the nuclear import machinery, then it should relocalize in muSOX-expressing cells in a PABPC independent manner. Conversely, if it was ‘escorted’ into the nucleus via its interaction with PABPC, then its relocalization should be blocked by PABPC depletion. Depletion of PABPC1 has been shown to lead to compensatory induction of PABPC4, which can function in a redundant manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumar and Glaunsinger, 2010</xref>). Therefore, we co-depleted both PABPC1 and PABPC4 using siRNAs. Upon co-depletion of the PABPC proteins, LARP4 no longer accumulated in the nucleus of muSOX-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, siRNA-mediated depletion of LARP4 had no effect on PABPC1 shuttling in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

In many of these cases, accelerated cytoplasmic mRNA decay initiates a widespread reduction in transcript levels, often through the engagement of the major mammalian 5’−3’ exonuclease Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Covarrubias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaglia et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to altering the translational landscape, depletion of cytoplasmic mRNA elicits changes in upstream components of the mammalian gene expression pathway, including RNAPII transcription, largely by unknown mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abernathy et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we tested the hypothesis that cellular RNA binding proteins may shift their subcellular localization in response to altered mRNA decay, thus conveying mRNA abundance information between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Quantitative proteomics was previously reported to allow the discovery of viral infection-induced protein translocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jean Beltran et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, our unbiased TMT-based proteomics approach revealed that among the total cellular protein pool, an RBP-enriched protein subset concentrates in the nucleus specifically in response to increased mRNA decay in an Xrn1 dependent manner. RBPs have critical roles in all stages of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller-McNicoll and Neugebauer, 2013</xref>), and our data further emphasize their multifunctional capacity.</p><p>We also found that RBPs are enriched in the set of proteins with altered nuclear or cytoplasmic localization in Xrn1 knockout cells. Interestingly, factors involved in decapping, the event that directly precedes Xrn1 attack during basal mRNA decay, were selectively increased in the nuclei of cells lacking Xrn1. Furthermore, we detected increased levels of the NMD factor UPF1 in the cytoplasm and overall elevated levels of GW182 in these cells. One speculative possibility is that these changes occur in response to cellular ‘reprogramming’ of the mRNA decay network, for example shifting emphasis towards 3’ end targeting mechanisms to compensate for the absence of the primary 5’ end decay mechanism. This scenario might explain the increase in GW182 levels, as it recruits the cellular deadenylase complexes PAN2-PAN3 and CCR4-NOT to mRNA targets to promote mRNA decay by Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chekulaeva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fabian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huntzinger and Izaurralde, 2011</xref>). In its absence, the increased GW182 levels may accelerate deadenylation to instead promote 3’−5’ decay. Alternatively, the RBP nuclear and/or cytoplasmic enrichment in Xrn1 knockout cells may reflect changes that occur when the cytoplasmic mRNA decay rate is reduced. The fact that we did not observe significant redistribution of the majority of Xrn1 interacting proteins argues against a model in which physical association with Xrn1 helps control decay factor protein localization.</p><p>Aside from RBPs, there was a clear overrepresentation of the OST complex, which catalyzes co-translational N-glycosylation, among the set of differentially expressed proteins in Xrn1 knockout cells. Although OST does not have established links to RNA decay or Xrn1, it has been shown to be a critical component of the replication cycle of flaviviruses such as Dengue and Zika (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marceau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Puschnik et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, these arthropod-borne flaviviruses inhibit Xrn1 activity through a subgenomic viral noncoding RNA that contains an Xrn1 blocking sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chapman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moon et al., 2012</xref>). In this context, it will be exciting to explore possible links between these two processes, especially given that small molecule OST inhibitors are now being tested for their pan-flaviviral inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Puschnik et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Among the set of proteins that translocated in cells undergoing accelerated Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay, there was a striking enrichment in factors that bind the 3’end of mRNAs. This supports the hypothesis that this class of RBPs would be significantly impacted by the mRNA abundance and availability. PABPC nuclear translocation in particular has been well documented in the context of infection with viruses that drive mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bablanian et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harb et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee and Glaunsinger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Piron et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Salaun et al., 2010</xref>), and our unbiased proteomics approach establishes it as one of the most robustly relocalized RBPs under these conditions. Several features of PABPC render it an ideal indicator of mRNA abundance. First, its association with poly(A) tails implies that depletion of mRNAs but no other type of abundant non-polyadenylated RNAs should selectively alter the level of PABPC in the RNA bound versus unbound state. Second, nuclear import of PABPC is antagonized by cytoplasmic mRNA abundance. We previously reported that PABPC harbors noncanonical NLSs within its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs); upon poly(A) binding, these elements are masked and the protein is thus retained in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>). However, release of PABPC from mRNA exposes the NLSs, enabling its interaction with importin α and its subsequent nuclear import. The observation that PABPC localization is directly influenced by mRNA abundance suggest that cells must carefully calibrate the ratio of PABPC to mRNA. Indeed, PABPC protein binds an autoregulatory A-rich sequence in the 5’UTR of its own mRNA to disrupt 40S ribosomal scanning and reduce its translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Melo Neto et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu and Bag, 1998</xref>).</p><p>When bound to poly(A) tails in the cytoplasm, PABPC contributes to mRNA stability and facilitates protein-protein interactions for efficient translation by the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgess and Gray, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fatscher et al., 2014</xref>). However, when concentrated in the nucleus, PABPC functions instead to restrict gene expression. One previously established mechanism by which gene expression is inhibited involves disruption of mRNA processing, where PABPC drives hyperadenylation of nascent mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumar and Glaunsinger, 2010</xref>). In this study, we reveal that nuclear accumulation of PABPC phenotypically mimics muSOX-dependent repression of RNAPII promoter binding; it appears necessary and sufficient to repress RNAPII promoter recruitment as a consequence of accelerated mRNA decay. Both muSOX and FLAG-PABPC1 expression target early stages of PIC assembly, as TBP and RNAPII occupancy are reduced at promoters. Interestingly, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> nuclear poly(A) binding protein Nab2 has been shown to potentiate RNAPIII activity by directly binding RNAPIII and stabilizing TFIIIB with promoter DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reuter et al., 2015</xref>), providing a precedent for PABPs influencing transcription. However, although TBP is required for the activity of other polymerases including RNAPIII, we found that the impact of mRNA decay-induced PABPC translocation appears specific to RNAPII responsive promoters. Furthermore, while RNAPII levels are reduced at both promoters and in the gene body, the residual promoter-bound population of RNAPII does not appear to have additional defects in promoter escape or elongation, as measured by polymerase CTD phosphorylation patterns. Collectively, these observations suggest that altered PABPC trafficking primarily impacts the very earliest stages of PIC assembly. Determining which factors govern the specificity for RNAPII responsive promoters during accelerated mRNA decay and their connection to nuclear PABPC remain important challenges for the future.</p><p>Although we did not detect a role for LARP4, MSI1, CHD3, or TRIM32 in muSOX-induced transcriptional repression, these findings are complicated by the observation that their depletion alone impaired RNAPII recruitment. In our hands, this phenotype is common to the depletion of a number of different RBPs (though not all), suggesting that their absence may cause secondary effects on gene expression. This also underscores the importance of using alternative assays to evaluate their contributions, as we did for PABPC. Interestingly, some of these proteins are likely to engage in distinct gene regulatory functions in the nucleus that could also be impacted by their altered nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking. For example, a nuclear role for MSI1 has recently been uncovered during mouse spermatogenesis, when it translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sutherland et al., 2015</xref>). In the cytoplasm, MSI1 negatively regulates the translation of its target RNAs by competing with eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4G for binding to PABPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawahara et al., 2008</xref>). However, upon spermatocyte differentiation, MSI1 relocalizes to the nucleus through direct interaction with importin-5 (IPO5), where it concentrates at the silent XY chromatin domain. This not only releases its repression on translation, but also alters its repertoire of RNA targets in the nucleus. LARP4 also binds PABPC, but unlike MSI1, this interaction promotes mRNA poly(A) tail lengthening and stabilization in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Our findings suggest that nuclear accumulation of LARP4 is also dependent on its interaction with PABPC. LARP4 protein levels are controlled post-transcriptionally via an instability determinant within its coding sequence, suggesting that akin to PABPC, its protein abundance is tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mattijssen et al., 2017</xref>). The functions of LARP4 in the nucleus, as well as other RBPs identified in this work, are currently unknown. Exploring these roles and how they become manipulated during times of cellular stress are areas ripe for future studies.</p><p>Finally, it is notable that connections between Xrn1-driven mRNA decay and RNAPII transcription have also been made in yeast, providing further evidence that these seemingly divergent stages of the gene expression cascade are intimately linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haimovich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). However, one key difference between this pathway in yeast and mammalian cells is that in yeast it appears to operate as a compensatory mechanism to maintain optimal mRNA abundance: reduced mRNA decay results in reduced transcription, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haimovich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). This potentially represents an evolutionary divergence in which a unicellular eukaryote ‘buffers’ its overall gene expression for continued maintenance of the organism. In multicellular eukaryotes like mammals, global mRNA decay (which is induced by numerous pathogens) may instead serve as a stress signal, and the ensuing response is thus geared towards shutdown of major cellular programs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(murine herpesvirus 68)</td><td>MHV68</td><td>PMID: 10888635</td><td>NCBI_refseq ID: <break/>NC_001826.2</td><td>Koszinowski <break/>Lab</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, <break/>strain background <break/>(murine herpesvirus 68)</td><td>R443I MHV68</td><td>PMID: 21811408</td><td/><td>Glaunsinger <break/>Lab</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(Homo sapiens)</td><td>HEK293T</td><td>American Type <break/>Culture Collection</td><td>Cat# CRL-11268;

Mixing ratios were adjusted using the information from the test mix to correct for sample losses and generate mixes with equal peptide amounts per channel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Peptide fractionation</title><p>Pooled peptides were acidified and fractionated by 2D StageTip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sauls et al., 2018</xref>). Peptides were first desalted via C18 StageTips to remove unreacted TMT reagent by washing the bound peptides with 5% ACN, 0.5% formic acid (FA) and then eluting the peptides in 70% ACN, 0.5% FA. The eluted peptides were then bound to SCX StageTips and eluted in four fractions with sequential elution (100 µL) as follows: (1) 0.05 M ammonium formate/20% ACN, (2) 0.05 M ammonium acetate/20% ACN, (3) 0.05 M ammonium bicarbonate/20% ACN, and (4) 0.1% ammonium hydroxide/20% ACN. Each of these fractions were diluted 1:1 with 1% trifluoroacetic acid and further fractionated by SDB-RPS StageTips with sequential elution (50 µL) into three fractions as follows: (1) 0.2 M ammonium formate/0.5% FA/60% ACN, (2) 0.2 M ammonium acetate/0.5% FA/60% ACN, (3) 5% ammonium hydroxide/80% ACN. The resulting 12 fractions for each 10-plex experiment were dried <italic>in vacuo</italic> and resuspended in 5 µL of 1% FA, 1% ACN in water.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>LC-MS/MS analysis</title><p>Peptides (2 µL) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UPLC coupled online to an EASYSpray ion source and Q Exactive HF. Peptides were separated on an EASYSpray C18 column (75 µm x 50 cm) heated to 50°C using a linear gradient of 5% ACN to 42% ACN in 0.1% FA over 150 min at a flow rate of 250 nL/min and ionized at 1.7kv. MS/MS analysis was performed as follows: an MS1 scan was performed from 400 to 1800 m/z at 120,000 resolution with an automatic gain control (AGC) setting of 3e6 and a maximum injection time (MIT) of 30 ms recorded in profile. The top 18 precursors were then selected for fragmentation and MS2 scans were acquired at a resolution of 60,000 with an AGC setting of 2e5, a MIT of 105 ms, an isolation window of 0.8 m/z, a fixed first mass of 100 m/z, normalized collision energy of 34, intensity threshold of 1e5, peptide match set to preferred, and a dynamic exclusion of 45 s recorded in profile.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Informatic analysis of TMT data</title><p>MS/MS data were analyzed by Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, v2.2.0.388). The nuclear channels (126 – 128C) and cytoplasmic channels (129 N-131) were analyzed in separate Proteome Discoverer studies to not bias the quantitation due to the expected protein expression differences between these two compartments. The Spectrum Files RC node was utilized to perform post-acquisition mass recalibration and the recalibrated spectra were passed to Sequest HT where two successive rounds of searching were employed against a Uniprot human database appended with common contaminants (2016 – 04, 22,349 sequences). Both search rounds required 5ppm accuracy on the precursor and 0.02 Da accuracy on the fragments and included static carbamidomethyl modifications to cysteine, static TMT additions to peptide N-termini and lysine residues, dynamic oxidation of methionine, dynamic deamidation of asparagine, and dynamic methionine loss and acetylation of protein n-termini. The first Sequest HT search was for fully tryptic peptides only and any unmatched spectra were sent to a second Sequest HT search, which allowed semi-tryptic peptide matches. All matched spectra were scored by Percolator and reporter ion signal-to-noise (S/N) values were extracted (The et al., 2016). The resulting peptide spectrum matches were parsimoniously assembled into a set of identified peptide and protein identifications with a false discovery rate of less than 1% for both the peptide and protein level and at least two unique peptides identified per protein. TMT reporter ion quantification was performed for unique and razor peptides with an average S/N of at least 10 and a precursor co-isolation threshold of less than 30% which did not contain a variable modification. Reporter ion values were normalized to the total detected signal in each channel and protein abundances were calculated as the sum of all normalized reporter ion values for each channel in each protein. Missing values were input using the low abundance resampling algorithm. The reporter ion values for the empty vector WT samples (channels 126 and 129N) were set as 100 and the other channels were scaled to this value. Statistically differential proteins were assessed via a background based ANOVA analysis implemented in Proteome Discoverer. Proteins and associated TMT reporter ion abundances and adjusted p-values from the ANOVA analysis were exported to Excel for further analysis.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Changes in mRNA abundance drive shuttling of RNA binding proteins, linking cytoplasmic RNA degradation to transcription&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The present study investigates the underlying RBP-associated mechanism(s) that influence changes in cellular gene expression by altering RNA decay via the inclusion of the SOX exonuclease as well as Xrn1 knockout. The authors take an attractive MS approach and identify a set of RBPs whose subcellular localization changes in response to muSOX activity. They eventually focus on PABPC1 and provide evidence to suggest that the nuclear relocalization of this protein may be, at least partly, responsible for transcriptional changes that occur in response to SOX activity and linking cytoplasmic decay rates to nuclear transcription.</p><p>Taken together, the findings are convincing and presented clearly. The weak point is that the authors do not explain mechanistically how PABPC1 influences RNAPII activity. Indeed, they argue that the effect might be indirect. Even though a detailed molecular mechanism might be beyond the scope of the study, some description of the nature of the transcriptional shut-down should be included.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Some description of the nature of the transcriptional shut-down should be provided. This could for example be more precisely describing the generality of the RNAP down regulation. For instance, a genome-wide view of RNAPII occupancy in muSOX cells as well as in PABPC1 overexpression conditions would address the robustness of the observation and how interconnected the two phenotypes are (number of common genes, types of genes, etc.). Alternatively, or in addition, the authors could examine the elongation and termination status of affected polymerase on a few model genes.

This could for example be more precisely describing the generality of the RNAP down regulation. For instance, a genome-wide view of RNAPII occupancy in muSOX cells as well as in PABPC1 overexpression conditions would address the robustness of the observation and how interconnected the two phenotypes are (number of common genes, types of genes, etc.). Alternatively, or in addition, the authors could examine the elongation and termination status of affected polymerase on a few model genes.

While a genome-wide analysis of PABPC’s influence is something we are planning as part of a follow-up study (and we agree the controls mentioned above are required for this type of experiment), completing this will take many more months of work and it is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. However, we have performed a number of experiments (comprising the new Figure 6) to better describe the nature of the transcriptional inhibition:</p><p>We added an analysis of RNAPII occupancy during expression of both muSOX and FLAG-PABPC1 at two additional promoters and three additional gene exons. We find that expression of FLAG-PABPC1 very closely mimics the effects of muSOX-induced repression of RNAPII occupancy at all locations tested (Figure 6A).</p><p>We examined the initiation and elongation status of RNAPII in cells expressing either muSOX or FLAG-PABPC1. This was done by ChIP with antibodies specific for the serine 5 or serine 2 phosphorylated versions of RNAPII within three different promoters and gene exons (Figure 6B-C). For both muSOX and FLAG-PABPC expressing cells, we observed that the primary defect is at the stage of RNAPII recruitment, rather than to the subsequent initiation and elongation phases of transcription.</p><p>We performed ChIP against the initiation factor TATA-binding protein (TBP) in muSOX and FLAG-PABPC expressing cells (Figure 6D). Notably, TBP promoter occupancy was also significantly reduced, revealing that the impact on transcription occurs at a very early stage of preinitiation complex assembly.</p><p>To test whether the reduced RNAPII and TBP occupancy at promoters was a consequence of decreased expression of either protein, we performed western blots of the RNAPII subunit Rpb1 and TBP in control, muSOX, and FLAG-PABPC expressing cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). In each sample, the levels of these proteins were equivalent.</p><p>Finally, to address whether muSOX and FLAG-PABPC specifically impact RNAPII responsive promoters, we performed ChIP for the POLR3A subunit of RNAPIII. Unlike the case for the RNAPII promoters, we found no change in RNAPIII occupancy at the 7SK or U6 promoters in the presence of either protein, confirming that the defect we observe is specific to RNAPII transcription (Figure 6E).</p><p>We hope you agree that these new data provide deeper insights into the stage of transcription that is impacted by muSOX and nuclear PABPC, as well as indicate a specificity of the effect for RNAPII responsive promoters. Importantly, for each of the experiments conducted, we observed parallel phenotypes for muSOX and FLAG-PABPC expression, bolstering the hypothesis that PABPC translocation is an important effector of the mRNA decay-transcription feedback mechanism.</p></body></sub-article></article>
