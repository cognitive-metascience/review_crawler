of the adult brain to undergo plastic changes is of particular interest in medicine, especially regarding recovery from injuries or improving learning and cognition. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been associated with juvenile experience-dependent primary visual cortex (V1) plasticity, yet little is known about their role in this process in the adult V1. Activation of MMPs is a crucial step facilitating structural changes in a healthy brain; however, upon brain injury, upregulated MMPs promote the spread of a lesion and impair recovery. To clarify these seemingly opposing outcomes of MMP-activation, we examined the effects of MMP-inhibition on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stoke-affected adult mice. In healthy animals, 7-day application of MMP-inhibitor prevented visual plasticity. Additionally, treatment with MMP-inhibitor once but not twice following stroke rescued plasticity, normally lost under these conditions. Our data imply that an optimal level of MMP-activity is crucial for adult visual plasticity to occur.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11290.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11290.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11290.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When part of the brain becomes damaged as a result of injury or disease – for example, a stroke – other brain regions can sometimes take over from the damaged part. This is one example of a phenomenon called brain plasticity. The strengthening and weakening of connections between neurons that underlies learning and memory is another, less extreme, example of plasticity. While the brain is most plastic during childhood, it remains malleable to some degree throughout life.</p><p>The brain’s visual system in particular shows robust and predictable plasticity, and so is often used by neuroscientists to study mechanisms behind plasticity. In young rodents, taping one eye shut for a few days causes inputs from that eye to visual areas of the brain to become weaker. Inputs from the open eye meanwhile become stronger, leading to improved vision in the open eye. Such plasticity also occurs in adult rodents, but the eye must be closed for longer to produce an effect.</p><p>In young animals, this plasticity depends, in part, on enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These help to regulate a network of proteins called the extracellular matrix, which provides structural support for cells. Pielecka-Fortuna et al. now provide the first evidence that MMP enzymes also contribute to visual plasticity in adult animals. Blocking the activity of MMPs prevented reorganisation of visual areas of the brains of adult mice in response to eye closure, and prevented vision improvements in the open eye.</p><p>However, blocking MMP in adult mice whose brains had been damaged by a stroke had the opposite effect. Whereas stroke normally prevents visual system plasticity in response to eye closure, treatment with a single dose of MMP blocker rescued this plasticity. Strikingly, these benefits were lost if the mice were given two doses of MMP blocker, rather than one.</p><p>These experiments show that MMP levels must be within a narrow range to support plasticity. In the healthy adult brain, blocking MMPs impairs plasticity. After stroke, MMP levels are increased and reducing them rescues plasticity. The next challenge is to identify the specific MMP enzymes responsible, and to determine whether these changes can be exploited to improve recovery from stroke.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11290.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11290.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>adult cortical plasticity</kwd><kwd>matrix metalloproteinases</kwd><kwd>primary visual cortex</kwd><kwd>stroke</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pielecka-Fortuna</surname><given-names>Justyna</given-names></name><name><surname>Fortuna</surname><given-names>Michal G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01GQ0921</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pielecka-Fortuna</surname><given-names>Justyna</given-names></name><name><surname>Kalogeraki</surname><given-names>Evgenia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01GQ0810</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Löwel</surname><given-names>Siegrid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Matrix metalloproteinases play a crucial role in adult visual plasticity in the brains of healthy and stroke-affected mice and their activity has to be within a narrow window for experience-induced plasticity to occur.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to adapt both structurally and functionally to changing patterns of activity induced by the environment or intrinsic factors. In the clinical setting, plasticity is important for tissue repair and neural network rewiring, necessary for recovery and optimal post-injury brain function. The primary visual cortex (V1) is a widely used model region for studying sensory plasticity in young vs. adult brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hofer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Espinosa and Stryker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levelt and Hübener, 2012</xref>). In mammals, V1 consists of a monocular and a binocular zone; neurons in the binocular zone respond to stimulation of both eyes but are dominated by the contralateral eye in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dräger, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">1978</xref>). This ocular dominance (OD) can be modified in an experience-dependent manner, by depriving one eye of pattern vision for several days (known as monocular deprivation or MD), as originally observed by Wiesel and Hubel more than 50 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wiesel and Hubel, 1965</xref>). OD-plasticity has become one of the major paradigms for studying cortical plasticity. In standard-cage raised mice, OD-plasticity in binocular V1 is most pronounced in 4-week-old animals; reduced, yet present, in early adulthood; and absent in animals older than 110 days of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lehmann and Löwel, 2008</xref>). In 4-week-old mice, 3-4 days of MD are sufficient to induce a significant OD-shift towards the open eye (juvenile OD-plasticity), while 7 days of MD are needed in 3-month-old animals (adult OD-plasticity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordon and Stryker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sawtell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frenkel and Bear, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mrsic-Flogel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sato and Stryker, 2008</xref>). Although the experimental paradigm is rather similar, molecular mechanisms underlying 'juvenile' and 'adult' OD-plasticity are different: in juvenile mice, OD-shifts are mostly mediated by reductions in deprived eye responses while adult plasticity is predominantly mediated by an increase in open eye responses in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hofer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Espinosa and Stryker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levelt and Hübener, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Activity driven modifications in neuronal circuits can be facilitated by degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pizzorusso et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Vivo et al., 2013</xref>), which provides structural and biochemical support for the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frischknecht and Gundelfinger, 2012</xref>). Structural and molecular composition of the ECM changes during development, becoming denser and more rigid in the mature brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frischknecht and Gundelfinger, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Vivo et al., 2013</xref>). This structural composition is partially regulated by a family of zinc dependent endopeptidases, the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and their enzymatic activity is crucial for proper development, function and maintenance of neuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Milward et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huntley, 2012</xref>). A recent study in juvenile rats showed that pharmacological inhibition of MMPs with a broad spectrum inhibitor during the MD-period did not influence the reduction of the closed-eye responses induced by 3 days of MD, yet it prevented the potentiation of the nondeprived eye responses in V1 after 7 days of MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spolidoro et al., 2012</xref>). Whether MMPs are involved in adult OD-plasticity, for which mechanisms are believed to be different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hofer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sato and Stryker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ranson et al., 2012</xref>), is not yet known, and clarifying this point was the first goal of this study.</p><p>In addition to MMP involvement in healthy brain function, their excessive activity can also be detrimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agrawal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huntley, 2012</xref>). Both human and animal studies found upregulated activity of MMPs following inflammation, infectious diseases or brain trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agrawal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosell and Lo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morancho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vandenbroucke and Libert, 2014</xref>), and pharmacological inhibition of MMPs shortly after brain injuries reduced infarct sizes and prompted better recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Romanic et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang and Tsirka, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yong, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morancho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vandenbroucke and Libert, 2014</xref>). Stroke can influence synaptic activities within the area directly affected by it, and also in a broader area surrounding the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Witte et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murphy and Corbett, 2009</xref>). Likewise, impairments in experience-dependent plasticity after a cortical stroke also have been observed in distant brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jablonka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greifzu et al., 2011</xref>): in 3-month-old mice, a focal stroke in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) prevented both V1-plasticity and improvements of the spatial frequency and contrast thresholds of the optomotor reflex of the open eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greifzu et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, some MMPs were shown to be upregulated within the first 24 hours after focal stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cybulska-Klosowicz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liguz-Lecznar et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the second goal of our study was to test whether balancing the upregulated MMPs resulting from a focal stroke in S1 would rescue visual plasticity.</p><p>Using a combination of <italic>in vivo</italic> optical imaging of intrinsic signals and behavioral vision tests in adult mice, we observed that application of the broad spectrum MMP-inhibitor GM6001 during the 7-day MD-period prevented both OD-plasticity and enhancements of the optomotor response of the open eye. In addition, a single treatment after the S1-stroke rescued plasticity in both paradigms, whereas treatment with the inhibitor two times diminished plasticity-promoting effect. Together, these data reveal a crucial role of MMPs in adult visual plasticity and suggest that MMP-activity has to be within a narrow window for experience-induced plasticity to occur.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inhibition of MMPs prevented experience-induced adult visual cortex plasticity</title><p>MMPs were shown to be critical for open eye potentiation after 7 days of MD in <italic>juvenile</italic> rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spolidoro et al., 2012</xref>). Since it is believed that the mechanisms underlying juvenile and adult OD-plasticity are different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hofer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sato and Stryker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ranson et al., 2012</xref>), we aimed to test whether MMPs also play a significant role in <italic>adult</italic> V1-plasticity, in which open-eye potentiation is a major component mediating these changes. First, we induced 7-day-MD in 3-month-old mice and examined whether treatment with GM6001 (50mg/kg/day, for 7days), a broad-spectrum MMP-inhibitor, can prevent ocular dominance (OD) plasticity, measured by <italic>in vivo</italic> intrinsic signal optical imaging in V1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows representative examples of optically recorded activity and polar maps after visual stimulation of the right (deprived, contralateral) and left (open, ipsilateral) eye in the binocular region of the left V1 in vehicle-treated (control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>) and GM6001-treated adult mice (GM6001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>). In both, control and GM6001-treated mice without MD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) the activity patch induced by stimulation of the contralateral eye was darker than that of the ipsilateral eye; the OD-index (ODI) was positive and warm colors dominated the OD-map, indicating typical contralateral eye dominance in V1. 7 days of MD induced an OD-shift towards the open eye in control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) but <italic>not</italic> in GM6001-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>): in control mice after MD visual stimulation of the contralateral and ipsilateral eye activated V1 rather equally strong; the OD-histogram was shifted to the left and cooler colors appeared in the 2-dimensional OD-map.

While the experience-induced improvements in the spatial frequency and contrast thresholds of the optomotor reflex of the open eye after MD are cortex-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prusky et al., 2006</xref>), the mechanism underlying these enhancements is not yet fully understood. Using the virtual-reality optomotor setup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prusky et al., 2004</xref>) and daily testing, we examined the role of MMPs in this kind of interocular plasticity. Spatial frequency and contrast sensitivity thresholds of the optomotor reflex were measured in both vehicle-treated (control) and GM6001-treated mice before and during the 7-day MD-period. Mice without MD did not show any experience-induced changes in the spatial frequency (n=6, day 0: 0.37 ± 0.002 cyc/deg vs. day 7: 0.37 ± 0.001 cyc/deg, t-test, p&gt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) or contrast sensitivity thresholds of the optomotor reflex (day 0 vs. day 7, for all spatial frequencies, ANOVA, p&gt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, vehicle-treated (control) mice with 7 days of MD showed the typical enhancements of both the spatial frequency and contrast thresholds of the optomotor reflex: the spatial frequency threshold of the open eye increased on average by 22 ± 1% from day 0 to day 7 (day 0/7: 0.37 ± 0.002/0.46 ± 0.0001 cyc/deg, n=5, t-test, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and was thus significantly different from control mice without MD (n=6) that displayed no experience-driven changes (ANOVA, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Likewise, contrast sensitivity of the open eye of control mice increased after MD (for all spatial frequencies, ANOVA, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), and was different on day 7 compared to control mice without MD (control, n=5 vs. control+MD, n=5, t-test, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, in GM6001-treated mice MD did neither induce an improvement of the spatial frequency (day 0/day 7: 0.37 ± 0.002/0.38 ± 0.002 cyc/deg, n=5, t-test, p&gt;0.05 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), nor of contrast sensitivity thresholds of the optomotor reflex of the open eye (at all spatial frequencies, ANOVA, p&gt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

In contrast to vehicle-treated, PT-lesioned mice receiving a single or two-times injections of the MMP-inhibitor (PT+MD+GM6001) displayed the typical experience-enabled enhancements in the spatial frequency threshold of the optomotor reflex of the open eye after MD: values increased from 0.38 ± 0.002 on day 0 to 0.45 ± 0.003 on day 7 after MD (n=14, t-test, p&lt;0.001).

This finding also suggests that upregulated MMPs in the immediate post-injury period can have a detrimental influence on interocular plasticity in adult mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The objective of this study was to examine if MMPs are crucial for adult visual plasticity, and if inhibition of their upregulation following cortical stroke may be beneficial for rescuing lost plasticity. A combination of <italic>in vivo</italic> optical imaging and behavioral vision tests revealed that an optimal level of MMP-activity is essential for adult visual plasticity to occur in the healthy <italic>and</italic> stroke-affected brain. In healthy adult mice, MMP-inhibition with GM6001 prevented both ocular dominance plasticity and experience-driven improvements of the optomotor reflex of the open eye after MD, indicating that MMP-activation is required for normal adult plasticity. In addition, blockade of elevated MMP-activity after a cortical stroke rescued compromised plasticity. Specifically, a single but not two-times treatment with GM6001 after a cortical PT-lesion in the neighboring S1 region fully rescued experience-dependent ocular dominance plasticity in adult V1, which is normally lost under these conditions. These observations suggest that MMP-activity has to be within a narrow window to allow visual plasticity: if MMP-activity is downregulated (with inhibitors) or upregulated (after stroke) experience-induced plastic changes are compromised.</p><p>In a healthy brain, the enzymatic activity of MMPs has plasticity promoting effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Milward et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huntley, 2012</xref>). Consequently to increased neuronal activity, activated MMPs can lessen physical barriers (loosen up the ECM) or via the degradation of certain receptors influence signaling pathways. Such changes within neuronal cells and their synapses thereby alter the structure and activity of neuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Milward et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huntley, 2012</xref>). Involvement of MMPs in synaptic circuit remodeling has been mainly studied in the hippocampus, yet, their abundant expression in the central nervous system (CNS) indicates a much broader function. For instance, MMP9-deficient mice showed modestly reduced experience-dependent plasticity in the barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaliszewska et al., 2012</xref>) and MMP3-deficient mice displayed abnormal neuronal morphology in the visual cortex and impaired plasticity induced by long-term monocular enucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aerts et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we used a different approach to probe the role of MMPs in experience-induced changes in the visual system: we performed the experiments in wild type mice and treated them with the broad-spectrum inhibitor GM6001 or vehicle during 7 days of MD. Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordon and Stryker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sawtell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sato and Stryker, 2008</xref>), the OD-shift of vehicle-treated mice was mediated by open-eye potentiation. In contrast, there was no change in the open nor in the closed eye responses and hence no OD-plasticity in V1 after MD in GM6001-treated adult mice. This is in line with recent observations from juvenile rats, in which chronic treatment with GM6001 also prevented open eye potentiation after 7 days of MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spolidoro et al., 2012</xref>). However, treatment in this study only partially prevented the OD-shift, as there was no effect on the reduction of deprived eye responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spolidoro et al., 2012</xref>). A reduction in deprived eye responses in V1 is mostly observed in juvenile rodents after 3-4 days of MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordon and Stryker, 1996</xref>), unless different raising conditions are used such as enriched environment or running wheel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greifzu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalogeraki et al., 2014</xref>). In adult, standard-cage raised mice, 6-7 days of MD are necessary for significant OD-shifts and changes are mainly mediated by increases of open eye responses in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordon and Stryker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sawtell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sato and Stryker, 2008</xref>). MMP9 activity was suggested in the potentiation of the open eye responses in juvenile rats, as treatment with GM6001 significantly reduced MMP9-mRNA expression only in the hemisphere where structural changes took place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spolidoro et al., 2012</xref>). Since we observed a full blockade of plasticity after GM6001-treatment, it would be of interest to determine whether MMP9 is crucial for open-eye potentiation also in the adult brain. MMP9 has been widely investigated in various plasticity paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Milward et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frischknecht and Gundelfinger, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huntley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsilibary et al., 2014</xref>) and one of the molecules shown to stimulate MMP9 secretion and expression <italic>in vitro and in vivo</italic> is Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFalpha) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanemaaijer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Candelario-Jalil et al., 2007</xref>). TNFalpha signaling was found to play an important role in the open eye potentiation in juvenile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaneko, et al., 2008</xref>), but not in adult V1 plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ranson et al., 2012</xref>), and since our data reveal that MMPs are indispensable for adult V1 plasticity, MMP-activation in the adult brain is most likely not dependent on TNFalpha signaling. Accordingly, this adds to the notion that juvenile and adult V1 plasticity depend on different molecular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hofer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sato and Stryker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ranson et al., 2012</xref>). Together, our new data demonstrate a vital role of MMPs for adult visual cortex plasticity, in particular for the increase of open eye responses in V1 after MD, and notably expand the previous studies from juvenile rats.</p><p>Under normal conditions, MMP-activity supports healthy brain development and function; yet a different outcome of MMP action has been described for diseased brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agrawal et al., 2008</xref>). Under pathophysiological conditions like inflammation, infection or stroke, uncontrolled MMP driven proteolysis can lead to negative consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rosenberg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agrawal et al., 2008</xref>). Excessive MMP-activity after stroke caused blood brain barrier disruption, upregulation of inflammatory mediators, excitotoxicity and eventually cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Romanic et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang and Tsirka, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yong, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morancho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vandenbroucke and Libert, 2014</xref>). Recent studies reported increased enzymatic MMP9 activity within 24 h after a PT-stroke, and application of a broad spectrum MMP-inhibitor (FN-439) applied <italic>at the time</italic> of stroke induction, partially rescued impaired barrel cortex plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cybulska-Klosowicz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liguz-Lecznar et al., 2012</xref>). Here we tested whether inhibition of upregulated MMP-activity (resulting from PT-stroke) may rescue cortical plasticity also when the treatment starts <italic>after</italic> lesion induction. Indeed, a single GM6001-treatment after PT in the neighboring S1 fully rescued plasticity in both of our experimental paradigms, OD- and interocular plasticity. Importantly, successful treatment did not have to start immediately after stroke induction (1 h) because treatment 24 h after had the same beneficial effect, highlighting the therapeutic potential of brief MMP-inhibition for stroke recovery. Beneficial treatment was, however, dependent on the number of injections: a single but not two-times injection of the MMP-inhibitor rescued OD-plasticity. The reduced plasticity-promoting effect in V1 of mice treated twice with GM6001 is likely due to <italic>too</italic> excessive MMP-downregulation, which in turn interfered with MMP facilitation of MD-induced plasticity. Consistent with this interpretation, it was reported that a particular dosage, timing as well as duration of MMPs-inhibition mattered for reduciton of lesion sizes after intracerebral hemorrhage, blood brain barrier permability or neurovascular remodeling in post-stroke period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang and Tsirka, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sood et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2014</xref>). Together with the results from healthy animals, our data suggest that the plasticity-promoting effects of MMPs are dependent on a well-balanced level of activation, and if that balance is disturbed, experience-induced plastic changes are compromised.</p><p>There are several plausible mechanisms by which MMP-inhibition rescues OD-plasticity after stroke in S1. Stroke influences brain function in numerous ways e.g., causing inflammation and apoptosis, or disrupting the tightly regulated balance of neuronal inhibition and excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neumann-Haefelin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schiene et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Witte and Stoll, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Que et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Witte et al., 2000</xref>) also in perilesional areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murphy and Corbett, 2009</xref>). One of the major consequences of ischemic damage is an elevated level of the neurotransmitter glutamate, leading to excitotoxicity and neuronal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lai et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, stroke can lead to increased tonic inhibition in the peri-infarct zone, and reducing this inhibition can promote functional recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clarkson et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, focal ischemia can induce spreading depression within ipsilateral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schroeter et al., 1995</xref>) and a recent study showed that this phenomenon upregulated MMPs, leading to a breakdown of the blood brain barrier, edema, and vascular leakage, which was suppressed by GM6001 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gursoy-Ozdemir et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, it is likely that treatment with GM6001 shortly after the stroke (as in the present study) downregulated MMPs, thus reduced spreading depression, improved disturbed excitation/inhibition balance and allowed plastic changes to occur.</p><p>Although, we observed clear functional rescue of OD-plasticity after GM6001-treatment, there was no apparent effect on the lesion size: the PT-lesions in GM6001-treated mice were not smaller compared to vehicle-injected mice. This is in line with a recent observation, that a different broad-spectrum MMP-inhibitor (FN-143) did not attenuate brain damage resulting from photothrombosis, but partially rescued barrel cortex plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cybulska-Klosowicz et al., 2011</xref>). The present results, together with the above mentioned study, are not easy to reconcile with findings where MMP-inhibitors reduced the volume of a brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang and Tsirka, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vandenbroucke and Libert, 2014</xref>). The difference might arise from the method used for stroke induction, dosage of inhibitors, timing and duration of the treatment and severity of the lesion.</p><p>Behavioral vision tests additionally revealed an involvement of MMPs for interocular plasticity during MD. The optomotor reflex is known to be mediated by subcortical pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giolli et al., 2006</xref>). While visual capabilities measured by optomotry mainly reflect the properties of the retinal ganglion cells that project to these subcortical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Douglas et al., 2005</xref>), daily testing in the optomotor setup after MD induces a cortex-dependent and experience-enabled enhancement of spatial vision through the open eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prusky et al., 2006</xref>). Although inflammation was shown to interfere with the experience-enabled optomotor changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greifzu et al., 2011</xref>), little is known about the cellular origins or signaling pathways responsible for this plasticity paradigm. Here, we found that daily application of the MMP-inhibitor during MD prevented enhancements in both the spatial frequency and contrast sensitivity thresholds of the optomotor reflex of the open eye, while vehicle-treated control mice displayed the typical experience-enabled optomotor improvements. On the other hand, treatment of mice with the same inhibitor once or twice following cortical stroke rescued the impaired optomotor improvements. Thus, in contrast to the OD-plasticity results, rescue of optomotor improvements was present regardless of the duration of the treatment, adding to the idea that separate mechanisms and different neuronal circuits are responsible for OD- and interocular plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greifzu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kang et al., 2013</xref>). Together, our results establish a novel function of MMPs in experience-enabled enhancements of the optomotor reflex of the open eye after MD in adult mice.</p><p>In conclusion, our present data highlight a critical role of MMPs in adult visual plasticity. They further suggest that upregulation of MMP-activity shortly after a cortical lesion compromises experience-induced visual plasticity, which in turn can be rescued by brief MMP-inhibition. Precise regulation of MMP-activity therefore seems to be essential for facilitating plasticity in the adult brain and offers new opportunities in treatment and recovery after stroke. It remains to be determined which particular MMPs account for the present results.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experimental procedures were approved by the local government (Niedersächsisches Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit, registration number 33.9-42502-04-10/0326).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male adult (n=49, P77-91) wild-type C57Bl/6J mice housed in standard cages (26×20×14 cm) on a 12 h light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioral vision tests</title><p>To assess basic visual capabilities and experience-induced changes of all experimental animals, we measured both the spatial frequency threshold and contrast thresholds of the optomotor reflex using a virtual-reality optomotor system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prusky et al., 2004</xref>).

(2005a)</xref>. In this method, a temporally periodic stimulus is continuously presented to the animal and the visual cortical responses at the specific stimulus frequency are extracted by Fourier analysis. Optical images of intrinsic cortical signals were obtained by a Dalsa 1M30 CCD camera (Dalsa, Waterloo, Canada) controlled by commercially available software. Using a 135 mm×50 mm (imaging of one hemisphere) or 50 mm×50 mm (simultaneous imaging of both hemispheres) tandem lens configuration (Nikon, Inc., Melville, NY) a cortical area of 2.67x2.67 mm<sup>2</sup> or 3.6x3.6 mm<sup>2</sup> and was imaged, respectively. The surface vascular pattern and intrinsic signal images were visualized with illumination wavelengths set by a green (550 ± 10 nm) or red (610 ± 10 nm) interference filter, respectively. After acquisition of a surface image, the camera was focused 600 μm below the cortical surface. Frames were acquired at a rate of 30 Hz temporally binned to 7.5 Hz and stored as 512×512 pixel images after spatial binning of the camera image.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Visual stimuli</title><p>Drifting horizontal bars (2° wide) were presented to the animal at a distance of 25 cm on a high refresh-rate monitor (Hitachi, ACCUVUE, HM-4921-D, 20 inches). The distance between two bars was 70° and they were presented at a temporal frequency of 0.125 Hz. For calculating ocular dominance, the visual stimulus was restricted to the binocular visual field of the left V1 (−5° to +15° azimuth, 0° azimuth corresponding to frontal direction) and animals were stimulated through either the left or the right eye in alternation. For determining the quality of retinotopic maps, we used full-field stimulation through the contralateral eye with a horizontal (elevation maps) or vertical (azimuth map) moving bar, extending 62x92°of the visual field contralateral to the recorded hemisphere.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Visual cortical maps were calculated from the acquired frames by Fourier analysis to extract the signal at the stimulation frequency using commercially available software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kalatsky and Stryker, 2003</xref>). While the phase component of the signal is used for the calculation of retinotopy, the amplitude component represents the intensity of neuronal activation (expressed as fractional change in reflectance ×10<sup>−4</sup>) and was used to calculate OD. For that, the ipsilateral eye magnitude map was first smoothed to reduce pixel shot noise by low-pass filtering using a uniform kernel of 5x5 pixels, and then thresholded at 30% of peak response amplitude to eliminate the background noise. Then an OD-index (ODI) for every pixel in this region was calculated as: (C−I)/(C+I), with C and I representing the response magnitudes of each pixel to visual stimulation of the contralateral and ipsilateral eye, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cang et al., 2005a</xref>). The ODI ranges from −1 to +1, with negative values representing ipsilateral and positive values representing contralateral dominance. We then computed an ODI as the average of the OD-scores of all responsive pixels (all pixels with response amplitude above 30% of peak response). Consequently, we calculated ODIs from blocks of 4 runs in which the averaged maps for each eye had at least a response magnitude of 1×10<sup>−4</sup>. All ODIs of one animal (typically 3–5) were averaged for further quantification and data display. In the polar maps, hue encodes visual field position (retinotopy) and lightness encodes the magnitude of the visual responses. The quality of the retinotopic maps was assessed by the calculation described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cang et al. (2005b)</xref> on contralateral eye. We selected the most responsive area (in the number of 20,000 pixels) within V1 by thresholding at 30% of peak response amplitude of the activity map. For each of the pixels within this area the difference between its visual field position and the mean position of its surrounding 24 pixels was calculated. For maps of high quality, the position differences are quite small because of smooth progression. The standard deviation of the position difference was then used as an index of the quality of retinotopic maps with small values indicating high map quality and vice versa.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Perfusion and histology</title><p>Following optical imaging experiments, mice were deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg pentobarbital and perfused transcardially with Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) (pH 7.4, 0.1M) for 2 min followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) for 8 min. The brain was removed and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) for one day, then transferred to a 10% sucrose solution in PBS for one day followed by a 30% sucrose solution in PBS for one or two days. The brains were frozen in methylbutane at -40°C and stored at -80°C. 40 μm thick coronal brain sections were cut on a microtome and Nissl-stained. To determine size and location of the cortical lesions every third section was analyzed under the microscope (Axioskop, Carl Zeiss) using AxioVision (AxioVs 40 4.5.0.0.). Animals in which the lesion extended into the white matter or V1 were excluded from further analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data and statistical analyses</title><p>We used the Shapiro-Wilk test to check if the data are normally distributed within the group and the F-test to look for equality of variance within the groups. All intra- and intergroup comparisons were analyzed either by a two-tailed t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons Bonferroni correction. The intergroup comparison of the enhancement of the spatial frequency, and contrast sensitivity thresholds were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements and Bonferroni correction. Significance levels were set as *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, and ***p&lt;0.001.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, Matteo Carandini (Reviewing editor), and three reviewers, one of whom is Michael Stryker (Reviewer 3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study provides novel insights into the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in visual cortex plasticity both in the normal adult brain and following a stroke. Previous evidence regarding the roles of MMPs and inflammation in the regulation of CNS plasticity has been confusing, at best, with some studies showing positive and others showing negative effects. The study reports on a series of experiments on the visual cortex of adult mice to show that blockade of MMPs prevents an important form of adult neural plasticity in otherwise intact animals, but that transient blockade of the apparently excessive MMP activity produced by an experimental stroke restores normal adult levels of plasticity in surrounding intact cortex. In other words, inhibiting MMPs prevents plasticity in healthy mice and promotes plasticity in lesioned mice.</p><p>These results reveal that MMPs have a surprisingly narrow range within which their activity permits and/or facilitates plastic changes. Thus MMP inhibitors prevent ocular dominance plasticity in normal mice and enable it following a stroke (in which MMP levels are presumed to have risen).</p><p>These results are interesting and they are compelling because they are obtained with a quantitative and sound physiological measure of visual cortical responses and a quantitative psychophysical measure of visual performance. The results are clear, and experimental and control conditions differ by many standard deviations, leaving one in no doubt about whether the results are sound. The findings are well documented and convincing.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main problem with the paper lies with its conclusions. It is not clear at all that the results show &quot;diverging roles&quot; (as stated in the title) for the stroke and healthy situation. Rather than 'opposite' the two effects are likely to be two sides of the same coin – it appears the MMPs have to be within a narrow window, i.e. be at just at the right level: if they go down (with inhibitors) or up (after stroke) then there is no plasticity. Recasting the paper in this direction (and making it clear that MMPs are elevated by stroke, which is now implied but barely stated), would make the paper much clearer. So it would be best to change the main message of the paper and focus on the narrow window for plasticity imposed by MMPs.</p><p>2) Another problem (which becomes minor if the problem above is solved and the conclusions are recast) is that the paper compares the stroke and healthy situation with completely different time courses for the inhibitor treatment. In the healthy mice, the inhibitor is applied for the seven days of MD, in the lesioned mice; it is applied once an hour after lesioning, or twice after lesioning, in which case the plasticity is blocked. The paper says that the two effects in healthy and lesioned mice are opposite. To make this conclusion, the paper would need to examine the OD plasticity in healthy mice with a single injection of the MMP inhibitor one hour after deprivation. It is unclear if plasticity would be blocked or enhanced in this case. For a proper comparison, one should also inject the lesioned mice daily for seven days – to match the healthy mouse experiment – although it is likely that the plasticity would be gone, given that a second injection after 24 hours prevents plasticity. This would point to the fact that there are not necessarily differential effects in lesioned and healthy mice. Different time courses or doses of inhibitor action might give different results. As a consequence, as stated in point 1, it is not clear that the results show these two scenarios to be opposite. They are likely different versions of the same plasticity (dependent on the timing), which is in direct contrast to the conclusions currently made in the manuscript.</p><p>3) Also, the paper would be strengthened by considering that the 2x inhibitor treatment in stroke mice also blocks plasticity, like in the healthy MD case. The Discussion should speculate on why one inhibitor treatment enhances plasticity and more than one treatment prevents it. It seems that once again this result points to the need for MMPs to be in a narrow window.</p><p>4) Please clarify the timing of the MD relative to the lesion.</p><p>5) Is the loss of the effect of plasticity rescue after stroke due to multiple injections or the timing of the injections? If one gave only one injection at 24 hours, would the plasticity be rescued? This is important from a translational point of view. If these types of treatments would need to be given immediately, that would be important to know.</p><p>6) The behavioral tests are a strength of the paper, linking the results of MD to a behavioral output, and the results are consistent with the Prusky studies. Still, some caution should be taken when interpreting a behavioral acuity test for which we don't understand the underlying physiology. Indeed, this effect of MD has not been reproduced in the non-rodent literature. The data seem to suggest a kind of inverse amblyopia where vision gets better (as mediated through the fellow eye) after a period of monocular deprivation. This is certainly not the case in any other species (including humans) studied so far; in fact small deficits for some aspects of vision have been reported for the fellow eye. This is something to comment on at least in Discussion.</p><p>7) The Discussion is interesting, and it connects the related phenomena in a revealing and comprehensive way. It is likely to be of interest both to experimental neuroscience and to clinical research on therapy to minimize effects of stroke. However, it is lengthy, and it does not suggest or even speculate on a potential mechanism or reason for the differential effects seen in the paper. Even the elevation of MMP levels after stroke is only implied. Again, this is a problem that will disappear if the focus of the paper is recast, so that instead of focusing on divergence of the effects on healthy and stroke brain, it focuses on the need for a narrow window of MMPs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11290.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:1) The main problem with the paper lies with its conclusions.

We agree that “diverging roles” is not the best wording and interpretation of our findings. As suggested, we revised our conclusions and substantially rewrote parts of the manuscript to discuss our data in the modified interpretation framework. We are convinced that these changes significantly improved our manuscript and we believe that the recast version resolves the main problem the reviewers had: (i) our interpretation of the results; and (ii) making it clear that MMP activity is upregulated in stroke. In the following, we refer to the final text, where <italic>major</italic> modifications have been made:</p><p>We have changed the title from “Diverging roles of matrix metalloproteinases in adult visual cortex plasticity in the healthy and lesioned brain” to “Optimal level activity of matrix metalloproteinases is critical for adult visual plasticity in the healthy and stroke-affected brain”.</p><p>The Abstract has been modified to incorporate our new conclusion.</p><p>The Introduction has been improved to make it clear that MMPs are elevated by stroke (second paragraph). In addition, we have modified the text to accommodate the suggested new interpretation of our results.</p><p>Part of the Results section has been modified to make it clearer that MMPs are upregulated by stroke and to accommodate the additional stroke experiments (suggested in the 5<sup>th</sup> comment of the reviewers).</p><p>As suggested by the Reviewing editor and reviewers in their 7<sup>th</sup> comment, the Discussion section was shortened and modified according to our new interpretation of the results.</p><p><italic>2) Another problem (which becomes minor if the problem above is solved and the conclusions are recast) is that the paper compares the stroke and healthy situation with completely different time courses for the inhibitor treatment. In the healthy mice, the inhibitor is applied for the seven days of MD, in the lesioned mice; it is applied once an hour after lesioning, or twice after lesioning, in which case the plasticity is blocked. The paper says that the two effects in healthy and lesioned mice are opposite. To make this conclusion, the paper would need to examine the OD plasticity in healthy mice with a single injection of the MMP inhibitor one hour after deprivation.

For a proper comparison, one should also inject the lesioned mice daily for seven days – to match the healthy mouse experiment – although it is likely that the plasticity would be gone, given that a second injection after 24 hours prevents plasticity. This would point to the fact that there are not necessarily differential effects in lesioned and healthy mice. Different time courses or doses of inhibitor action might give different results. As a consequence, as stated in point 1, it is not clear that the results show these two scenarios to be opposite. They are likely different versions of the same plasticity (dependent on the timing), which is in direct contrast to the conclusions currently made in the manuscript.</italic></p><p>We thank the Reviewing editor and reviewers for this important comment, which also helped us to rethink the interpretation and discussion of our results. We fully understand the reviewers concerns that our experimental design (7-day healthy mice treatment vs. 2-day treatment after stroke) did not allow us to draw the conclusion that “…the two effects in healthy and lesioned mice are opposite”. As suggested we have now modified our interpretation and substantially changed the text. We endorse the idea that in both scenarios, the role of MMPs is basically the same (enzymatic digestion of the substrate), yet the outcome of this activity is different due to altered physiological conditions. As stated in the above comment, our conclusions are now recast and we hope that this answers major reviewers concern.</p><p><italic>3) Also, the paper would be strengthened by considering that the 2x inhibitor treatment in stroke mice also blocks plasticity, like in the healthy MD case. The Discussion should speculate on why one inhibitor treatment enhances plasticity and more than one treatment prevents it. It seems that once again this result points to the need for MMPs to be in a narrow window.</italic></p><p>Yes, we agree with the Reviewing editor and reviewers. We therefore modified a paragraph in the Discussion, so that it addresses why one inhibitor treatment can enhance plasticity and more than one treatment prevents it (third paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) Please clarify the timing of the MD relative to the lesion.</italic></p><p>We apologize for not stating this important information explicitly in our manuscript. MD was performed directlyafter surgery for induction of a photothrombotic stroke, and the information is now added to the Methods section (subsection “Monocular deprivation (MD)”).</p><p><italic>5) Is the loss of the effect of plasticity rescue after stroke due to multiple injections or the timing of the injections? If one gave only one injection at 24 hours, would the plasticity be rescued? This is important from a translational point of view. If these types of treatments would need to be given immediately, that would be important to know.</italic></p><p>Thank you for raising this very interesting point. Inspired by your suggestion, we performed a set of additional experiments to test if treatments need to be given immediately after stroke to rescue plasticity. To this end, we induced a photothrombotic stroke in S1 (as before) of adult mice, and gave only a single injection of the MMPs-inhibitor 24h after lesion induction. Interestingly, a single injection 24h after PT also rescued plasticity (both ocular dominance- and interocular plasticity) indicating that the lost cortical plasticity after two injections is most likely due to multiple injections and <italic>not</italic> the timing. Importantly, these results are promising from a translational point of view as treatment did not need to start immediately after stroke induction to have a beneficial effect for rescuing lost visual plasticity. We believe that these additional findings strengthened our study and also significantly improved the interpretation of our results. We have added these important new findings to our Results section and expanded the Discussion accordingly (third paragraph).</p><p><italic>6) The behavioral tests are a strength of the paper, linking the results of MD to a behavioral output, and the results are consistent with the Prusky studies. Still, some caution should be taken when interpreting a behavioral acuity test for which we don't understand the underlying physiology. Indeed, this effect of MD has not been reproduced in the non-rodent literature. The data seem to suggest a kind of inverse amblyopia where vision gets better (as mediated through the fellow eye) after a period of monocular deprivation. This is certainly not the case in any other species (including humans) studied so far; in fact small deficits for some aspects of vision have been reported for the fellow eye. This is something to comment on at least in Discussion.</italic></p><p>We understand the Reviewing editor and reviewers’ concern and decided to rephrase the description of our optomotry measurements. We have now removed the expression “visual acuity” from the entire text and figures and changed it into “spatial frequency threshold of the optomotor reflex”. We hope that the modified wording now unambiguously clarifies what we have measured. Changes can be found: Introduction: third paragraph; Results: subsection “Inhibition of MMPs prevented experience-enabled improvements in visual capabilities” and subsection “Inhibition of MMPs after induction of a cortical lesion rescued experience-induced 240 improvements in visual capabilities in adult mice “; Discussion: sixth paragraph; Methods: subsection “Behavioral vision tests”; Figure legends: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6; Y</xref> axis labeling for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>.</p><p><italic>7) The Discussion is interesting, and it connects the related phenomena in a revealing and comprehensive way. It is likely to be of interest both to experimental neuroscience and to clinical research on therapy to minimize effects of stroke. However, it is lengthy, and it does not suggest or even speculate on a potential mechanism or reason for the differential effects seen in the paper. Even the elevation of MMP levels after stroke is only implied. Again, this is a problem that will disappear if the focus of the paper is recast, so that instead of focusing on divergence of the effects on healthy and stroke brain, it focuses on the need for a narrow window of MMPs.</italic></p><p>Thank you for these constructive comments. We rewrote and shortened some parts of our Discussion and tried to make it clearer. We considerably changed the explanation of our findings so that the interpretation of our results is now focused on the need for a narrow window of MMP activity to promote adult visual plasticity. In addition, we made it more visible that the MMPs are upregulated after stroke (appropriate changes were made in the Introduction, Results, Discussion), and our Discussion has better interpretation of observed effects of MMP inhibition in healthy and stroke-affected mice.</p></body></sub-article></article>
