Stimulated β2 adrenergic receptors (β2ARs) also release Gβγ subunits, but GIRK is not activated. This study addresses the mechanism underlying this specificity of GIRK activation by M2Rs. K<sup>+</sup> currents and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer between labelled G proteins and GIRK show that M2Rs catalyze Gβγ subunit release at higher rates than β2ARs, generating higher Gβγ concentrations that activate GIRK and regulate other targets of Gβγ. The higher rate of Gβγ release is attributable to a faster G protein coupled receptor – G protein trimer association rate in M2R compared to β2AR. Thus, a rate difference in a single kinetic step accounts for specificity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GIRK</kwd><kwd>GPCR</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>G protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM43949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacKinnon</surname><given-names>Roderick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A single kinetic step in the G protein activation cycle determines whether a G protein-coupled receptor activates G protein-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels or not.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heart rate is tightly regulated by the combined effects of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system.

Sympathetic stimulation accelerates heart rate through activation of beta-adrenergic receptors (βARs) and the stimulatory G protein (Gα<sub>s</sub>) pathway, while parasympathetic stimulation slows heart rate through activation of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M<sub>2</sub> (M2Rs) of the inhibitory G protein (Gα<sub>i</sub>) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brodde and Michel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gordan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>G protein-activated inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) channels are targeted by the parasympathetic nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Loewi, 1921</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Irisawa et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schmitt et al., 2014</xref>). Upon stimulation, acetylcholine (ACh) released from the vagus nerve binds to and activates M2Rs in sinoatrial node (SAN) pacemaker cells, promoting the engagement of the GDP-bound G protein trimer (Gα<sub>i</sub>(GDP)βγ). The activated receptor catalyzes removal of GDP from the G protein alpha subunit (Gα<sub>i</sub>), which allows intracellular GTP to bind. The GTP-bound Gα (Gα<sub>i</sub>(GTP)) and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gβγ) then dissociate from the receptor and from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hilger et al., 2018</xref>).

The reason why GIRK channel opening is specific to Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled GPCR stimulation and not to Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCR stimulation has remained a long-standing unsolved puzzle, which we refer to as the Gβγ specificity puzzle. One theory posited the existence of a macromolecular super-complex consisting of GIRK, G proteins and a Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled GPCR, to endow specificity by proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peleg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ivanina et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clancy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Riven et al., 2006</xref>). Another theory suggested that stimulated Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors might generate insufficient quantities of free Gβγ if Gα<sub>s</sub>(GTP) binds to Gβγ with higher affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Digby et al., 2008</xref>). None of these studies provided sufficient data to strongly support a solution. Here we present data that support a simple biochemical solution to this puzzle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gβγ specificity in native and heterologously expressed GIRK channels</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows spontaneous action potentials recorded from current-clamped murine SAN cells isolated from adult mice. With application of isoproterenol (Iso), action potential (AP) frequency increased, and with ACh firing altogether ceased. Somewhat surprisingly, we could not find in the literature a demonstration of both autonomic responses in the same cell. Here we observe that both Gα<sub>i</sub>-associated (<italic>via</italic> ACh to slow heart rate) and Gα<sub>s</sub>-associated (<italic>via</italic> Iso to speed heart rate) pathways are indeed activated within a single pacemaker cell. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows a voltage-clamp experiment performed on the very same cell shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.

M2R is a Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled GPCR stimulated by ACh and beta 1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) and beta 2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) are both Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs stimulated by Iso. In each experiment, agonist (ACh or Iso) is applied to reveal the level of stimulated K<sup>+</sup> current. Only M2R receptor stimulation activates GIRK to a large extent. This expression is not due to endogenous M2Rs in HEK-293T cells, as ACh fails to stimulate GIRK channels unless M2R is expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A difference in surface expression levels of the GPCRs does not explain this result, as Alexa Fluor 488-labeled M2Rs and β2ARs show similar fluorescence intensity at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–1C</xref>). To ensure that expressed β1AR and β2AR are indeed functional in the cells and capable of initiating the Gα<sub>s</sub> pathway, the cAMP ELIZA assay was used to measure Iso-stimulated increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentration, which is not observed in control cells and is thus dependent on the β1AR and β2AR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Similar experiments were carried out in chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (also mammal-derived) and Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells (insect-derived) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–1E</xref>). In each cell line only M2R receptor stimulation activates GIRK channels. These data demonstrate that specificity persists across mammalian and insect cells and is therefore a robust property of these signaling pathways. The results also imply that GIRK activation does not depend on Gβγ subtypes, because different cell lines, particularly Sf9 cells, express subtypes of Gβγ that are distinct from those in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leopoldt et al., 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Effect of artificially enforced GPCR-GIRK co-localization</title><p>To test whether the macromolecular supercomplex hypothesis can account for Gβγ specificity, we artificially enforced proximity by expressing GIRK linked to either M2R or β2AR within a single open reading frame, as shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). When expressed and analyzed using a western blot, the linked GIRK channel and GPCR run on SDS-PAGE gels as either full-length GIRK-GPCR units or as dimers, trimers and tetramers of those units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, when expressed, GIRK and the GPCR remain linked together. Because GIRK channels are tetramers under native conditions, expression of the GIRK-GPCR unit causes each channel to be surrounded by four GPCRs. Voltage-clamp experiments on HEK-293T cells transiently transfected with the M2R-GIRK construction showed GIRK activation in response to ACh stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Iso stimulation with cells expressing the β2AR-GIRK construction did not activate GIRK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), even though the β2AR is functional as evidenced by quantifying levels of stimulated cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

We next ask what happens if the levels of G proteins available for mediating activation are altered? Using a cell line in which we established stable expression of GIRK channels and GPCRs, G protein levels were altered using transient transfection. In control experiments endogenous G protein levels support M2R stimulated GIRK channel activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), as was observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Expression of additional Gα<sub>i1</sub> subunits suppressed the level of M2R-stimulated GIRK current, presumably because excess Gα<sub>i1</sub> subunits blunt the normal increase in Gβγ concentration (i.e. Gα<sub>i1</sub> can compete with the channel for available Gβγ). Expression of additional Gα<sub>i1</sub> and Gβγ subunits, however, leads to M2R-stimulated GIRK current that exceeds levels mediated by endogenous G proteins alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This latter observation would seem to suggest that increased availability of Gα<sub>i</sub>(GDP)βγ substrate (upon which stimulated M2R acts to generate free Gβγ) leads to increased Gβγ levels following M2R stimulation. The question then naturally arises, if sufficiently high levels of Gα<sub>s</sub>(GDP)βγ substrate are provided, might the β2AR activate GIRK to a detectable extent? The answer is yes. Experiments using cells expressing GIRK channels and β2ARs show that excess Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gβγ subunits give rise to β2AR-stimulated GIRK current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This finding suggests that the specificity exhibited by Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled GPCRs versus Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs is somehow related to differences in the levels of Gβγ that they each are able to generate.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42908.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Influence of G protein levels on specificity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GIRK currents induced by M2R agonist ACh.

First, we examined the binding of Gβγ-Venus to the membrane anchored C-terminal PH domain of GRK3 fused to NLuc (masGRK3ct-NLuc), which is known to bind to Gβγ with ~20 nM affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pitcher et al., 1992</xref>). This experiment produced a robust increase in the BRET signal following M2R stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Second, we examined the binding of Gβγ-Venus to Kir2.2 fused to NLuc. Kir2.2 is structurally similar to GIRK but does not bind to Gβγ. No change in BRET signal occurred following M2R stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These positive and negative controls imply that the BRET assay may be suitable for monitoring a specific interaction between GIRK and Gβγ subunits released following GPCR stimulation.</p><p>HEK-293T cells were transiently transfected with M2Rs, Gβγ-Venus, GIRK-NLuc, and varying concentrations of Gα<sub>i1</sub>. The BRET signal was then monitored over time following ACh stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Even in the absence of additional Gα<sub>i1</sub>, the BRET signal showed a time-dependent increase, consistent with Gβγ-Venus being released from M2Rs and then binding to the GIRK channel. As the amount of Gα<sub>i1</sub> expression was increased the BRET signal increased further, consistent with more Gβγ-Venus being generated as a result of greater Gα<sub>i1</sub>(GDP)βγ-Venus substrate availability. Note that this result is not inconsistent with the reduced current generated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> upon excess Gα<sub>i1</sub> expression because in the BRET experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) Gβγ-Venus is also over-expressed. As the level of Gα<sub>i1</sub> expression is increased a maximum BRET signal is reached, suggesting that an aspect of this signaling pathway other than Gα<sub>i1</sub> availability eventually becomes limiting. When the same experiment was carried out with the β2AR only a very small change in the BRET signal was observed in the absence of Gα<sub>s</sub> transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), consistent with the failure of β2AR stimulation (in the absence of Gα<sub>s</sub> transfection) to activate GIRK channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In accord with the ability of Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gβγ over-expression to over-ride specificity and permit β2AR-stimulated GIRK current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the BRET ratio increased with increased expression of Gα<sub>s</sub> (and Gβγ-Venus). The electrophysiological and BRET assays are in complete agreement with each other and suggest that specificity in Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled GPCR signaling results from higher Gβγ concentrations achieved when Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled receptors are stimulated compared to Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Generalization of Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled GPCR target specificity</title><p>If specificity results from higher levels of Gβγ generated when Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled receptors are stimulated rather than from a specific protein-protein interaction and localization of the receptor with GIRK, then other targets upon which Gβγ acts might also exhibit similar specificity. To test this idea, we carried out experiments using the transient receptor potential melastatin 3 (TRPM3) channel, which is inhibited by Gβγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badheka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Quallo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dembla et al., 2017</xref>). TRPM3 channels and M2Rs were transiently transfected into HEK-293T cells and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed. TRPM3 channels were first activated by a chemical ligand, pregnenolone sulphate (PS), and then inhibited (85 ± 10%) by stimulating M2R with Ach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Similar experiments with Iso-stimulated β2ARs showed only modest inhibition (17 ± 10%), consistent with some degree of specificity as a result of there being insufficient concentrations of Gβγ generated by the Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>). As in the GIRK experiments, specificity is lost when Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gβγ are over-expressed (inhibition 73 ± 14%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–4F</xref>). These observations further strengthen the idea that Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled receptors generate higher concentrations of Gβγ in the setting of endogenous G protein concentrations and that these higher Gβγ levels account for Gβγ specificity. These observations also further reject the macromolecular supercomplex hypothesis as a tenable explanation, because similar Gβγ specificity is observed with a completely different protein target of the Gβγ pathway.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42908.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Generalization of Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled GPCR target specificity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic representation of TRPM3 channel inhibition by Gβγ.

If Gα<sub>i</sub> subunits were more abundant in cells than Gα<sub>s</sub> subunits then higher rates of Gβγ generation would be expected. This explanation seems unlikely though, because the endogenous levels of Gα<sub>s</sub> in HEK-293T cells are actually higher than Gα<sub>i</sub> when we measure levels directly using a Western blot assay in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To test this possibility, we assessed the relative ability of Gα<sub>s</sub>-GTP versus Gα<sub>i1</sub>-GTP to bind to Gβγ. Because the affinity of GTP-bound forms of Gα for Gβγ are so low we contrived the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. GIRK channels and Gβγ were reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers at a mass ratio of ~1:0.1.

Under this condition, sufficiently high concentrations of Gα(GTP-γS) can inhibit GIRK activation through competition by binding to Gβγ. Thus, known amounts of Gα<sub>i1</sub>(GTP-γS) or Gα<sub>s</sub>(GTP-γS) were added by replacing the lipid tail with a His<sub>10</sub> tag and including in the bilayer 3% Ni-NTA lipids. After saturation of Ni-NTA lipids these conditions should yield a Gα(GTP-γS) concentration adjacent to the membrane ~3 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Touhara et al., 2016</xref>).

We also expressed masGRK3ct in the same cells to sequester Gβγ-NLuc once it is released, thus reducing the extent to which Gβγ-NLuc will rebind to Gα-Venus. Two different Gα-Venus insertion constructs were made – into the αa-αb loop or into the αb-αc loop of Gα – to ensure that the observed behavior does not depend on the site of insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Prior to GPCR stimulation, N-Luc intensity and BRET ratio were nearly constant and approximately similar in magnitude in all experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Following GPCR stimulation the BRET ratio change was small for the β2AR and comparatively large for M2R. Similar experiments were also carried out with the Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled dopamine receptor (D2R), which activates GIRK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and the Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled β1AR, which does not.

The small signal associated with βAR stimulation is not due to malfunctioning of the Venus-inserted Gα<sub>s</sub> constructs because Gβγ-NLuc dissociation from Gα<sub>s</sub>-Venus is observable in controls in which G proteins were over-expressed to higher levels (i.e. when BRET ratio prior to βAR stimulation was higher) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

The first transition (<italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic>) describes the formation of a productive complex between the G protein trimer and an active (ligand-bound) GPCR (R*). The second (<italic>k<sub>23</sub></italic>) combines multiple reactions, including GDP/GTP exchange and Gα(GTP) and βγ dissociation. In our experiments, the observation that G protein over-expression increases levels of stimulated Gβγ in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) implies that the <italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic> transition is to some extent rate-limiting under physiological G protein conditions. A single molecule study of the α2 adrenergic receptor (α2AR; a Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled GPCR) also concluded that complex formation between activated receptor and G protein trimer (i.e. the <italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic> transition) was rate-limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sungkaworn et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the same study found that <italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic> for the β2AR was ten times smaller than for the α2AR.</p><p>GPCR density over the entire membrane of atrial cardiac myocytes and in CHO cells is approximately 5 µm<sup>−2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nenasheva et al., 2013</xref>). However, G protein signaling occurs within ‘hotspots’ that we estimate to cover about 10% of the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sungkaworn et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we assume the receptor density to be 50 µm<sup>−2</sup> within a hotspot and assume an initial Gα(GDP)βγ density of 100 µm<sup>−2</sup>. When the reaction is switched on (i.e. ligand stimulation) at t = 0 by changing <italic>k</italic><sub>12</sub> from 0 to 0.2 µm<sup>2</sup> molecule<sup>−1</sup> sec<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sungkaworn et al., 2017</xref>), Gβγ concentration increases (along with time-dependent concentration changes of other components) and GIRK channels activate to a steady state value within a few seconds following a time course similar to M2R stimulated GIRK currents in SAN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We note that time courses vary from cell to cell, but that the modeled time course falls within the experimental range.</p><p>To model the β2AR receptor we reduced <italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic> ten times, consistent with Sungkaworn et al, leaving all other quantities the same. Lower concentrations of Gβγ are predicted and along with significantly less GIRK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> displays in greater detail calculated GIRK-(Gβγ)<sub>4</sub> concentration (i.e. channel activation) as a function of <italic>k</italic><sub>12</sub> magnitude. A steep dependence occurs right around the experimentally determined value for the Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled receptor turnover rate constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sungkaworn et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the model predicts that higher rates of G protein turnover catalyzed by Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled compared to Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs can account for Gβγ specificity.</p><p>Partial agonists by definition activate GPCRs with reduced efficacy compared to full agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McKinney et al., 1991</xref>). The effects of two partial agonists, oxotremorine and pilocarpine, on M2R activation of GIRK are shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–1C</xref>). A study recently concluded that for the β2AR, the distinction between partial and full agonist action lies in the magnitude of <italic>k</italic><sub>12</sub>, its value being smaller for partial agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gregorio et al., 2017</xref>). We think this conclusion likely applies to M2R as well, based on the following observations. When the partial agonists oxotremorine (Oxo) and pilocarpine (Pilo) are used to stimulate M2R, reduced GIRK currents are associated with reduced BRET signals for Gβγ-Venus binding to GIRK-NLuc (blue symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, when amounts of available Gα<sub>i1</sub> are increased (so that more Gα<sub>i1</sub>(GDP)βγ-Venus can form), the partial agonist Oxo gives rise to a BRET signal as strong as that of ACh (orange symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). A similar effect was also observed with Pilo, although to a lesser extent. These results are explicable on the basis of the G protein trimer-GPCR on-rate determining the efficacy of different agonists. Thus, <italic>k</italic><sub>12</sub> can explain the difference in agonists versus partial agonists as well as the fundamental difference between M2R and βARs with respect to their ability to activate GIRK channels. In the model we present, <italic>k</italic><sub>12</sub>, is rate limiting under physiological G protein concentrations, and its magnitude determines differential rates of Gβγ generation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The essential conclusion of this study is that M2R catalyzes the generation of Gβγ at a higher rate than β2AR, thus achieving higher concentrations of Gβγ to activate GIRK. The concentrations of Gα<sub>s</sub>(GTP) generated by β2AR are obviously sufficient to stimulate the downstream-amplified Gα<sub>s</sub> pathway and speed heart rate, but the lower Gβγ levels generated are insufficient to activate GIRK to a great extent. The higher rate of Gβγ generation by M2R likely stems from an intrinsically higher rate of association with G protein trimer. This conclusion is most easily appreciated through careful inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>, where it is shown that endogenous levels of Gα (in the presence of expressed Gβγ-Venus to detect Gβγ binding to GIRK) permit Gβγ generation by M2R, but not by β2AR. Furthermore, over-expression of Gα and Gβγ increases the rate of Gβγ generation in both cases, but higher levels of Gα expression are needed for the β2AR to reach its maximum rate. Thus, Gβγ specificity is explicable on the basis of a difference in the rate at which M2R and β2AR associate with G protein trimer, M2R being faster.</p><p>The forward rate in the first step of the reaction cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) is <italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic> [G protein trimer] [GPCR]. Therefore, a difference in the rate constant <italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic> or either reactant concentration will change the forward rate. We have four reasons to conclude that the difference lies primarily in a difference in <italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic>. First, we have shown in HEK-293T cells that the endogenous concentration of Gα<sub>i</sub> does not exceed Gα<sub>s</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and therefore it is unlikely that Gα<sub>i</sub> trimer exceeds Gα<sub>s</sub> trimer. Moreover, we estimate the levels of GPCR density expressed in HEK-293T cells to be similar for M2R and β2AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Second, given that endogenous levels of Gα<sub>i</sub> are not greater than Gα<sub>s</sub> in HEK-293T cells, the difference in the rate of Gβγ generation (mediated by M2R versus β2AR) as reported by the BRET assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>) is explicable on the basis of a difference in <italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic>. Third, the higher rate of Gβγ dissociation from Gα, mediated by M2R versus β2AR (and also D2R versus β1AR), is most simply explained by a difference in <italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Fourth, the recent single molecule study showing an intrinsically larger <italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic> for α2AR (a Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled GPCR) compared to β2AR is completely consistent with the three reasons enumerated above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sungkaworn et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that the basis of specificity we are describing here is explained by a difference in <italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic>. It is possible that differences in Gα<sub>i</sub> versus Gα<sub>s</sub> concentrations in certain cell types could further contribute to specificity. However, a difference in <italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic> alone can explain specificity.</p><p>When G protein trimer associates with a GPCR, both Gα and receptor undergo a series of conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rasmussen et al., 2011</xref>). A chimera Gα subunit containing mostly Gα<sub>i1</sub> amino acids and only 13 C-terminal Gα<sub>s</sub> amino acids – that engage the receptor – is known to permit βAR activation of GIRK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leaney et al., 2000</xref>). This observation suggests that the Gα conformational change, which involves the main body of the Gα subunit, might be more important in determining the rate of G protein trimer-GPCR association.</p><p>The M2R-GIRK signaling pathway is characterized by four key features: M2R density over the entire cell membrane is relatively low (~5 µm<sup>−2</sup>), M2R turnover rate (i.e. Gβγ generation rate) is slow (maximum rate <italic>k</italic><sub>23</sub> ~1 sec<sup>−1</sup>), Gβγ lifetime is short (~1 s), and the affinity of Gβγ for GIRK is not very high (1.9 mM for the first Gβγ and a cooperativity factor of 0.3 for each successive Gβγ). These features have important consequences. The expected steady state concentration profile of Gβγ surrounding an isolated M2R catalyzing even at its maximum rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>23</sub>) shows that Gβγ never reaches sufficient levels to activate GIRK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and F</xref>). This is because as Gβγ is generated it both diffuses away (diffusion coefficient, D ~ 0.2 µm<sup>2</sup> sec<sup>−1</sup>) and is re-sequestered by Gα(GDP) in approximately one second (k ~ 1 sec<sup>−1</sup>), causing the Gβγ concentration to decay over a characteristic distance (D/k)<sup>1/2</sup>. This circumstance explains why β2AR does not activate GIRK even when it is tethered to the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). And it implies that the macromolecular super-complex hypothesis can not work very well to activate GIRK or to explain Gβγ specificity. At a density of 5 µm<sup>−2</sup>, M2Rs are too far apart from each other to build up the Gβγ concentration. But at a density of 50 M2Rs µm<sup>−2</sup>, sufficiently high Gβγ concentrations can be reached: the expected concentration profile surrounding a disk-shaped ‘hotspot’ of radius 0.3 µm is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). In the middle of the hotspot, which contains about 14 M2Rs, Gβγ concentration reaches 12.5 µm<sup>−2</sup> (2.5 µM in a layer 80 Å thick beneath the membrane), which is enough to activate GIRK channels that happen to be located within the disk. At a fixed GPCR density (50 µm<sup>−2</sup>), the steady state Gβγ concentration depends on the size of the disk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). It is notable that the predicted disk size – several hundred nm to 1 µm – required to achieve sufficiently high concentrations of Gβγ to activate GIRK matches well with G protein signaling hotspots observed in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sungkaworn et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In summary, Gβγ specificity is determined by more rapid Gα<sub>i</sub>(GDP)Gβγ association with M2R compared to Gα<sub>s</sub>(GDP)Gβγ association with β2AR. A sufficient density of GPCRs is required to achieve GIRK-activating concentrations of Gβγ. This is apparently achieved through the formation of hotspots of higher GPCR and G protein density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sungkaworn et al., 2017</xref>). But specificity is explained by the magnitude of a rate constant.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit monoclonal anti Gα<sub>i1</sub></td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: ab140125</td><td valign="top">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit monoclonal Anti Gα<sub>i2</sub></td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: ab157204</td><td valign="top">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti Gα<sub>o</sub></td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: sc-13532</td><td valign="top">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti Gα<sub>s/olf</sub></td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: sc-383</td><td valign="top">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti SNAP tag</td><td valign="top">NEB</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: P9310S</td><td valign="top">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti Halo tag</td><td valign="top">Promega</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: G9281</td><td valign="top">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">cAMP ELISA Detection Kit</td><td valign="top">GenScript</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: L00460</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">NLuc substrate</td><td valign="top">Promega</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: N1110</td><td valign="top">1:50</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (Homo Sapiens)</td><td valign="top">Flp-In-T-REx-293</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_U427">CVCL_U427</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (Homo Sapiens)</td><td valign="top">HEK-293 tsA201</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_2737">CVCL_2737</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (Cricetulus griseus)</td><td valign="top">Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0213">CVCL_0213</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (Spodoptera frugiperda)</td><td valign="top">Sf9 cells</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0549">CVCL_0549</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software</td><td valign="top">Mathematica</td><td valign="top">Wolfram</td><td valign="top">SCR_014448</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6J (Jackson Labs) male and female adult mice (≥10 weeks old) were used.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Kenton Jon Swartz as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a fascinating manuscript exploring why Gα<sub>i</sub> coupled GPCRs like M2R activate GIRK channels while Gα<sub>s</sub>coupled receptors like β2AR do not, even though both liberate the same Gβγ subunits that ultimately bind to and activate the GIRK channel. This is a systematic study by all measures, including testing a wide range of conditions, expression systems, approaches (both experimental and computational) to look at each step in the pathway to arrive at the simple and elegant solutions that the receptors that can activate GIRK channels must liberate Gβγ at faster rates and therefore achieve higher concentrations of the active subunits. The authors were also able to push the Gα<sub>s</sub>system to observe GIRK activation under non-physiological experimental conditions, which we found particularly satisfying. The additional controls with TRPM3 are beyond what we would have expected from a study such as this and they recapitulate the core conclusion. The modeling adds considerably by illustrating the conditions required for selective activation of GIRK channels. The authors are to be commended for putting together an unusually complete and conclusive story on a topic of fundamental biological importance. The presentation also fully takes advantage of the <italic>eLife</italic> format to concisely yet thoroughly present a large body of work.</p><p>Suggested revisions:</p><p>1) One point of comment is that conformational changes in both G protein and receptor proteins are required for their stable association (the <italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic> step in Figure 7A). This seems to imply that one of these conformational changes may be the rate-limiting component of the <italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic> receptor/G protein association step. In the second paragraph of the Discussion, data are discussed supporting this idea, identifying conformational change in the G protein, rather than receptor, as the limiting factor for receptor/G protein association. In our view this is quite a remarkable result, and it could be more strongly emphasized and discussed given its implications. For example, if conformational change in the Gα protein is the true rate-limiting step, this implies that selectivity of GIRK activation is independent of receptor expression levels, since active-state G protein subunits and not activated receptor molecules are limiting. It also means that GIRK activation should still not occur even if several Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors are activated simultaneously. This could be a useful biological feature of the system given the rich collection of GPCRs expressed in the heart and the nervous system.</p><p>2) Our only criticism would be that the manuscript contains a somewhat cursory treatment of the literature, and a corresponding lack of discussion of potentially alternative theories and modifying aspects. For example:</p><p>a) G-protein subunit specificities were a big story in the late 1980's and the 1990's. Some functional experiments showed remarkable subtype specificities, while biochemical experiments showed very little (with the exception of the retinal β<sub>1</sub>γ<sub>1</sub> pair). This is not at all discussed and (unless we overlooked this) the authors don't even tell us which Gβγ they are using.</p><p>b) Paul Insel's lab did a thorough determination of the stoichiometries of the receptor/G-protein/cyclase signaling chains in the heart. Although, to our knowledge, they did not attempt an analysis in sinoatrial node cells, they did report an excess of Gα<sub>i</sub> over Gα<sub>s</sub> that may explain the authors' findings similarly well. Furthermore, several labs, notably Al Gilman's, determined quantities of various G proteins in various tissues, and usually found very little Gα<sub>s</sub>.</p><p>c) FRET and BRET experiments done in the mid-2000s have yielded controversial results whether Gα and Gβγ dissociate or just re-arrange during activation. Particularly for Gα<sub>i</sub> variants, several labs reported that they do not (or do not need to) dissociate in intact cells (which appears be different in cell membrane experiments). How would such a finding affect the authors’ model and conclusions?</p><p>3) A final remark concerns the choice of reaction parameters in Table 2, which are all taken from the indicated references. However, the GTP hydrolysis rate (Breitwieser and Szabo, 1988) is very high compared with turnover numbers reported from biochemical experiments by many labs (which are on the order of 2-4/min).</p><p>4) The authors do a nice job of documenting population responses for most experiments, except for the BRET responses. Would there be a simple way to analyze the results from the most important experiments to provide population data?</p><p>5) In the Results, the authors might specifically mention the cAMP ELISA used to measure the concentration of the nucleotide simply to orient the reader without going to the methods.</p><p>6) Subsection “Direct measure of the Gβγ-GIRK interaction”, last paragraph, suggest modifying &quot;no change&quot; to &quot;only very small changes&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42908.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggested revisions:</p><p>1) One point of comment is that conformational changes in both G protein and receptor proteins are required for their stable association (the k<sub>12</sub> step in Figure 7A).

We do not know whether this intrinsic difference is related to differences in conformational changes in the G protein trimer or the GPCR or both. However, in light of our findings, the observations of Leaney et al. suggest that rate differences are mainly ‘encoded’ by the Gα subunits. We put this idea forth only as a suggestion. This is definitely an area worth further investigation.</p><p>To the dependence of GIRK activation on receptor expression levels, our data support the conclusion that under physiological G protein concentrations, when receptors are activated by ligand they are generally not saturated with G protein trimer, especially in the case of the βARs owing to a smaller <italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic>. This can be appreciated from the BRET data in Figure 3D and 3E and in a new figure supplement (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E), which provides the requested statistical information from multiple experiments (see below). Increasing the GPCR concentration will still increase the rate of Gβγ generation (because the forward rate of formation of activated receptor is <italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic> [G protein trimer] [GPCR]), but a very high density of βARs would be required.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Our only criticism would be that the manuscript contains a somewhat cursory treatment of the literature, and a corresponding lack of discussion of potentially alternative theories and modifying aspects.

In Figure 1 and in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 we show that GPCR-GIRK signaling specificity persists in cells derived from species ranging from mammals to insects. Because G protein conservation between insects and mammals is very low compared to conservation between mammalian subtypes, it is extremely unlikely that Gβγ subtype affects signaling. We now include this point in the discussion on Gβγ subtype specificities (subsection “Gβγ specificity in native and heterologously expressed GIRK channels”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Paul Insel's lab did a thorough determination of the stoichiometries of the receptor/G-protein/cyclase signaling chains in the heart.

Thus, given the mechanism of specificity based on an intrinsically larger <italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic> for the Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled GPCR, higher levels of Gα<sub>i</sub> (compared to Gα<sub>s</sub>) are not required for specificity. If the concentration of Gα<sub>i</sub> were to be greater than Gα<sub>s</sub> in certain cell types then this would also contribute to specificity, but it is not a requirement. This is such an important point raised by the reviewers that we have added a paragraph to the Discussion (second paragraph) to address it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) FRET and BRET experiments done in the mid-2000s have yielded controversial results whether Gαand Gβγ dissociate or just re-arrange during activation. Particularly for Gαivariants, several labs reported that they do not (or do not need to) dissociate in intact cells (which appears be different in cell membrane experiments). How would such a finding affect the authors' model and conclusions?</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out, a FRET study by Bünemann et al. suggested that Gα<sub>i</sub> and Gβγ undergo subunit rearrangement rather than dissociation during G protein activation (Bünemann et al., 2003). However, in our BRET experiments we observed robust apparent dissociation of Gα and Gβγ using two different Gα-Venus constructs (Figure 6). Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, our previous studies using reconstitution clearly demonstrate that free Gβγ activates GIRK and that Gα<sub>i</sub>(GDP) inhibits the channel by removing Gβγ from GIRK through equilibrium-mass action (Wang et al., 2014). Furthermore, our atomic structural studies also demonstrate that the GIRK binding site on Gβγ overlaps with the Gα binding site (Whorton and MacKinnon, 2013). Given these data, the necessity of G protein subunit dissociation seems an inescapable fact.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A final remark concerns the choice of reaction parameters in Table 2, which are all taken from the indicated references. However, the GTP hydrolysis rate (Breitwieser and Szabo, 1988) is very high compared with turnover numbers reported from biochemical experiments by many labs (which are on the order of 2-4/min).</p></disp-quote><p>Intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα is known to be 2-4 min<sup>-1</sup>. However, under physiological conditions GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) accelerate the rate by ~10-1000 fold (Sprang, 2016). Breitwieser and Szabo measured the GTP hydrolysis rates in isolated atrial myocytes where endogenous GAPs were most likely present, as in our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors do a nice job of documenting population responses for most experiments, except for the BRET responses. Would there be a simple way to analyze the results from the most important experiments to provide population data?</p></disp-quote><p>We added Figure 3—figure supplement 1E to provide population data for BRET experiments in Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the Results, the authors might specifically mention the cAMP ELISA used to measure the concentration of the nucleotide simply to orient the reader without going to the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the information to the manuscript (subsection “Gβγ specificity in native and heterologously expressed GIRK channels”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “Direct measure of the Gβγ-GIRK interaction”, last paragraph, suggest modifying &quot;no change&quot; to &quot;only very small changes&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We made this change.</p></body></sub-article></article>
