BESTROPHIN1, encoded by <italic>BEST1</italic>, is predominantly expressed in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), but its physiological role has been a mystery for the last two decades. Using a patient-specific iPSC-based disease model and interdisciplinary approaches, we comprehensively analyzed two distinct <italic>BEST1</italic> patient mutations, and discovered mechanistic correlations between patient clinical phenotypes, electrophysiology in their RPEs, and the structure and function of BESTROPHIN1 mutant channels. Our results revealed that the disease-causing mechanism of <italic>BEST1</italic> mutations is centered on the indispensable role of BESTROPHIN1 in mediating the long speculated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current in RPE, and demonstrate that the pathological potential of <italic>BEST1</italic> mutations can be evaluated and predicted with our iPSC-based ‘disease-in-a-dish’ approach.

Over two hundred of these disease-causing mutations exist, but it is not understood how they affect BESTROPHIN1. Furthermore, there are currently no treatments available to treat these diseases.</p><p>BESTROPHIN1 is an ion channel found in cell membranes in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a layer of cells in the eye that is vital for vision. When BESTROPHIN1 is stimulated by calcium ions, it opens up to allow chloride ions to flow into and out of the cell.</p><p>The health of human eyes can be assessed by measuring how well they respond to light – a response that is believed to be generated from the flow of calcium-stimulated chloride ions in the RPE. Patients with mutant BESTROPHIN1 channels have an abnormally low response to light, but it remains unclear whether these channels are responsible for maintaining the flow of chloride ions required for the light response. Indeed, it is not confirmed whether calcium-stimulated chloride flow occurs on the surface of normal human RPE cells at all.</p><p>Human RPE cells are difficult to obtain. Instead, Li, Zhang et al. took human skin cells – some from patients who had disease-causing mutations that affect BESTROPHIN1 – and used stem cell technology to coax the cells to develop into RPE cells. Calcium-stimulated chloride ion flow could be recorded on the surface of these cells.</p><p>Next, the impact of two disease-causing mutations on BESTROPHIN1 was examined. The mutation from the patient who displayed the more severe illness completely inactivated the channel, while the other associated with milder illness caused a partial loss of channel activity. Notably, introducing normal BESTROPHIN1 into the RPE cells developed from patients with mutant BESTRPOPHIN1 restored chloride ion flow to normal levels. Thus it appears that BESTROPHIN1 is essential for maintaining calcium-stimulated chloride ion flow in human RPE cells.</p><p>The techniques developed by Li, Zhang et al. form a patient-specific ‘disease-in-a-dish’ approach that could be used to study the consequences of other mutations to the gene that produces BESTROPHIN1. This work also suggests that gene therapy could potentially help to treat BESTROPHIN1-related diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC)</kwd><kwd>BESTROPHIN1</kwd><kwd>BEST1</kwd><kwd>retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)</kwd><kwd>retinal diseases</kwd><kwd>patient-specific iPSC-RPE</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31770801</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Shoudeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002402</institution-id><institution>Sun Yat-sen University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100 Top Talents Program (II)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Shoudeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Barbara and Donald Jonas Family Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsang</surname><given-names>Stephen H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsang</surname><given-names>Stephen H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008091</institution-id><institution>University of Rochester</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start-up funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Tingting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A multidisciplinary platform featured by patient-derived RPEs is established to study the disease-causing mechanisms of <italic>BEST1</italic> mutations, and demonstrates gene-supplemented rescue of the mutation-caused deficiency in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current in human RPE.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human <italic>BEST1</italic> gene encodes a protein (BESTROPHIN1, or BEST1) that is predominantly expressed in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marmorstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marquardt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petrukhin et al., 1998</xref>). To date, over 200 distinct mutations in <italic>BEST1</italic> have been identified to associate with bestrophinopathies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-huge.uni-regensburg.de/BEST1_database/home.php?select_db=BEST1">http://www-huge.uni-regensburg.de/BEST1_database/home.php?select_db=BEST1</ext-link>), which consist of at least five distinct retinal degeneration disorders, namely: Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marquardt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petrukhin et al., 1998</xref>), autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy (ARB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burgess et al., 2008</xref>), adult-onset vitelliform dystrophy (AVMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allikmets et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krämer et al., 2000</xref>), autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy (ADVIRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yardley et al., 2004</xref>), and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>). Patients with bestrophinopathies are susceptible to progressive vision loss for which there is currently no treatment available. Therefore, understanding how disease-causing mutations affect the biological function of BEST1 in the retina is critical for elucidating the pathology of bestrophinopathies and developing rational therapeutic interventions.</p><p>A clinical feature of bestrophinopathies associated with <italic>BEST1</italic> mutations is abnormal electrooculogram (EOG) light peak (LP), measured by the maximum transepithelial potential produced by RPE upon light exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marmorstein et al., 2009</xref>). LP is believed to represent a depolarization of the basolateral membrane of RPE due to activation of a Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance triggered by changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujii et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallemore and Steinberg, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallemore and Steinberg, 1993</xref>). The simplest hypothesis about the origin of this ion conductance is that it is generated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels (CaCCs). However, the existence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current on the plasma membrane of RPE has not yet been directly demonstrated, let alone the identity of the participating channel(s).</p><p>BEST1 localizes to the basolateral membrane of RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marmorstein et al., 2000</xref>), and has been functionally identified as a CaCC in heterologous expression studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hartzell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kane Dickson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tsunenari et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xiao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2014b</xref>). Consequently, whether or not BEST1 conducts Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> currents responsible for LP in RPE has been a long-standing question in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hartzell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Best1</italic> knock-out mice do not have any retinal phenotype or Cl<sup>-</sup> current abnormality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marmorstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Milenkovic et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that either BEST1 is not the Cl<sup>-</sup> conducting channel in RPE, or that there are fundamental differences between humans and mice regarding the genetic bases for this electrophysiological response. So far only two studies investigated the Cl<sup>-</sup> channel function of endogenous BEST1 in human RPE. Although both studies demonstrated that Cl<sup>-</sup> secretions were partially impaired in iPSC-RPEs (RPE cells differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells) derived from <italic>BEST1</italic> patients compared to those from healthy donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Milenkovic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moshfegh et al., 2016</xref>), whether or not the CaCC function of BEST1 is involved remains unknown. The first study measured volume-regulated Cl<sup>-</sup> current without testing the involvement of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and used only one WT iPSC-RPE as the control which may not be representative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Milenkovic et al., 2015</xref>). The second study, by our group, utilized anion sensitve fluorescent dyes to detect changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion, which is not a direct measurement of CaCC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moshfegh et al., 2016</xref>). As BEST1 has also been suggested to regulate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis by controlling intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and/or modulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barro-Soria et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Constable, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gómez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neussert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Strauß et al., 2014</xref>), our observations could potentially reflect BEST1’s role as a regulator of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling rather than as a CaCC. Moreover, two recent reports argued that other CaCCs rather than BEST1 are responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated Cl<sup>-</sup> current based on results from porcine and mouse RPEs, and the human RPE-derived ARPE-19 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keckeis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schreiber and Kunzelmann, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the physiological role of BEST1 in human RPE and the pathological mechanisms of <italic>BEST1</italic> disease-causing mutations are still poorly understood. Here for the first time, we directly measured Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> currents on the plasma membrane of human RPEs by whole-cell patch clamp, evaluated the physiological influence of two distinct ARB patient-derived <italic>BEST1</italic> mutations in this context, and demonstrated rescue of mutation-caused loss of function by complementation. We further investigated the impacts of the two disease-causing mutations on the function and structure of BEST1 by electrophysiological and crystallographic approaches, respectively, and discovered mechanistic bases correlated with patient clinical phenotypes. Our results provide definitive evidence that the CaCC activity of BEST1 is indispensable for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> currents in human RPE, reveal the molecular mechanisms of two <italic>BEST1</italic> patient mutations, and offer a proof-of-concept for curing <italic>BEST1</italic>-associated retinal degenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Direct recording of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current by whole-cell patch clamp in human RPEs</title><p>Reduced LP is a pathognomonic phenotype associated with <italic>BEST1</italic> mutations in bestrophinopathy patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marmorstein et al., 2009</xref>).

It should be noted that a Pro to Arg mutation based on the structure model would result in a steric clash between this amino acid and helix S3b, thereby highlighting the major contribution of Pro in the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29914.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Patient mutations in a BEST1 homology model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Left</italic>, ribbon diagram of the BEST1 pentamer with each protomer colored differently, as viewed from the side. <italic>Right</italic>, ribbon diagram of two oppositely facing (144°) protomers of a BEST1 pentamer are shown with the extracellular side on the top.

Taken together, we concluded that P274R is a null mutation that abolishes both plasma membrane localization and channel activity of BEST1 due to structural disruption, whereas I201T is a partial loss-of-function mutation that retains plasma membrane localization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of BEST1 caused by minor structural alterations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we first proved the existence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> currents on the plasma membrane of human RPE by whole-cell patch clamp.

We used both KpBest crystal structures and human homology models mainly based on cBest1 to analyze the possible structural alterations in BEST1 caused by the patient-specific mutations. Results from the two methods are consistent with each other and with functional data. Moreover, it has been proposed that disease mutations may result in wrongly numbered oligomers rather than the correct pentamer formed by WT BEST1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>). The structure of KpBest I177T suggests that the BEST1 I201T mutation does not alter the pentameric conformation of the channel.</p><p>Although decreased LP in <italic>BEST1</italic> patients has been attributed to aberrant RPE surface Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current, how <italic>BEST1</italic> disease-causing mutations physiologically influence Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current in RPE has not been directly examined. Most previous studies investigated the anion channel function of BEST1 in transiently transfected cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hartzell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>), while the only two studies done in human RPE by other groups did not directly examine Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current: one measured transepithelial potential in fhRPE expressing exogenous BEST1 on virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marmorstein et al., 2015</xref>), and the other investigated volume-dependent current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Milenkovic et al., 2015</xref>). We recently used anion sensitive fluorescent dyes to compare Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion in <italic>BEST1</italic> WT and mutant donor iPSC-RPEs, but neither the surface Cl<sup>-</sup> current nor Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity was directly measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moshfegh et al., 2016</xref>). Here we clearly demonstrated with whole-cell patch clamp that the surface Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current in patient-derived iPSC-RPEs is completely abolished and significantly reduced by the P274R and I201T mutations, respectively, providing the first direct evidence that <italic>BEST1</italic> disease-causing mutations impair Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current in human RPE. Our results strongly argue that BEST1 is the CaCC mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current in human RPE, because: 1) the surface Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current is completely defective in iPSC-RPE with the P274R mutation, which generates an essentially ‘null’ BEST1 channel with loss of plasma membrane enrichment in RPE and no ion conductivity in HEK293 cells and bilayer (KpBest P239R), suggesting that BEST1 is indispensable for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current in RPE; 2) the I201T mutation results in significantly reduced conductivity of the channel in both HEK293 cells and bilayer (KpBest L177T), and concomitantly leads to much smaller Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> currents in the patient iPSC-RPE, in which the mutant BEST1 channels are still expressed and enriched on the plasma membrane, suggesting that the CaCC function of membrane located BEST1 orchestrates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current in RPE; 3) the I201T mutation does not affect the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of Cl<sup>-</sup> current in RPE, consistent with the non-involvement of I201 in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding according to the cBest1 crystal structure model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kane Dickson et al., 2014</xref>). The simplest and most logical conclusion based on our results is that BEST1 functions as the surface CaCC to generate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current in human RPE.</p><p>A recent report with primary mouse RPE and the human RPE-derived ARPE-19 cell line suggested that TMEM16B is the CaCC responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated Cl<sup>-</sup> current in those cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keckeis et al., 2017</xref>), while a role of TMEM16A was proposed by another study using Cl<sup>-</sup> channel blockers in porcine RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schreiber and Kunzelmann, 2016</xref>). It should be noted that <italic>Best1</italic> knockout mice do not have any retinal abnormality or aberrant Cl<sup>-</sup> current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marmorstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Milenkovic et al., 2015</xref>), unlike the phenotypes seen with human <italic>BEST1</italic> mutations, suggesting different genetic requirements for retinal physiology among species. Moreover, the expression of BEST1 in the ARPE-19 cell line may be different from that in iPSC-RPE and fhRPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marmorstein et al., 2000</xref>). In any case, our results do not completely exclude the role of other CaCCs in contributing to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current in human RPE.</p><p>Besides its CaCC function on the basolateral plasma membrane of RPE, other roles of BEST1 have also been suggested including HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> channel, volume-regulated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel, regulator of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barro-Soria et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burgess et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fischmeister and Hartzell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gómez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qu and Hartzell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosenthal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). Here we focused on the CaCC function of BEST1 in conducting surface Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current, which directly gives rise to LP, but did not exclude any indirect contribution of BEST1 to LP through its non-CaCC function(s). For instance, BEST1 may affect a downstream CaCC (e.g. TMEM16A or TMEM16B) through regulating intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>Interestingly, we found remarkable differences in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of Cl<sup>-</sup> current in different cell types. The lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivities in fhRPE (EC<sub>50</sub> 1.7 μM) compared to that in <italic>BEST1</italic> WT iPSC-RPE (EC<sub>50</sub> 455 nM) may result from the cells’ different developmental stages, considering that fetuses do not have a fully functional visual system and therefore probably only need less sensitive CaCCs in their RPEs. The higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of heterologously expressed BEST1 in HEK293 cells (EC<sub>50</sub> ~150 nM) has been reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xiao et al., 2008</xref>), while purified cBest1 displays an even smaller EC<sub>50</sub> of 17 nM in bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vaisey et al., 2016</xref>). Considering the role of BEST1 as the CaCC in RPE, the significant difference of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivities may reflect intrinsic differences between RPE where BEST1 is endogenously expressed and other experimental systems with overexpressed or purified proteins. It is also possible that in native RPE, BEST1 senses Ca<sup>2+</sup> not only through direct interaction as suggested by the cBest1 model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kane Dickson et al., 2014</xref>), but also indirectly via a third-party Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor protein or by posttranslational modification mechanisms (e.g. phosphorylation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hartzell et al., 2008</xref>), to function properly under the sophisticated physiological environment. Notably, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity observed in <italic>BEST1</italic> WT iPSC-RPE (EC<sub>50</sub> 455 nM) is at levels more comparable to physiological conditions than that detected in HEK293 cells over-expressing BEST1 (EC<sub>50</sub> ~150 nM), let alone cBest1 in bilayer (EC<sub>50</sub> 17 nM), because basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the human body is typically around 100 nM, meaning that CaCCs with a EC<sub>50</sub> near or lower than 100 nM would be readily activated even in resting cells.</p><p>In regard to the clinical treatment of bestrophinopathies, our study provided an important proof-of-concept for treating ARB caused by <italic>BEST1</italic> recessive mutations, as the loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current in the ‘null’ BEST1 P274R iPSC-RPE was rescued by viral expression of WT BEST1. It will be very intriguing to see if ARB patients can be treated by gene therapy delivering functional WT BEST1 to their RPEs. Notably, most of the <italic>BEST1</italic> patient-specific mutations are dominant, so that the mutant <italic>BEST1</italic> alleles in these cases may be more functionally defective and/or structurally disruptive compared to recessive mutant alleles in ARB patients. Although it is formally possible that overexpression of WT BEST1 can also rescue, in a dominant-negative matter, aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current in RPE caused by <italic>BEST1</italic> dominant mutations, further studies will be needed to test this premise.</p><p>On the other hand, recessive <italic>BEST1</italic> mutations from ARB patients provide a unique opportunity to analyze and connect the structure, function and physiological role of BEST1 in a ‘clean’ manner, as only the mutant BEST1 proteins are present in patients and all our experimental systems. By contrast, the co-existence of both WT and mutant BEST1 proteins in the cases of dominant mutations complicates the functional-structural analyses for several reasons: (1) as the pentameric bestrophin channels consist of five protomers, different numbers (0–5) of BEST1 mutant protomers could potentially be assembled to a BEST1 pentamer and impact the channel structure and function; (2) although the ratio of endogenous WT to mutant BEST1 proteins is key to determine the composition of pentameric BEST1 channels in patients, this critical factor cannot be determined by either western blot or immunostaining, as the BEST1-specific antibody cannot distinguish WT and mutant BEST1 proteins; (3) crystallographic studies with the BEST1 dominant mutant proteins only reflect homopentamers consisting of all five mutant protomers, but not heteropentamers with 1–4 mutant protomers; (4) it could be technically challenging to rescue phenotypes caused by dominant mutations, and thus hard to draw a clear conclusion. Nevertheless, we are actively investigating <italic>BEST1</italic> dominant mutations using the pipelines established in this work with necessary modifications and cautions.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

CytoTune-iPS 2.0 Sendai Reprogramming Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A16517), and immunocytofluorescence assays were performed for scoring iPSC pluripotency following the previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2016</xref>). In brief, a panel of antibodies (1:200, abcam, ab109884) against four standard pluripotency markers SOX2, Tra-1–60, SSEA4 and Nanog were applied to characterize the iPSCs from all the subjects enrolled in this study. Hoechst staining was applied to detect nuclei. Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-rabbit or Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1,000; Life Technologies). Images for all antibody labels were taken under the same settings with fluorescence microscope (NIKON, Eclipse, Ts2R). All iPSC lines were maintained in mTeSR-1 medium (STEMCELL Technologies, 05850) and passaged every 3–6 days. The morphology and nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of the iPSC lines were closely monitored to ensure the stability. To verify genome integrity, all the iPSC lines in this study were sent for karyotyping by G-banding at the Cell Line Genetics (Wisconsin, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Differentiation of iPSC into RPE</title><p>iPSC differentiation started at passage 4 for all iPSC lines. For differentiation, iPSC colonies were cultured to confluence in 6-well culture dishes (Costar, Corning, Corning, NY) pretreated with 1:50 diluted matrigel (CORNING, 356230) in differentiation medium consisting of Knock-Out (KO) DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10829018), 15% KO serum replacement (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10829028), 1% nonessential amino acids (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11140050), 2 mM glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 35050061), 50 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10378016), and 10 mM nicotinamide (Sigma-Aldrich, N0636) for the first 14 days. During the 15<sup>th</sup>-28<sup>th</sup> days of differentiation, 100 ng/ml human Activin-A (PeproTech, 120–14) was supplemented into differentiation medium. From day 29, Activin-A supplementation was stopped until differentiation was completed. After 8–10 weeks, pigmented clusters were formatted and manually picked, then plated on matrigel-coated dishes in RPE culture medium as previous described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maminishkis et al., 2006</xref>). They were cultured for another 6–8 weeks to allow them to form a functional monolayer for function assay. Besides well-established classical mature RPE markers RPE65, Bestrophin1 and CRALBP, two additional RPE markers, MITF and PAX6, were used for RPE fate validation. All the iPSC-RPE cells used in this study were at their passage 1. Mutations (P274R and I201T) in the mutant iPSC-RPEs were verified by sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cell lines</title><p>HEK293 cells were gifts from Dr. David Yule at University of Rochester. Although HEK293 is on the list of commonly misidentified cell lines maintained by the International Cell Line Authentication Committee, the HEK293 cells used in this study were authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) DNA profiling. No mycoplasma contamination was found. Low-passage-number HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Immunofluorescence staining was performed in all iPSC-RPE lines and human fetal RPE cells. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 45 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS twice, the cells were incubated in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100% and 2% donkey serum for 45 min. Then, primary antibodies against BESTROPHIN-1 (1:200, Novus Biologicals, NB300-164), ZO-1 (1:500, Invitrogen Life Technologies, 40–2200) and EEA1 (1:200, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA5-14794) were applied to each sample for 2 hr at room temperature. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated and Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated IgG (1:1,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used as secondary antibodies. Hoechst was used to detect the cell nuclei.

The non-dissolved matter was removed by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 g for 30 min, and the supernatant was loaded to a 5 ml Hitrap Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA affinity column (GE Healthcare), pre-equilibrated with the same solubilization buffer supplemented with 0.05% DDM. After 20 column volume buffer wash, the protein was eluted with 500 mM imidazole in the solubilization buffer. The 10-His tags were removed by adding super TEV at 1:1 mass ratio and incubating at 4°C for 30 min. Tag removal was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, and the resulting sample was concentrated to approximately 10 mg/ml. Preparative size-exclusion chromatography was carried out on a Superdex-200 column for further purification, including removal of TEV protease and the cleaved tag.

Next, the RPE layer was separated from the choroid layer and transferred to a 15 ml conical tube containing 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. Then the tube was incubated in 37°C water bath for 10 min. After centrifugation at 0.8 rpm for 4 min, the cell pellet was resuspended in RPE medium and plated on a matrigel coated petri dish. All the fetal RPE cells used in this study were at their passage 1.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Henry Colecraft for comments on the paper, Anne R Davis for providing human globe samples, David Yule for HEK293 cells, David Yule and Yu (Julie) Zhang for help in taking confocal images, Qun Liu and Min Su for help in generating the human model, Yota Fukuda for suggestions on model analysis and staff at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) beamline 24-ID-E for their assistance in data collection.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Patient-specific mutations impair an essential role of BESTROPHIN1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Three experts reviewed your manuscript, and their assessments, together with my own (Reviewing Editor), form the basis of this letter. The evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>As you will see, all of the reviewers were impressed with the importance and novelty of your work, but they also had a wide variety of critiques. I am including the three reviews at the end of this letter, as there are many specific and useful suggestions in them.</p><p>In further discussions among the reviewers, the major questions that arose focused on:</p><p>1) Potential variability among different cell lines from the same donor – i.e. how reproducible are the data obtained from different cell lines?</p><p>2) The distinction between <italic>Best1</italic> current and other non-<italic>Best1</italic> currents (e.g. VRAC) – i.e. a fuller characterization of the rescued current.</p><p>We appreciate that the reviewers' comments cover a very broad range of suggestions for improving the manuscript. Please use your best judgment in deciding which of these can be accommodated in a reasonable period of time. We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This study provides the first direct evidence that the endogenous human Bestrophin 1 is responsible for calcium-dependent chloride current in human RPE cells and that disease-associated mutations in human Bestrophin 1 abolishes this current in human RPE cells. This study also offers the most direct evidence that Best disease is a channelopathy caused by a defective calcium-activated chloride channel and overcomes the difficulty of previous mouse models. This achievement warrants its publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. This reviewer does not suggest any further experiments, but suggests improvements in the Discussion and presentation. Here are a few high relevant points that can be discussed to improve the manuscript:</p><p>1) What are the differences in locations between the recessive mutations and dominant mutations in Bestrophin 1? Can the structural model predict or make sense of this functional difference? Since the data showed that the recessive mutants are still expressed at the protein level, it is surprisingly that the mutant subunit does not interfere with the function of the wild-type subunits in the pentamer (it does, it would be a dominant mutant).</p><p>2) The authors write &quot;in any case, our results do not exclude the role of TMEM16A/TMEM16B in regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current in human RPE.&quot; However, the authors presented data showing that RPE cells with the mutant Bestrophin 1 lacks any Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current. This data does exclude the role of TMEM16A/TMEM16B in regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current in human RPE.</p><p>3) The authors state &quot;most of the <italic>BEST1</italic> patient-specific mutations are dominant, so that the mutant <italic>BEST1</italic> alleles in these cases may be gain-of-function as oppose to the loss-of-function alleles in ARB patients.&quot; There is only evidence to suggest that the dominant mutations are loss-of-function mutations.

For example, in native bovine RPE NFA increases basolateral membrane Cl conductance and the resultant Cl current is blocked by basal DIDS as measured by intracellular recording and by decreased 36Cl flux. In bovine RPE intracellular Cl was significantly decreased by NFA. By comparison, the current authors (Moshfegh et al., 2016) showed that elevated Ca (physiological?) also decreased intracellular Cl activity in iPSC-derived RPE as inferred from the initial decrease in measured YFP fluorescence. In the latter experiments the intracellular Ca increase could be acting at the plasma membrane or at locations inside the cell and the change in Cl activity could for example be mediated by apical membrane Na/K/2Cl cotransporters, or basolateral membrane HCO<sub>3</sub>/Cl exchangers (but see 4 below), or other Ca-mediated transporters/channels. It would be worthwhile measuring the intracellular Cl activities (YFP) in the presence and absence of NFA.

The absence of HCO<sub>3</sub> buffer significantly deactivates a variety of apical and basolateral membrane transporters that control cell pH, Na, Cl, K, and volume in and around the RPE. For example, the apical membrane NaHCO<sub>3</sub> co-transporter is electrogenic and if absent from these cells would reduce apical and basolateral membrane potential potentials, ion gradient's, and volume regulation and alter net fluid transport. These outcomes would obscure the possible connection between Ca-dependent currents measured in vitro and the in vivo events following light onset and the subsequent generation of the LP.</p><p>5) Authors do not provide mechanistic evidence regarding the driving forces that generate the calcium activated chloride channel.

Mutations in the Ca-activated Cl channel <italic>BEST1</italic> cause a spectrum of retinopathies known as bestrophinopathies, but the mechanisms have remained obscure at least partly because mouse models do not faithfully reproduce human. A hallmark of bestrophinopathies is the absence of the light peak in the electrooculogram. While it has long been suspected that <italic>BEST1</italic> is the channel responsible for the light peak, evidence has been lacking. This paper addresses the question by (1) identifying 2 patients with <italic>BEST1</italic> mutations and characterizing their phenoptype, (2) showing that RPE cells differentiated from iPSCs derived from these bestrophinopathy patients have defective Ca-activated Cl currents, (3) showing that HEK cells expressing the patient mutations have defective Cl currents, and (4) solving the crystal structure of a <italic>BEST1</italic> homolog (KpBest) with one of the patient mutations and recording single channel currents. This very powerful combination of approaches provides a strong argument that <italic>BEST1</italic> is the Ca-activated Cl channel responsible for the light peak.</p><p>Despite the strength of the multi-dimensional approach, each aspect of the study has serious weaknesses.</p><p>1) The evidence that the ionic currents in iPSC-RPE cells that are interpreted as encoded by <italic>BEST1</italic> is weak. First, the current traces have the characteristic unmistakable appearance of volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC) and they do not resemble hBEST1 currents expressed in HEK cells (as can be seen comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This could mean that the currents are mediated VRAC (LRRC8) which are somehow regulated by <italic>BEST1</italic>. Second, the experiments the authors perform to conclude these are <italic>BEST1</italic> currents are superficial. There is no data in this paper showing their anion selectivity. The use of NFA as a Ca-activated Cl channel blocker is bogus: NFA is more potent at blocking VRAC and TMEM16A than <italic>BEST1</italic> (PMID:28620305;PMID:25078708). The authors must rule out the possibility that the currents they are studying are VRAC currents. This could involve knockdown of LRRC8A. Another approach to distinguish between VRAC and <italic>BEST1</italic>, the authors might measure taurine permeability (taurine is zwitterionic so taurine currents can be measured at the appropriate pH). This is a crucial point. The authors might argue that VRAC is not Ca-activated, but VRAC is clearly Ca-regulated.</p><p>2) The immunofluorescence images showing <italic>BEST1</italic> on the cell surface are not convincing. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>, ZO-1 is clearly on the cell surface, but most of <italic>BEST1</italic> is intracellular. It is not clear that any <italic>BEST1</italic> co-localizes with ZO-1. The authors must use deconvolution or super-resolution imaging and perform statistical analysis to show co-localization. This should be supplemented with cell surface biotinylation. Also, because the CaCC that generates the light peak is presumed to be on the basolateral membrane, the authors should determine whether <italic>BEST1</italic> is trafficked properly in these cultures. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> the localization of <italic>BEST1</italic> is not obviously different from control. The level of expression seems spotty in the P274R mutant, but some cells look like they express at control levels. ZO-1 is very clearly disrupted in the I201T mutant, but the authors do not comment on this. It is also curious that overexpressed <italic>BEST1</italic> localizes more strongly to the plasma membrane than does the endogenous protein detected by antibody. This raises questions about the validity of the antibody. Has it been knockout-verified in IF?</p><p>3) While the homology model is informative, the crystal structure of the KpBest L177T mutant does not provide any important insights. The KpBest L177T mutant is meant to model the hBEST1 I201T mutant. Not only is the mutated residue non-identical but of the 10 amino acids on either side of L177 (residues 167-187) only 3 amino acids are identical and not many more are structurally similar. Furthermore, KpBest is not a Cl channel, but a cation channel. It is puzzling why the authors did not use chicken <italic>BEST1,</italic> which has also been successfully crystalized and is very closely related to hBEST1. The shift in the helices shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> does not obviously provide any mechanistic insights. A more detailed analysis of the effects of this mutation on the channel pore is required, but since this is a cation channel, I am not sure that the conclusions would be relevant. The single channel analysis supports the authors' conclusions but would be more valuable if they were performed with cBest1. How many times was this experiment repeated?</p><p>4) No methods are provided about how the ERGs were measured. How long were patients dark-adapted? What was the light stimulus intensity/duration, etc.? More explanation is required about the &quot;age-matched controls&quot;. Were the controls measured co-temporaneously and how were they selected? Although the literature is a little ambiguous about ERG changes with age, I am a little surprised that normal teenagers have b-waves twice as large as a normal 72-year old. Not only should the authors provide more information about their own controls, but should compare their results to the published literature. At least one study shows no difference in b-wave amplitude between 20-39 year-olds and 60-82 year-olds (Doc Ophthalmol (2011) 122: 177.)</p><p>5) Of the two mutations studied, the P274R is clearly the most dramatic. However, the impact of the cellular data are weakened because there are no electro-oculogram data presented for this patient. The authors should show current traces for the rescued cells and should show that the rescued currents have the same Ca sensitivity as WT. While the authors state that &quot;all patients display reduced LP&quot;, it is not clear exactly what this means. There are cases in the literature describing patients with <italic>BEST1</italic> mutations that have normal LPs.</p><p>6) In most experiments, only 4-5 cells were tested. Were these cells all from the same RPE colony derived from the same iPSC culture, or are they from different RPE colonies? If these data are from a single colony, how can one be certain that the difference in ionic currents is not explained by technical differences between colonies?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29914.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Potential variability among different cell lines from the same donor – i.e. how reproducible are the data obtained from different cell lines?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concern about potential variability among different cell lines from the same donor.

This Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current is apparently dependent on BEST1, as the null phenotype in P274R iPSC-RPE was fully rescued by complementation with WT BEST1. As BEST1 is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel specifically expressed in the RPE surface, the simplest model according to the principle of Occam’s Razor is that BEST1 conducts this Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current. This model is further supported by the direct correlation between the structural/functional deficiency of BEST1 channels and the severity of the clinical and cellular phenotypes. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that BEST1 somehow plays an indispensable role in regulating or cooperating with other anion channels such as TMEM16A, TMEM16B or other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent VRAC. In fact, BEST1 itself has been suggested to function as a VRAC (Fischmeister and Hartzell, 2005; Qu and Hartzell, 2008). To conclusively exclude or include additional player(s) in mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current in RPE, one needs to perform individual knockout of each candidate gene, which is beyond the scope of this work. The focus of this work is on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current in RPE. VRAC current in RPE and the putative role of BEST1 as a VRAC are important but separate topics, which need to be carefully addressed in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We appreciate that the reviewers' comments cover a very broad range of suggestions for improving the manuscript.

Can the structural model predict or make sense of this functional difference? Since the data showed that the recessive mutants are still expressed at the protein level, it is surprisingly that the mutant subunit does not interfere with the function of the wild-type subunits in the pentamer (it does, it would be a dominant mutant).</p></disp-quote><p>Mutations causing ARB are mostly located outside of the exons that usually harbor vitelliform macular dystrophy–associated dominant mutations (Fung et al., 2015). Unfortunately, it is still hard to predict the functional differences between dominant and recessive mutations based on their locations on the structural model. For the P274R mutation, our immunostaining results showed that the mutant protein is not localized on the plasma membrane, suggesting that the mutant subunit cannot traffic onto the plasma membrane to interfere with the WT subunit. For the I201T mutation, as the structural alteration is subtle even in the mutant homopentamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), it may require certain numbers of I201T mutant protomers in the heteropentamers to cause a significant phenotype in the channel function. Moreover, whether or not I201T mutant protomers can be properly assembled to form heteropentamers with WT protomers is unknown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors write &quot;in any case, our results do not exclude the role of TMEM16A/TMEM16B in regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current in human RPE.&quot; However, the authors presented data showing that RPE cells with the mutant Bestrophin 1 lacks any Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> current.

Moreover, the differences between native currents in RPE and BEST1 currents expressed in HEK293 cells are likely attributed to the intrinsic differences between the two hosting cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The immunofluorescence images showing BEST1 on the cell surface are not convincing. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>, ZO-1 is clearly on the cell surface, but most of BEST1 is intracellular. It is not clear that any BEST1 co-localizes with ZO-1. The authors must use deconvolution or super-resolution imaging and perform statistical analysis to show co-localization. This should be supplemented with cell surface biotinylation. Also, because the CaCC that generates the light peak is presumed to be on the basolateral membrane, the authors should determine whether BEST1 is trafficked properly in these cultures. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> the localization of BEST1 is not obviously different from control. The level of expression seems spotty in the P274R mutant, but some cells look like they express at control levels. ZO-1 is very clearly disrupted in the I201T mutant, but the authors do not comment on this. It is also curious that overexpressed BEST1 localizes more strongly to the plasma membrane than does the endogenous protein detected by antibody. This raises questions about the validity of the antibody. Has it been knockout-verified in IF?</p></disp-quote><p>We co-stained BEST1 with the endosome marker EEA1. The results show that BEST1 does not co-localize with EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), ruling out the cytoplasmic localization of BEST1. We agree that the basolateral vs. apical membrane localization of BEST1 will need further investigation. Please refer to our response to reviewer 2’s question #2. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the upper panel is P274R, which lost the membrane enrichment, while the bottom panel is I201T, which was not different from the WT control. The P274R mutant lost membrane enrichment, but the protein expression level was similar as the WT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Although we do not have a <italic>BEST1</italic> knockout RPE, there is no BEST1 immunoreactivity in RPE derived from WT iPSC until sufficient RPE maturation. It is challenging to compare antibody staining of endogenous BEST1 and fluorescently labelled exogenous BEST1 directly, especially because the former experiment was performed with hexagonally shaped, tight junction-connected RPEs which had been cultured in the same dish for over a month, while the latter was in freshly seeded RPEs which had not reformed the typical hexagonal shape and intercellular tight junctions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While the homology model is informative, the crystal structure of the KpBest L177T mutant does not provide any important insights. The KpBest L177T mutant is meant to model the hBEST1 I201T mutant. Not only is the mutated residue non-identical but of the 10 amino acids on either side of L177 (residues 167-187) only 3 amino acids are identical and not many more are structurally similar. Furthermore, KpBest is not a Cl channel, but a cation channel. It is puzzling why the authors did not use chicken BEST1, which has also been successfully crystalized and is very closely related to hBEST1. The shift in the helices shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> does not obviously provide any mechanistic insights. A more detailed analysis of the effects of this mutation on the channel pore are required, but since this is a cation channel, I am not sure that the conclusions would be relevant. The single channel analysis supports the authors' conclusions but would be more valuable if they were performed with cBest1. How many times was this experiment repeated?</p></disp-quote><p>Although cBest1 has a higher sequence identity with human BEST1 compared to KpBest, the two structures are very similar. Both KpBest and cBest1 are pentamers displaying a flower vase shaped ion permeation pathway with two narrow hydrophobic restrictions. Here, we used both KpBest crystal structures and cBest1 based human homology models to analyze the possible structural alterations in human BEST1 caused by the patient-specific mutations. Results from the two methods are consistent with each other, and supported by functional data. The bilayer results were from 3 independent experiments as indicated now in figure legends. Unfortunately, we currently do not have the capacity to purify cBest1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) No methods are provided about how the ERGs were measured. How long were patients dark-adapted? What was the light stimulus intensity/duration, etc.? More explanation is required about the &quot;age-matched controls&quot;. Were the controls measured co-temporaneously and how were they selected? Although the literature is a little ambiguous about ERG changes with age, I am a little surprised that normal teenagers have b-waves twice as large as a normal 72-year old. Not only should the authors provide more information about their own controls, but should compare their results to the published literature. At least one study shows no difference in b-wave amplitude between 20-39 year-olds and 60-82 year-olds (Doc Ophthalmol (2011) 122: 177.)</p></disp-quote><p>We used international standardized procedures to carry out the ERG (Kohl et al., 2015; McCulloch et al., 2015), and have included these two references in the manuscript (cited in the subsection “Patients and clinical analysis”). Following 10 minutes of light adaptation, the photopic 30-Hz flicker cone and transient photopic cone ERGs were recorded. A stimulus 0.6 log units greater than the ISCEV standard flash was also used to better demonstrate the a-wave, as suggested in the recent revision of the ISCEV standard for ERG. Subjects were dark-adapted for thirty minutes (ISCEV standards are at least twenty minutes). Autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy is a form of progressive generalized rod-cone dystrophy, and hence maximal ERG b-waves are expected to be lower in the 72-year-old affected subject. Control subjects were not measured contemporaneously with the patients. Our initial submission provided representative traces from exactly age-matched normal subjects in our routine clinic. As ERG results are sensitive to the setups and conditions of the measuring devices, it is more accurate to compare subjects measured in the same practice. We have revised the manuscript to “… contrasting 355 μV (median value) in healthy teenagers tested in the same device”, and “… contrasting 287 μV (median value) in age matched healthy people”, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Of the two mutations studied, the P274R is clearly the most dramatic. However, the impact of the cellular data are weakened because there are no electro-oculogram data presented for this patient. The authors should show current traces for the rescued cells and should show that the rescued currents have the same Ca sensitivity as WT. While the authors state that &quot;all patients display reduced LP&quot;, it is not clear exactly what this means. There are cases in the literature describing patients with BEST1 mutations that have normal LPs.</p></disp-quote><p>The rescued current traces and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity are now shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>. As the patient with the milder I201T mutation has no EOG light rise, we do not expect the patient with the more severe P274R mutation to have it. Furthermore, we would have trouble getting this patient’s EOG data on time for the paper resubmission because his insurance is not accepted by the hospital and he lives far from our location. Normal LPs in patients with <italic>BEST1</italic> mutations have never been seen in recessive cases, and they have been very rare for dominant cases. Both of our patients in this study are recessive. To address the reviewer’s concern, we have revised the sentence to “… reduced LP is a clinical feature in <italic>BEST1</italic> patients”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In most experiments, only 4-5 cells were tested. Were these cells all from the same RPE colony derived from the same iPSC culture, or are they from different RPE colonies? If these data are from a single colony, how can one be certain that the difference in ionic currents is not explained by technical differences between colonies?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this concern. In our initial submission, 5-6 cells were tested for each patch clamp data point except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, in which 3-5 P274R cells were included for each data point. Because P274R cells had no current at all tested [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]s, the variance between cells were extremely small, allowing us to draw a statistically significant conclusion with fewer cells. Moreover, we have now included more samples from different clones and/or differentiations in the new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>.
