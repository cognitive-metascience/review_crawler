Natural killer (NK) cells become activated when the receptor NKG2D is engaged by ligands that are frequently upregulated in primary tumors and on cancer cell lines. However, the molecular mechanisms driving NKG2D ligand expression on tumor cells are not well defined. Using a forward genetic screen in a tumor-derived human cell line, we identified several novel factors supporting expression of the NKG2D ligand ULBP1. Our results show stepwise contributions of independent pathways working at multiple stages of ULBP1 biogenesis. Deeper investigation of selected hits from the screen showed that the transcription factor ATF4 drives <italic>ULBP1</italic> gene expression in cancer cell lines, while the RNA-binding protein RBM4 supports ULBP1 expression by suppressing a novel alternatively spliced isoform of <italic>ULBP1</italic> mRNA. These findings offer insight into the stress pathways that alert the immune system to danger.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08474.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08474.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08474.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer is caused by a series of mutations that result in uncontrolled cell growth and division. Yet, the body's immune system can often detect and destroy abnormal cells before they cause tumors and disease. Natural killer cells are part of the immune system and have receptors on their surface that allow them to tell the difference between healthy host cells and host cells that are stressed or abnormal. Some of these receptors activate the natural killer cells when they bind to their target molecules. Other receptors have the opposite effect and inhibit the natural killer cells. Activation occurs when the signaling from the activating receptors is stronger than the signals from the inhibitory receptors.</p><p>One of the well-studied activating receptors recognizes a number of proteins and molecules that are produced by abnormal or tumor cells, including a protein called ULBP1. This protein is absent from the surface of healthy cells but is found in abundance on tumor cells. However, it is still not clear what drives tumor cells to produce ULBP1 (or other molecules) that are recognized by natural killer cell receptors.</p><p>Now, Gowen et al. report on a genetic screen that has revealed numerous genes that regulate the levels of ULBP1 in human cells. Many of these genes had independent effects that when added together accounted for most of the ULBP1 present on the cell surface.</p><p>Gowen et al. then explored some of the ‘regulators’ encoded by these genes in more detail. One called ATF4, which had previously been linked to stress responses, was shown to increase the expression of the gene for ULBP1 in cancer cells. Another regulator called RBM4 instead acted in a different way and at a later stage in ULBP1 production.</p><p>All together, these findings offer insight into the stress pathways that alert the immune system to abnormal cells. The next challenge will be investigating how these pathways might be exploited for cancer immunotherapy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08474.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08474.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>tumor immunology</kwd><kwd>natural killer cells</kwd><kwd>NKG2D</kwd><kwd>cellular stress</kwd><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muljo</surname><given-names>Stefan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Experience for Undergraduates, NSF 0552996</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>Teal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000008</institution-id><institution>David and Lucile Packard Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carette</surname><given-names>Jan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006978</institution-id><institution>University of California Berkeley (UC Berkeley)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K.

NK cell activation is controlled by a balance of signals from activating and inhibitory receptors, which recognize cognate ligands expressed by potential target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vivier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shifrin et al., 2014</xref>). One of the best-studied NK-activating receptors is NKG2D, which is also expressed on certain subsets of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raulet, 2003</xref>). Engagement of NKG2D by its ligands displayed on a target cell membrane leads to NK cell activation, cytokine secretion, and lysis of target cells, such as tumor cells.</p><p>NKG2D recognizes a family of ligands that are structurally similar to MHC Class I proteins. Humans express up to eight NKG2D ligands (ULBP1-6, MICA, and MICB), and mice express 5–6 different ligands, depending on the strain (RAE-1α-ε, H60a-c, and MULT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raulet et al., 2013</xref>). Healthy cells typically do not display NKG2D ligands on their surface and are thus poor targets for NKG2D-mediated lysis by NK cells. However, cellular stresses associated with transformation, viral infection, or other danger to the host cause the upregulation of NKG2D ligand expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raulet et al., 2013</xref>). Primary tumors and cancer cell lines frequently express one or more NKG2D ligand, and NKG2D expression is important for the control of tumors in vivo in models of spontaneous cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guerra et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Tumors arise despite the tumor-suppressive effects of the immune system, and some tumors show evidence of adaptation to escape immune control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schreiber et al., 2011</xref>). In the case of NKG2D-mediated tumor recognition, published results suggest that one mechanism of tumor immune evasion is the loss or decreased expression of NKG2D ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guerra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McGilvray et al., 2009</xref>). In other cases, tumors progress despite sustained expression of NKG2D ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vetter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guerra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McGilvray et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilpert et al., 2012</xref>). The evidence as a whole suggests that upregulation of NKG2D ligands on early stage tumor cells is part of a host defense mechanism, but that the immune response subsequently applies selective pressure for tumors that have either extinguished expression of NKG2D ligands or have activated immune suppressive mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raulet and Guerra, 2009</xref>). Therefore, identifying factors and pathways that regulate NKG2D ligands will improve our understanding of the cellular properties used by the immune system to define unwanted cells and will also help reveal how tumors evade the corresponding immune responses.</p><p>Prior investigations have identified regulators of NKG2D ligands using a candidate approach based on the roles of these regulators in known stress pathways. Such approaches have implicated the DNA damage response pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gasser et al., 2005</xref>), heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Venkataraman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nice et al., 2009</xref>), hyperproliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jung et al., 2012</xref>), and pattern recognition receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hamerman et al., 2004</xref>), among others, in the regulation of one or more NKG2D ligands. However, these pathways do not account fully for expression of ligands in tumor cells, since inhibiting them may decrease ligand expression but typically does not abrogate it. For example, the DNA damage response is active in many cancer cells and tumor cell lines, but inhibiting that pathway only partially inhibits ligand expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gasser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gasser and Raulet, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soriani et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, hyperproliferation can drive NKG2D ligand expression, but blocking proliferation does not completely eliminate NKG2D ligand expression by tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jung et al., 2012</xref>). These findings suggest that unidentified molecular cues in tumor cells also initiate the expression of NKG2D ligands, allowing potentially dangerous tumor cells to be distinguished from normal cells. Identifying those cues, especially for human NKG2D ligands, is important for understanding the biological regulation of NKG2D ligands and devising approaches for immunotherapy based on that knowledge.</p><p>To identify novel drivers of NKG2D ligand expression, we performed a genome-wide loss-of-expression mutant screen in the tumor-derived human cell line HAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carette et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carette et al., 2011</xref>) and used CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting methodology for confirmation of the hits and extension of the results. The results reveal previously unknown regulators for NKG2D ligands, provide evidence for selectivity of the regulators for specific ligands, and support the cooperation of different stress pathways in the regulation of one such ligand.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A genome-wide screen to identify novel drivers of ULBP1 expression</title><p>Many tumors and cancer cell lines express multiple NKG2D ligands, possibly due to ongoing stress responses associated with the transformed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raulet et al., 2013</xref>). To identify novel drivers of human NKG2D ligand expression in transformed cells, we employed a retroviral gene-trap mutagenesis screen using the near-haploid human cell line HAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carette et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carette et al., 2011</xref>). Like many cell lines, HAP1 cells express multiple NKG2D ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We chose to screen for drivers of ULBP1 expression because it showed the brightest staining on HAP1 cells, making it particularly amenable to our loss-of-expression screen. Following mutagenesis, we selected for mutants with decreased expression of ULBP1 but intact expression of the unrelated GPI-anchored protein CD55 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Selection of CD55<sup>+</sup> cells was used to reduce the fraction of selected cells that had lost ULBP1 expression due to mutations that alter cell surface expression of all proteins or of all GPI-linked proteins. In the first round of selection, we depleted ULBP1<sup>high</sup> cells from the mutant cell population using magnetic bead-based depletion of cells labeled with a ULBP1 antibody. After briefly expanding the selected cells, we used flow cytometry to further select for ULBP1<sup>low</sup>CD55<sup>+</sup> cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows ULBP1 and CD55 expression on WT and post-selection HAP1 cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08474.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A genetic screen of a haploid human cell line to identify regulators of ULBP1 expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HAP1 cells (∼10<sup>8</sup> cells) were transduced with a retroviral gene-trap vector.

Following a brief recovery and expansion of the cells, we used FACS to further enrich ULBP1<sup>low</sup>CD55<sup>+</sup> cells.

The genes chosen encode ATF4 (a stress-associated transcription factor), RBM4 (an RNA-binding protein), HSPA13 (a protein chaperone), and SPCS1 and SPCS2, which are both non-catalytic subunits of the signal peptidase complex.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08474.005</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Selected list of genes enriched for gene-trap insertions after selection of ULBP1<sup>low</sup>CD55<sup>+</sup> cells</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08474.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08474.005</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Gene symbol</th><th>Function/Process</th><th>p-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">PIGW</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">GPI synthesis/anchoring</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">1.12E-196</named-content></td></tr><tr><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">PIGQ</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">GPI synthesis/anchoring</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">3.26E-155</named-content></td></tr><tr><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">PIGB</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">GPI synthesis/anchoring</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">2.38E-103</named-content></td></tr><tr><td><bold>ULBP1</bold></td><td><bold>NKG2D ligand</bold></td><td><bold>2.65E-76</bold></td></tr><tr><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">PIGO</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">GPI synthesis/anchoring</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">1.49E-65</named-content></td></tr><tr><td><bold>RBM4</bold></td><td><bold>RNA-binding protein</bold></td><td><bold>1.29E-24</bold></td></tr><tr><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">PIGV</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">GPI synthesis/anchoring</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">4.43E-23</named-content></td></tr><tr><td><bold>SPCS1</bold></td><td><bold>Non-catalytic subunit of signal peptidase complex</bold></td><td><bold>1.25E-15</bold></td></tr><tr><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">PIGM</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">GPI synthesis/anchoring</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">6.06E-14</named-content></td></tr><tr><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style1">C1GALT1C1</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style1">Protein O-linked glycosylation</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style1">2.22E-13</named-content></td></tr><tr><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style1">SLC35A1</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style1">Golgi-localized CMP-sialic acid transporter</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style1">1.77E-12</named-content></td></tr><tr><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style1">ST3GAL2</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style1">Sialyltransferase</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style1">1.64E-11</named-content></td></tr><tr><td><bold>SPCS2</bold></td><td><bold>Non-catalytic subunit of signal peptidase complex</bold></td><td><bold>6.20E-09</bold></td></tr><tr><td><bold>HSPA13</bold></td><td><bold>Microsome-associated protein with ATPase activity</bold></td><td><bold>1.24E-05</bold></td></tr><tr><td>FLJ37453</td><td>Non-coding RNA</td><td>0.00115</td></tr><tr><td>SLC17A9*</td><td>Vesicular nucleotide transporter</td><td>0.00715</td></tr><tr><td>RPS25</td><td>Ribosomal protein</td><td>0.00715</td></tr><tr><td><bold>ATF4</bold></td><td><bold>Stress-induced transcription factor</bold></td><td><bold>0.0206</bold></td></tr><tr><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style1">PMM2</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style1">Oligosaccharide synthesis, protein glycosylation</named-content></td><td><named-content content-type="author-callout-style1">0.0234</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>NCRNA00167</td><td>Non-coding RNA</td><td>0.0363</td></tr><tr><td>CRNKL1*</td><td>Pre-mRNA splicing</td><td>0.0363</td></tr><tr><td>ICK</td><td>Intestinal cell kinase, MAPK-related</td><td>0.0363</td></tr><tr><td>TBC1D19</td><td>TBC domain-containing protein</td><td>0.0416</td></tr><tr><td>ZNF236</td><td>Zinc-finger protein</td><td>0.0496</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>The gene symbols of hits (p &lt;

The <italic>ULBP1</italic> gene was targeted for comparison. After HAP1 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding Cas9 and guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for each candidate gene, a population of ULBP1<sup>low</sup> cells appeared that was absent in control transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In each case, individual ULBP1<sup>low</sup> cells were sorted into 96-well plates, and expanded clones were screened for mutations by PCR and sequencing. For further analysis, we selected clones with insertions or deletions that resulted in frameshift mutations in each targeted gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since the sites targeted were near the beginning of each coding region and the cells are haploid, the frameshift mutations are expected to result in complete loss-of-function of the corresponding proteins. Analysis of HAP1 cell lysates by Western blot confirmed the loss-of-protein expression in ATF4, RBM4, and SPCS2 mutant cell lines (data not shown).</p><p>Cells with a <italic>ULBP1</italic> mutation lacked cell surface ULBP1 staining altogether, as expected, whereas the other mutations analyzed resulted in a partial (twofold to threefold) decrease in cell surface expression of ULBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The effect of each mutation was specific to ULBP1, as we found no change in cell surface expression of other proteins, including four other NKG2D ligands (ULBP2, ULBP3, MICA, and MICB), HLA Class I, the unrelated GPI-anchored protein CD59, or PVR and Nectin-2, the ligands for DNAM-1, another NK cell-activating receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The minor changes in ULBP3 staining seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref> were not consistently observed across experiments. The finding that the mutations each affect only ULBP1 among the NKG2D ligands tested supports the hypothesis that different NKG2D ligands are subject to distinct regulatory processes. It was surprising that <italic>SPCS1</italic> and <italic>SPCS2</italic> mutations only impacted cell surface staining of ULBP1 and not the six other membrane proteins tested, as we had expected that mutating components of the signal peptidase complex would cause a more generalized defect in cell surface protein expression (see ‘Discussion’). In all cases, ULBP1 expression on mutant lines could be restored by re-expressing the gene of interest with a doxycycline-inducible lentiviral vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Such stresses, including amino acid starvation, the unfolded protein response (UPR), oxidative stress, and the presence of dsRNA, induce ATF4 through phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rutkowski and Kaufman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suragani et al., 2012</xref>).

The transcriptional targets of ATF4 include amino acid transporters and protein chaperones, which in combination with the overall reduction in protein synthesis help mitigate the cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harding et al., 2003</xref>). However, ATF4 expression also drives the expression of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP (GADD153), suggesting that ATF4 not only drives adaptation to stress but also promotes cell death if the stress cannot be overcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2013</xref>).

Although histidinol and thapsigargin induce transcription of ATF4-regulated genes, they also inhibit protein synthesis, both directly (e.g., by limiting the availability of charged histidine tRNAs) and indirectly, by causing eIF2α phosphorylation. These opposing effects make it difficult to predict whether stress induction will result in increased amounts of any specific protein encoded by an ATF4-regulated gene. Nevertheless, in K-562 cells, we observed a dramatic ATF4-dependent induction of cell surface ULBP1 by histidinol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>). In HAP1 and Jurkat cells, in contrast, addition of histidinol induced ULBP1 cell surface expression slightly in WT cells, but caused decreased ULBP1 expression in <italic>ATF4</italic>-mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>), consistent with the aforementioned inhibition of protein synthesis resulting from histidinol treatments. Indeed, histidinol treatments resulted in substantially decreased cell surface expression of HLA proteins, which are not regulated by ATF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,E</xref>). As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, the overall effect of ATF4 induction by histidinol was to induce and/or maintain ULBP1 cell surface expression in the face of global protein synthesis inhibition associated with this stress pathway.</p><p>To address whether ATF4 directly regulates <italic>ULBP1</italic> transcription, we used ChIP-Seq analysis to determine whether it binds to <italic>ULBP1</italic> regulatory elements in histidinol-treated HAP1 cells.

No other notable ATF4 binding was observed in the 266 kb interval shown, which includes genes encoding five other functional NKG2D ligands (<italic>ULBP2-6; RAET1K</italic> is a pseudogene), at least two of which are expressed in HAP1 cells (<italic>ULBP2</italic> and <italic>ULBP3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, data not shown).

Loss-of-function mutations in each of the corresponding genes resulted in relatively modest reductions in cell surface ULBP1 when examined separately. The capacity of the screen to detect mutations that each have relatively small effects demonstrates its remarkable power to identify pathways that function in a partially redundant fashion. Overall, the data suggest that most of the pathways studied control different steps in the biogenesis of ULBP1, with ATF4 controlling transcription, RBM4 regulating RNA splicing, and HSPA13, SCPS1, and SPCS2 regulating co-translational or post-translational steps such as protein processing. The power of the CRISPR/Cas9 method to rapidly generate double- and triple-mutant cell lines led to the finding that disabling multiple regulators resulted in much more striking reductions in ULBP1 expression than disabling them individually. Thus, each regulator contributes incrementally to ULBP1 expression. This finding lends support to the hypothesis that stress pathways might cumulatively control the amount of a given NKG2D ligand displayed on the cell to define a quantitative ‘threat level’ confronting a cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raulet et al., 2013</xref>). Previously published evidence demonstrated that greater NK-dependent tumor elimination occurs with increasing amounts of cell surface NKG2D ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9a">Diefenbach et al., 2001</xref>), consistent with the ‘threat-level’ hypothesis.</p><p>When characterizing the phenotypes of our mutant HAP1 cell lines, we were surprised to find that in each case, ULBP1 was the only NKG2D ligand with substantially altered expression, the one exception being an increase in MICB expression observed on <italic>HSPA13</italic> KO cells. These data provide strong support for the proposal that different ligands are specialized with respect to their regulatory mechanisms, providing the capacity to respond to specific classes of threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raulet et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, certain other regulatory pathways, such as the DNA damage response, regulate several NKG2D ligands similarly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gasser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Soriani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raulet et al., 2013</xref>). The system as a whole, therefore, encompasses both generic and specific regulators.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>ATF4 and transcription of ULBP1</title><p>A key finding was that ATF4, a mediator of several stress responses, transcriptionally activates <italic>ULBP1</italic>. The data show that ATF4 binds to two locations at the <italic>ULBP1</italic> locus, including the promoter region, that an ATF4 site in the <italic>ULBP1</italic> promoter is essential for ATF4-induced transcription, and that ATF4 drives <italic>ULBP1</italic> transcription in wild-type cells. No additional ATF4 binding or transcriptional induction was detected for most other NKG2D ligand genes, although <italic>ULBP2</italic> was modestly upregulated by histidinol treatment in a manner partially dependent on ATF4. Since ATF4 was not bound to the <italic>ULBP2</italic> promoter, we speculate that <italic>ULBP2</italic> transcription is regulated by a transcription factor that is induced by ATF4, or that ATF4 binding to the sites in the <italic>ULBP1</italic> gene modestly activates the neighboring <italic>ULBP2</italic> gene.</p><p>Disruption of <italic>ATF4</italic> resulted in reduced ULBP1 expression under steady-state conditions in all three of the cell lines tested. These data suggest that ATF4 activity caused by constitutive stress in tumor cell lines contributes to ULBP1 expression. This finding has physiological relevance, as overexpression of UPR components has been found in primary tumors and cell lines derived from breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernandez et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fujimoto et al., 2003</xref>), hepatocellular carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shuda et al., 2003</xref>), and multiple myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reimold et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Munshi et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The three cell lines we examined illustrate the different ways that ATF4 can support steady-state ULBP1 expression in different contexts. In some cases, expression of ULBP1 may be critically dependent on ATF4. This is the case in unstimulated K-562 cells in which basal ULBP1 expression was detected (though weakly) in WT cells but was absent from the surface of <italic>ATF4</italic> KO cells. In other cases, exemplified by HAP1 and Jurkat cells, numerous factors contribute to ULBP1 expression, with ATF4 being only one of them. Those cells had higher basal ULBP1 expression than K-562 cells and showed a modest decrease in ULBP1 expression when <italic>ATF4</italic> was mutated.</p><p>The impact of ATF4 on <italic>ULBP1</italic> transcription was most notable when additional stressors were applied that induce ATF4 expression. Outcomes at the level of protein expression are difficult to predict a priori, because these stressors induce transcription of ATF4 target genes, but also cause global suppression of translation as a result of eIF2α phosphorylation. We observed a range of outcomes in different cell lines. Amino acid starvation of K-562 cells, imparted by histidinol treatment, caused a substantial increase in <italic>ULBP1</italic> mRNA and surface protein, and the response was ablated in <italic>ATF4</italic> KO cells. In this case, the increase in <italic>ULBP1</italic> transcription overwhelmed the global decrease in translation. In contrast, in HAP1 and Jurkat cells, amino acid starvation of WT cells caused a fivefold to sevenfold increase in <italic>ULBP1</italic> mRNA, but a much smaller increase in ULBP1 protein at the cell surface. Nevertheless, the impact of ATF4 was made apparent by the observation that ULBP1 protein levels <italic>decreased</italic> on the surface of similarly stressed <italic>ATF4</italic> KO cells. In these cell lines, therefore, the induction of <italic>ULBP1</italic> transcription by ATF4 serves to <italic>maintain</italic> (and slightly increase) expression of ULBP1 protein in the face of cellular stress. Maintaining ULBP1 expression that is induced by distinct regulatory pathways is important in cells where translational inhibition is likely to occur, such as in hypoxic tumors.</p><p>Our finding that <italic>ULBP1</italic> expression is regulated by ATF4 fits the existing paradigm for ATF4 target genes. ATF4 is induced by amino acid starvation, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and the UPR. ATF4 target genes include amino acid transporters, anti-oxidant response genes, angiogenic factors, and protein chaperones, and thus, ATF4 initially promotes cell survival against these insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jain, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roybal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies have shown that ATF4 expression is frequently induced in primary tumors and tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernandez et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shuda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma and Hendershot, 2004</xref>). Inadequate vascularization can cause tumors to become hypoxic and nutrient-starved, two conditions known to induce ATF4. Indeed, ATF4 expression is highest in hypoxic regions of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ameri et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi et al., 2005</xref>). However, the pro-apoptotic targets of ATF4, such as <italic>CHOP</italic>, provide an important safety mechanism for the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>). Without a pro-apoptotic component, the transcriptional targets of ATF4 would be ripe for exploitation by expanding tumors, which are often poorly vascularized, and consequently both hypoxic and starved. Upregulation of ULBP1 by ATF4 provides an additional layer of host defense, marking potentially dangerous cells for elimination by the immune system. Although not explored in this study, induction of ULBP1 by ATF4 may also play a role in antiviral immunity. As mentioned above, ATF4 expression is induced by phosphorylation of eIF2α. Viral infection can activate PERK and PKR, which phosphorylate eIF2α and therefore induce ATF4 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mohr and Sonenberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jheng et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>RBM4 and splicing of <italic>ULBP1</italic> transcripts</title><p>We identified RBM4 as a second factor responsible for steady-state ULBP1 expression in HAP1 cells. RBM4-deficient cells exhibited a twofold to threefold reduction in cell surface ULBP1 and the corresponding canonical <italic>ULBP1</italic> mRNA isoform.

Transcripts containing premature stop codons can be targets for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maquat, 2004</xref>), but we could nonetheless detect the alternative <italic>ULBP1</italic> transcript by RNA-Seq. The degree to which the alternative <italic>ULBP1</italic> transcript is degraded by NMD is presently unclear. RBM4 has also been implicated in other forms of gene regulation, including translation and microRNA-mediated gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin and Tarn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Uniacke et al., 2012</xref>). In HAP1 cells, however, the change in cell surface ULBP1 in <italic>RBM4</italic> KO cells was commensurate with the change in canonically spliced transcripts, suggesting that these other mechanisms do not play an appreciable role. It remains possible that RBM4 influences ULBP1 translation or gene expression in other cells or contexts.</p><p>It was recently reported that RBM4 regulates the alternative splicing of numerous cancer-related genes. Most interesting, in light of our findings, was the finding based on RNA-Seq analysis that RBM4 expression promoted a tumor-suppressive splicing profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2014a</xref>). This action occurred in part through the alternative splicing of the <italic>BCL2L1</italic> gene (<italic>Bcl-x</italic>), wherein RBM4 promoted splicing that generated the pro-apoptotic isoform Bcl-xS, at the expense of the anti-apoptotic isoform Bcl-xL. Our data suggest that RBM4 further promotes tumor suppression by favoring the canonical splicing of <italic>ULBP1</italic> mRNA, marking cells for elimination by the immune system. Decreased RBM4 expression has been observed in various cancers compared to paired healthy tissues, including lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Furthermore, lower RBM4 expression correlated with decreased patient survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2014a</xref>). We speculate that tumor cells are under selective pressure to downregulate RBM4 expression, as this would allow tumors to evade tumor-suppressive events such as expression of Bcl-xS and ULBP1.</p><p>An interesting question is whether the splicing functions of RBM4 are subject to stress-regulation. Intriguingly, the subcellular localization of RBM4 is reportedly regulated by oxidative stress or activation of the MKK<sub>3/6</sub>-p38 MAPK pathway. In that instance, however, stress favored the cytoplasmic localization of RBM4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2007</xref>), where it reportedly enhanced translation of a subset of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin and Tarn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Uniacke et al., 2012</xref>). Additional studies will be necessary to establish whether regulated re-localization of RBM4, or other types of regulation, impact alternative splicing of <italic>ULBP1</italic> or other transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>HSPA13</title><p>HSPA13 (also known as STCH) belongs to the Hsp70 family of chaperone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Otterson et al., 1994</xref>). HSPA13 is associated with microsomes and displays ATPase activity, but little is known about its function, including whether HSPA13 participates in cellular stress responses. One report showed that HSPA13 binds to the ion transporters NBCe1 and NHE1, which help maintain intracellular pH homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2013</xref>). HSPA13 overexpression increased NBCe1 and NHE1 protein levels and functional activity. It will be interesting to pursue the mechanisms by which HSPA13 supports expression of ULBP1, which could be through direct or indirect effects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>SPCS1 and SPCS2</title><p>SPCS1 and SPCS2 are non-catalytic subunits of the signal peptidase complex, but surprisingly little is known about their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mullins et al., 1996</xref>). We were surprised that HAP1 cells lacking <italic>SPCS1</italic> or <italic>SPCS2</italic> did not have a more general defect in cell surface protein expression; out of seven cell surface proteins tested, only ULBP1 expression was decreased. However, it should be noted that seven proteins represent a small fraction of the proteome, and we expect that a proteome-wide investigation would reveal many additional affected proteins. In yeast, SPCS1 and SPCS2 are required for maximal signal peptidase activity under certain growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mullins et al., 1996</xref>), and in mammalian cells, SPCS1 supports expression of the HCV protein NS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>). It will be of future interest to define the properties that determine if a given secreted or membrane protein depends on SPCS1 and SPCS2 for maximal expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Final remarks</title><p>The drivers of ULBP1 expression we have identified are likely to cooperate with previously described stress pathways that regulate ULBP1. Other transcription factors known to bind the <italic>ULBP1</italic> gene and drive gene expression include Sp1, Sp3, and the tumor suppressor protein p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">López-Soto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Textor et al., 2011</xref>). It is possible that one or more of these factors contribute to <italic>ULBP1</italic> transcription in HAP1 and Jurkat cells, considering that residual ULBP1 expression was observed even after ATF4 was disrupted. Additional stress pathways including heat shock, E2F transcription factors, and the DNA damage response drive expression of other NKG2D ligands, and the combined expression level of all the NKG2D ligands on a given cell will contribute to its ability to activate NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gasser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Venkataraman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jung et al., 2012</xref>). HAP1 cells may be representative of a very high ‘threat level’, as they had activated numerous ULBP1 drivers, and independent drivers for several other NKG2D ligands. Moreover, these cells possessed potent NK-activating properties distinct from NKG2D ligands, as shown by studies with NKG2D-deficient NK cells (data not shown). Probably as a consequence, loss of ULBP1 drivers, and even ULBP1 itself, had little detectable effect on the capacity of HAP1 cells to stimulate a response (data not shown).</p><p>The layers of ULBP1 regulation we have described could allow NKG2D ligand expression to be fine-tuned to reflect the ‘threat level’ of the cell. ATF4 could upregulate <italic>ULBP1</italic> transcription, but other factors may amplify the extent of ULBP1 transcription. Maximal cell surface expression would require RBM4 to direct splicing of the functional mRNA isoform, followed by maximal translation and trafficking of the protein to the cell surface. Ubiquitous RBM4 expression is ‘safe’ for normal, healthy cells, since functional <italic>ULBP1</italic> cannot be spliced unless the gene is transcribed in the first place.</p><p>The results of our screen highlight diverse mechanisms for the control of NKG2D ligand expression. To the best of our knowledge, none of the hits we investigated are related to previously known drivers of ULBP1 or other NKG2D ligands, and the effects found were generally specific to ULBP1. Screens for drivers of other NKG2D ligands will be the subject of future work, and the advent of CRISPR/Cas9-based screens will enable screens to be carried out in many different cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2014b</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells, antibodies, and reagents</title><p>Cell cultures were performed at 37°C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Gowen et al. reports on a retroviral trap-based genetic screen in the human haploid cancer cell line HAP1 to identify regulators of ULBP1, a ligand for NKGD2. They identify several hits that are confirmed by CRISPR/Cas9 gene inactivation. The major emphasis of the manuscript is on ATF4, which is shown to positively regulate ULBP1 in two other cancer cell lines. This effect is accentuated by activation of the unfolded protein response, and is relatively selective for ULBP1 in comparison to other NKGD2 ligands. Consistent with this, ATF4 is shown to bind near the <italic>ULBP1</italic> promoter, but not near genes encoding other NKGD2 ligands. The authors further show that a second hit, RBM4, is required for appropriate splicing of ULBP1. The authors conclude that their findings provide insights into the stress pathways that alert the immune system to danger. Overall the experiments appear to be carefully performed and clearly establish ATF4 and RBM4 as regulators of the expression ULBP1 in the cell lines examined. There was substantial enthusiasm for these findings among the three reviewers. One reviewer remarked: “Overall this paper provides new information on the regulation of NKG2D ligands expression, identifying 5 molecules previously unknown to be involved in ULBP1 expression. The method used is elegant, the results are convincing and the paper is well written.” A second reviewer commented: “Overall this is an excellent and insightful study with novel findings that are fully supported by the data and importantly advance the field on NKG2D/NKG2DL research.”</p><p>1) One significant concern was raised that needs to be addressed in a revised manuscript. The authors conclude that binding of ATF4 to the <italic>ULBP1</italic> gene indicates direct transcriptional control. That is almost certainly the case given the other evidence, but DNA binding per se is not a sufficient proof of direct regulation. Many transcription factor binding events are not associated with gene activation when assessed on a genome-wide scale. An assessment of the requirement of the binding site for activation is needed. This could be done fairly easily by a transient reporter gene assays using wild type and ATF4 binding site mutants.</p><p>2) The RBM4 mutation seems to affect MICA transcription in the first intron. The authors may comment on that.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08474.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) One significant concern was raised that needs to be addressed in a revised manuscript.

The data from transient luciferase reporter assays indicate that a fragment of the <italic>ULBP1</italic> promoter is activated by ATF4. Mutation of the ATF4 binding motif found in the <italic>ULBP1</italic> promoter ablates this response. Together with the other data in the paper, these data provide solid evidence that ATF4 drives transcription of the <italic>ULBP1</italic> gene.</p><p><italic>2) The RBM4 mutation seems to affect MICA transcription in the first intron. The authors may comment on that</italic>.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>, we did not observe any significant change in the number of reads in the first intron. On the other hand, the <italic>RBM4</italic> KO sample does have more RNA-seq reads spanning the splice junction between exons 1 and 2 than does the WT sample. The meaning of this result is not clear, especially considering that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows no difference in MICA surface expression between WT and <italic>RBM4</italic> KO cells. We think it is best to not comment on this in the main text and merely present the data as it is in the supplement, with a short comment in the figure legend.</p></body></sub-article></article>
