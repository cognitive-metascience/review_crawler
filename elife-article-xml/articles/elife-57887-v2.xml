for integral membrane proteins that are assembled at the endoplasmic reticulum. An abundant and widely conserved multi-protein complex termed EMC has been implicated in membrane protein biogenesis, but its mechanism of action is poorly understood. Here, we define the composition and architecture of human EMC using biochemical assays, crystallography of individual subunits, site-specific photocrosslinking, and cryo-EM reconstruction. Our results suggest that EMC’s cytosolic domain contains a large, moderately hydrophobic vestibule that can bind a substrate’s transmembrane domain (TMD). The cytosolic vestibule leads into a lumenally-sealed, lipid-exposed intramembrane groove large enough to accommodate a single substrate TMD. A gap between the cytosolic vestibule and intramembrane groove provides a potential path for substrate egress from EMC. These findings suggest how EMC facilitates energy-independent membrane insertion of TMDs, explain why only short lumenal domains are translocated by EMC, and constrain models of EMC’s proposed chaperone function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>membrane proteins</kwd><kwd>organelle biogenesis</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UP_A022_1007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hegde</surname><given-names>Ramanujan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UP_1201/10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM078186</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM130051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keenan</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 18-2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Donnell</surname><given-names>John P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phillips</surname><given-names>Ben Photon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007428</institution-id><institution>Naito Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yagita</surname><given-names>Yuichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Japanese Biochemical Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yagita</surname><given-names>Yuichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P2ELP3_18910</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malinverni</surname><given-names>Duccio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and biochemical analysis of an abundant and conserved protein complex called EMC shows how it is likely to insert nascent membrane proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site for biogenesis of nearly all eukaryotic integral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shao and Hegde, 2011a</xref>). The defining feature of these proteins is the presence of one or more α-helical TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">von Heijne, 2007</xref>). Successful biogenesis requires each of these TMDs to be moved from the aqueous phase of the cytosol into the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guna and Hegde, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">White and von Heijne, 2005</xref>). Although this insertion reaction can occur unassisted in vitro for some substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brambillasca et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brambillasca et al., 2006</xref>), insertion in the crowded cellular environment typically requires factors that facilitate the reaction to minimize off-pathway outcomes such as aggregation, mislocalization, and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anghel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guna et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heinrich et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Samuelson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The best understood insertion factor is the protein translocation channel formed by the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rapoport et al., 2017</xref>). Structural studies have demonstrated that the Sec61α subunit contains an hourglass pore across the membrane for polypeptide translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Van den Berg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Voorhees et al., 2014</xref>). The wall of this pore contains a lateral gate that opens to provide hydrophobic domains in a substrate access to the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gogala et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Voorhees and Hegde, 2016</xref>). Thus, Sec61 is thought to facilitate TMD insertion by its distinctive architecture that connects the aqueous environment in the cytosol to the hydrophobic environment inside the membrane.</p><p>In addition to the Sec61 complex, the ER contains two other widely conserved insertases that both mediate the insertion of tail-anchored (TA) membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guna and Hegde, 2018</xref>). TA proteins contain a single TMD close to the C-terminus with a short unstructured domain translocated across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kutay et al., 1993</xref>). This topology necessitates that the TMD is inserted post-translationally. The ‘guided entry of TA proteins’ (GET) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hegde and Keenan, 2011</xref>) culminates at a heterodimeric complex (made of the ER-resident membrane proteins Get1 and Get2) that inserts TA proteins delivered to it by the targeting factor Get3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mariappan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). More recently, the ten-subunit ‘ER membrane protein complex’ (EMC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christianson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jonikas et al., 2009</xref>) was shown to insert TA proteins whose TMDs are insufficiently hydrophobic to effectively engage TRC40, the mammalian homolog of Get3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guna et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In addition to TA proteins, EMC mediates co-translational insertion of TMDs close to the N-terminus in the N<sub>exo</sub> topology (defined by a translocated N-terminus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chitwood et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, the translocated domain is short and unstructured. When the N-terminus is extended and preceded by a signal peptide, insertion is no longer EMC-dependent and occurs instead via the Sec61α lateral gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chitwood et al., 2018</xref>). Although the topology of N<sub>exo</sub> TMDs is opposite to the TMDs of TA proteins, they are both terminal TMDs whose insertion is not accompanied by appreciable polypeptide translocation. The EMC-mediated insertion reactions of both types of terminal TMDs has been reconstituted with purified EMC in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chitwood et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guna et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that they might use similar mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chitwood and Hegde, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The ten subunits of mammalian EMC (termed EMC1 through EMC10) are poorly understood because they have very few clearly established domains or resemblance to proteins of known structure or biochemical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wideman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The one possible exception is the three-TMD protein EMC3, which is predicted to be topologically and evolutionarily related to Get1 and a subdomain of the prokaryotic insertase YidC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anghel et al., 2017</xref>). It has been speculated that this potential structural similarity reflects a similarity in molecular function.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>EMC2•EMC8 and EMC2•EMC9 form complexes that can bind a TMD.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of predicted EMC mass distribution and subunits.

This aggregate product is progressively reduced to a comparable extent by the inclusion of EMC2, EMC2•EMC8, or EMC2•EMC9. By contrast, EMC9 alone is not able to reduce aggregation, while EMC8 alone has a partial effect on aggregation. Note that the crosslinking observed to EMC9 when it is added in isolation is probably due to its co-aggregation with substrate and not a protective interaction because the substrate aggregate product is not diminished appreciably.

EMC8 and EMC9 are ~44% identical in mammals, and not all species contain both genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wideman, 2015</xref>). Whether they are both part of a single 10-protein complex or substitute for each other in a 9-protein complex is not known.

Thus, EMC is thought to function as a stable complex to mediate TMD insertion. Notably, this reaction appears to be energy independent in reconstitution assays in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guna et al., 2018</xref>), consistent with the absence of any nucleotide-binding domain in any of its subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wideman, 2015</xref>).</p><p>EMC has also been suggested to act as a co-translational chaperone that captures individual or bundles of TMDs as they exit laterally from the Sec61 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shurtleff et al., 2018</xref>). This postulated function has been inferred from analysis of EMC-mediated co-translational proximity biotinylation of ribosomes translating membrane proteins. How EMC might act as a chaperone, and the relationship of this function to its insertase activity, is not known. Consistent with either function, many membrane proteins are partially or strongly impacted in their biogenesis by the loss of EMC in numerous organisms including yeast, worms, flies, and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bircham et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chitwood et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guna et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lakshminarayan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Louie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Richard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Satoh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shurtleff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Talbot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taylor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Volkmar et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, EMC is a highly abundant component of the ER needed for cellular and organism homeostasis.</p><p>Understanding the function(s) of EMC requires knowledge of its structure. By analogy to the Sec61 complex, EMC’s insertase function might involve a path from the cytosol into the membrane. To investigate this idea, we used a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and structural approaches to determine the architecture of EMC. Our findings suggest that the cytosolic subunits initially engage a TMD in a weakly hydrophobic vestibule that is contiguous with an intramembrane groove open to the lipid bilayer. This work provides a mechanistic framework for how the highly abundant and conserved EMC functions as a TMD insertase, explains why EMC acts preferentially on terminal TMDs, and suggests that EMC is unlikely to chaperone TMDs released at the Sec61α lateral gate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cytosolic EMC subunits can engage a substrate TMD</title><p>Purified native EMC reconstituted in proteoliposomes is sufficient to catalyze the insertion of a TA protein substrate containing the TMD from squalene synthase (SQS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guna et al., 2018</xref>).

structure. The only region of EMC2•EMC9 that did not precisely align with the EM-density was the first three alpha-helices of EMC2 comprising residues 11–66 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Low frequency normal mode analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Suhre and Sanejouand, 2004</xref>) predicted that these three helices undergo structural movement that would be compatible with the EM-density. Therefore, the EMC2•EMC9 structure was refined against the EM-density using Flex-EM, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Topf et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>Coot</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>), and PHENIX real-space refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afonine et al., 2018</xref>), resulting in a slightly rotated position that fits into the EM-density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The plane of the membrane was evident from the detergent micelle surrounding the TMD region of EMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Relative to the membrane, the EMC2•EMC9 complex is oriented such that the TPR-repeats of EMC2 are proximal to the membrane but angled at ~30°. In this configuration, the substrate binding cavity of EMC2•EMC9 has access to both the bulk cytosol and the membrane domain of EMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The surface of EMC2 that faces the membrane domain is also highly conserved, consistent with this region making contacts with the membrane-embedded subunits of EMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, the cytosolic subunits of EMC are arranged so the cavity capable of binding substrate forms a vestibule that links the cytosol to the integral membrane subunits that would act next to mediate TMD insertion.</p><p>The region of the vestibule that binds substrates as determined in crosslinking assays is occupied in the cryo-EM map by density that is contributed from another EMC subunit (possibly EMC6, as discussed below). Intramolecular placeholders that temporarily shield the substrate-binding pockets are also observed in the membrane protein targeting factors SRP and Get3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mateja et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Voorhees and Hegde, 2015</xref>). In both of these other examples, the placeholders are less hydrophobic than substrate TMDs, allowing their displacement by bona fide substrates but presumably not other proteins. EMC may therefore operate similarly. Thus the putative placeholder density might provide an approximation of what a substrate-bound intermediate of EMC looks like. From this position, an inserting substrate would next have to engage the region of EMC embedded in the membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Architecture of the membrane-embedded and lumenal regions of EMC</title><p>A cross section through the detergent micelle of the EMC map in the plane of the membrane showed the arrangement of thirteen putative TMD helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Using trRosetta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yang et al., 2020</xref>), which employs co-evolutionary data, deep learning, and inter-residue contacts for energy minimization of structural models, we produced models for EMC3, EMC4, EMC5, and EMC6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Even though trRosetta does not consider biological membranes or topology, the predicted TMDs of EMC3 and EMC5 pack together as helices whose lengths match the thickness of a lipid bilayer.

More surprisingly, EMC4 also is predicted by trRosetta to have three TMD-like helices, not two as previously thought based on topology algorithms. Protease-protection assays resolved this discrepancy in favor of the trRosetta model because we found that the N-terminus of EMC4 faces the cytosol and the C-terminus is in the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The trRosetta models for EMC3, EMC6, and EMC5 could be docked at distinctive positions into the EM map based on their helix lengths and relative tilts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The main remaining region that could accommodate a three-helix bundle was therefore assigned to EMC4. This left two TMD-like densities and three single-spanning EMC subunits (EMC1, EMC7, and EMC10). Because EMC10 can be depleted with no functional consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Volkmar et al., 2019</xref>), we suspected this subunit was probably peripheral and least likely to be visualized in the map. We therefore assigned the two remaining TMD-like densities to EMC1 and EMC7, distinguishing between them using a site-specific photo-crosslinking approach.</p><p>The photo-crosslinking amino acid 3'-azibutyl-N-carbamoyl-lysine (AbK) was introduced by amber suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ai et al., 2011</xref>) into specific sites of individual FLAG-tagged EMC subunits. The cells were then UV-irradiated to induce crosslinks with nearby proteins (with a backbone-to-backbone distance of ~10–15 Å) and the samples were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Three and four sequential positions were tested within a TMD to sample different radial directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCormick et al., 2003</xref>). Introduction of AbK at position I23<sup>AbK</sup> in the first TMD of EMC3 showed a strong high-molecular weight crosslink consistent with the size of EMC1. EMC1 immunoblotting of natively purified EMC via the FLAG-tagged EMC3 verified that the UV-dependent EMC3 crosslinking partner is EMC1. Denaturing IP of EMC1 followed by anti-FLAG immunoblotting further validated this assignment. The EMC1 crosslink is sharply diminished at positions T24<sup>AbK</sup> and F25<sup>AbK</sup>, but is partially recovered at position F26<sup>AbK</sup>, thereby defining the face of this TMD helix that is adjacent to EMC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>Similar experiments placing AbK in other parts of EMC3 showed that TMD2, but not TMD3, is near EMC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>; results summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These results not only validated the trRosetta model for EMC3, but also assigned the position of EMC1’s sole TMD within the EM density. The remaining TMD-like density in the EM map was assigned to the TMD of EMC7 and supported by Abk-mediated crosslinks seen from TMD2 of EMC3. Additional crosslinking data between EMC5 and EMC6 supported our overall placements for the TMD regions of EMC subunits, resulting in a provisional model for the membrane domain of EMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>The EM density in the cytosolic domain contains regions not accounted by EMC2 or EMC8/9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). The regions of additional density in the cytosolic vestibule extend from the TMDs of EMC1 and possibly EMC6. Consistent with these being core features of EMC, the C-terminal tail of EMC1 and the N-terminal tail of EMC6 are highly conserved. Most of the remaining density could be fitted with minor adjustments to the trRosetta model for the cytosolic domains of EMC3. In particular, a three-helix bundle formed of the coiled-coil between TMD1 and TMD2 in complex with a helix in the C-terminal tail fit well into a pyramidal density on the backside of EMC2. This three-helix bundle is predicted based on co-evolution analysis using trRosetta. Consistent with this placement, AbK positioned in the EMC3 coiled coil where it approaches the three-helix bundle of EMC4 forms a UV-mediated EMC3-EMC4 crosslink. The remainder of the cytosolic density might correspond to EMC3’s C-terminal tail. Thus, EMC2 organizes EMC’s membrane subunits via its multi-pronged interactions with EMC1, EMC3, and EMC6, explaining why the membrane domain of EMC falls apart completely in the absence of EMC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Volkmar et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The lumenal region of EMC is almost entirely composed of the lumenal domains of EMC1, EMC7, and EMC10. Predictions of their structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) generated models that could be unambiguously docked into the lumenal region of the EM map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In these models, EMC1 contains two beta-propellers, while EMC7 and EMC10 each contain a small beta-barrel of different sizes. Using these distinctive features to guide docking, other regions of continuous density could be assigned to other parts of the predicted models with minor adjustments. The most prominent additional feature was a long conserved amphipathic helix flanked by two long unstructured linkers. We assigned this EMC1 helix to a conspicuous density (termed the crossbar) that sits at the interface between the lumen and membrane. Inspection of the density at the plane of the crossbar where the TMDs interact with the lumenal domain shows that EMC does not have a pore across the membrane that connects the cytosolic vestibule to the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>In sum, all of the membrane-embedded and lumenal density in the EM map could be accounted for by rigid body fitting the independently generated trRosetta models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These models were subsequently real-spaced refined into the density using PHENIX. The combination of atomic resolution structures, contact-informed modeling, photocrosslinking, and moderate resolution EM-density allow the positioning of individual subunits to produce a composite EMC structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). The composite structural model accounts for the majority of EMC polypeptides with the exception of the TMD of EMC10 and flexible loops and termini of many subunits.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>EM refinement statistics.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Resolution for refinement (Å)</td><td valign="top">6.4</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">CC<sub>Mask</sub></td><td valign="top">0.72</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">RMS deviations</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Bond length (Å)</td><td valign="top">0.005</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Bond angle (°)</td><td valign="top">1.028</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">No. of atoms</td><td valign="top">9412</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Protein residues</td><td valign="top">1906</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ramachandran Outliers (%)</td><td valign="top">0.49</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Mean B-factors (<sup>2</sup>)</td><td valign="top">200.0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">MolProbity score</td><td valign="top">2.77</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Clash score</td><td valign="top">31.03</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">PDB code</td><td valign="top">6Z3W</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The vestibule leads into a lipid-exposed intramembrane groove</title><p>A TMD substrate in the cytosolic vestibule of EMC needs to access the membrane interior for insertion. Furthermore, any route into the membrane should not only be accessible from the vestibule, but also be separated from the vestibule by a gap exposed to the cytosol. The gap is crucial for release of substrate from EMC; without it, the polypeptide segment between the substrate’s TMD and cytosolic domain could not pass into the cytosol. This is analogous to the Sec61 complex, where a gap of ~10 Å separates the cytosolic end of the lateral gate and the ribosome surface surrounding the mouth of the polypeptide exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Voorhees et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The cytosolic vestibule is continuous with a large horseshoe-shaped groove lined by the TMDs of EMC1, EMC3, EMC6, and EMC5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; red star in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The lumenal side of this groove contains the crossbar contributed by EMC1. The groove stretches deep into the membrane and is open laterally toward the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>,). Importantly, the cytosolic side of this groove at the N-terminus of EMC5 is separated from EMC2 by a clear gap of ~9 Å. This region of EMC2 is also predicted to be flexible and could move further away as needed during substrate insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, a substrate TMD in the vestibule could potentially enter this groove and diffuse away from EMC with the cytosolic flanking polypeptide passing through the EMC2-EMC5 gap. Future mutagenesis experiments of groove-lining residues and site-specific crosslinking to substrates are needed to validate the proposed pathway of insertion.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The cytosolic vestibule leads into an intramembrane groove.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The cytosolic vestibule in EMC2•EMC9 (grey surface) is contiguous with a horseshoe-shaped intramembrane groove lined by the TMDs of EMC1, EMC3, EMC5, and EMC6.

Our analysis of EMC leads to a plausible mechanistic model for how it moves TMDs close to the N- or C-terminus of a protein from the aqueous cytosol to the membrane interior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The partially hydrophobic character of a TMD favours binding to the cytosolic vestibule formed by the EMC2•EMC8 or EMC2•EMC9 complex. This vestibule is constitutively open to the cytosol, is shallow, and is only moderately hydrophobic. In these respects, EMC’s vestibule differs from the targeting factors SRP and Get3, both of which have deeper, more hydrophobic grooves. These differences reflect their distinct roles: SRP and Get3 ferry TMDs through the cytosol to the membrane, while EMC engages TMDs that are already at the membrane. Thus, EMC2•EMC9 does not need to fully cover the TMD or bind to it stably; it instead serves as a portal of entry. Stable substrate binding to EMC2•EMC9 is not needed and might even be detrimental by impeding TMD release into the membrane.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for EMC-mediated TMD insertion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TMDs follow a gradient of increasing hydrophobicity from the cytosol through EMC and into the lipid bilayer. TMDs first enter the cytosolic vestibule formed by either the EMC2•EMC8 or EMC2•EMC9 complex. This vestibule leads into an intramembrane groove that is laterally open toward the lipid bilayer. (<bold>B</bold>) The ribosome-Sec61 complex is depicted with EMC at the same scale in the same membrane plane. The minimum distance from the Sec61 lateral gate to the intramembrane groove of EMC is ~110 Å. This implies that EMC can only mediate TMD insertion before ribosomes bind to Sec61 or if the polypeptide downstream of a TMD can span this distance. EMC cannot capture TMDs at the Sec61 lateral gate.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57887-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>EMC, like SRP and Get3, contains a conserved intramolecular ‘placeholder’ that sits in the substrate binding site and must be displaced by substrate. Hence, substrates that engage EMC2•EMC9 must not only be more favourable within the vestibule than in the aqueous environment, but also more favourable in the vestibule than the placeholder. These constraints may provide a degree of specificity for potential TMDs and discriminate against hydrophilic sequences. The conformation of substrates within the vestibule is not known, but might not be a helix in contrast to TMDs bound by SRP or Get3. This is because helix formation of a TMD occurs when shielding the polypeptide backbone is more favourable than exposing it to solvent. Because the vestibule is shallow, exposed to aqueous solvent, and has appreciable hydrophilic surfaces, the nascent TMD is likely to be unstructured when it first binds. This mode of binding might allow different regions of the vestibule to accommodate different types of TMDs. Furthermore, by exposing the backbone amides and carbonyls, even rather hydrophobic TMDs could be temporarily accommodated within a partially hydrophilic vestibule.</p><p>From the vestibule, the polypeptide has two points of egress: back toward the cytosol or into the intramembrane groove. This choice would be influenced by the polypeptide’s properties. Hydrophilic polypeptides that transiently sampled the groove spuriously would diffuse back into the cytosol. Similarly, internal segments of polypeptides with large domains on either side would be sterically disfavoured from entering the groove. In this way, access into the groove serves as a filter that preferentially favors entry of terminal TMDs. Regardless of the precise register of the TMDs that form the intramembrane groove, its surface is more hydrophobic than the cytosolic vestibule. We therefore posit that polypeptide movement into the groove would be accompanied by helix formation. We expect substrate residence time in the groove would be minimal because it is open to the lipid bilayer. It is likely that TMD movement into the groove, helix formation, and partitioning into the membrane interior occur in rapid succession. Thus, the cytosol, vestibule, groove, and membrane interior are connected via a gradient of hydrophobicity that a TMD follows during its energy-independent insertion by EMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>The topology of the TMD would be influenced by steric constraints imposed by its flanking regions. Because the groove is not open toward the lumen, the side of the substrate containing only a short flexible segment can be translocated while the side with a bulky domain cannot. Translocation of the short terminus could be promoted despite the absence of a trans-bilayer pore by thermodynamically favorable release of a TMD into the lipid environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engelman and Steitz, 1981</xref>). This driving force can facilitate translocation of up to ~100 amino acid long polypeptide segments in the absence of a translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brambillasca et al., 2006</xref>). In cases where both sides are short (e.g., very small single-TMD proteins), one orientation might be favoured over the other by flanking charges on the substrate being interpreted by charged residues on EMC.</p><p>It is noteworthy that EMC2 at the entry point into the intramembrane groove contains well-conserved solvent-exposed basic amino acids (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) such as Arg26 and Arg91. Furthermore, the ordered cytosolic tail of EMC1 at this key junction contains four conserved basic residues, at least some of which would face the vestibule. Finally, a conserved basic residue at position six in EMC5, and possibly its N-terminus, may also contribute net positive charge in this region. This enrichment of positive charge (and relatively fewer exposed negative charges) would disfavor entry into the groove of polypeptide segments that are enriched in basic amino acids. Such a mechanism would select against mitochondrial TA proteins, cleavable signal peptides, and N<sub>cyt</sub> signal anchors. In each case, these otherwise suitable EMC substrates (based on their terminal location and hydrophobicity) are enriched in basic amino acids in the short unstructured domain flanking the hydrophobic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beltzer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Costello et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">von Heijne, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kalbfleisch et al., 2007</xref>). Conversely, bona fide EMC substrates (ER-targeted TA proteins and N<sub>exo</sub> signal anchors) are typically dis-enriched in basic amino acids in the translocated tail. Thus, the mechanism of substrate selection by EMC might be part of the explanation for the ‘positive-inside rule’, a long-observed preference for positive flanking charges facing the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gafvelin et al., 1997</xref>). This is an important area for future investigation.</p><p>The architecture and dimensions of EMC have major implications for when it acts during co-translational insertion of N-terminal TMDs and how it could function as a putative chaperone. EMC cannot feasibly approach closer than ~100 Å to a ribosome-bound Sec61 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This means that EMC can act co-translationally on TMDs only before the ribosome docks on the Sec61 complex or only after at least ~100 Å of polypeptide downstream of the TMD has emerged from the ribosomal tunnel. Because ribosome-nascent chain complexes in which a TMD has just emerged from the ribosome can be inserted in an EMC-dependent manner, we have postulated that EMC acts after SRP-mediated targeting but before ribosomes bind to the Sec61 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chitwood and Hegde, 2019</xref>). Due to SRP’s position at the ribosome exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Halic et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schaffitzel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Voorhees and Hegde, 2015</xref>), Sec61 cannot engage its binding site unless SRP releases the TMD and dissociates from the ribosome. Thus, there is a brief window when a TMD is available for EMC-mediated insertion before Sec61 binds to its position at the exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jomaa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kobayashi et al., 2018</xref>). We posit that this time constraint helps minimize inappropriate insertion of N-terminal TMDs intended for the N<sub>cyt</sub> topology so they can be subsequently inserted by the Sec61 complex.</p><p>Although the intramembrane groove is well suited to serve as a chaperone for a single TMD, such a function seems unlikely to occur adjacent to the Sec61 translocon as proposed on the basis of ribosome profiling experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shurtleff et al., 2018</xref>). Co-translational engagement of EMC by TMDs emerging from the ribosome-Sec61 complex could only occur once a TMD can diffuse at least 100 Å away. The very rigid structure of the EMC2•EMC9 complex and the absence of subcomplexes lacking these proteins makes it unlikely that the steric constraints shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> could be overcome. Furthermore, the intramembrane groove is sufficiently large to house one TMD, and possibly a second just outside the groove. This means that EMC is not likely to bind multiple TMDs simultaneously. Thus, a chaperone function would seem limited to post-translationally engaging an isolated TMD that has not yet assembled with its intra- or inter-molecular partners. Direct evidence for this function is currently lacking, but merits future study.</p><p>The role of the lumenal domain of EMC is currently unclear. The simplest possibility is that it serves a crucial structural role in stabilizing the seven integral membrane subunits while sealing the intramembrane groove toward the lumen. Maintaining the intramembrane groove configuration might be energetically unfavourable without structural caps on both sides. Other examples of proteins with a large lipid-exposed groove have most or all of their TMDs within a single polypeptide in contrast to EMC’s multi-protein assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumazaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ramasamy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rollauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schoebel et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the lumenal domain, like EMC2, might nucleate EMC assembly, an early structural solution that was maintained across all eukaryotes.</p><p>Our proposed mechanism for EMC-mediated TMD insertion is conceptually similar to how the prokaryotic protein YidC is thought to function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dalbey et al., 2014</xref>). YidC is a much simpler protein with a 5-TMD core whose arrangement forms an intramembrane ‘hydrophobic slide’ lined by TMD1, TMD2, and TMD5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumazaki et al., 2014</xref>). The hydrophobic slide in YidC is appreciably smaller than the intramembrane groove in EMC and could not house a substrate TMD helix without conformational changes. Nevertheless, biochemical evidence supports the notion that substrate TMDs are near the hydrophobic slide during insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klenner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). Our structural model for the EMC3 subunit is consistent with an evolutionary relationship to YidC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anghel et al., 2017</xref>). Notably however, EMC3 in our model is oriented such that the surface corresponding to YidC’s hydrophobic slide is opposite to the surface lining EMC’s intramembrane groove (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This observation raises the possibility that the putative hydrophobic slide in EMC3 might be an alternative or additional route for substrate TMD insertion.</p><p>One way this could occur without risk of substrate entanglement in EMC is if the TMD approaches the hydrophobic slide from behind the EMC2•EMC9 vestibule. Upon insertion into the hydrophobic slide, the TMD would then release from EMC in the same direction from which it approached. Unlike in YidC however, access to lipid from the hydrophobic slide in EMC3 is partially occluded by EMC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, insertion via this alternative ‘backside’ route may require conformational changes to create more space between EMC3, EMC4, and EMC6 so substrates can enter the lipid bilayer.</p><p>Regardless of the exact route(s) of insertion through EMC, it appears that a simplified insertase originating from a YidC-like protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borowska et al., 2015</xref>) has been elaborated during evolution to form EMC. As Get1 appears to be a homolog of EMC3, the Get1/Get2 complex may be a simplified version of EMC that co-opted a different binding partner. High resolution structures of EMC’s membrane region and the Get1/Get2 complex, together with structure-guided mutagenesis and substrate crosslinking experiments, will be important for fully elucidating and comparing their potentially shared mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BL21 NEB Express competent cells</td><td valign="top">New England Biolabs</td><td valign="top">Cat# C2523</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK293 TRex EMC5-FLAG</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guna et al., 2018</xref></td><td valign="top">MBP04</td><td valign="top">EMC5-FLAG (see below) integrated into FRT site of HEK293 TRex-Flp-in cell line.

At OD 600 of 0.3, 0.2% L-arabinose was added to cultures and continued to grow to an OD 600 of 0.6 and cultures were cooled to 16°C. Once cultures were cooled, 0.15 mM IPTG and 1 mM benzoyl-phenylalanine (from a 1 M stock in 1 M NaOH) was added. Cells were then cultured at 16°C overnight. For both standard and amber suppression protein expression, cells were harvested via centrifugation, resuspended in ice cold Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA buffer A (25 mM Tris pH 8.4, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole), lysed using sonication at 4°C, and subjected to centrifugation at 39,000 x g for 1 hr at 4°C. The supernatant containing hexahistidine-tagged proteins was passed over a column of Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA matrix (Qiagen) at 0.5 mL matrix/1 L of culture. The matrix was washed with 20 column volumes of Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA buffer A and eluted in a minimum of 3 column volumes using Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA buffer A supplemented with imidazole to a final concentration 500 mM. Samples were buffer exchanged into 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100–400 mM NaCl (depending on the protein) with either PD-10 or HiPrep 26/10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare). SGTA, calmodulin, and EMC amber suppression samples for in vitro assays were used directly and subsequently were supplemented with 10% glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. EMC8 expression required an amino terminal SUMO solubilization tag, which was subsequently cleaved using ULP1 protease overnight at 4°C. Excess His-tagged SUMO and His-tagged ULP1 protease were removed via passage through a column of Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA matrix. EMC2, EMC8, and EMC9 were concentrated and subjected to gel filtration using a GE 200 16/60 liquid chromatography column equilibrated in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 400 mM NaCl. Complex formation of EMC2•EMC8 or EMC2•EMC9 complexes was achieved by mixing a 1 to 1.2 molar ratio of EMC2 and either EMC8 or EMC9.

Initially five independent datasets were processed individually. Movies were motion corrected using multi-patch motion correction and CTF values estimated using multi-patch CTF estimation in CryoSPARC. Particles were picked using a blob picker before extraction with a box size of 224 pixels and 2D classification to produce templates for 2D-template based auto picking. Picked particles were subject to 2D and 3D reference-free classification and selected particles were refined using non-uniform refinement and local resolution estimation in CryoSPARC. Maps from datasets with differing nominal pixel sizes were then re-scaled to a range of pixel sizes and matched to a reference map in UCSF Chimera, yielding a cross correlation coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tan et al., 2017</xref>). Titration of these cross correlation values was used to identify an optimal nominal pixel size relative to the reference dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wilkinson et al., 2019</xref>). The calculated values were used to re-scale the motion corrected micrographs from two datasets to match the nominal pixel size of 1.38 Å per pixel. The re-scaled datasets were then reprocessed as detailed above. Rescaled particles were merged with particles from three datasets originally collected at 1.38 Å per pixel, resulting in a master pool of 405,515 particles, which were subject to reference-free 3D classification. The final dataset of 167,294 particles was subject to non-uniform refinement followed by per-particle CTF refinement. CTF refined particles were subject to a final round of non-uniform refinement followed by local resolution estimation and filtering to produce a final map with a resolution of 6.4 Å. Refinement was limited to a maximum alignment resolution of 6.5 Å to prevent overfitting.

SQS-reporter DNA (250 ng) and either EMC2 DNA or empty vector (750 ng) were added to the Opti-MEM/GeneJuice mixture, solution was pipetted up and down to mix, and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were seeded into a six well dish at 40% confluency concurrent with the addition of 100 µL of the transfection/DNA mixture. Cells were grown for 3 days and then detached with trypsin/EDTA in 250 µL volume, neutralized with 500 µL complete media, and pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 x g in a table top centrifuge at 4°C. Cells were washed by resuspension in 500 µL ice cold PBS and re-pelleted as above. Pelleted cells were resuspended in a final volume of 600 µL ice cold PBS and filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer for analysis. Cells were analyzed using a BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The flow cytometry experiment and data analysis using FlowJo software packages were conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Itakura et al., 2016</xref>). Knockdowns of EMC3, EMC8 and EMC9 with siRNAs were for 3 days in HEK 293 Trex cells with stably integrated inducible reporters (GFP-P2A-RFP-SQS or OPRK-GFP-P2A-RFP) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Thermo Fisher). siRNA sequences are available in the Key Resources Table). Expression of the reporters was induced with 1 µg/ml doxycycline for ~20 hr before analysis by flow cytometry performed as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistics and reproducibility</title><p>This study did not employ any statistical analysis or comparisons, no grouping, and no power calculations. Biochemical and cell biological experiments include internal controls that were performed as part of the same experiment and are shown within the respective figures. Each result or conclusion from any given figure panel represents one example of at least two biologically independent experiments, both of which contained the same or similar internal controls. No attempts at replication with valid controls failed. Where data are compiled from multiple measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), the number of replicates are indicated in the figure legend with error bars to indicate standard deviation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank P Chitwood for helpful discussions, MM Babu for co-evolution advice, RL Williams and D Bellini for advice on crystallography analysis, J Chin and I Gregor for amber suppression reagents, A Guna for help with protein preparations at an early stage of this project, N Volkmar and J Christianson for discussions and the ∆EMC2 cells, G Cannone for EM support, J Grimmett and T Darling for scientific computing, the EM, crystallization, mass spectrometry, and biophysics core facilities at the LMB, and the staff on beamlines I03 and I23 at the Diamond Light Source for assistance with crystal screening and data collection.

detailed structural analysis of the EMC complex that is involved in incorporating N- or C-terminal transmembrane helices into the ER membrane. It describes a combination of x-ray crystallography and cryo-EM as well as cross linking techniques to establish a model of the entire complex despite the relatively low resolution which requires the use of extensive modelling. Overall, the entire procedure is carefully performed and provides an excellent model that explains the structure and function of this important complex.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The architecture of EMC reveals a path for membrane protein insertion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Volker Dötsch as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript Dr Ramanujan S. Hegde and co-workers address the structure and molecular mechanism of EMC, an ER membrane protein complex which comprises ten subunits and facilitates the insertion of some tail anchored (TA)- and certain multipass-membrane proteins. In the latter case only the most aminoterminal transmembrane domain appears to be head first-/Nexo-inserted by EMC, additional domains of the same membrane proteins were suggested to be integrated into the membrane by the Sec61 complex. Therefore, EMC was proposed to mediate membrane insertion of either amino- or carboxy-terminal transmembrane domains which cannot be handled by the Sec61 complex.</p><p>The authors employed state of the art methods for the purification of native EMC as well as individual subunits or mutant variants thereof, 3D reconstruction after cryo-electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, site specific crosslinking, and functional plus additional biochemical assays for the characterization of the purified proteins.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) The RMSD value should be given in A, not A squared.</p><p>2) Among the reviewers the evidence for the inner membrane cavity part of the EMC being a slide for TMH integration was discussed. For your information the original suggestion for experimental evidence is included here:</p><p>&quot;To be convincing, the second part needs to be supported by functional data, such as crosslinking of at least the TA model protein to the intramembrane groove (e.g. at low temperature) plus rational design of mutant variants of groove subunits and test of their membrane insertion capacity for the TA model protein in intact cells. Furthermore, even in the presence of such results it would be difficult to unequivocally exclude the chaperone model for EMC function. In my opinion, the latter would require either crosslinking or 3D reconstruction after cryo-EM of nascent multipass-membrane proteins to EMC and Sec61 complex, and the use of EMC mutant variants in studies on the biogenesis of multipass membrane proteins in intact cells, respectively.&quot;</p><p>However, in the discussion it was agreed that no further experiments are needed, but that the authors should make more careful statements (i.e. use the words suggest, hypothesize, etc.) and that a sentence that &quot;substrate cross linking will be used for validation of the intramembrane groove in future work&quot; should be added.</p><p>3) Subsection “Functional analysis of the vestibule in the EMC2•EMC9 complex”. It is stated that EMC8 or EMC9 alone suppress aggregation of the model TA substrate less than EMC2 alone does. Whilst true, the difference is not huge for EMC8 (roughly two fold difference) so it seems unsafe to conclude that only EMC2 has specific interactions with the substrate. In fact we later find that EMC9/EMC8 forms part of the substrate binding cavity. It is stated in the Figure 1—figure supplement 2 legend that the crosslinks between the TA substrate and EMC2 alone are physiologically relevant but those between the substrate and EMC8 and EMC9 are due to co-aggregation with the substrate. How do the authors know this?</p><p>4) Figure 3. The HLY substitution that perturbs model substrate integration includes the substitution of an amino acid Y191 that has previously been used as a negative control for the BPA crosslinking experiments because it faces away from the binding cavity. It's therefore very difficult to infer that substitution of this residue is affecting substrate binding by changing the polarity of the cavity (rather than changing the protein fold).</p><p>5) Figure 1—figure supplement 2. The CaM-substrate adduct should be labelled to assist the reader.</p><p>6) Figure 5B. The rotation between the two views appears to be the opposite direction to that indicated in the figure. I appreciate that this figure is included primarily to show the quality of the model fit to the EM density, but I did struggle to assign the subunits by their colours under the EM density overlay. For example I could not identify EMC1. It might be worth labelling the subunits nearest the viewer on the figure.</p><p>7) Figure 5C.

For your information the original suggestion for experimental evidence is included here:</p><p>&quot;To be convincing, the second part needs to be supported by functional data, such as crosslinking of at least the TA model protein to the intramembrane groove (e.g. at low temperature) plus rational design of mutant variants of groove subunits and test of their membrane insertion capacity for the TA model protein in intact cells. Furthermore, even in the presence of such results it would be difficult to unequivocally exclude the chaperone model for EMC function. In my opinion, the latter would require either crosslinking or 3D reconstruction after cryo-EM of nascent multipass-membrane proteins to EMC and Sec61 complex, and the use of EMC mutant variants in studies on the biogenesis of multipass membrane proteins in intact cells, respectively.&quot;</p><p>However, in the discussion it was agreed that no further experiments are needed, but that the authors should make more careful statements (i.e. use the words suggest, hypothesize, etc.) and that a sentence that &quot;substrate cross linking will be used for validation of the intramembrane groove in future work&quot; should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and this important caveat has been added (subsection “The vestibule leads into a lipid-exposed intramembrane groove”), as well as more cautious language throughout. We have also added an additional paragraph about alternative models of insertion at the end of the revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Functional analysis of the vestibule in the EMC2•EMC9 complex”. It is stated that EMC8 or EMC9 alone suppress aggregation of the model TA substrate less than EMC2 alone does. Whilst true, the difference is not huge for EMC8 (roughly two fold difference) so it seems unsafe to conclude that only EMC2 has specific interactions with the substrate. In fact we later find that EMC9/EMC8 forms part of the substrate binding cavity. It is stated in the Figure 1—figure supplement 2 legend that the crosslinks between the TA substrate and EMC2 alone are physiologically relevant but those between the substrate and EMC8 and EMC9 are due to co-aggregation with the substrate. How do the authors know this?</p></disp-quote><p>We deleted the line suggesting EMC2 is the major contributor to substrate interaction. The primary basis on which we judged whether the crosslinks are functionally relevant (versus non-specific, potentially due to co-aggregation) was whether the substrate-substrate interaction was simultaneously diminished. This is now clarified in the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3. The HLY substitution that perturbs model substrate integration includes the substitution of an amino acid Y191 that has previously been used as a negative control for the BPA crosslinking experiments because it faces away from the binding cavity. It's therefore very difficult to infer that substitution of this residue is affecting substrate binding by changing the polarity of the cavity (rather than changing the protein fold).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a caveat (subsection “Functional analysis of the vestibule in the EMC2•EMC9 complex”) noting that in addition to hydrophobicity, the mutations might alter the local conformation to account for the phenotype. Of course, the overall fold is not likely to be perturbed given this mutant protein effectively assembles with the rest of EMC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 1—figure supplement 2.

The rotation between the two views appears to be the opposite direction to that indicated in the figure. I appreciate that this figure is included primarily to show the quality of the model fit to the EM density, but I did struggle to assign the subunits by their colours under the EM density overlay. For example I could not identify EMC1. It might be worth labelling the subunits nearest the viewer on the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise this figure was not clearer. The rotation is correct and can be seen by the position of the crossbar moving from the plane of the page to a perpendicular position on the left side. To further clarify this, we have labelled the front-facing subunits as recommended.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 5C.

Similarly, it would be useful to have the identify (aa number) of all the crosslinking amino acids shown in Figure 5D marked on the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried extensively to incorporate amino acid labels but it was not possible without making the figure extremely complicated or having the labels be very small. Instead, we have prepared a supplementary figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 3) that shows the primary data for the crosslinking, and in panel F lists the amino acid numbers of the key crosslinking sites depicted on the structural model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 5D.
