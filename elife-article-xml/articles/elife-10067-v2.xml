We have developed a proteomics approach to quantitatively profile the changes of sulfhydrated cysteines in biological systems. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that sulfhydrated cysteines are part of a wide range of biological functions. In pancreatic β cells exposed to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, elevated H<sub>2</sub>S promotes the sulfhydration of enzymes in energy metabolism and stimulates glycolytic flux. We propose that transcriptional and translational reprogramming by the integrated stress response (ISR) in pancreatic β cells is coupled to metabolic alternations triggered by sulfhydration of key enzymes in intermediary metabolism.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10067.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10067.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10067.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins play essential roles in almost every aspect of a cell’s life, and also contribute to the structure and function of body tissues and organs. Cells and tissues adapt to their continuously changing environments by regulating the activity of their proteins. For example, proteins that are not fully active immediately after they are built instead require further ‘posttranslational’ modifications to become active.</p><p>Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and cysteine amino acids are frequent sites of posttranslational modifications because they are particularly chemically reactive. Under certain conditions inside the cell, the sulfur atom in a cysteine can bond with chemical group containing a second sulfur atom plus a hydrogen atom. This process, which is known as sulfhydration, can be triggered by the presence of the gas molecule, hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S). The levels of hydrogen sulfide are highly regulated in the body, and it has been suggested to play a role in aging, environmental stress and many diseases. However, it is not clear whether sulfhydration plays a major role in disease conditions by modifying protein activity.</p><p>Efforts to address this question have been limited by a lack of methods that can measure the extent of sulfhydration of proteins. However, Gao et al. have now devised such a method. The approach takes steps to avoid false-positive and false-negative results, and can identify changes in the sulfhydration of cysteines across the entire complement of proteins produced by a cell, tissue or organ.</p><p>Gao et al. then used this new method to show that a master regulator of transcription (i.e. a protein that regulates the expression of many genes) causes large-scale changes in cysteine sulfhydration. These large-scale changes resulted in the reprogramming of the cell’s energy metabolism, and further experiments showed that hydrogen sulfide accumulation influences sulfhydration, protein activity and signaling pathways. The development of this new method may now lead to additional discoveries into the role of hydrogen sulfide as a signaling molecule.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Posttranslational modification is a fundamental mechanism in the regulation of structure and function of proteins. The covalent modification of specific amino acid residues influences diverse biological processes and cell physiology across species. Reactive cysteine residues in proteins have high nucleophilicity and low p<italic>K</italic>a values and serve as a major target for oxidative modifications, which can vary depending on the subcellular environment, including the type and intensity of intracellular or environmental cues. Oxidative environments cause different post-translational cysteine modifications, including disulfide bond formation (-S-S-), sulfenylation (-S-OH), nitrosylation (-S-NO), glutathionylation (-S-SG), and sulfhydration (-S-SH) (also called persulfidation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Finkel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mishanina et al., 2015</xref>). In the latter, an oxidized cysteine residue included glutathionylated, sulfenylated, and nitrosylated on a protein reacts with the sulfide anion to form a cysteine persulfide. The reversible nature of this modification provides a mechanism to fine tune biological processes in different cellular redox states.</p><p>Sulfhydration coordinates with other post-translational protein modifications such as phosphorylation and nitrosylation to regulate cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altaany et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sen et al., 2012</xref>). Despite great progress in bioinformatics and advanced mass spectroscopic (MS) techniques, identification of different cysteine-based protein modifications has been slow compared to other post-translational modifications. In the case of sulfhydration, a small number of proteins have been identified, among them the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, GAPDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mustafa et al., 2009</xref>). Sulfhydrated GAPDH at Cys<sup>150</sup> exhibits an increase in its catalytic activity, in contrast to the inhibitory effects of nitrosylation or glutathionylation of the same cysteine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mustafa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paul and Snyder, 2012</xref>). The biological significance of the Cys<sup>150</sup> modification by H<sub>2</sub>S is not well-studied, but H<sub>2</sub>S could serve as a biological switch for protein function acting via oxidative modification of specific cysteine residues in response to redox homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paul and Snyder, 2012</xref>). Understanding the physiological significance of protein sulfhydration requires the development of genome-wide innovative experimental approaches. Current methodologies based on the modified biotin switch technique do not allow detection of a broad spectrum of sulfhydrated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Finkel, 2012</xref>). Guided by a previously reported strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sen et al., 2012</xref>), we developed an experimental approach that allowed us to quantitatively evaluate the sulfhydrated proteome and the physiological consequences of H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis during chronic ER stress. The new methodology allows a quantitative, close-up view of the integrated cellular response to environmental and intracellular cues and is pertinent to our understanding of human disease development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title><bold>Results</bold></title><p>The ER is an organelle involved in the synthesis of proteins followed by various modifications. Disruption of this process results in the accumulation of misfolded proteins, causing ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>), which is associated with development of many diseases ranging from metabolic dysfunction to neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hetz, 2012</xref>). ER stress induces transcriptional, translational, and metabolic reprogramming, all of which are interconnected through the transcription factor ATF4. ATF4 increases expression of genes promoting adaptation to stress via their protein products. One such gene is the H<sub>2</sub>S-producing enzyme, cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH) or γ-cystathionase , previously shown to be involved in the signaling pathway that negatively regulates the activity of the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) via sulfhydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krishnan et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that low or even modest levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during ER stress may reprogram cellular metabolism via H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated protein sulfhydration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10067.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ER stress induces protein sulfhydration, a reversible cysteine-based post-translational modification.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of protein sulfhydration, which requires synthesis of H<sub>2</sub>S and low ROS levels.

We tested whether or not MIN6 cells expressed the essential components of H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis and protein sulfhydration in response to ER stress induced by thapsigargin (Tg, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Upon Tg treatment, MIN6 cells exhibited higher levels of intracellular ROS, decreased GSH/GSSG (reduced/oxidized glutathione ratios), and increased CTH protein levels via transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2A</xref>). This transcriptional reprogramming was also seen in mouse and human islets subjected to physiological or pharmacologically induced ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). In agreement with increased CTH expression, H<sub>2</sub>S levels increased during the chronic phase of the stress response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Coordinated induction of expression of the gene encoding the glutamate/cystine exchanger, Slc7a11, also was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and this induction was associated with increased glutamate/cystine flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Slc7a11 mediates the exchange of oxidized extracellular cystine with intracellular glutamate. Once cystine is imported into the cells it gets reduced to cysteine, and then serves as a substrate for GSH and H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis. These data support the idea that both increased uptake of the CTH substrate and increased levels of CTH contribute to increased H<sub>2</sub>S levels in cells under ER stress.</p><p>The functional significance of increased H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis was shown by measuring the catalytic activity of GAPDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mustafa et al., 2009</xref>), which gradually increased in response to elevated H<sub>2</sub>S production in MIN6 cells during ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This increase in activity was independent of GAPDH protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). As noted above, GAPDH has the unusual feature of being catalytically inactive when Cys<sup>150</sup> is oxidatively modified, except when it undergoes sulfhydration which restores/increases its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mustafa et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore tested the protective effects of Cys<sup>150</sup> sulfhydration by H<sub>2</sub>S on its catalytic activity in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidation. Recombinant GAPDH was incubated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the presence or absence of the H<sub>2</sub>S donor, NaHS. The inhibition of GAPDH activity by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was significantly reversed by H<sub>2</sub>S treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Furthermore, incubation of purified GAPDH with oxidized glutathione (GSSG) resulted in formation of inactive glutathionylated GAPDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gao et al., 2010</xref>), which was significantly rescued by treatment with H<sub>2</sub>S as well as DTT reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). HPLC-MS confirmed that recombinant GAPDH exposed to NaHS or GSSG was modified predominantly at Cys<sup>150</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7B, C</xref>). These data confirm that H<sub>2</sub>S is a positive regulator of GAPDH activity. Increased GAPDH activity is directly linked to H<sub>2</sub>S production, as shown by the loss of induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) upon treatment with the CTH inhibitor, propargylglycine (PAG). PAG inhibits H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis and therefore is expected to decrease Cys<sup>150</sup> modification. Taken together, these results indicate that regulation of H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis during ER stress might regulate the catalytic activity of other metabolic pathway proteins. The latter is raising the possibility that the ATF4-mediated sulfhydration of proteins is part of the integrated stress response (ISR), and has regulatory effects on cellular metabolism.</p><p>ATF4 increases gene expression of CTH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dickhout et al., 2012</xref>), the cystine transporter Slc7a11, as well as the ROS-producing enzyme Ero1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>). We hypothesized that during ER stress, this network of ATF4 target genes promotes protein sulfhydration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Knockdown of ATF4 in MIN6 cells during Tg-induced ER stress caused inhibition of H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis with a parallel loss of induction of CTH protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, in the absence of stress, ATF4 overexpression increased CTH and Ero1α levels and H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis, in agreement with increased GAPDH activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The levels of GSH and the activity of the glutamate/cystine exchanger also increased with ATF4 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>). These data support the hypothesis that ATF4 is a master regulator of protein sulfhydration in pancreatic β cells during ER stress.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10067.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ATF4-mediated transcriptional reprogramming during ER stress increases expression of a gene cohort involved in H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis and protein sulfhydration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the ATF4-induced cohort of genes leading to sulfhydration of proteins during ER stress.

We tested this hypothesis in extracts isolated from Tg-treated MIN6 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of NM-biotin (0.05–1 mM). The eluate containing the sulfhydrated proteins was analyzed with SDS–PAGE and the proteins were visualized by Coomassie blue staining. Indeed, increasing the concentration of NM-biotin beyond 0.5 mM decreased the levels of eluted proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), consistent with cysteine residues having free -SH groups becoming alkylated at high concentrations of NM-biotin. No protein was eluted from the column with the addition of DTT at high concentrations of NM-biotin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), confirming that the biotin was attached to proteins via a disulfide bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). This selectively labeling behavior not only relies on the probe concentration, but also is dependent on the protein structure conformations. We found that no protein was detected in the eluates if the BTA was performed on the denatured cell extracts (data not shown).</p><p>When Tg-treated MIN6 lysates were pretreated with DTT (to decrease the level of sulfhydrated proteins), the signal was significantly reduced compared to untreated lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>), confirming that DTT reduces an intermolecular disulfide bond of cysteine persulfides labeled with biotin. These data show that sulfhydrated cysteine residues are the primary targets of NM-biotin at low concentrations, thus making the BTA a unique tool to identify the sulfhydrated proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We next assessed the BTA assay using recombinant GAPDH, which contains six cysteine residues including the redox-regulated Cys<sup>150</sup>. GAPDH was incubated with either H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or NaHS. The presence of sulfhydrated GAPDH was evaluated by the BTA method following Western blot analysis. We found that only the NaHS-treated GAPDH was eluted as an H<sub>2</sub>S-modified target, indicating that the assay distinguishes sulfhydration or free SH groups from other forms of cysteine modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B</xref>). This was independently confirmed with the red malemide assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>), which discriminates between free -SH groups and sulfhydrated-SH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sen et al., 2012</xref>). We next tested if the BTA can identify modification of a specific cysteine on GAPDH by using recombinant wild-type and Cys<sup>150</sup>Ser GAPDH mutant, which were incubated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or NaHS. We found that NaHS treatment induced sulfhydration in the wild-type GAPDH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7A</xref>), a result that was also confirmed by high-resolution quadruple MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7B–C</xref>), and that this modification was absent in the Cys<sup>150</sup>Ser mutant. Finally, a proteome-wide view of sulfhydration was obtained from Tg-treated MIN6 cell extracts subjected to BTA and further analyzed by LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>). We identified 150 proteins, including several known targets for sulfhydration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mustafa et al., 2009</xref>). Similar results were obtained from analysis of mouse liver (data not shown), a tissue known to exhibit high levels of H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kabil et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together, this shows that BTA discriminates between protein sulfhydration and other oxidative modifications.</p><p>Next, the BTA methodology identified the sulfhydrated proteome downstream of the transcription factor ATF4 during ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). MIN6 cells treated with Tg increased GAPDH levels in the DTT eluate, that was abolished by knocking down ATF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). In the absence of stress, ATF4 knockdown resulted in an increase in sulfhydrated GAPDH in MIN6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Because ATF4-deficient cells have decreased levels of sulfur-containing amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harding et al., 2003</xref>), and sulfur amino acid restriction is linked to an increase in the transulfuration pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hine et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that the increase in GAPDH sulfhydration in ATF4-depleted cells is due to activation of CBS (cystathionine-β-synthase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Niu et al., 2015</xref>), the second cytosolic H<sub>2</sub>S-producing enzyme. Moreover, we found that in the absence of stress ATF4 overexpression induced GAPDH sulfhydration that is dependent on the CTH activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–K</xref>). The use of PAG decreased GAPDH sulfhydration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). We conclude that sulfhydration of proteins during ER stress is part of the ISR and is controlled by the transcription factor, ATF4.</p><p>The BTA requires determining the concentration of NM-Biotin for selectively labeling proteins with reactive, sulfhydrated cysteines rather than the relatively high abundant and less reactive, unmodified (with free SH groups) cysteine residues. However, this labeling step has some limitations under certain circumstances. For example, if free Cys-SH groups are biotinylated on the same protein containing one or more Cys-S-SH groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), then the protein will not be eluted with DTT and will not be identified as a target for sulfhydration. In addition, if a protein contains sulfhydrated cysteines with low reactivity for the probe, this protein will not be captured and identified as an H<sub>2</sub>S-modified target. Due to those limitations and in order to extend the capability of the BTA approach, we introduced a proteolytic digestion step before applying the avidin column step. This added step provided not only the isolation of cysteine-containing peptides with persulfide bonds, but also increased the identification of sulfhydrated proteins. The eluted peptides were then sequenced and identified by LC-MS/MS analysis, thereby identifying the modified cysteines on proteins. By using the modified BTA technique, we have identified over ~ 1000 novel sulfhydrated cysteines in MIN6 cells treated with Tg, corresponding to about 820 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), including GAPDH, wherein two cysteine-containing peptides were captured: Cys<sup>150</sup> and Cys<sup>245</sup>. Remarkably, the Cys<sup>150</sup> active-site peptide was highly enriched as compared to the C-terminal of Cys<sup>245</sup>, supporting prior mutagenesis studies that have shown Cys<sup>150</sup> as the primary H<sub>2</sub>S-modified site on GAPDH, both in vitro and in vivo. One of novel targets including phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) was also confirmed by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s10">Figure 2—figure supplement 10</xref>). CTH Knockdown mediated by shRNA decreased GAPDH and PHGDH sulfhydration levels, confirming that those proteins identified by the BTA method are bona-fide targets for sulfhydration in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s11">Figure 2—figure supplement 11</xref>). Sulfhydrated peptides do not reveal a consensus protein abundance and sulfhydrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">7</xref>and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>), supporting that lower concentrations of the NM-biotin labeling reveal reactivity of cysteine residues rather than protein abundance.</p><p>In order to obtain genome-wide stress-induced changes in the sulfhydrome and individual cysteine residues within these proteins, we devised a modified BTA protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) by introducing a stable isotope-labeling step after the DTT elution step. This protocol uses (1) digestion of biotinylated cell extracts with trypsin before avidin capture, (2) labeling of free Cys-SH groups on peptides in the column eluent by mass-difference cysteine-alkylating reagents with either NEM-H<sub>5</sub> (Light) or NEM-D<sub>5</sub> (Heavy), and (3) quantification by LC-MS/MS analysis of H/L ratios of the individual pair-labeled cysteines in the identified peptides based on a mass-difference labeling. In addition to quantifying changes in protein sulfhydration, this modified BTA approach allows the detection of additional proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s11">Figure 2—figure supplement 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). We used as an experimental system the ATF4-expressing MIN6 cells to profile quantitatively the sulfhydrated proteome. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, ATF4-mediated signaling triggers the cellular response, which leads to increased protein sulfhydration. Using the experimental plan in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, we identified over 834 cysteine-containing peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Of these peptides, 771 exhibited pair-labeling with an overall average H/L ratio 2.6, and 348 peptides (45%) displayed high ratios (H/L&gt;2). These findings confirmed that ATF4 drives global changes in protein sulfhydration in MIN6 cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10067.022</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Quantitative and pathway analysis of sulfhydrated peptides in MIN6 cells overexpressing the transcription factor ATF4.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the BTA experimental approach combined with alkylation of free SH groups by either the stable isotope-labeled (D<sub>5</sub>, heavy) or normal (H<sub>5</sub>, light) maleimide.

We thus queried the Uniprot database to retrieve functional annotations for the aforementioned 827 peptides. The analysis revealed that 28% of the peptides were localized to protein regions whose structural and functional properties are known (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). An additional 18% were found within functional regions of proteins with cysteine residues of unknown significance. Our finding of sulfhydration of specific cysteine residues within functional domains of proteins suggests that the cysteine modification influences the activity of proteins. In contrast, 4.2% of the peptides in question contained cysteine residues in experimentally proven active sites of enzymes or cysteine residues involved in disulfide bond formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This percentage of active cysteine-containing peptides from the BTA assay is significantly larger than the 0.2% of all cysteines in the Uniprot database that have been assigned to experimentally characterized active cysteines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Weerapana et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, 2.4% of the annotated peptides were found in known nucleotide binding domains of proteins, suggesting the potential for regulation of gene expression by H<sub>2</sub>S cysteine-modified proteins. None of these proteins have been reported as targets of sulfhydration. Although not found among the 827 peptides in this study, the NF-κB RelA transcription factor has been shown to be sulfhydrated in the DNA-binding domain, resulting in increased DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sen et al., 2012</xref>). We also found by querying the redox modification databases (RedoxDB and GPS-SNO) that 11% of the 834 peptides from the RedoxDB and 36% from the GPS-SNO corresponded to cysteine residues that are known to be modified by nitrosylation or glutathionylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that protein sulfhydration not only influences the catalytic activity of enzymes like GAPDH, but also can potentially regulate a broad range of biological processes.</p><p>We noted a wide range of H/L ratios in the identified peptides, reflecting a large difference in the reactivity of individual cysteines to sulfhydration in MIN6 cells that overexpress ATF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). In addition, labeled cysteines on the same protein exhibited remarkably different ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). For example, the protein, PHGDH, was labeled on two cysteines, Cys<sup>281</sup> had an H/L ratio of 5.8, whereas Cys<sup>254</sup> displayed a ratio of 17. To identify a sulfhydration motif in proteins, all cysteine-containing peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) were analysed by the pLogo motif analyzer program. This analysis did not reveal conserved residues surrounding the modified cysteine site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>), a result consistent with other enzyme-independent oxidative modifications of cysteines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Weerapana et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marino and Gladyshev, 2011</xref>). However, when we selected only the peptides with high H/L ratios (&gt;2), and searched for a sequence motif at the cysteine modification sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>), an Arg residue was significantly enriched at the +1 position of the modified cysteine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Additionally, structure motif and surface accessibility analysis revealed that the modified cysteine is highly accessible and positioned at the N-terminal alpha-helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C–D</xref>). This is consistent with previous reports suggesting that a reactive cysteine thiolate anion is stabilized by interaction with alpha-helix dipoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kortemme and Creighton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Weerapana et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Bioinformatics clustering with two pathway annotation programs DAVID and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed an enrichment of sulfhydrated proteins in glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Data from this analysis are in agreement with increased activity of the glycolytic enzyme, GAPDH, by sulfhydration, and prompted the question as to whether or not glycolytic flux is regulated by the H<sub>2</sub>S-dependent modification of enzymes involved in intermediary metabolism. Also in agreement with this hypothesis, we found that ATF4-overexpressing MIN6 cells had higher glycolytic rates as evaluated with a Seahorse analyzer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, the activity of the rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase 2 (PKM2), also was increased in ATF4 overexpressing MIN6 cells, in a manner dependent on CTH activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We therefore returned to the induction of ER stress by Tg-treatment of MIN6 cells and evaluated glycolytic flux rates in the absence or presence of PAG. The advantage of using PAG instead of genetic manipulation such as gene knockdown is that the inhibitor could be added at the same time as labeled glucose, thus allowing assessment of the inhibitor’s effect on glycolytic flux rates.</p><p>We directly measured changes in metabolic flux by utilizing stable isotope label incorporation and mass isotopomer analyses. MIN6 cells were treated with Tg for 18 hr; the growth media was changed to (D-glucose-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>) media in the presence or absence of PAG during the last 3.5 hr of treatment. Tg-treatment significantly augmented glycolytic flux as determined by the increase in the glycolytic intermediate, 3 phosphoglyceric acid (3PG), as well as lactate and alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The flux was consistent with an increase in the relative concentrations of 3PG and alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, lactate levels were decreased significantly despite the increased flux. A decrease in cellular lactate levels supports the idea that there is high consumption of pyruvate by the mitochondria to generate oxaloacetate (OAA). In contrast to the increased glycolytic rates, flux to tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediates was significantly reduced by Tg-treatment as evidenced by the low <sup>13</sup>C label incorporation of both acetyl-CoA and OAA moieties of citrate, fumarate, and malate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). When the cells were exposed to PAG along with Tg-treatment, the increase in glycolytic flux was prevented, as shown by the decrease in <sup>13</sup>C-labeling of 3PG, lactate, and alanine. In contrast, TCA cycle flux was restored, as exemplified by the increase in <sup>13</sup>C-labeling of both OAA and acetyl-CoA moieties of citrate, succinate, fumarate, and malate, and a decrease in their concentrations, suggesting utilization. <sup>13</sup>C-labeling of aspartate and glutamine also increased significantly, indicating increased cataplerosis of TCA cycle intermediates. Moreover, we determined the activity of PKM2 in MIN6 cells treated with Tg in the presence or absence of PAG. Tg-treatment increased PKM2 activity, but PAG addition inhibited the increase, without affecting PKM2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Thus, the development of tools that can quantitatively measure genome-wide protein sulfhydration in physiological or pathological conditions is of central importance. However, a significant challenge in studies of the biological significance of protein sulfhydration is the lack of an approach to selectively detect sulfhydrated cysteines from other modifications (disulfide bonds, glutathionylated thiols and sulfienic acids) in complex biological samples. In this study, we introduced the BTA approach that allowed the quantitative assessment of changes in the sulfhydration of specific cysteines in the proteome and in individual proteins. BTA is superior to other reported methodologies that aimed to profile cysteine modifications, such as the most commonly used, a modified biotin switch technique (BST). BST was originally designed to study protein nitrosylation and postulated to differentiate free thiols and persulfides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mustafa et al., 2009</xref>). A key advantage of BTA over the existing methodologies is that the experimental approach has steps to avoid false-positive and negative results, as target proteins for sulfhydration. BST is commonly generating such false targets for cysteine modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Forrester et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Using mutiple validations, our data support the specificity and reliability of the BTA assay for analysis of protein sulfhydration both in vitro and in vivo. With this approach, we found that ATF4 is the master regulator of protein sulfhydration in pancreatic β cells during ER stress, by means of its function as a transcription factor. A large number of protein targets have been discovered to undergo sulfhydration in β cells by the BTA approach. Almost 1000 sulfhydrated cysteine-containing peptides were present in the cells under the chronic ER stress condition of treatment with Tg for 18 hr. Combined with the isotopic-labeling strategy, almost 820 peptides on more than 500 proteins were quantified in the cells overexpressing ATF4. These data show the potential of the BTA method for further systematic studies of biological events. To our knowledge, the current dataset encompasses most known sulfhydrated cysteine residues in proteins in any organism. Our bioinformatics analyses revealed sulfhydrated cysteine residues located on a variety of structure–function domains, suggesting the possibility of regulatory mechanism(s) mediated by protein sulfhydration. Structure and sequence analysis revealed consensus motifs that favor sulfhydration; an arginine residue and alpha-helix dipoles are both contributing to stabilize sulfhydrated cysteine thiolates in the local environment.</p><p>Pathway analyses showed that H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated sulfhydration of cysteine residues is the part of the ISR with the highest enrichment in proteins involved in energy metabolism. The metabolic flux revealed that H<sub>2</sub>S promotes aerobic glycolysis associated with decreased oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria during ER stress in β cells. The TCA cycle revolves by the action of the respiratory chain that requires oxygen to operate. In response to ER stress, mitochondrial function and cellular respiration are down-regulated to limit oxygen demand and to sustain mitochondria. When ATP production from the TCA cycle becomes limited and glycolytic flux increases, there is a risk of accumulation of lactate from pyruvate. One way to escape accumulation of lactate is the mitochondrial conversion of pyruvate to oxalacetic acid (OAA) by pyruvate carboxylase. This latter enzyme was found to be sulfhydrated, consistent with the notion that sulfhydration is linked to metabolic reprogramming toward glycolysis.</p><p>The switch of energy production from mitochondria to glycolysis is known as a signature of hypoxic conditions. This metabolic switch has also been observed in many cancer cells characterized as the Warburg effect, which contributes to tumor growth. The Warburg effect provides advantages to cancer cell survival via the rapid ATP production through glycolysis, as well as the increasd conversion of glucose into anabolic biomolecules (amino acid, nucleic acid, and lipid biosynthesis) and reducing power (NADPH) for regeneration of antioxidants. This metabolic response of tumor cells contributes to tumor growth and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>). By analogy, the aerobic glycolysis trigged by increased H<sub>2</sub>S production could give β cells the capability to acquire ATP and nutrients to adapt their cellular metabolism toward maintaining ATP levels in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vishnu et al., 2014</xref>), increasing synthesis of glycerolphospholipids, glycoproteins and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krokowski et al., 2013</xref>), all important components of the ISR. Similar to hypoxic conditions, a phenotype associated with most tumors, the decreased mitochondria function in β cells during ER stress, can also be viewed as an adaptive response by limiting mitochondria ROS and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. We therefore view that the H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated increase in glycolysis is an adaptive mechanism for survival of β cells to chronic ER stress, along with the improved ER function and insulin production and folding, both critical factors controlling hyperglycemia in diabetes. Future work should determine which are the key proteins targeted by H<sub>2</sub>S and thus contributing to metabolic reprogramming of β cells, and if and how insulin synthesis and secretion is affected by sulfhydration of these proteins during ER stress.</p><p>Abnormal H<sub>2</sub>S metabolism has been reported to occur in various diseases, mostly through the deregulation of gene expression encoding for H<sub>2</sub>S-generating enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wallace and Wang, 2015</xref>). An increase of their levels by stimulants is expected to have similar effects on sulfhydration of proteins like the ATF4-induced CTH under conditions of ER stress. It is the levels of H<sub>2</sub>S under oxidative conditions that influence cellular functions. In the present study, ER stress in β cells induced elevated CTH levels, whereas CBS was unaffected. The deregulated oxidative modification at cysteine residues by H<sub>2</sub>S may be a major contributing factor to disease development. In this case, it would provide a rationale for the design of therapeutic agents that would modulate the activity of the involved enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse islets RNA isolation</title><p>Experimental protocols were approved by the Case Western Reserve University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

The data was searched against the mouse reference sequence database which contains 77,807 entries using a precursor ion tolerance of 10 ppm and a fragment ion tolerance of 0.6 Da. These searches included differential modification of +125.047679 and +130.079062 on cysteine to account for NEM and d<sub>5</sub>-NEM alkylation and +15.994915 Da to account for oxidation on methionine residues. Peptide identification was validated with the Percolator node on the basis of q-values which are estimated from target-decoy searches. The false discovery rate (FDR) for these searches was set to 1% at the peptide level. In addition, peptides were also required to be fully tryptic and have Xcorr scores &gt; 1.5 (+1), 2.0 (+2), 2.25 (+3), and 2.5 (+4).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Ratio quantification</title><p>Quantification of light/heavy ratios (d<sub>5</sub>-NEM/NEM) was performed using two algorithms of Proteome Discoverer, the event detector and Precursor Ions Quantifier. The event detector applied a 2 ppm mass variability and 0.2 min chromatographic window for the generation of extracted ion chromatograms. The Peptide ratio was calculated from the summed extracted ion chromatograms of all isotopes for the NEM and d<sub>5</sub>-NEM containing peptides. All missing ions were assigned a value equivalent to the minimum intensity, only unique peptides were quantified, and since this included quantitation at the peptide level, single channel was used. The H/L ratios of approximately 25% of the quantified peptides were manually validated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Bioinformatics analysis of cysteine-containing peptides</title><p>For functional annotation: Protein sequences from the FTP site of the Uniprot Protein database for mouse (Proteome_ID/Tax_ID: UP000000589/10090), rat (Proteome_ID/Tax_ID: UP000002494/10116), and human (Proteome_ID/Tax_ID: UP000005640/9606) release current as of May 23 2015. Sequence annotation in the feature fields (ACT_SITE, BINDING, CA_BIND, DISULFID, DNA_BIND, DOMAIN, METAL, MOD_RES, MOTIF, NP_BIND, SITE, ZN_FING) of the Uniprot entry was searched and any annotation corresponding to the labeled cysteine peptides was collected.</p><p>For redox cysteine annotation: each peptide identified by MS, all exact matches in any of the RedoxDB databases on any oxidative modification cysteine sequences (fasta or additional_fasta) were collected. For motif search: The lager data set of putative modification cysteine sites and their vicinity sequences were submitted to the pLogo program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.plogo.uconn.edu">www.plogo.uconn.edu</ext-link>, version v1.2.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">O'Shea et al., 2013</xref>) to identify linear motif.</p><p>For prediction of candidate peptides for nitrosylation: the peptide sequences with H/L ratio &gt;2 were submitted for use in predicting nitrosylation sites under the medium threshold condition using the batch prediction tool of the GPS-SNO 1.0 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xue et al., 2010</xref>). The predicted nitrosylation sites of sequences were extracted for further analysis.</p><p>For determination of surface accessibility and secondary structural motif: we turned to DSSP's (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kabsch and Sander, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Touw et al., 2015</xref>) annotations of the PDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berman et al., 2000</xref>). We downloaded a total of 108355 DSSP-annotated PDB files from (rsync.cmbi.ru.nl/dssp/) on Sep. 9th 2015. Each peptide with H/L greater than 2-fold was aligned on all matching DSSP profiles, from which the 10-state structural context and accessibility were extracted. When an exact match is not found, then all matches with 1 mismatch are considered. The structural context of a peptide is defined as the context that reoccur most frequently among the hits, while the accessibility is the average across the hits, log<sub>2</sub>-normalized by the median of accessibility considering the amino acid type; positive log<sub>2</sub> values means that the amino acid embedded in the 3D structure of the protein is more accessible that the mode (median).</p><p>For pathway annotation: the canonical pathways were scored based on the total sulfhydrated peptides and the peptides with H/L ratios greater than 2 by using DAVID (www.david.ncifcrf.gov) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) programs. Statistical significant of pathways are calculated, and pathways are ranked by the p-values based on those tests. The tests measure the likelihood that the association between proteins measured in our experiments and a pathway is due to random chance. The smaller the p-value the less likely that the association is due to random chance. Top scoring pathways are presented.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Metabolic labeling of MIN6 cells</title><p>MIN6 cells were plated onto 10-cm plates in triplicates and cultured in the cell growth medium. After 48 hr treatment with Tg, metabolic labeling was performed. Cells were washed with warm PBS and incubated for 3 hr in the DMEM medium containing 10% heat inactive FBS, 2 mM glutamine, and 25 mM glucose consisting of a mixture of 12.5 mM d-glucose plus 12.5 mM of d-[U-<sup>13</sup>C] glucose.

Samples were centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min at 14,000 rpm and ethanol was transferred to a GC/MS vial and evaporated to dryness in a SpeedVac evaporator. Glucose was converted to its pentaacetate derivative by the reaction with 150 µl of acetic anhydride in pyridine (2:1, v/v) at 60°C for 30 min. Samples were evaporated to dryness and glucose derivatives were reconstituted in 80 µl of ethyl acetate and transferred to GC/MS inserts.

Briefly, cellular pellets in Eppendorf tubes were homogenized and frozen in 600 µl of Folch solution (chloroform:methanol, 2:1, vol./vol.) on dry ice. After addition of 0.4 volumes of ice-cold water, cells were homogenized again and let sit on ice for 30 min. Homogenates were centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. The upper methanol/water layer was removed to GC/MS vial. To the bottom chloroform layer, 120 µl of water and 200 µl of methanol were added and extraction steps from above were repeated. Combined methanol/water layers were evaporated to dryness in Speedvac evaporator at 4°C. Metabolites were derivatized using two-step derivatization. First, keto- and aldehyde groups were protected by the reaction with MOX (methoxylamine-HCl in pyridine, 1:2) overnight at room temperature. Then excess derivatizing agent was evaporated and dry residue was converted to MOX-TMS (trimethylsilyl) derivative by reacting with bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide with 10% trimethylchlorosilane (Regisil) at 60°C for 20 min. Resulting MOX-TMS derivatives were run in GC-MS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>GC-MS conditions</title><p>Analyses were carried out on an Agilent 5973 mass spectrometer equipped with 6890 Gas Chromatograph.

Four bioinformatics programs were employed for this purpose, including pLOG sequence motif analyzer, DSSP-PDB structure analyzer, DAVID and IPA pathway annotations.</p><p>2) It has been reported that iNOS expression is induced by ER stress, which may contribute to protein nitrosylation. GAPDH is one of the nitrosylated targets under nitrosative stress. We have thus examined if iNOS protein expression is induced in MIN6 cells treated with Tg, using Western blot analysis. We found that iNOS protein was not induced. Furthermore, we have performed the BTA and BST (Biotin Switch Technique) assays in parallel on the same lysate extracted from MIN6 cells treated with Tg for 18h in order to identify if NO nitrosylates GAPDH. We found an increase in GAPDH sulfhydration and not nitrosylation. It is known that the GAPDH activity is inhibited by nitrosylation or glutathionylation or other redox-based modifications. However, our data showed that GAPDH activity increases by ER stress. All together, our data support that sulfhydration and not other redox-based cysteine modifications, primarily occur on proteins in MIN6 cells during the time frame of chronic ER stress that was studied in this manuscript.</p><p>3) We performed the sequence alignment analysis of the quantified peptide data using a sequence annotation program named pLOG at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plogo.uconn.edu/">http://plogo.uconn.edu/</ext-link>. Similar to ComPASS, the pLOG program has been broadly employed and has been cited in 30 articles until now. It does not only provide real-time conditional probability calculations for motif assessments, but also presents specific features for the analysis of post-translational modifications (nitrosylation) based on peptide sequences (1). By using the pLOG, we showed that an Arg residue was significantly enriched at the +1 position of the modified cysteine when we selected only the peptides with high H/L ratios (2-fold), but no conserved residues were found to surround the modified cysteine residue based on the full pair-labeled peptides. These data were presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A, B</xref> and discussed in the Results (paragraph thirteen).</p><p>The surface accessibility and structure motif analysis were performed by using the DSSP program. We downloaded a total of 108355 DSSP-annotated PDB files from rsync.cmbi.ru.nl/dssp/. Each peptide with H/L greater than 2-fold was aligned on all matching DSSP profiles, from which the 10-state structural context and accessibility were extracted. The analysis showed that the modified cysteine residue is highly accessible and preferentially located at the N-terminal of alpha helix of the protein. These data were included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C, D</xref> and discussed the aforementioned paragraph of the Results section.</p><p>We have performed an experiment in order to examine if there is a correlation between protein sulfhydration and their protein abundance. We chose to identify the entire proteome and sulfhydrome in Min6 cells treated with Tg for 18h because we would be able to better understand the metabolic response of the cells described in our manuscript. We therefore identified almost 1000 cysteine sulfhydration sites in 868 proteins by the BTA approach, and quantified the full proteome from MIN6 cells treated the Tg by using label-free, semi-quantitative MS approaches. Then, we compared the full protein abundance with two sulfhydrome datasets from either the Tg-treated, or ATF4 overexpressing MIN6 cells. The analysis showed that, protein sulfhydration does not correlate with their protein abundance. The data were presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">7</xref> and discussed the Results (paragraph ten).</p><p>4) We have employed the second gene annotation program IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com/products/ipa">http://www.ingenuity.com/products/ipa</ext-link>) to calculate the pathway enrichment of the quantified peptides. Similar to the results generated by DAVID pathway annotation program, the IPA analysis showed that glycolysis is among the top 5 highest enriched pathways based on the peptides with enriched H/L ratios (&gt;2-fold), confirming that glycolytic enzymes are primarily targeted by increased H<sub>2</sub>S levels in MIN6 cells. These data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>, and discussed the Results (paragraph thirteen).</p><p><italic>2)</italic> Reviewer 1<italic>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: The authors show the time course of induction of CSE and H<sub>2</sub>S production in response to thapsigargin.

It showed that the GSH/GSSG ratio diminished by 50% at 12h of Tg treatment compared to untreated cells, despite the total levels of GSH that increased significantly starting at 12h of Tg treatment. These data indicate that severe oxidative stress occurs during chronic ER stress. The new data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.</p><p>2) We performed an experiment to test if the induction of CSE levels was affected by antioxidant treatments in MIN6 cells treated with Tg for 18h. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and catalase (CAT) were employed as antioxidant scavengers for this purpose. The experiment showed that the antioxidants did not change the levels of induction of the CSE protein, but had protective effects on induction of apoptosis. These data are not shown in the manuscript. We chose not to include the data in the manuscript, because we plan to expand these studies and determine the significance of CSE-mediated H<sub>2</sub>S production during ER stress on cell fate.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10067.037</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Antioxidant treatments do not affect the induction of CES protein expression in MIN6 treated with Tg for 18h.</title><p>MIN6 cells were either kept in DMEM growth medium (10% heat inactive FBS, 2 mM glutamine, and 25 mM glucose) as control, or were cultured in the medium supplement with Tg alone, Tg and N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 1 mM), or Tg and catalase (CAT, 500 unit/mL) for 18h.

Cells were then sonicated on ice, lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4°C and the protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (BioRad). (Top panel) The antioxidant effects were evaluated by the caspase 3 activity assay. We found that the caspase 3 activation was significantly reduced by both antioxidant treatments compared to untreated cells. However, the induction of CSE protein expression was unaffected by the treatments (bottom panel), indicating that Increased ROS production does not contribute in induction of CSE protein levels via the ATF4 transcription program during ER stress in MIN6.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10067.037">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10067.037</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-10067-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>3)</italic> Reviewer 1<italic>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>: ATF4-deficient cells exhibit an increase in sulfhydrated GAPDH, which is attributed to a possible increase in activity of CBS.

This suggested that CBS controls protein sulfhydration during basal non-stress conditions.

We plan to study the regulation of CBS in the absence of stress in Min6 cells which are deficient of UPR markers (ATF4, PERK, XBP1, other) and further understand how stress influences Min6 metabolism and insulin secretion (GSIS). We hope the reviewers can allow this. On the other hand, we have knocked down CSE levels via the use of a shRNA, in MIN6 cells treated with Tg, and showed that protein sulfhydration decreased. Two targets of sulfhydration, GAPDH and PHGDH (phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase), were shown to have decreased levels of sulfhydration.

It may be expected to increase glycolytic intermediates that lead to synthesis of biomass for proliferation/growth. Although very interesting, we feel that this is outside the scope of this manuscript. However, the reviewer’s question is valued and should be followed in future studies. It has been reported recently, that increased insulin synthesis in pancreatic β cells promotes proliferation in a manner that involves the induction of the Unfolded Protein Response (3). It is therefore possible that increased insulin synthesis in β cells, causes induction of the UPR that acts as a protective mechanism in the continuing insulin synthesis and therefore proliferation. In contrast to this response, β cells that do not induce the UPR, they cannot properly fold and handle the additional insulin and therefore cannot have positive effects of insulin on proliferation. Future studies can explore the involvement of H<sub>2</sub>S-metabolic responses in β cells during the pre-diabetes state that β cells increase insulin synthesis in response to peripheral tissue insulin resistance.</p><p>A detailed explanation on the second part of the reviewer’s comment is given in the response to comment 4 above.</p><p><italic>The authors should discuss the physiological consequences of increased glycolytic activity under ER stress.</italic> </p><p>The physiological consequences of H<sub>2</sub>S production under ER stress in β cells are now discussed in detail (please see paragraphs one and four of the Discussion).
