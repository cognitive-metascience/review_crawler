essential to fundamental processes in eukaryotic life, including cell growth and division. In plant cytokinesis, post-Golgi trafficking mediates a massive flow of vesicles that form the partitioning membrane but its regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we identify functionally redundant Arabidopsis ARF guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (ARF-GEFs) BIG1–BIG4 as regulators of post-Golgi trafficking, mediating late secretion from the trans-Golgi network but not recycling of endocytosed proteins to the plasma membrane, although the TGN also functions as an early endosome in plants. In contrast, BIG1-4 are absolutely required for trafficking of both endocytosed and newly synthesized proteins to the cell–division plane during cytokinesis, counteracting recycling to the plasma membrane. This change from recycling to secretory trafficking pathway mediated by ARF-GEFs confers specificity of cargo delivery to the division plane and might thus ensure that the partitioning membrane is completed on time in the absence of a cytokinesis-interphase checkpoint.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02131.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02131.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02131.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane, and when a cell divides to create two new cells, it must grow a new membrane to keep the two new cells apart. Animal cells and plant cells tackle this challenge in different ways: in animal cells the new membrane grows inwards from the surface of the cell, whereas the new membrane grows outwards from the centre of the cell in plant cells.</p><p>The materials needed to make the plasma membrane are delivered in packages called vesicles: most of these materials arrive from a structure within the cell called the trans-Golgi network, but some materials are recycled from the existing plasma membrane. In plants the formation of the new cell membrane is orchestrated by scaffold-like structure that forms in the plant cell called the ‘phragmoplast’. It is widely thought that this structure guides the vesicles bringing materials from the trans-Golgi network, but the details of this process are not fully understood.</p><p>Now, Richter et al. have discovered four proteins, called BIG1 to BIG4, that control the formation of the new cell membrane in the flowering plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, a species that is routinely studied by plant biologists. These four proteins belong to a larger family of proteins that control the trafficking of vesicles within a cell. Richter et al show that a plant cell can lose up to three of these four proteins and still divide, as the plant can still grow and develop as normal. Thus, BIG1 to BIG4 appear to perform essentially the same role in the plant.</p><p>Richter et al. also show that, when a plant cell is not dividing, these proteins are involved in controlling the delivery of new materials to surface membrane, and not the recycling of material. However, when a cell is dividing, these proteins switch to regulate both processes, but direct all the material to a new destination—the newly forming membrane, instead of the established surface membrane. Richter et al. suggest that this switch is important to stop any recycling to the plasma membrane that might move material away from the new membrane. The next challenge will be to identify the molecular signals and mechanisms that enable the proteins BIG1 to BIG4 to re-route the recycling of membrane material during cell division.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02131.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02131.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>post-Golgi trafficking</kwd><kwd>gegulation of vesicle traffic</kwd><kwd>ARF-GEF</kwd><kwd>cell division</kwd><kwd>secretion</kwd><kwd>recycling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German Research Foundation (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB446/TP A9</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jürgens</surname><given-names>Gerd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German Research Foundation (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JU 179/18-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jürgens</surname><given-names>Gerd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Carlsberg Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2011_01_0789</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nielsen</surname><given-names>Mads Eggert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The same membrane trafficking cargo can change pathways mediated by different members of ARF-GEF family of vesicle formation regulators.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In post-Golgi membrane trafficking, cargo proteins are dynamically distributed between trans-Golgi network (TGN), various endosomes, lysosome/vacuole and plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Surpin and Raikhel, 2004</xref>). In contrast to animals, the TGN also functions as an early endosome in plants and is a major trafficking hub where secretory, endocytic, recycling and vacuolar pathways intersect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Viotti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Reyes et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it has been notoriously difficult to functionally delineate the recycling vs secretory pathways in plants. Sorting of cargo proteins occurs during the formation of transport vesicles, involving activation of small ARF GTPases by ARF guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (ARF-GEFs) and recruitment of specific coat proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Casanova, 2007</xref>). Arabidopsis ARF-GEFs are related to human large ARF-GEFs, GBF1 or BIG1. Whereas the three GBF1-related members GNOM, GNL1 and GNL2 have been characterised in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Geldner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Richter et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2012</xref>), of the 5 BIG1-related ARF-GEFs only BIG5 has been analysed so far and implicated in pathogen response (MIN7) and endocytic traffic (BEN1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nomura et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tanaka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tanaka et al., 2013</xref>).

Other triple mutants were growth-retarded only if the activity of the respective fourth gene was reduced to 50%. No quadruple mutants were recovered because BIG1-4 were essential in male reproduction, sustaining pollen tube growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). BIG1-4 functional redundancy would be consistent with the occurrence of <italic>BIG1-4</italic>-like single-copy or closely related sister genes in lower plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Although large ARF-GEFs are often inhibited by the fungal toxin brefeldin A (BFA), the SEC7 domain of BIG3 (At1g01960; formerly named BIG2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nielsen et al., 2006</xref>; see nomenclature used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cox et al., 2004</xref>) displayed BFA-insensitive GDP/GTP exchange activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nielsen et al., 2006</xref>).

We engineered a BFA-resistant variant of the naturally BFA-sensitive ARF-GEF BIG4 by replacing amino acid residue methionine at position 695 with leucine, as previously described for the recycling ARF-GEF GNOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Geldner et al., 2003</xref>).

Thus, BFA treatment of <italic>big3</italic> single mutants effectively causes conditional inactivation of BIG1-4 ARF-GEF function, providing us with a unique tool for studying BIG1-4-dependent trafficking in an organismic context.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02131.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>BIG1 – BIG4 act redundantly at TGN and are involved in several physiological processes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>big1,2,4 (big1 big2 big4)</italic>, <italic>big2,3,4 (big2 big3 big4)</italic>, <italic>big1,3,4 (big1 big3 big4)</italic> and <italic>big1,2,3/+,4 (big1 big2 big3/BIG3 big4)</italic> mutant plants without obvious phenotype but <italic>big1/+,2,3,4 (big1/BIG1 big2 big3 big4)</italic>, <italic>big1,2/+,3,4 (big1 big2/BIG2 big3 big4)</italic> and <italic>big1,2,3 (big1 big2 big3)</italic> were dwarfed (yellow arrowheads).

Secretory GFP (secGFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Viotti et al., 2010</xref>), which is normally secreted from the cell, and plasma membrane (PM)-targeted syntaxin SYP132 were trapped in BFA compartments and did not reach the plasma membrane of <italic>big3</italic> seedlings, in contrast to wild-type, suggesting a role for BIG1-4 in late secretory traffic, that is from the TGN to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). There was a slight retention of SYP132 in the BFA compartments of wild-type seedling roots, which probably reflects slowed-down passage of newly-synthesized proteins through the TGN.

We also analysed endocytosed plasma-membrane proteins PEN1 and PIN1 for BFA-sensitive trafficking to the cell plate in <italic>big3</italic> mutants.

When plasma membrane localized proteins are endocytosed (endocytic pathway, red), they can return to the plasma membrane via the GNOM-dependent recycling pathway (orange). During cytokinesis, newly synthesized proteins are transported from the ER to the Golgi/TGN and from there to the cell plate (CP) in BIG1-BIG4 dependent fashion.

The BFA insensitivity of the secretory pathway depends on the BFA resistance of ARF-GEF GNL1, which mediates COPI-vesicle formation in retrograde Golgi-ER traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37a">Teh and Moore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Richter et al., 2007</xref>), and also requires another BFA-resistant ARF-GEF acting in post-Golgi traffic to the plasma membrane. Here we show that ARF-GEFs BIG1-4 act at the TGN to mediate secretion of newly synthesized proteins to the plasma membrane in interphase but not recycling of endocytosed plasma-membrane proteins, and that BIG3 is BFA-resistant, unlike GNOM involved in recycling to the plasma membrane. Thus, there are two distinct trafficking pathways from the TGN to the plasma membrane in interphase. This is best illustrated by the trafficking of auxin-efflux carrier PIN1 - whereas newly synthesized PIN1 requires BIG1-4 on the late secretory pathway for non-polar delivery to the plasma membrane, polar PIN1 recycling to the basal plasma membrane solely depends on ARF-GEF GNOM (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Like newly synthesized proteins, endocytosed proteins are targeted to the division plane during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Reichardt et al., 2011</xref>). Proteins that cycle between endosomes and the plasma membrane in interphase accumulate, preferentially or even exclusively, at the cell plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Reichardt et al., 2011</xref>). In general, recycling to the plasma membrane appears to be switched off during cytokinesis. Here we show that secretory ARF-GEFs BIG1-4 are essential for protein trafficking to the plane of cell division, regardless of proteins being newly synthesized or endocytosed from the plasma membrane (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Although trafficking to the plane of cell division appears to override recycling of endocytosed proteins to the plasma membrane, we noticed one clear exception—auxin-efflux carrier PIN1, which accumulates polarly at the plasma membrane in interphase and during cell division when both BFA-resistant BIG3 and engineered BFA-resistant GNOM were expressed. Rather than substituting for BIG1-4 in traffic to the plane of cell division, recycling ARF-GEF GNOM appeared to counteract that process by promoting PIN1 recycling to the basal plasma membrane. Of course, the critical question is whether both processes occur at the same time or whether GNOM-dependent PIN1 recycling only sets in after trafficking to the cell plate has come to an end. Although there are no time-course studies, which would be difficult to perform because the process is very fast, detailed analysis of dividing cells at different mitotic stages revealed that polar recycling mediated by BFA-resistant GNOM occurs throughout mitosis and cytokinesis. Furthermore, only in the absence of both BFA-resistant BIG3 and BFA-resistant GNOM is PIN1 trapped in BFA compartments. If then BFA-resistant GNOM is expressed PIN1 is not delivered to the plane of division but rather polarly recycled to the plasma membrane, again suggesting that the latter pathway is a direct route bypassing the cell plate. PIN1 might be exceptional because continuous recycling of PIN1 is required for maintaining the polar transport of auxin across tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Geldner et al., 2003</xref>). If PIN1 recycling were shut down during cytokinesis this would disrupt the polar auxin transport required in specific developmental situations such as forming lateral root primordia when essentially all cells proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geldner et al., 2004</xref>). Another problem in auxin flow arises from cell division when the partitioning membrane has physically separated the two daughter cells: one daughter suddenly has PIN1 located at opposite ends. Obviously, PIN1 has to be removed from the wrong end in order to sustain polar auxin transport. This seems to be a fast process and has been studied for the related auxin-efflux carrier PIN2 in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Men et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Animal and plant cytokinesis differ in the way the partitioning membrane is laid down. In animals, secretory and recycling pathways contribute to the ingrowth of the plasma membrane mediated by a contractile actomyosin ring and to the subsequent abscission of the daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schiel and Prekeris, 2013</xref>). In plants, a massive flow of membrane vesicles from TGN/early endosome to the plane of cell division sustains, by fusion, the rapid formation and outward expansion of the partitioning cell plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Samuels et al., 1995</xref>). This process is orchestrated by a specialised cytoskeletal array termed phragmoplast that delivers those membrane vesicles to the division plane. Phragmoplast-assisted trafficking might be required for completing the partitioning membrane on time, in the absence of a cytokinesis-interphase checkpoint, and would thus effectively rule out recycling of endocytosed proteins to the plasma membrane. However, our results make clear that this is not the case because recycling to the plasma membrane is not switched off during cytokinesis. Rather, endocytosed proteins enter the late-secretory pathway to reach the division plane at the expense of being recycled to the plasma membrane, which requires the late-secretory ARF-GEFs BIG1-4. In conclusion, our results raise the possibility that in general, different ARF-GEFs have different specificity of action during vesicle formation such that the same cargo protein can be delivered to different destinations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>Plants were grown on soil or agar plates in growth chambers under continuous light conditions at 23°C. <italic>big</italic> mutant lines: <italic>big1</italic> (GK-452B06) and <italic>big2</italic> (GK-074F08) T-DNA lines were from GABI-KAT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gabi-kat.de">http://www.gabi-kat.de</ext-link>), <italic>big3</italic> (SALK_044617) and <italic>big4</italic> (SALK_069870) T-DNA lines from the SALK collection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress">http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress</ext-link>). <italic>big3</italic> mutant lines were selected on MS plates using kanamycin.</p><p>The following transgenic marker lines were used: H4::RFP-PEN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Reichardt et al., 2011</xref>) (expressed from <italic>HISTONE4</italic> (<italic>H4</italic>) promoter during S phase), KN::Myc-SYP132 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Reichardt et al., 2011</xref>) (expressed during lateG2/M phase), HS::secGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Viotti et al., 2010</xref>) (expressed from heat shock promoter), GFP-KN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Reichardt et al., 2007</xref>), BOR1-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Takano et al., 2005</xref>), DR5::NLS-3xGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weijers et al., 2006</xref>), VHA-a1-RFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Viotti et al., 2010</xref>), AP1M2-3xHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Park et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>T-DNA genotyping of <italic>big</italic> mutant lines</title><p>Primers used to test for <italic>big1</italic> heterozygosity:</p><p>5′GCAAGATCAGGGAAGACG 3′ and 5′ACCAGAGGAAGGTGCTTCTTC 3′</p><p>Primers used to test for <italic>big1</italic> homozygosity:</p><p>5′TCGTCCCATCTTCTTCATTTG 3′ and 5′ACCAGAGGAAGGTGCTTCTTC 3</p><p>Primers used to test for <italic>big2</italic> heterozygosity:</p><p>5′GCAAGATCAGGGAAGACG 3′ and 5′TTGAGGGGTTCATATGACAGC 3′</p><p>Primers used to test for <italic>big2</italic> homozygosity:</p><p>5′TTTCCCACTTTTTCCACTGTG 3′ and 5′TTGAGGGGTTCATATGACAGC 3′</p><p>Primers used to test for <italic>big3</italic> heterozygosity:</p><p>5′AAACTCTCCACTGGCTAAGCC 3′ and 5′ATTTTGCCGATTTCGGAAC 3′</p><p>Primers used to test for <italic>big3</italic> homozygosity:</p><p>5′AAACTCTCCACTGGCTAAGCC 3′ and 5′GCAAGTTTTCTTGCGCAATAC 3′</p><p>Primers used to test for <italic>big4</italic> heterozygosity:</p><p>5′ATTTTGCCGATTTCGGAAC 3′ and 5′CTATCTTGCGCTGGAGACAAC 3′</p><p>Primers used to test for <italic>big4</italic> homozygosity:</p><p>5′TCCTCTTCAAACTCGTCAACG 3′ and 5′CTATCTTGCGCTGGAGACAAC 3′</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Generating transgenic plants</title><p>Genomic BIG4 was amplified and introduced into pDONR221 (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) and afterwards into <italic>UBQ10::YFP</italic> destination vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grefen et al., 2010</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before reaching this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers agree that your paper addresses important unresolved issues and that both experiments and data presentation are of exceptional quality. There is however some discussion regarding your conclusion that “endocytosed proteins enter the late secretory pathway to reach the division plane at the expense of being recycled to the plasma membrane, which is regulated by the switch to the late secretory ARF-GEFS BIG1-4” that we would like you to address. The reviewers consider this is a significant claim because the identity of the cell-plate pathway and its relationship to pathways that operate in interphase has been a longstanding unresolved controversy. However, they fail to see how these specific conclusions can be drawn from the present data. We would like to ask you to consider the following reviewer comments in detail:</p><p>1) Although the data show that traffic of all cargoes to the cell plate requires BIG1-4, I see no evidence that BIG1-4 REGULATE a switch of cargoes from one pathway to another.</p><p>2) Second, an important piece of evidence is that in BFA-treated <italic>big3</italic> GN<sup>R</sup> plants PIN1 proteins recycle to their normal polar position at the basal PM during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5V-X</xref>). This implies that recycling continues during cytokinesis so traffic to the cell plate requires sorting of PIN1 away from that pathway into the BIG1-4 pathway. I think the authors are using the presence of the cytokinesis-specific syntaxin KNOLLE to identify cells undergoing cytokinesis. Normally this is reasonable because KNOLLE is so rapidly degraded in the vacuole after cytokinesis but I am concerned here that in BFA-treated <italic>big3</italic> plants KNOLLE may be artificially stabilised as trafficking to the vacuole is inhibited under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Indeed the extensive labelling of whole files of cells is unusual for a marker of cytokinesis suggesting that there may be temporal stability. Treatment seems to have been for 3 h so the majority of cells that contain KNOLLE may have gone through (failed) cytokinesis some time ago. Isn't it possible that recycling to the plasma membrane does not in fact occur during cytokinesis, that endocytosed PIN1 accumulated in BFA-compartments during cytokinesis, but was recycled back to the PM in the subsequent G1. If so the important change could be the inhibition of the GN-pathway during cytokinesis causing endocytosed proteins to enter the default secretory pathway at the TGN, rather than any regulatory role for BIGs.</p><p>3) Even if recycling to the PM does occur during cytokinesis, I do not think the data shows compellingly that there is indeed such a switch (during cell plate assembly) from the GN-dependent recycling pathway to the BIG1-4-dependent secretory pathway.</p><p>a) Although the data show that GNOM is sufficient to recycle a majority of endocytosed protein, can it be excluded that a fraction of endocytosed protein that enters the TGN in interphase is returned by the BIG1-4 secretory pathway? If so, it could be this fraction that arrives in the cell plate during cytokinesis. This might explain why endocytosed PIN1 in BFA-treated wild-type appears to accumulate in BFA-compartments (cell plate associated and detached) as well as the cell plate.</p><p>b) Although some endocytosed protein arrives in the cell plate, is it clear that all or most endocytosed protein goes there as proposed?</p><p>4) To resolve question 2 convincingly I think the authors will need at least to show time-lapse data on cells of relevant genotypes undergoing cytokinesis with and without BFA treatments. There probably needs to be an independent marker of cell cycle stage such as tubulin-GFP, which would also provide evidence that phragmoplasts are normal in the BFA-treated cells. I also think that it would be important to ask whether newly-synthesised PIN1 is trapped in interphase BFA compartments in <italic>big3</italic> and <italic>big3</italic> GN<sup>R</sup>. To resolve the second question, perhaps photoswitchable fluorescent proteins which are available may also be suitable though I realise that they are not easy to image. Protein could be photoconverted in the BFA compartment of BFA-treated Col and followed over time to look at its rate of return to the PM versus the cell plate when cells enter cytokinesis – I don't recall this specific experiment being been done before.</p><p>5) From our perspective, the time-lapse (or equivalent) data would be necessary to establish the crucial point about recycling during cytokinesis. We imagine you should be in a position to do this without much delay and to establish the stability of KN in <italic>big3</italic>+BFA - one reviewer suggests that the conditionality of the BFA-induced phenotype is a perfect system for such experiments. The photoswitch experiment or similar is much more demanding but without it there is ambiguity about whether anything really changes with respect to PIN1 trafficking during cytokinesis, a major claim of the paper. If this point remains unclarified, we think the Discussion and title will need to change to reflect this.</p><p>6) The reviewers also question the coining of BIG1-4 as “regulatory switches”. It seems that the paper does not demonstrate a direct molecular mechanism in which BIG1-4 display a switch-like function, rather you seem to provide genetic evidence that BIG1-4 are necessary for the observed changes in trafficking. At this point, alternative hypotheses, e.g., that GN or something else on the GN pathway is somehow inactivated during cytokinesis, also appear plausible. We understand that this is partly a semantic issue, but we still would like to ask you to re-word appropriately.</p><p>We hope you will be able to address the above issue, but let us clarify that the remaining points that cell plate assembly requires BIG1-4 and so is derived from a biosynthetic pathway at the TGN, and that there are two distinct classes of TGN with distinct ARF-GEFs that keep biosynthetic and recycling cargo separate, are valuable contributions. For these alone, your paper merits publication, but it would have to be revised accordingly in the Discussion and title.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02131.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Although the data show that traffic of all cargoes to the cell plate requires BIG1-4, I see no evidence that BIG1-4 REGULATE a switch of cargoes from one pathway to another</italic>.</p><p>This is partly a semantic issue but we understand the concern and have toned down the statement, avoiding “regulation” and “switch”. In our view, nonetheless, BIG1-4 are absolutely required for trafficking to the cell plate. They cannot be substituted by e.g., GNOM, which rather mediates recycling to the plasma membrane (see also reply to the next comment). Thus, there is a specific trafficking pathway to the cell plate mediated by secretory ARF-GEFs and taken by both newly synthesised and endocytosed cargo proteins.</p><p><italic>2) Second, an important piece of evidence is that in BFA-treated</italic> big3 <italic>GN</italic><sup><italic>R</italic></sup> <italic>plants PIN1 proteins recycle to their normal polar position at the basal PM during cytokinesis (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5, V-X</italic></xref><italic>).

The experiment has been repeated, using anti-tubulin immunostaining of mitotic microtubule arrays and DAPI staining of nuclear chromatin as reliable markers for mitotic staging of dividing cells. The new results reveal polar localisation of PIN1 at the plasma membrane in dividing cells of GN-BFAr at successive stages of mitosis (metaphase to telophase) and cytokinesis (cell plate being formed, laterally expanded or nearly complete), this being accompanied by PIN1 accumulation at the cell plate during cytokinesis (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 3</xref>). The control images (wild-type, i.e., GNOM inactivated by BFA) also show PIN1 accumulation at the cell plate but no polar accumulation at the basal plasma membrane.

It has been documented many times since the first analysis published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Geldner et al.

This might explain why endocytosed PIN1 in BFA-treated wild-type appears to accumulate in BFA-compartments (cell plate associated and detached) as well as the cell plate</italic>.</p><p>When BIG3 is deleted and GNOM rendered BFA-resistant PIN1 does not reach the cell plate but is properly recycled to the basal plasma membrane (see also reply to preceding comment).</p><p><italic>b) Although some endocytosed protein arrives in the cell plate, is it clear that all or most endocytosed protein goes there</italic> <italic>as proposed</italic>?</p><p>A previous quantitative study of endocytosed PEN1 distribution in cytokinesis cells indicated that most PEN1 accumulates at the cell plate with little, if any, signal remaining at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Reichardt et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) To resolve question 2 convincingly I think the authors will need at least to show time-lapse data on cells of relevant genotypes undergoing cytokinesis with and without BFA treatments</italic>.</p><p>This is technically challenging and beyond the scope of the present paper. However, we think that our detailed analysis of dividing cells at different stages of mitosis and cytokinesis essentially provides the relevant information.

Unlike KN, these markers are not likely affected by changes in trafficking conditions. We detected PIN1 polar accumulation at the basal plasma membrane at all mitotic stages from metaphase to anaphase to telophase as well as during initiation, expansion and completion of the cell plate, revealing progression of cytokinesis. During cytokinesis, polar accumulation at the PM was accompanied by accumulation at the cell plate when both BFA-resistant BIG3 was present and GNOM was rendered BFA-resistant.</p><p><italic>One reviewer suggests that the conditionality of the BFA-induced phenotype is a perfect system for such experiments</italic>.</p><p>We agree, in principle. However, the dynamics of the process is enormous, and our previous experience with GFP-tagged KN suggests that the short duration of cytokinesis makes live-imaging challenging. Thus, the effort required may well be beyond the scope the present paper.</p><p><italic>The photoswitch experiment or similar is much more demanding but without it there is ambiguity about whether anything really changes with respect to PIN1 trafficking during cytokinesis, a major claim of the paper. If this point remains unclarified, we think the Discussion and Title will need to change to reflect this</italic>.</p><p>See our new data on Col vs. GN-BFAr and the expanded Discussion. We have modified the Results and Discussion sections accordingly.</p><p><italic>6) The reviewers also question the coining of BIG1-4 as “regulatory switches”. It seems that the paper does not demonstrate a direct molecular mechanism in which BIG1-4 display a switch-like function, rather you seem to provide genetic evidence that BIG1-4 are necessary for the observed changes in trafficking. At this point, alternative hypotheses, e.g., that GN or something else on the GN pathway is somehow inactivated during cytokinesis, also appear plausible. We understand that this is partly a semantic issue, but we still would like to ask you to re-word appropriately</italic>.</p><p>We agree that we cannot present a molecular mechanism regulating the pathway change of endocytosed cargo proteins in cytokinesis. However, our results strongly suggest that GNOM is still functional during mitotic and cytokinetic stages. This implies to us that the destination of cargo proteins, division plane or plasma membrane, depends on whether they are recruited to membrane vesicles whose formation is mediated by BIG1-4 or GNOM, respectively.</p><p><italic>We hope you will be able to address the above issue, but let us clarify that the remaining points that cell plate assembly requires BIG1-4 and so is derived from a biosynthetic pathway at the TGN, and that there are two distinct classes of TGN with distinct ARF-GEFs that keep biosynthetic and recycling cargo separate are valuable contributions. For these alone, your paper merits publication, but it would have to be revised accordingly in the Discussion and Title</italic>.</p><p>In order to avoid confusion for the reader, we have changed the title and the Discussion as suggested and make no claim regarding switches or molecular regulation of the process.</p></body></sub-article></article>
