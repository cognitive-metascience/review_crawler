We report that hemocytes in the caterpillar, <italic>Pieris rapae</italic> are able to synthesize 5-HT following activation by lipopolysaccharide. The inhibition of a serotonin-generating enzyme with either pharmacological blockade or RNAi knock-down impaired hemocyte phagocytosis. Biochemical and functional experiments showed that naive hemocytes primarily express 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors. The blockade of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> significantly reduced phagocytic ability; however, the blockade of 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> increased hemocyte phagocytosis. The 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>-null <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> mutants showed higher mortality than controls when infected with bacteria, due to their decreased phagocytotic ability. Flies expressing 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> or 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> RNAi in hemocytes also showed similar sensitivity to infection. Combined, these data demonstrate that 5-HT mediates hemocyte phagocytosis through 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors and serotonergic signaling performs critical modulatory functions in immune systems of animals separated by 500 million years of evolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12241.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12241.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12241.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Serotonin is a small molecule found in organisms across the animal kingdom. This molecule plays various roles in the human body and affects many systems including the gut and central nervous system. Over recent decades, serotonin has been found to play a role in the immune system too, and appears to help regulate how immune cells respond to invasion by infectious bacteria or viruses. Various types of immune cells that can engulf foreign particles or microorganisms via a process called phagocytosis have receptors for serotonin on their cell surface and are activated when serotonin is present.</p><p>Signaling pathways associated with part of the immune system in mammals are often highly similar to pathways found in insects. Serotonin is also known to influence many processes in insects, such as appetite, sleep and reproduction, but its role in the insect’s immune system was not well understood. In particular, insects have phagocytic cells known as hemocytes and it was unknown if serotonin helps to activate these cells.</p><p>Qi, Huang et al. have now discovered that serotonin does indeed control the activity of insect hemocytes from the caterpillars of the small white butterfly (<italic>Pieris rapae</italic>)and the fruit fly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>). The experiments showed that two distinct receptors on a hemocyte’s cell surface can detect serotonin. One of these receptors increases phagocytic activity in both insects, while the other has the opposite effect in the caterpillar and reduces this activity.Qi, Huang et al. also discovered that phagocytosis depends on which of these receptors is most common on the hemocyte cell surface, and demonstrated that insects exposed to bacteria start to produce more of the serotonin receptors that increase phagocytosis. Further experiments showed that fruit flies in which the gene for a serotonin receptor has been deleted are more vulnerable to bacterial infections due to their poor phagocytic ability.</p><p>Insects and mammals are separated by about 500 million years of evolution, and so these findings suggest that serotonin is an ancient signaling molecule that can control the immune system across the animal kingdom. The work also supports the idea that studies of the simpler immune systems of insects, including the model organisms such as <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, can offer insight into the immune systems of humans and other animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12241.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12241.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>serotonin receptor</kwd><kwd>hemocyte</kwd><kwd>phagocytosis</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>bacteria infection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013CB127600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31572039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31321063</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Gong-yin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Insects use serotonin signaling in blood cells to help defend themselves against pathogens.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is one of the oldest neurotransmitters/hormones in evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turlejski, 1996</xref>). It regulates or modulates a wide variety of processes in most invertebrates and vertebrates, such as metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sze et al., 2000</xref>) and locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ranganathan et al., 2000</xref>) in nematodes; reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anstey et al., 2009</xref>), learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sitaraman et al., 2008</xref>) in insects; physiologic states and behaviors, including pain, appetite, mood, and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mössner and Lesch, 1998</xref>) in humans. 5-HT also plays an important role outside of the central nervous system (CNS) in immune signaling. Immune cells can synthesize and sequester 5-HT. For instance, human mast cells express the key peripheral 5-HT synthesizing enzyme, tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kushnir-Sukhov et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2008</xref>). Mouse dendritic cells (DCs) express the serotonin transporter (SERT), taking up 5-HT from the microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">O'Connell et al., 2006</xref>). 5-HT regulates immune responses and inflammatory cascades via distinct receptors and different immune cells have been shown to express a different composition of 5-HT receptor subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baganz and Blakely, 2013</xref>). 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> may contribute to chemotaxis of eosinophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boehme et al., 2008</xref>) and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors on alveolar macrophages can be activated by 5-HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mikulski et al., 2010</xref>). However, most studies assess the in vitro response of immune cells to pharmacological agents. Therefore, the function of 5-HT signaling in vivo in are still unclear.</p><p>Vertebrate blood cells (e.g. macrophages) have evolved a variety of strategies to internalize particles and solutes, including pinocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and phagocytosis, a highly conserved aspect of innate immunity. Phagocytosis, the uptake of large particles (&gt;0.5 μm) into cells, allows for rapid engulfment of dying cells and pathogens by specialized phagocytes, such as macrophages and neutrophils in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aderem and Underhill, 1999</xref>). In insects, hemocyte phagocytosis is an important cellular defense response to pathogens and parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lavine and Strand, 2002</xref>). In lepidopteran insects, the granulocytes and plasmatocytes are the major phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kanost et al., 2004</xref>). Cross-talk between the immune and nervous system may play a role in regulating phagocytosis in insects during infection. However, the roles of serotonin in insect phagocytosis are less well characterized compared with vertebrate counterparts, although there is evidence that 5-HT can enhance phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baines et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al.,2009</xref>).</p><p>Many of the intracellular signaling pathways that drive the insect immune system are very similar to those found in the mammalian innate immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>), and some of them were first uncovered in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hoffmann, 2003</xref>). Indirect evidence suggests that similarities between insects and mammals extend to the molecular mechanisms involved in the neuroendocrine control of immune function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamo, 2008</xref>). Because of the relative simplicity of the insect immune system, examining the basic interactions between serotonin receptor-medicated second messenger systems and immune-related intracellular signaling pathways may be easier in insects. As an initial step toward this goal, we have made a comprehensive study in the caterpillar, <italic>Pieris rapae</italic> hemocytes to elucidate the function of 5-HT signaling in insect cellular immune responses. We found that hemocyte-derived 5-HT regulates phagocytosis in an autocrine manner through 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors, each of which produces distinct effects. Mortality experiments using <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants and hemocyte-specific RNAi-silencing further found that both 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> are necessary for effective resistance to bacterial infections.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hemocytes synthesize 5-HT in an activation-dependent manner</title><p>After activation with 100 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 2 hr, we detected 5-HT within hemocytes directly by immunolabeling and fluorescence microscopy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows that granules of 5-HT labeled with 5-HT antisera (upper) are readily visible in the cytosol. As a negative control, 5-HT antisera preabsorbed with 5-HT were invisible (lower). Serotonin synthesis requires two enzymes, tryptophan hydroxylase and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Tryptophan hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin biosynthesis encoded by two genes, TPH and TRH in insects, TPH1 and TPH2 in mammals. Both gene products have tryptophan hydroxylase activity in vivo. The TPH/TPH1 gene is expressed in non-neural tissues, and the TRH/TPH2 gene is expressed in neural tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Côté et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Neckameyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Watanabe et al., 2011</xref>). The high-affinity SERT is a plasma membrane protein that can take up extracellular 5-HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rudnick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Torres et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, we performed RT-PCR to characterize TPH, TRH, and SERT expression in hemocytes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows that hemocytes produced mRNA for <italic>TPH</italic>, but that transcripts of <italic>TRH</italic> and <italic>SERT</italic> were not detected. These results suggest that hemocytes do not selectively sequester 5-HT but can synthesize 5-HT using TPH. Then, we performed ELISA to quantify the amount of 5-HT released into the hemocytes’ culture media. 5-HT levels increased significantly above that found in controls in cell supernatants 1 hr after exposure of hemocytes to LPS. 5-HT levels reached maximal at 2 hr and decreased at 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The real-time quantitative RT-PCR results also show that mRNA expression level of <italic>TPH</italic> was up-regulated by approximately sixfold relative to controls at 15 min and at 4 hr after LPS stimulation, suggesting a potential negative feedback regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Therefore, it is concluded that hemocytes are able to synthesize and release 5-HT in vitro, and this activity is enhanced following their activation. We hypothesise that 5-HT may play an important role in hemocyte function.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12241.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Activated hemocytes are capable of 5-HT synthesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 5-HT was visualized by confocal microscopy in hemocytes activated with 100 ng/ml LPS by labeling with 5-HT antisera (Alexa Fluor 546; red) (upper left). 5-HT antisera was preabsorbed with 5-HT as the negative control (lower left).

Three selective 5-HT receptor antagonists (SB 216641, SB 269970, and RS 127445) were applied at a final concentration of 10 μM to block their corresponding receptors. The inhibition effects of SB 216641 and SB 269970 on Pr5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and Pr5-HT<sub>7</sub> were also confirmed by cAMP assays in heterogeneous expression system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found that only blockade of Pr5-HT<sub>1B</sub> significantly reduced the phagocytic ability of hemocytes. Blockade of Pr5-HT<sub>7</sub> neither intensified nor reduced hemocyte phagocytosis. Surprisingly, blockade of 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> significantly increased hemocyte phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–H</xref>).</p><p>We further found that the 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> blocker SB 216641 affected hemocyte phagocytosis in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To confirm the above results, we performed siRNA-mediated interference to knock-down each receptor in hemocytes. The results showed that si<italic>Pr5-HT<sub>1B</sub></italic>decreased Pr5-HT<sub>1B</sub> expression significantly at both mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B–C</xref>) after 24 hr and 48 hr, respectively.

This paper is the first to demonstrate that insect hemocytes express TPH and can synthesize 5-HT, like human macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakamura et al., 2008</xref>). The exposure of hemocytes to LPS led to an induction of TPH expression and a release of 5-HT. Moreover, the secreted 5-HT appears to be an important autocrine stimulus. It promotes phagocytosis: inhibition of TPH either by a competitive inhibitor or siRNA silencing resulted in significantly decreased hemocyte phagocytosis.</p><p>Chemicals that act as neurotransmitters in the nervous system can also modulate immune function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meredith et al., 2005</xref>). 5-HT is one of these classical neurotransmitters that is also an important immune regulatory molecule in both insects and mammals. Recent research has made progress in determining 5-HT modulated mammalian immune responses, especially regarding the machinery to produce, store, release, and respond to 5-HT in immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahern, 2011</xref>). 5-HT was also reported to mediate immune responses, such as hemocyte phagocytosis, nodule formation and hemocyte population in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baines et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim and Kim, 2010</xref>), but the signaling pathway is unclear. <italic>Drosophila</italic> TPH homolog gene <italic>Henna</italic> was found to be one hit in a genome-wide RNAi screen for genes that affect phagocytosis of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> by hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stroschein-Stevenson et al., 2006</xref>). Examining the basic interactions between serotonin receptor-medicated second messenger systems and immune-related intracellular signaling pathways in insects may shed light on their interactions and functions in mammals.</p><p>Second, our findings show that naive hemocytes express 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors, but only 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> appear to have functional roles. Using selective antagonists and RNAi, we found that inhibition of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> decreases hemocyte phagocytosis. However, inhibition of 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> enhances hemocyte phagocytosis. It seems that activation of these two receptors affects hemocytes in opposite ways. Interestingly, we found that 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> is dramatically up-regulated following hemocyte activation, but 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> is significantly down-regulated. Therefore, even though the two receptors have opposite functions upon activation, the overall effects of 5-HT signaling induced by immune challenge are favorable for hemocyte phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Mammalian DCs also express 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>, via which 5-HT induces chemotaxis and in vivo migration of DCs to draining lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Müller et al., 2009</xref>). Even though insect plasmatocytes are macrophage-like cells, 5-HT activates macrophage cells via 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakamura et al., 2008</xref>) and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mikulski et al., 2010</xref>), which are different from the receptor sub-types found in insect hemocytes. The 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor plays a critical role in the immune response in the gut of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Although our results indicated that 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors were not involved in insect hemocyte phagocytosis, they may be critical for other immune activities.</p><p>Many neurotransmitter receptors are found on mammalian immune cells and regulate innate immune response, however, it is still unclear about their general role at the organismal level because most studies are conducted in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sternberg, 2006</xref>). However, it is relatively easy to test immunity in insects in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>). We found that the <italic>5-HT<sub>1B</sub></italic> deficiency flies were more vulnerable to bacterial infections due to their poor phagocytic ability. Hemocyte-specific RNAi experiments showed similar results, indicating that the 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>-mediated hemocyte phagocytosis is important for insects to defend themselves against pathogens. Surprisingly, the flies expressing 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> RNAi in their hemocytes were more susceptible to bacterial infections, suggesting that activation of 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> may promote phagocytosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, different from the results in <italic>P. rapae</italic>.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that insect hemocytes can synthesis and release 5-HT, which regulates phagocytosis via 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors on the membrane of the hemocyte. We also used the genetic model <italic>Drosophila</italic> to further confirm the roles of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> in vivo. These findings suggest that serotonin, an ancient signaling molecule, modifies immune function in animals across phyla. Exploring the interactions between serotonin receptor-mediated pathways and immune-related pathways may be easier to initiate in insects, which have a simpler immune system.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Insects</title><p><italic>P. rapae</italic> larvae were collected primarily from cabbage ﬁelds in the experimental farmland of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China and the laboratory colony of <italic>P. rapae</italic> was reared at 25 ± 1°C and 70% relative humidity under a photoperiod of 14 hr light: 10 hr dark in a greenhouse as previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al.

The cells were subsequently washed twice with a bathing solution (152 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 5.5 mM glucose, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). The coverslips were transferred to a microscopic chamber that was constantly perfused with the bathing solution at ≈ 2 ml/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). The fluorescence at 510 nm by excitation at 340 or 380 nm with a xenon lamp was measured with individual cells using an Easy Ratio Pro calcium imaging system (Photon Technology International, Birmingham, NJ). Each experiment was repeated three times or more. EC<sub>50</sub> values were estimated by fitting to a dose-dependent curve in Origin Pro (Origin Lab, Northampton, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Survival following infection</title><p>The tetracycline-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> was grown overnight in a shaking incubator at 37ºC shaking at 225 rpm. Cultures were spun down. The resuspended cells were diluted in sterile PBS to achieve an optical density (OD) of 0.4. Five to seven days post-eclosion, flies were injected with 32.2 nl of the bacterial resuspension using a Drummond Scientific Nanoject II. Flies were kept at 25°C. Flies that died within 6 hr were considered dead and were removed from the count.

Approximately 24 female flies per genotype were injected with 23 nl of the bacterial suspension. Eight flies from each group were then immediately homogenized in individual tubes with 100 μl sterile PBS. The material was serially diluted to 1:10, twice, in sterile PBS, and then plated on LB plates containing tetracycline. After 6 and 18 hr of infection at 25°C, eight additional flies from each genotype per time point were assayed as above with the exception that each sample was serially diluted 1:10 five times. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 8 to 10 hr. Bacterial colonies were counted when the colonies remain small and discrete.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data had a normal distribution and are expressed as means ± standard error (s.e.m.). Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test and Student t tests. Log rank tests were used to determine whether survival curves of male flies were significantly different from one another. Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test were used to determine whether survival curves of female flies were significantly different from one another. All curve fitting and statistical calculations were performed with Origin 8.0 (Origin Lab, Northampton, MA) and GraphPad Prism 5.0 (San Diego, CA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by National Program on Key Basic Research Projects (2013CB127600), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31572039) and China National Science Fund for Innovative Research Groups of Biological Control (31321063).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by three reviewers, including Dan Hultmark and a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation was overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In Qi et al., the authors present evidence that the neurotransmitter serotonin is secreted by activated hemocytes in the caterpillar <italic>Pieris rapae</italic>. Inhibition of serotonin production decreased hemocyte phagocytosis. The authors identified two serotonin receptors expressed in hemocytes, <italic>Pr5-HT<sub>1B</sub></italic> and <italic>Pr5-HT<sub>2B</sub></italic>. Blocking the activity of each of these receptors demonstrates that <italic>Pr5-HT<sub>1B</sub></italic> promotes phagocytosis, while <italic>Pr5-HT<sub>2B</sub></italic> inhibits it. However, upon activation by LPS, the authors observed that <italic>Pr5-HT<sub>1B</sub></italic> expression is up-regulated while <italic>Pr5-HT<sub>2B</sub></italic> is down-regulated, resulting in a net increase in phagocytosis during activation. The authors wanted to test the if inhibition of serotonin signaling decreases hemocyte phagocytosis in vivo, so they performed bacterial infection assays in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, comparing wild-type flies to 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptor mutants. They found decreased phagocytosis of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptor mutants as well as decreased survival upon infection. Overall, the authors argue that serotonin signaling plays an important role in insect innate immunity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The work done in the caterpillar is well done and nicely controlled. There are similar results already published for other insect species (Kim GS, Nalini M, Kim Y, Lee DW, Arch Insect Biochem Physiol. 2009; Kim GS and Kim Y, J Insect Physiol. 2010) and these need to be acknowledged up front in the introductory section with a sentence justifying why this study is still relevant. The reviewers found that the butterfly experiments are more detailed than in the older literature and that the extension to <italic>Drosophila</italic> opens up new possibilities for extending this research. Unfortunately, it is the fruit fly results that are not substantial enough to warrant an <italic>eLife</italic> publication. If some more characterization is presented in terms of phenotype and mechanisms, then this will achieve that goal. The authors are the best judges of the experiments that will further consolidate the fruit fly story. The manuscript will benefit from such addition. Of course, if necessary changes will take longer than 2 months, the authors could resubmit an expanded manuscript. The following major questions are provided as examples of questions that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) Is the receptor 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> required autonomously in hemocytes?</p><p>Does hemocyte-autonomous RNAi of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> affect the phagocytosis response, CFU after infection, and overall survival after infection? The authors could use <italic>Hml∆-GAL4</italic> and ideally two independent <italic>UAS</italic>-RNAi lines. For suitable readouts of CFU and phagocytosis see below.</p><p>2) Does 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> indeed mediate phagocytic behavior in hemocytes and bacterial clearance as measured by CFU (or other hemocyte response/s)?</p><p>Regarding the quantification of CFU after bacterial infection, it is unclear if bacterial strains with a resistance gene were used? This is not mentioned in the methods and needs to be clarified. Use of bacteria with a resistance marker is needed so injected bacteria can be distinguished from the naturally occurring bacterial load.</p><p>To carefully evaluate phagocytosis the authors should, at a minimum, use the trypan blue phagocytosis assay as described by Elrod-Erickson et al. Curr. Biol. 2000.</p><p>3) Does infection or LPS challenge indeed trigger an increased phagocytic hemocyte response through 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>?</p><p>Does hemocyte-specific kd of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> dampen phagocytosis in general, or is there indeed a lack of inducibility, e.g. after LPS challenge? Comparison of injecting fluorescent beads -/+LPS would allow to address this. A wt control should be used in parallel to confirm inducibility by the immune challenge here. The experiment could also be performed by injecting fluorescent beads with -/+ 5-HT.</p><p>4) Do 5-HT levels increase upon bacterial infection in <italic>Drosophila</italic>? It would be easy to perform a hemolymph ELISA (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) to see if 5-HT levels increase upon infection in flies.</p><p>5) Both 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> seem to be expressed in hemocytes of uninfected adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). But the entire focus of the infection study phenotype is limited to the 1B mutant. What effects, if any, does inhibition/reduction of 2B have on phagocytosis and the lifespan of immune challenged animals? Would it be the same as in the caterpillar? If there is no mutant for 2B, the authors could minimally check levels of 2B expression in the hemocytes of infected animals, and perhaps one would see a down regulation similar to that in the caterpillar. There are MiMIC and TRiP lines available at BDSC, and minimally, 2B RNAi lines could be used to determine if this leads to increased phagocytosis and increased survival when challenged with bacterial infection.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12241.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>The work done in the caterpillar is well done and nicely controlled.

Of course, if necessary changes will take longer than 2 months, the authors could resubmit an expanded manuscript. The following major questions are provided as examples of questions that need to be addressed. 1) Is the receptor 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> required autonomously in hemocytes?

As show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, hemocyte-specific knockdown of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> decreased hemocyte phagocytic capacity, increased the bacterial load and susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p><p> <italic>2) Does 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> indeed mediate phagocytic behavior in hemocytes and bacterial clearance as measured by CFU (or other hemocyte response/s)?

Curr. Biol. 2000.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ constructive comments and suggestions. We are sorry for the unclear information regarding the bacterial strains we used. The bacterial strain <italic>S. aureus</italic> is resistant to tetracycline and the LB plates contain tetracycline. We have added the information in the Methods.</p><p>The bacteria we used to evaluate phagocytosis are <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> labeled with pHrodo, a dye that fluoresces in the acidic environment of a mature phagosome upon fusion with lysosomes. This method reduces signal variability and improves assay reproducibility since wash steps and quencher dyes are not needed. It is now widely used in mammals (Fiala M et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 104:12849-12854, 2007; Berger SB et al., Nat Immunol.11:920-927,2010; Neaga A et al., J Immunol Methods. 2011) and insects including <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Cuttell L et al., Cell 135, 524-534, 2008; Ulvila J et al., J Leukoc Biol. 89(5): 649-59, 2011; Stone EFet al., PLoS Pathog. 8(1): e1002445, 2012; Lombardo Fet al., PLoS Pathog. 9(1): e1003145, 2013; Regan JC et al., PLoS Pathog. 9(10): e1003720, 2013; Garg A and Wu LP. Cell Microbiol. 16(2): 296-310, 2014). Besides, we also tested the classical trypan blue phagocytosis assay described by Elrod-Erickson et al. (Curr. Biol. 2000) to check the hemocyte phagocytic difference between <italic>5-HT<sub>1B</sub></italic> null flies and control flies. The results are in Author response image 1 and similar to that by the pHrodo dye assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, we still used the pHrodo dye in phagocytosis assays of this paper.</p><p>Quantification of in vivo phagocytosis of <italic>E. coli.</italic></p><p> <italic>3) Does infection or LPS challenge indeed trigger an increased phagocytic hemocyte response through 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>?</italic> </p><p> <italic>Does hemocyte-specific kd of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> dampen phagocytosis in general, or is there indeed a lack of inducibility, e.g. after LPS challenge? Comparison of injecting fluorescent beads -/+LPS would allow to address this. A wt control should be used in parallel to confirm inducibility by the immune challenge here. The experiment could also be performed by injecting fluorescent beads with -/+ 5-HT.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this valuable comment. Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we used latex beads with -/+ 5-HT to address this question. Flies injected with PBS all show similar phagocytic capacity. However, when flies are injected with 5-HT, the flies expressing 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> RNAi in blood cells take up significantly less latex beads than the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). These results indicate that hemocyte-specific knockdown of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> flies do not have a more limited phagocytic capacity, but instead become unable to enhance phagocytosis upon exposure to 5-HT.</p><p> <italic>4) Do 5-HT levels increase upon bacterial infection in Drosophila? It would be easy to perform a hemolymph ELISA (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) to see if 5-HT levels increase upon infection in flies.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. However, we have tried many times with different protocols but still failed to culture hemocytes in the medium without contamination for a longer time (&gt;30 min). The small body size makes the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae extremely difficult to isolate clean hemolymph like we did on the caterpillar.</p><p> <italic>5) Both 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> seem to be expressed in hemocytes of uninfected adult Drosophila (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). But the entire focus of the infection study phenotype is limited to the 1B mutant. What effects, if any, does inhibition/reduction of 2B have on phagocytosis and the lifespan of immune challenged animals? Would it be the same as in the caterpillar? If there is no mutant for 2B, the authors could minimally check levels of 2B expression in the hemocytes of infected animals, and perhaps one would see a down regulation similar to that in the caterpillar. There are MiMIC and TRiP lines available at BDSC, and minimally, 2B RNAi lines could be used to determine if this leads to increased phagocytosis and increased survival when challenged with bacterial infection.</italic></p><p>Following these comments, we have used <italic>Hml∆-GAL4</italic> and two independent <italic>UAS-5-HT<sub>2B</sub></italic> RNAi lines to investigate the role of 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> in phagocytosis and the lifespan of immune challenged animals. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> shows, the reduced levels of 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> in hemocyte led to the defect in phagocytosis of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A-D</xref>) and that was associated with higher bacterial load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>) and increased susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E-G</xref>) in the flies. The results suggest that activation of 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> may promote phagocytosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, different from the results in the caterpillar.</p></body></sub-article></article>
