constant ATP level (‘set-point’) is a vital homeostatic function shared by eukaryotic cells. In particular, mammalian myocardium exquisitely safeguards its ATP set-point despite 10-fold fluctuations in cardiac workload. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this regulation of ATP homeostasis remain elusive. Here we show mitochondrial flashes (mitoflashes), recently discovered dynamic activity of mitochondria, play an essential role for the auto-regulation of ATP set-point in the heart. Specifically, mitoflashes negatively regulate ATP production in isolated respiring mitochondria and, their activity waxes and wanes to counteract the ATP supply-demand imbalance caused by superfluous substrate and altered workload in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, manipulating mitoflash activity is sufficient to inversely shift the otherwise stable ATP set-point. Mechanistically, the Bcl-xL-regulated proton leakage through F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase appears to mediate the coupling between mitoflash production and ATP set-point regulation. These findings indicate mitoflashes appear to constitute a digital auto-regulator for ATP homeostasis in the heart.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23908.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23908.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23908.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A small molecule called ATP is often referred to as the primary “energy currency” of living cells. It is required to power tasks as diverse as the general housekeeping processes that keep all cells alive to the programmed cell death response that dismantles any cells that are no longer needed. It is also crucial that cells maintain a constant level of ATP at all times, even when the supply of and demand for ATP fluctuate. This control is particularly important in the mammalian heart where the rates of ATP production and consumption change ten-fold during intense exercise. Despite intensive research over the past decades, it was still not known how cells keep ATP levels constant.</p><p>In many cell types, including heart muscle cells, ATP is mainly produced inside compartments called mitochondria. Each heart muscle cell contains between 5,000 and 8,000 mitochondria. Recent experiments have shown that ATP production in mitochondria is interrupted by ten-second bursts called “mitochondrial flashes” (or mitoflashes for short), during which the mitochondria release chemicals called reactive oxygen species. The mitoflashes are tightly linked with energy usage, and Wang, Zhang, Wu et al. have now explored if and how mitoflashes regulate ATP levels in the heart.</p><p>Experiments on isolated mitochondria from mouse heart muscle cells showed that mitoflashes inhibit the production of ATP. When the intact heart muscle cells were given excess of the building blocks needed to produce ATP – mitoflashes occurred more often. Conversely, when the cells were forced to contract more quickly, which increased demand for ATP, the mitoflashes occurred less often. Importantly, the level of ATP inside the cells actually remained constant in the experiments. Furthermore, inhibiting mitoflashes with antioxidants increased the ATP concentration in heart muscle cells. Lastly, Wang et al. demonstrated that mitoflashes could be triggered under certain conditions.</p><p>Overall, these experiments uncovered a way in which highly active cells can maintain a constant level of ATP. Future studies are needed to understand exactly how mitoflashes are initiated and how they in turn inhibit ATP production. A better understanding of these processes might uncover molecules that could be targeted by drugs to the control of the rate of ATP production to treat heart failure.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23908.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23908.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial flashes</kwd><kwd>ATP homeostasis</kwd><kwd>energy metabolism</kwd><kwd>heart</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31130067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Heping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Basic Research Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013CB531200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Heping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31470811</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xianhua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31521062</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Heping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mitochondrial flashes counteract the imbalance of ATP supply-and-demand and constitute an auto-regulator of ATP homeostasis in the heart.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>ATP is the most important energy currency and mitochondria constitute the largest cellular powerhouse, supplying ATP at a rate of ~6 kg/day in the human heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neubauer, 2007</xref>). More than an energy currency, ATP also plays diverse roles in physiological processes including signal transduction, ion channel regulation, cytoskeleton remodelling, and gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rolfe and Brown, 1997</xref>). The regulation of intracellular ATP concentration is therefore a vital homeostatic function shared by all tissues and eukaryotic cells. An exemplary case is found in mammalian myocardium - the rate of energy consumption and supply (i.e., ATP flux) augments by 5–10 folds in situations of fight-or-flight or exercise, but the ATP concentration (i.e., ATP set-point) remains remarkably constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balaban et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neely et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matthews et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allue et al., 1996</xref>). The mechanism underlying such exquisite ATP homeostatic regulation has been extensively pursued over the last several decades. ADP, P<sub>i</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> have been suggested to be regulators of ATP homeostasis, but challenges exist because of the relative constancy of ADP and P<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katz et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yaniv et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balaban, 2012</xref>) and the extremely low activity of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU) in cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fieni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Williams et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, recent findings in MCU knockout mice suggest that MCU is dispensable for energy metabolism except under extreme physiological stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). Myocardial overexpression of the dominant negative MCU increases, rather than decreases, mitochondrial oxygen consumption due in part to secondary effect on cytosol Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rasmussen et al., 2015</xref>). To date, deciphering the exact mechanism underlying ATP set-point regulation in the heart remains an unmet challenge.</p><p>Mitochondrial flash (mitoflash) represents a recently discovered dynamic activity of the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2008</xref>) and has been ubiquitously detected in all eukaryotic species examined, from <italic>C. elegans</italic> to zebrafish and to rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Individual mitoflash consists of multiple signal components including bursting superoxide production, transient matrix alkalization, oxidative redox shift, transient depletion of the electron donors NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>, and mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2016b</xref>). The generation of mitoflashes in intact cells requires the integrity of the electron transfer chain (ETC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2008</xref>); and mitoflash frequency is highly regulated over a wide dynamic range by factors including metabolic state, thus the mitoflash activity is considered a biomarker for mitochondrial energy metabolism under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wei et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pouvreau, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gong et al., 2015</xref>). Most recently, we have shown that protons produced by photolysis or electroneutral proton ionophores act as a powerful mitoflash trigger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>). This finding is instructive because, in the Mitchell chemiosmotic theory of ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nicholls and Ferguson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitchell, 1961</xref>), proton gradients, vectorial proton movement, and proton motive force (Δμ<sub>H</sub>) across the inner mitochondrial membrane are quintessential for energy metabolism. Thus, the mitoflash biogenesis may be mechanistically and functionally intertwined with energy metabolism at multiple levels.</p><p>Emboldened by these recent advances, we revisited the fundamental question of ATP set-point regulation. Our central hypothesis to be tested is that mitoflashes might provide the long-sought regulatory mechanism for ATP homeostasis in the mammalian heart. In particular, we sought to determine whether mitoflash activity is able to regulate mitochondrial ATP production, how mitoflash responds to altered ATP supply and expenditure, and whether manipulation of mitoflashes can reset the level at which the cellular ATP concentration is maintained stable. In the scenario that mitoflash emerges as the ATP set-point regulator, we also attempted to identify a possible physiological trigger that couples the mitoflash activity with the regulation of ATP homeostasis. Our findings indicate that, by sensing and counteracting the ATP supply-and-demand imbalance, mitoflashes appear to constitute a digital auto-regulator for the maintenance of ATP homeostasis in the heart.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mitoflashes negatively regulate ATP production in cardiac mitochondria</title><p>To interrogate a possible role of mitoflashes in the regulation of ATP homeostasis, we first determined whether mitoflashes exert any direct effect on mitochondrial metabolic activity and, in particular, ATP production. To circumvent complicated homeostatic regulation at the cellular level, we opted to use isolated cardiac mitochondria freshly prepared from mt-cpYFP-transgenic mouse hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). While the mitochondrial respiration was supported by the presence of succinate, ADP and phosphate, mitoflash activity was visualized with confocal imaging, and the rate of ATP production was measured with the luciferin luminescence method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jouaville et al., 1999</xref>). We found that mitoflash events occurred randomly at a rate of 26 ± 2 events / (1000 µm<sup>2</sup>·100s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) and individual mitoflashes exhibited an average rise time of 7 s, peak amplitude of 0.5 (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>), and duration of 22 s, comparable with those in intact cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Treatments using the mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, SS31 and mitoTEMPO, or the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) decreased the mitoflash frequency by 44%, 31%, and 47% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), whereas the amplitudes and time courses of mitoflashes were largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Parallel luciferin luminescence measurement showed that, along with the repression of mitoflash activity, the rate of ATP production, assessed as the cumulative ATP formation over a 5 min time window, was enhanced by 25%, 24%, and 22%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This result suggests that mitoflashes negatively regulate ATP production at the organelle level. In other words, mitoflash activity may also be directly involved in the regulation of energy metabolism, in addition to serving a biomarker of respiratory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gong et al., 2015</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23908.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mitoflashes negatively regulate ATP production in isolated cardiac mitochondria.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Inhibition of mitoflashes by mitochondrial targeted antioxidants, mitoTEMPO (1 μM) or SS31 (50 μM), and the mPTP inhibitor CsA (2 μM).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, all metabolites examined, including glucose, free fatty acid and pyruvate, dose-dependently increased the mitoflash frequency, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pouvreau, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wei et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gong et al., 2015</xref>). Strikingly, 10 mM pyruvate, the immediate metabolite that enters mitochondria and feeds the tricarboxylic cycle, elicited the most vigorous mitoflash activity, increasing the mitoflash frequency by 12 folds comparing to 5.6 mM glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This stimulatory effect on mitoflash activity was fully reversed upon pyruvate washout, and was largely prevented by α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial pyruvate transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

In cardiac myocytes, a single heartbeat consumes ~2% of the cellular ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacobus, 1985</xref>). The higher the heart rate, the greater is the rate of ATP expenditure and replenishment. We therefore assessed the mitoflash response to electrical pacing at various frequencies. To minimize interference from cell shortening, image acquisition in contracting cells was synchronized with the electrical pacing (See Materials and methods). The mitoflash activity in pyruvate-treated cells declined precipitously at the onset of electrical pacing, alongside the onset of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and cell shortenings; it was readily restored at the offset of pacing, with the cessation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and contractile responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

This finding reinforces the notion that mitoflash plays an active role on its own. To this end, we noticed that the rapid and reversible mitigation of mitoflash activity in response to pacing and the inverse relation between mitoflash activity and pacing frequency fit naturally the cell logic that the mitoflash acts as a rapid and sensitive responder to altered ATP demand. For instance, when the ATP demand is augmented at the onset of pacing, the mitoflash activity is downregulated to alleviate its inhibition on ATP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), leading to increased ATP supply. Similar reasoning is applicable to explain the equally fast mitoflash changes on cessation of electrical pacing. Taken together, we propose a unifying interpretation - mitoflash acts as a reporter of ATP supply-and-demand imbalance and an ATP homeostasis regulator through negative regulation of ATP production. That mitoflash can serve as the biomarker of mitochondrial respiration is merely a special case when the substrate supply is changed and at the same time the ATP demand is held constant.</p><p>Paradoxically, pacing-induced suppression of mitoflashes occurred concurrently with the onset of large cyclic intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, opposite to the prediction of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation of mitoflashes in different cell types including cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gong et al., 2014</xref>). This discrepancy is only apparent, because cardiac mitochondria are relatively inert in terms of Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fieni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Williams et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2011a</xref>) and a prolonged pacing protocol elicited only a moderate mitoflash-stimulatory effect as an after-effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gong et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the bioenergetics-dependent mechanism might be more powerful than the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanism, thus dominating the mitoflash response in the present experimental conditions.</p><p>Next, we extended our studies to other situations of altered ATP demand. Even in quiescence, it takes a significant portion of energy expenditure for a cardiac myocyte to maintain physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradients across different compartments. In this regard, we demonstrated that β-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol (ISO, 1 μM), to enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling and thus to increase ATP demand, inhibited mitoflash frequency by 70% in pyruvate-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, brief removal of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (5 mM EGTA in nominal 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution) increased mitoflash activity by 48% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results provide additional lines of evidence that mitoflash regulation is dominated by bioenergetics - rather than Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanism in the present experimental settings. Notably, the ATP content and ATP/ADP ratio were kept constant under either ISO stimulation or Ca<sup>2+</sup> manipulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Taken together, both sets of experiments unveil a unifying interpretation of the mitoflash responses: mitoflash activity waxes and wanes in accordance with the ATP supply-and-demand imbalance, with higher activity occurring in response to over-exuberant ATP supply or diminished ATP demand, and vice versa.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Shifting ATP Set-point by altering mitoflash activity</title><p>The above results indicate that mitoflashes responding to altered energy supply and demand safeguard the ATP-set-point. The question arises whether tuning mitoflash activity can shift the ATP set-point when both energy expenditure and substrate supply are held unchanged. To answer this question, we inhibited mitoflashes with mitochondria-targeted antioxidants SS31 or mitoTEMPO, or overexpression of SOD2 in intact cardiac myocytes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, all these manipulations decreased mitoflash frequency and increased the ATP content even in intact cardiac myocytes. Quantitatively, the ATP set-point was elevated by ~60% while the mitoflash activity was mitigated by ~40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Linear regression revealed a strong inverse correlation between the mitoflash activity and the cellular ATP content (r = −0.96, p=0.009) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Then, what is the specific mechanism that senses the ATP supply-and-demand imbalance and regulates mitoflash activity? To date, three mitochondrial signals have been shown to be effective triggers or activators of mitoflashes, i.e., matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup>, basal ROS, and protons (at nanodomains of the inner mitochondrial membrane) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>). Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> is unlikely the candidate signal for the bioenergetics-dependent mitoflash activity, because no apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes were detected upon pyruvate-stimulated mitoflash activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and electrical pacing elicited opposite mitoflash and Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Moreover, inhibiting MCU with Ru360 did not show any significant effect on mitoflash frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The lack of significant effect of Ru360 on mitoflashes in cardiomyocytes is expected because pyruvate treatment did not induce any changes in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and thus mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, mitoflash is sensitive to MCU inhibition in situations when it is induced by elevations of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>, e.g., in HeLa cells under hyperosmotic stress or high cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation (in permeabilized cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jian et al., 2014</xref>). Further, electrical pacing did not alter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and pyruvate stimulation caused a slight decrease of mitochondrial ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that ROS are unlikely a major player, either. TMRM measurement revealed little effects of these manipulations on ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>, excluding changes in ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> as a possible cause of the mitoflash response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Given that protons act as a potent trigger of mitoflashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>), we reckoned that ATP synthesis-uncoupled proton entry might be a logic candidate for the trigger of mitoflashes to counteract the ATP supply-and-demand imbalance.</p><p>While proton entry at the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase drives ATP production, there exist multiple routes for ATP synthesis-uncoupled futile proton entry, and varying the proportion of the coupled and uncoupled proton entry would effectively alter the metabolic efficiency. We therefore determined the proton leakage by measuring the ATP-synthesis uncoupled oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Interestingly, we found that the proton leakage associated OCR was augmented by 28% in response to increasing ATP supply, i.e. 10 mM pyruvate stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Increasing workloads by ISO treatment attenuated the proton leakage associated OCR by 11% while decreasing energy expenditure by brief removal of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (5 mM EGTA in nominal 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution) elevated the proton leakage associated OCR by 14% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). This result indicates that the ATP-synthesis uncoupled proton leakage varies in accordance with the changes of ATP supply and demand, consistent with its role in sensing the ATP supply-and-demand imbalance and triggering mitoflashes.</p><p>In search for the specific uncoupled proton leak for the triggering of mitoflashes, we examined possible involvement of proton leakage through mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs). Inhibition of UCP2, the dominant isoform of UCPs in heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ricquier and Bouillaud, 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>) with either genipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>) or RNA interference, slightly increased, rather than decreased, the mitoflash incidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). This result excludes UCPs as the source of mitoflash-triggering proton flux. Recently, a Bcl-xL-regulated proton leakage through F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATPase has been demonstrated with multiple approaches, including patch-clamping of sub-mitochondrial vesicles, proton flux measurement, and immunochemical demonstration of a Bcl-xL interaction with the β-subunit of ATP synthase in hippocampal neuronal mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alavian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2011b</xref>). We therefore turned our attention to this F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATPase-mediated proton leakage with its hallmark sensitivity to Bcl-xL regulation. Indeed, we found that Bcl-xL overexpression, to inhibit the uncoupled proton flux, markedly decreased mitoflash incidence, whereas knockdown of Bcl-xL with siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>), increased mitoflashes at both 5.6 mM glucose and 10 mM pyruvate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Likewise, treatment with ABT-737, a mimetic of BH3-only proteins that inhibits Bcl-xL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oltersdorf et al., 2005</xref>), also elevated mitoflash production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, the mitoflash responses were accompanied by a 19% upward shift of the ATP set-point with Bcl-xL overexpression, and an 11% downward shift with ABT-737 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). These lines of evidence support the notion that proton leakage through ATP synthase is an important physiological trigger of mitoflashes, coupling the mitoflash biogenesis with auto-regulation of ATP homeostasis in cardiac myocytes.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23908.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Proton leakage through F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATPase, not UCP2, triggers mitoflashes.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Effect of UCP2 knockdown and inhibition on mitoflashes.

Indeed, the present results show that the ATP content and ATP/ADP ratio are held constant regardless of electrical pacing, altered substrate supply, receptor stimulation, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> manipulations in isolated single cardiac myocytes, attesting to the exquisiteness of the ATP set-point regulation. Ironically, as ADP, Pi and Ca<sup>2+</sup> have been dismissed as the major players, the exact mechanism underlying ATP set-point regulation remains an unsolved enigma. From the design principle of control systems, at least three criteria should be met for any candidate mechanism to be qualified as an ATP set-point regulator. First, it should have an impact on mitochondrial ATP production through the OXPHOS process. Second, it should respond to cellular ATP supply-demand imbalance. More specifically, its direction of response should counteract the imbalance and its dynamic range as well as kinetics of response should be robust and fast enough to cope with 10-fold fluctuations of ATP supply and demand on a beat-to-beat basis. Third, actively tuning this regulatory mechanism should be able to reset the ATP level in situations when the ATP supply and demand are held unaltered. Additional mechanism is also required to sense the state of ATP supply-demand imbalance and to couple the regulator’s response with the OXPHOS process. In this scenario, the major finding of the present study is that the recently-discovered, digital mitoflash activity meets all these criteria at once.</p><p>First, the current study provides direct evidence that mitoflashes negatively regulate ATP production in isolated cardiac mitochondria. Inhibiting mitoflash activity can increase the rate of ATP production by 25%. Multiple mechanisms could contribute to the mitoflash-mediated inhibition of ATP production. First of all, multifaceted energy-consuming processes occur in a mitoflash, including diversion of electrons from energy metabolism to bursting superoxide production, dissipation of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>, and loss of membrane permeability due to flickering mPTP opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2016b</xref>). Albeit the ETC activity is accelerated as indicated by transient matrix alkalization and depletion of the electron-donor pools of NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>, Δμ<sub>H</sub> for ATP synthesis is dissipated because of loss of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>. All these events indicate that mitochondria undergoing a mitoflash are at a state of futile respiration. That is, intermittent mitoflashes of the ATP-generating organelles are analogous to discharges of the safety-valve of a working steam engine. Second, as Δμ<sub>H</sub> dissipates, the Complex V could operate in the reverse mode, switching on its ATPase activity and consuming ATP in the flashing mitochondria. Third, mitoflashes may activate some yet-unknown downstream pathways to impose prolonged inhibition of OXPHOS activity. Regardless of specific mechanism of action, the finding that mitoflashes negatively regulate ATP production sheds new light on possible bioenergetics role of this digital activity built-in in the powerhouse of the cell.</p><p>Second, based on results from numerous maneuvers purported to perturb the ATP supply-and-demand balance, a unifying pattern emerges in which mitoflashes counteract the imbalance between ATP supply and expenditure, whereby safeguarding the ATP set-point. Specifically, the mitoflash frequency increases with either superfluous substrate supply or diminished energy demand (e.g., offset of electrical pacing, removal of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>); conversely, it mitigates upon substrate washout or with enhanced workload and energy expenditure (e.g., onset of electrical pacing, β-adrenergic stimulation). Remarkably, the dynamic range of mitoflash frequency spans over an order of magnitude and its kinetics are fast enough to cope with sudden changes occurring in the pacing protocol, allowing for only a transient escape of ATP from its tightly controlled constant level. Thus, compared to the interpretation of mitoflashes as a biomarker of mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gong et al., 2015</xref>), which holds true in certain conditions (e.g., varying substrate supply without altering the ATP demand), we re-interpret mitoflashes as a reporter of ATP supply-and-demand imbalance and an ATP set-point regulator through its ability to regulate ATP production.</p><p>Third, not only that the mitoflash stabilizes the ATP level in fluctuations of energy expenditure and substrate supply, but also it participates in determining the specific level at which cellular ATP is held stable. When the mitoflash activity is manipulated independently of changes in ATP supply and demand, e.g., by ROS scavenging, SOD2 overexpression, and Bcl-xL manipulation, it can tune the ATP set-point upwardly or downwardly: the higher the mitoflash activity is, the lower the ATP set-point becomes. The negative correlation between mitoflash activity and ATP level attained is in remarkable contrast to the constancy of ATP level in situations of electrical pacing, receptor stimulation and calcium manipulation, and testifies the robustness of this mitoflash-mediated ATP set-point regulation.</p><p>It is of interest to note that mitoflash regulation of the ATP set-point bears prominent features of a digital, distributed control system. Individual mitoflashes occur only intermittently, and are confined to single mitochondria. They are digital and operate in the frequency-modulatory mode, i.e, the average amplitude and duration of mitoflashes are relatively constant in different conditions. At the single-mitochondrion level, a mitoflash is a dramatic event blanketing the entire organelle and interrupting the ATP synthesis. In a cardiac myocyte typically containing 5,000–8,000 mitochondria, only a tiny portion of mitochondria undergo the flashing activity at any moment; No central control mechanism is identifiable in this control system, because stochastic mitoflash events are evenly distributed among the population of mitochondria, with their frequency rapidly and tightly regulated in accordance with the ATP supply-and-demand imbalance. Keeping in mind that ATP diffuses freely in the cytosol, such local, stochastic ATP-negating events afford a novel mechanism to finely regulate ATP homeostasis at the cellular level. Taken together, we conclude that mitoflashes act as the long-sought ATP set-point regulator in the mammalian heart.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Bcl-xL-sensitive proton leakage is a physiological trigger of mitoflashes</title><p>In search for possible mechanism that couples metabolism and mitoflashes in the context of ATP set-point regulation, we demonstrate that the proton leakage through F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase regulated by Bcl-xL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alavian et al., 2011</xref>) provides a physiological proton trigger of mitoflashes for the regulation of metabolic efficiency. Our recent studies have shown that protons at the nanodomains of inner mitochondrial membrane trigger mitoflashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>), suggesting a possible link between mitoflash biogenesis and the OXPHOS process at the deepest mechanistic level. In the present study, we first show that the ATP synthesis- uncoupled proton leakage varies in accordance with alterations in ATP supply or expenditure, increasing when the supply is superfluous and decreasing when the ATP demand is high. More importantly, we then provide direct evidence that bidirectional manipulations of Bcl-xL-sensitive proton leakage, but not those of UCP2, cause robust, bidirectional changes in the mitoflash frequency and ATP content.</p><p>By analogy of local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng and Lederer, 2008</xref>), we have envisaged a ‘local control model’ for proton triggering of mitoflashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>) in order to explain the finding that protons from different sources differ in terms of mitoflash triggering efficiency. Recent numerical analysis has revealed that free protons are short-lived (lifetime ~1.4 ns) and diffuse only over a nanometre scale (~2.1 nm) in the matrix environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>). Furthermore, free protons are extremely scarce in an alkaline mitochondrial matrix (~0.4 protons in a mitochondrion of 2 μm length and 200 nm diameter at pH 8.0), and matrix pH buffering capacity is estimated to be about 5 mM per pH unit at pH 8.0 (i.e., 1:500,000 for free: bound proton ratio) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Poburko et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, we envision that only protons in the nanoscopic vicinity of the putative trigger sites can effectively serve their role as the mitoflash trigger. Consistent with this model, super-resolution microscopy has shown, in the mitochondria from neurons, nanoscale protein partition of UCP4 and F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase, residing in the inner boundary membrane and the cristae membrane, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klotzsch et al., 2015</xref>). Several groups have independently proposed that F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase is of the same molecular identity as that of mPTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giorgio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alavian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonora et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernardi et al., 2015</xref>), whose flickering openings signify the ignition of mitoflashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hou et al., 2014</xref>). If this picture turns out to be true, both proton leakage and mitoflash triggering would occur within the same macrocomplex protein machinery, thus conferring high selectivity among different proton sources.</p><p>In summary, we have presented a set of novel and cohesive findings on mitoflashes as a digital auto-regulator of ATP homeostasis in the heart. First, mitoflashes respond rapidly and robustly to ATP supply-and-demand imbalance, increasing with a superfluous supply and mitigating with a greater demand. Because mitoflashes negatively regulate mitochondrial ATP production, such bioenergetics-dependent mitoflash activity acts as an auto-regulator of the ATP homeostasis (mode I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), akin to the safety-valve of a steam engine. Second, tuning the mitoflash activity is able to shift the level at which ATP is held constant (mode II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), revealing that mitoflash activity is an important, heretofore unappreciated determinant of the ATP set-point. Third, we demonstrate that the Bcl-xL-sensitive proton leakage through F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase constitutes a physiological proton trigger of mitoflashes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These findings not only mark mitoflashes as the putative auto-regulator for cellular ATP homeostasis, but also uncover compelling cell logic for the biogenesis of mitoflashes in the heart.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23908.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic of mitoflash regulation of ATP set-point.</title><p>In mode I, mitoflash activity, which is triggered by ATP synthesis-uncoupled proton leakage, waxes and wanes in accordance with fluctuations in ATP supply or demand, and whereby stabilizes the ATP set-point at a constant level.

Specifically, the changes of BCECF fluorescence and PercevalHR fluorescence upon pH alterations were recorded and an empirical linear correlation between the PercevalHR signal and the BCECF signal was established for calibration. The pH bias in the PercevalHR signal was corrected by subtracting the estimated pH component based on the pH calibration of PercevalHR and parallel BCECF measurement.</p><p>For measuring ATP production in isolated cardiac mitochondria, the isolated mitochondria were suspended in respiration solution containing (in mM) 220 mannitol, 70 sucrose, 5 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 EDTA, 2.5 succinate, 0.2 ADP, 2 HEPES (pH7.4), and 0.1% BSA. The ATP content was measured with the luciferase assay (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Measurement of Oxygen Consumption Rate</title><p>Oxygen consumption rate in intact adult cardiac myocytes was measured with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Strathkelvin 782 2-Channel Oxygen System version 1.0; Strathkelvin Instruments, Motherwell, UK). Briefly, 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were suspended in Tyrode’s solution containing 5.6 mM glucose or 10 mM pyruvate and the oxygen consumption was measured over 10 min with the Strathkelvin System.</p><p>To measure ATP synthesis-uncoupled oxygen consumption rate, the mouse cardiac myocytes were cultured in XF24 cell-culture microplates (Seahorse Bioscience). The cells were suspended in different medium: Tyrode’s solution with 5.6 mM glucose, Tyrode’s solution with 10 mM pyruvate, Tyrode’s solution with 10 mM pyruvate and 1 μM ISO, nominal 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup> Tyrode’s solution with 10 mM pyruvate and 5 mM EGTA. Bioenergetics analyses were performed in an XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) with the injection of oligomycin (1 μM), FCCP (1 μM), and rotenone (1 μM) and antimycin A (1 μM) sequentially. The uncoupled oxygen consumption rate was calculated as the oligomycin-insensitive percentage relative to basal oxygen consumption.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Western-blot analysis</title><p>Cell lysates were separated by 4–12% NuePAGE (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study investigates the role of mitochondrial flashes in regulating the ATP set-point in the cardiac muscle cells. The results show that the frequency of mitoflashes is negatively correlated with the ATP production and serves as a key regulator for maintaining the balance of ATP supply-demand. The results show that the BCl<sup>-</sup>xL-regulated proton leakage through F1Fo-ATP synthase appears to mediate the coupling between mitoflash production and the ATP set-point regulation. It is concluded that mitoflashes constitute a digital auto-regulator for ATP homeostasis in the heart.</p><p>This is a very important study because it is bringing in a novel concept to explain one of most fundamental questions in bioenergetics, namely, regulation of ATP set-point in beating heart. The authors have applied different approaches to validate their hypothesis. However, there are several major concerns as listed below that either require further explanations or additional experiments. While the authors provide evidence that mito flashes vary according to the interventions applied, the authors have not provided convincing evidence that the mito flashes are setting the ATP homeostasis. Rather mito flashes may be a consequence of alterations in proton flow or proton leak rather than a regulator of ATP production. Furthermore, mito flashes do not occur in every mitochondria suggesting that mito flashes are not playing a significant role in ATP homeostasis. In addition, further experimentation is need to understand the role that calcium plays in frequency of mitoflashes.</p><p>1) The ATP measurements in the isolated mitochondria were done in mitochondria suspensions, however, the mitoflash events occurred randomly in only a very small subset of mitochondria (26 ± 2 events / 1000 µm2·100s). The justification for correlating these two measurements was not explained (whole populations of mitochondria vs. a relatively small number of mitochondria).</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows the correlation of ATP/ADP, ATP, and flashes. As indicated, glucose-to-pyruvate switch leads to an initial overshoot of mitoflash frequency that coincides with a transient increase of luciferin luminescence (ATP increase), which does not indicate a clear &quot;negative&quot; correlation. Please clarify.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> used super-high levels of pyruvate, which already significantly increased (many folds) flashes (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). It is therefore not clear how the pacing induced suppression of this very high level of flashes has any physiological relevance.</p><p>4) Also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, manipulations that significantly suppressed the super-high level of flashes did not change ATP levels. This does not support the correlation?</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is confusing, since the manipulations of flashes through antioxidants may exert other effects to alter the detection/measurement of ATP using the fluorescent indicator. The authors need to rule out that the negative correlation was not a result of indirect effect or off-target effect.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is the key data to support this study's conclusion. The idea that BCl<sup>-</sup>XL coupled but not UCP coupled proton leak triggers flashes (and suppressed ATP) is interesting. However, the authors need to show with direct measurements that manipulating UCP or BCl<sup>-</sup>XL changes the pH in the microdomain in the matrix near the inner membrane of mitochondria in cardiomyocytes. They also need to explain why and how the leaked protons between these two mechanisms could have a different effect in triggering flashes.</p><p>7) What happens to mito membrane potential during the interventions applied and when mitoflashes appear?</p><p>8) What happens to the frequency of mito flashes after application of the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin?</p><p>9) The authors argue that calcium does not regulate the appearance of mito flashes. What effect does inhibition of MCU have on mito flashes? Why does pyruvate which feeds the TCA cycle (a calcium dependent process) increase mito flashes while a calcium chelator also increases mito flashes by 48% (subsection “Mitoflash Response to Altered Energy Expenditure”, last paragraph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>)?</p><p>10) If the authors argue that mitoflashes regulate ATP, what are the circumstances that &quot;mitoflashes are biomarkers of mito respiration&quot; as mentioned by the authors in the manuscript and argued by others? Why different roles?</p><p>11) Since mitoflashes do not occur in all mitos is this a consequence of alterations in mito biogenesis? Do they occur in the mitos undergoing autophagy or undergoing fission?</p><p>12) The authors state…&quot;Remarkably, the cellular ATP content and ATP/ADP ratio were held constant regardless of pacing at different frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), substantiating the tightness of the ATP set-point regulation&quot; but this statement seems in contradiction of mito flashes setting the ATP level if pacing results in a decrease in mito flashes. Please clarify.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Mitochondrial Flashes Regulate ATP Homeostasis in the Heart&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have made a good effort in addressing the previous concerns. Overall, this study deals with a fundamental question regarding the ATP set-point regulation in beating heart. The data indeed give a strong correlation that mitoflash could be a digital auto-regulator for ATP homeostasis in the heart. Before publication, however, there are still issues concerning the physiological relevance and the causal relationships. There exist several key discrepancies that will require the authors' further consideration. In addition, one reviewer may have overlooked the technical issue last time for flash measurement <italic>during</italic> pacing (see below). It is candidly felt that the authors should not over interpret their data.</p><p>1) The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> showing that inhibiting MCU with Ru360 did not show any significant effect on mitoflash frequency, which are in contradictory with two recent publications by several key authors in this manuscript. They have previously shown that blocking mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport by knockdown of MICU1 or MCU, markedly diminished the flash response (PMID: 23283965), consistent with the idea that Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggers mPTP, the underlying mechanisms for mitoflash. In addition, they have also shown that inhibition of MCU activity by ruthenium red (RR) or by genetic disruption with siRNAs, both significantly depressed superoxide flashes induced by μM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]c in permeabilized cells. Specifically, RR decreased flash frequency by 73.8%, siMCU-1 by 73.2% and siMCU-2 by 49.1%. These results show that mitoflashes are activated by the steady-state mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation (PMID: 24699914). These crucial discrepancies between the authors own data need to be explained in detail and unequivocally.</p><p>2) The pacing mediated decreases in flash frequency are quite interesting and surprising. However, it is in opposition to the results published by Dr. Wang's group in University of Washington (PMID: 25252178). As I can see, the only difference between these two reports is that the current mitoflash data are acquired before, during and after pacing. The frequency during pacing is decreased, and it returned back right after the pacing stopped. This is different from Wang's JMCC paper, in which the flash is measured before and after pacing, but not <italic>during</italic> pacing. My concern is that a motion artifact (as shown in their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> the cell continues to beat, shorten, change volume) could affect the recording of mitoflash. This technical issue needs to be addressed. This technical issue will require the authors to perform simple new experiments by recording the mitoflash right before and after the pacing.</p><p>3) I am still bothered by the use of 10 mM pyruvate in the majority of the experiments. I understand that this manipulation increases mitoflash frequency approximately 12 times more than when the cells are incubated in the physiological glucose concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), as such, the authors can have a robust mitoflash signal to study. However, this raises the concern about the physiological relevance and the causal relationship of the reported data. This is an important issue because the &quot;artificially&quot; high mitoflash data support a correlation rather than a causal relationship. Please discuss this issue.</p><p>4) Another issue, as pointed out in the previous Question#1 that the measurement of ATP (steady state) and flash are on different populations. In fact, the unchanged ATP level during pacing is understandable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). What really matters is the flux (the rate of ATP production). The flux (ATP generation rate) is likely increased when the pacing rates are increased, but this is not determined. For instance, it is well-known that without a dynamic and continuous ATP regeneration, in less than 60 beats, the entire cellular ATP reservoir will be consumed. Therefore, pacing the heart will drop the cellular ATP to a minimal level within a few seconds until the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated generation of NADH starts to kick in (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> of Brandes R &amp; Bers DM, Biophys J, 2002, PMID: 12124250).

The authors have applied different approaches to validate their hypothesis. However, there are several major concerns as listed below that either require further explanations or additional experiments. While the authors provide evidence that mito flashes vary according to the interventions applied, the authors have not provided convincing evidence that the mito flashes are setting the ATP homeostasis. Rather mito flashes may be a consequence of alterations in proton flow or proton leak rather than a regulator of ATP production. Furthermore, mito flashes do not occur in every mitochondria suggesting that mito flashes are not playing a significant role in ATP homeostasis. In addition, further experimentation is need to understand the role that calcium plays in frequency of mitoflashes.</italic> </p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have performed additional experiments and added further explanations accordingly. In particular, 1) we inhibited the activity of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU) with Ru360 and found that the MCU inhibition did not exert any significant effect on mitoflash activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>); 2) we examined the effect of electrical pacing and cell contraction on mitoflash activity at normal glucose concentration (5.6 mM glucose) and found similar results as those at 10 mM pyruvate – increasing workload inhibits rather than stimulates mitoflash activity (Figure 3—figure supplement 2); 3) we measured mitochondrial membrane potential during different experimental manipulations used in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>); 4) we examined the effect of inhibiting ATPase with oligomycin on mitoflash activity and validated that SS31 and mitoTEMPO did not exert any side-effect on ATP measurement. In addition, we discussed how mitoflashes might negate ATP production: possible mechanisms proposed include electrochemical energy dissipation, complex V operating as ATPase during a mitoflash, and possible prolonged inhibitory effects on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity.</p><p>Several lines of evidence indicate that mitoflash constitutes an important regulator of ATP homeostasis in the heart. First, instead of being a bystander or an epiphenomenon of mitochondrial respiration or proton leakage, mitoflashes significantly inhibit ATP production in isolated mitochondria. Second, when the cellular ATP supply-and-demand balance is perturbed, the mitoflash response tends to counteract the imbalance and restore the ATP set-point. Third, when ATP supply and demand are held constant, selectively inhibiting mitoflash activity shifts the otherwise very stable ATP set-point, and quantitatively, there is a negative correlation between mitoflash activity and ATP set-point. Finally, although mitoflashes may not occur in every mitochondrion in a given time window, their ATP-negating effects should be non-local because ATP diffuses freely in the cytosol. We believe these new data and text revisions have significantly improved this work.</p><p><italic>1) The ATP measurements in the isolated mitochondria were done in mitochondria suspensions, however, the mitoflash events occurred randomly in only a very small subset of mitochondria (26 ± 2 events / 1000 µm2·100s). The justification for correlating these two measurements was not explained (whole populations of mitochondria vs. a relatively small number of mitochondria).</italic> </p><p>In our experiments, ATP production was measured in the whole mitochondrial population over a 5-min time window after adding the substrate and ADP. We estimated that ~25% mitochondria of the population undergo mitoflashes during this time window (the mitochondrial radius is estimated to be 1 µm). Multiple mechanisms could contribute to the inhibitory effect of mitoflashes on ATP production. First of all, multifaceted energy-consuming processes occur in a mitoflash, including diversion of electrons from energy metabolism to bursting superoxide production, dissipation of ΔΨm, and loss of membrane permeability due to flickering mPTP opening. All these events indicate that mitochondria during a mitoflash are at a state of futile respiration, consuming NADH, FADH<sub>2</sub>, and electrochemical energy. Second, when ΔμH dissipates, flashing mitochondria may directly consume ATP through Complex V operating as an ATPase. Moreover, mitoflashes may activate some yet-unknown downstream pathways for prolonged negative regulation of OXPHOS activity. It is noteworthy that, although individual mitoflashes are spatially confined, ATP is highly diffusible. As such, mitoflashes afford a mechanism to finely regulate the ATP supply-and-demand balance at the cellular level. These points have been clarified in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows the correlation of ATP/ADP, ATP, and flashes. As indicated, glucose-to-pyruvate switch leads to an initial overshoot of mitoflash frequency that coincides with a transient increase of luciferin luminescence (ATP increase), which does not indicate a clear &quot;negative&quot; correlation. Please clarify.</italic> </p><p>The negative correlation between changes in mitoflash frequency and ATP level is applicable when ATP supply and demand are held constant, and when the changes reach steady state (Mode II in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the initial overshoot reflects a transient “escape” of homeostatic control of the ATP level. The decline of ATP from its peak appears to reflect that the mitoflash regulatory mechanism kicked in to restore the ATP level to its set-point (Mode I in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We have clarified this point in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> used super-high levels of pyruvate, which already significantly increased (many folds) flashes (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). It is therefore not clear how the pacing induced suppression of this very high level of flashes has any physiological relevance.</italic> </p><p>Per your suggestion, we performed the pacing experiment at 5.6 mM glucose and confirmed that increasing workload inhibits rather than stimulates mitoflash activity. The new data have been added in the revised manuscript (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><p><italic>4) Also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, manipulations that significantly suppressed the super-high level of flashes did not change ATP levels. This does not support the correlation?</italic> </p><p>When the ATP supply and demand are unchanged, there exists a negative correlation between mitoflash activity and ATP levels (Mode II in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). When the ATP supply-and-demand balance is perturbed by altering either ATP supply or workload, the mitoflash response counteracts the imbalance (Mode I in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we show that the mitoflashes are largely suppressed upon enhancing the workloads induced by pacing stimulation. Under this condition, the ATP expenditure is highly increased due to the imbalanced ATP supply-and-demand that might lead to ATP downward shift. However, the rapid decrease of mitoflash activity to alleviate its inhibition on ATP production counteracts this imbalance and maintains the cellular ATP at constant levels. Thus, the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are consistent with the scenario presented in Mode I in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is confusing, since the manipulations of flashes through antioxidants may exert other effects to alter the detection/measurement of ATP using the fluorescent indicator. The authors need to rule out that the negative correlation was not a result of indirect effect or off-target effect.</italic> </p><p>We tested the indirect or side- effect of SS31 and mitoTEMPO on ATP measurement using the in vitroluciferin luminescence assay.

The idea that BCl<sup>-</sup>XL coupled but not UCP coupled proton leak triggers flashes (and suppressed ATP) is interesting. However, the authors need to show with direct measurements that manipulating UCP or BCl<sup>-</sup>XL changes the pH in the microdomain in the matrix near the inner membrane of mitochondria in cardiomyocytes. They also need to explain why and how the leaked protons between these two mechanisms could have a different effect in triggering flashes.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. Unfortunately, we cannot directly measure the microdomain pH now because there are no proper pH indicators which can be localized to specific microdomain in mitochondrial matrix. However, we have recently performed numerical analyses on local proton signaling in the mitochondria. We have shown that the free protons are short-lived (lifetime ~1.4 ns) and diffuse only over a nanometer scale (~2.1 nm) in the matrix environment (Wang et al., 2016). Furthermore, free protons are extremely scarce in an alkaline mitochondrial matrix (~0.4 protons in a mitochondrion of 2 μm length and 200 nm diameter at pH 8.0), and matrix pH buffering capacity is estimated to be about 5 mM per pH unit at pH 8.0 (i.e., 1:500,000 for free: bound proton ratio) (Poburko et al., 2011). Thus, only when a proton is in nanoscopic vicinity of a putative trigger site, it can potentially trigger a mitoflash. We have included this discussion in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) What happens to mito membrane potential during the interventions applied and when mitoflashes appear?</italic> </p><p>We have measured the mitochondrial membrane potential by interventions used in this study, including pyruvate stimulation, electrical pacing, ISO or EGTA treatment. We found that all these manipulations exert negligible effects on mitochondrial membrane potential. These results are now reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>. As we and others have reported previously (Wang et al., 2008, Wei-LaPierre et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2016), the mitochondrial membrane potential is transiently depolarized when a mitoflash appears. Further, there is a positive correlation between the amplitudes of mitoflashes and the magnitudes of mitochondrial depolarizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and Figure S3 in (Wang et al., 2016)).</p><p><italic>8) What happens to the frequency of mito flashes after application of the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin?</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref> shows that the mitoflashes stimulated by 10 mM pyruvate are sensitive to the inhibition of the ATP synthase with oligomycin, in general agreement with what has been seen at 5.6 mM glucose condition (Wang et al., 2008).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23908.022</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of mitoflashes by oligomycin.</title><p>The adult cardiomyocytes were stimulated by 10 mM pyruvate. 5 μM oligomycin were applied to treat the cells for 30 min before mitoflash detection. n = 12-22 cells for either group. ** p &lt;0.01 versuscontrol.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23908.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23908.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23908-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>9) The authors argue that calcium does not regulate the appearance of mito flashes. What effect does inhibition of MCU have on mito flashes? Why does pyruvate which feeds the TCA cycle (a calcium dependent process) increase mito flashes while a calcium chelator also increases mito flashes by 48% (subsection “Mitoflash Response to Altered Energy Expenditure”, last paragraph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>)?</italic> </p><p>To address your concerns, we examined the effect of inhibiting MCU with Ru360 on mitoflashes. In adult cardiac myocytes, the MCU activity is known to be very low (Fieni et al., 2012, Williams et al., 2013) and Ru360 treatment did not exert any detectable effect on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake during caffeine-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases from the internal store. In neonatal cardiac myocytes whose MCU activity is relatively high, we found that the mitoflash frequency was unaffected albeit the amplitude of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient stimulated by 10 mM caffeine is significantly decreased. The new data are reported in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This result suggests that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> is unlikely a major trigger of mitoflash activation in cardiac myocytes. In contrast, the bioenergetics-dependent mechanism is much more powerful, thus dominating the mitoflash response in the present experimental conditions. Therefore, not only pyruvate which feeds the TCA cycle and stimulates mitochondrial metabolism to increase ATP supply augments mitoflashes, but also a calcium chelator EGTA which decreases ATP demands also increases mitoflashes – both can be unified in a single working model.</p><p><italic>10) If the authors argue that mitoflashes regulate ATP, what are the circumstances that &quot;mitoflashes are biomarkers of mito respiration&quot; as mentioned by the authors in the manuscript and argued by others? Why different roles?</italic> </p><p>Mitoflashes can serve as a biomarker of mitochondrial respiration when the substrate supply is changed and at the same time the ATP demand is held constant, such as pyruvate stimulation. Notably, this is merely a special case of a unifying interpretation that we proposed here – mitoflash acts as a reporter of ATP supply-and-demand imbalance and an ATP set-point regulator through inhibition of ATP production. We have clarified this issue in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>11) Since mitoflashes do not occur in all mitos is this a consequence of alterations in mito biogenesis? Do they occur in the mitos undergoing autophagy or undergoing fission?</italic> </p><p>Because the mitoflash observation time is limited (we usually detect mitoflash in 100 s), we can only detect mitoflashes in a subset of mitochondria. However, mitoflashes do occur stochastically and uniformly across the cell, and all mitochondria are expected to give rise to mitoflashes providing that the detection time is long enough. On your other comment, whether mitoflashes play any roles in mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, and fusion-and-fission are interesting questions that merit future investigations. However, they are perhaps beyond the scope of the current study. Thank you!</p><p><italic>12) The authors state…&quot;Remarkably, the cellular ATP content and ATP/ADP ratio were held constant regardless of pacing at different frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), substantiating the tightness of the ATP set-point regulation&quot; but this statement seems in contradiction of mito flashes setting the ATP level if pacing results in a decrease in mito flashes. Please clarify.</italic> </p><p>As in our response to point 4, under the condition as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, the increased ATP expenditure might lead to an imbalanced ATP supply-and-demand. This is counteracted by a rapid decrease of mitoflash activity to alleviate its inhibition on ATP production, which tends to maintain the cellular ATP at constant levels. However, when the ATP supply and demand are unaltered, selectively changing mitoflash activity re-sets the ATP level. These two modes of behaviors of the same homeostatic control system are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and our statement is not in contradiction with the roles of mitoflashes in setting and maintaining homeostatic ATP level.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors have made a good effort in addressing the previous concerns. Overall, this study deals with a fundamental question regarding the ATP set-point regulation in beating heart. The data indeed give a strong correlation that mitoflash could be a digital auto-regulator for ATP homeostasis in the heart. Before publication, however, there are still issues concerning the physiological relevance and the causal relationships. There exist several key discrepancies that will require the authors' further consideration. In addition, one reviewer may have overlooked the technical issue last time for flash measurement during pacing (see below). It is candidly felt that the authors should not over interpret their data.</italic> </p><p>We thank again the editor and the reviewers for additional comments and suggestions. In the revised manuscript, we have clarified the physiological relevance and further explained how to avoid motion artifacts during pacing. In addition, we have toned down our conclusion for the role of mitoflashes in regulating ATP production throughout the Abstract, Introduction, Results and Discussion, to avoid over interpretation of our data.</p><p><italic>1) The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> showing that inhibiting MCU with Ru360 did not show any significant effect on mitoflash frequency, which are in contradictory with two recent publications by several key authors in this manuscript. They have previously shown that blocking mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport by knockdown of MICU1 or MCU, markedly diminished the flash response (PMID: 23283965), consistent with the idea that Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggers mPTP, the underlying mechanisms for mitoflash. In addition, they have also shown that inhibition of MCU activity by ruthenium red (RR) or by genetic disruption with siRNAs, both significantly depressed superoxide flashes induced by μM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]c in permeabilized cells. Specifically, RR decreased flash frequency by 73.8%, siMCU-1 by 73.2% and siMCU-2 by 49.1%. These results show that mitoflashes are activated by the steady-state mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation (PMID: 24699914). These crucial discrepancies between the authors own data need to be explained in detail and unequivocally.</italic> </p><p>The differences between the present results and our previous publications cited are <italic>not</italic> contradictory. Rather, they arise from different experimental conditions in different cell types. In the publication of PMID:23283965, HeLa cells were stimulated by hyperosmotic stress which induced cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient and MCU-sensitive mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. In the publication of PMID: 24699914, the permeabilized HeLa cells were stimulated by high cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> which also induced MCU-sensitive mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. So inhibiting MCU with ruthenium red or by siRNA knockdown decreased mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and thus repressed mitoflashes. However, in the present study, cardiomyocytes stimulated by 10 mM pyruvate did not</p><p>exhibit any detectable changes in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and thus mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). So it is not unexpected that inhibiting MCU with Ru360 exerted no effect on mitoflash activity in the present experimental conditions. These points are now integrated in the revised manuscript (subsection “Triggering Mitoflashes by Proton Leakage through ATP Synthase”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) The pacing mediated decreases in flash frequency are quite interesting and surprising. However, it is in opposition to the results published by Dr. Wang's group in University of Washington (PMID: 25252178). As I can see, the only difference between these two reports is that the current mitoflash data are acquired before, during and after pacing. The frequency during pacing is decreased, and it returned back right after the pacing stopped. This is different from Wang's JMCC paper, in which the flash is measured before and after pacing, but not during pacing. My concern is that a motion artifact (as shown in their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> the cell continues to beat, shorten, change volume) could affect the recording of mitoflash. This technical issue needs to be addressed. This technical issue will require the authors to perform simple new experiments by recording the mitoflash right before and after the pacing.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful question. As we explained in the Methods, and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, we did our detection of mitoflashes right before, during, and right after the pacing, and found that the mitoflash activity declined precipitously upon pacing and restored as pacing stopped. This could not be due to motion artifact, because our image acquisition was synchronized to electrical stimulation (i.e., confocal scanning was triggered by the electric stimulator’s SYNC signal such that cell contraction was phase-locked with image acquisition). To make it clearer, we have slightly modified the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">figure 3A</xref> and the related Methods (subsection “Mitoflash Detection in Contracting Cells”).</p><p>In Wang’s JMCC paper, the mitoflash frequency during pacing was not determined and the mitoflash frequency was only modestly increased after 2-min continuous pacing at 2 Hz, along with elevated mitochondrial basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> in some mitochondria. However, we did not detect any significant changes in mitoflash after 1-min, pacing at 1-Hz. As we stated in the Methods, cells in our experiments “were perfused with Tyrode’s solution at a rate of 3 ml/min. Cells displaying healthy contractility were chosen for mitoflash measurement and those near the anode, where electrolysis can produce reactive oxygen species locally (Jackson et al., 1986), were avoided.” These cautious measures are deemed necessary, because we have recently shown that ROS generated by electrolysis of Tyrode’s solution at the anode can cause significant increase in mitoflash as well as mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> (PMID: 24912881). In this regard, we could not find pertinent cell perfusion and selection information in the work by Wang’s group, and therefore could not determine the exact source of discrepancy (if any).</p><p><italic>3) I am still bothered by the use of 10 mM pyruvate in the majority of the experiments. I understand that this manipulation increases mitoflash frequency approximately 12 times more than when the cells are incubated in the physiological glucose concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), as such, the authors can have a robust mitoflash signal to study. However, this raises the concern about the physiological relevance and the causal relationship of the reported data. This is an important issue because the &quot;artificially&quot; high mitoflash data support a correlation rather than a causal relationship. Please discuss this issue.</italic> </p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have emphasized that the key experiments were all repeated under physiological conditions (5.6 mM glucose), and qualitatively similar results were obtained both at 10 mM pyruvate and 5.6 mM glucose, including changes of mitoflash frequency during pacing at different frequencies (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, previously Figure 3—figure supplement 2), inverse relation between mitoflash frequency and ATP level (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>, previously Figure 4—figure supplement 1), and changes of mitoflashes by manipulating BCl<sup>-</sup>xL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Another issue, as pointed out in the previous Question#1 that the measurement of ATP (steady state) and flash are on different populations. In fact, the unchanged ATP level during pacing is understandable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). What really matters is the flux (the rate of ATP production). The flux (ATP generation rate) is likely increased when the pacing rates are increased, but this is not determined. For instance, it is well-known that without a dynamic and continuous ATP regeneration, in less than 60 beats, the entire cellular ATP reservoir will be consumed. Therefore, pacing the heart will drop the cellular ATP to a minimal level within a few seconds until the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated generation of NADH starts to kick in (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> of Brandes R &amp; Bers DM, Biophys J, 2002, PMID: 12124250). Therefore, it is hard to use the steady state ATP measurement to show that ATP flux is controlled by flash mechanistically. Please address this issue.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comment. We agree that the steady state of ATP cannot represent the ATP flux. To determine a possible role of mitoflash in ATP production, we used isolated cardiac mitochondria supported by succinate, ADP, and Pi. In the isolated mitochondria system, there is no cellular homeostatic regulation system, and the ATP level reached in a given period of time under this condition represents the <italic>ATP production rate</italic>. The negative correlation between ATP production and mitoflash frequency in isolated mitochondria suggests a regulatory role of mitoflashes in ATP production (flux in vitro).</p><p>Per your suggestion, we have toned down our conclusion for the role of mitoflashes in regulating ATP production throughout the Abstract, Introduction, Results, and Discussion, to avoid over interpretation of our data.</p><p><italic>5) The BCl<sup>-</sup>xL-mediated leak channel proposed by Jonas group (Alavian et al., 2011, Chen et al., 2011) has a peak conductance of 600 pS on average, which should be much higher than the H<sup>+</sup> leak channel that is proposed here.
