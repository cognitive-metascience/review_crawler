Tissue damage is generally accompanied by cell death and release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), molecules that are sequestered within healthy cells but become exposed to the extracellular milieu upon loss of membrane integrity and that trigger inflammation, modulate immunity or promote tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Rock et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Zelenay and Reis e Sousa, 2013</xref>). Examples of DAMPs include ATP, uric acid, IL-33, IL1α, RNA and DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Zitvogel et al., 2010</xref>), as well as actin, a ubiquitous and abundant component of the cytoskeleton of all eukaryotes. Exposure of filamentous (F-) actin by dead cells can be recognised by an innate immune receptor known as DNGR-1 (aka CLEC9A) expressed by specialised leucocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahrens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hanč et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). DNGR-1 is only found in mammals but we recently provided evidence that cytoskeletal exposure may be sign of cell damage also in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mechanical and other stresses elicit JAK-STAT pathway signalling, which is implicated in stem cell mobilisation and tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ekengren and Hultmark, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ekengren et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agaisse et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>). We found that injection of purified actin into adult flies led to selective induction of STAT target genes in the fat body, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> equivalent of the mammalian liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Srinivasan et al., 2016</xref>). The response to actin required the NADPH oxidase Nox, the Src family kinase Src42A, and the adapter Shark and led to an autocrine and paracrine amplification loop that involved the cytokine Upd3 and the JAK-STAT-coupled cytokine receptor Domeless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Srinivasan et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we revise our interpretation of those data and report that alpha-actinin (α-actinin), a cytoskeletal protein tightly associated with F-actin, is a more potent inducer of STAT target genes than actin. Like the response to actin, the response to α-actinin requires Nox, Src42A and Shark. Notably, α-actinin can be found in trace amounts in the purified actin preparations that we had used in our initial study and recombinant actin expressed in bacteria and devoid of α-actinin is no longer capable of eliciting the STAT response upon injection into flies. We conclude that α-actinin rather than actin is the key trigger of STAT activation upon injection into <italic>Drosophila</italic>, suggesting that distinct cytoskeletal proteins can serve as DAMPs across species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>In our previous study, actin purified from human platelets or rabbit muscle or recombinant actin purified from insect cells elicited the expression of STAT-responsive genes in the fat body when injected into adult <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Srinivasan et al., 2016</xref>). While assessing the ability of other cytoskeletal proteins to elicit a similar response, we found that myosin, α-actinin, and, to a lesser degree, tubulin could also drive induction of the STAT responsive gene <italic>TotM</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). On a per molecule basis, α-actinin was the most potent trigger and was superior to myosin, the second most potent inducer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). Robust induction of <italic>TotM</italic> was observed as early as 6 hr post α-actinin injection and was sustained above control levels for at least two days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The ability of α-actinin to induce STAT-responsive gene induction was independently reproduced in three laboratories (C.R.S, M.D., L.T.), underscoring the robustness of the result (data not shown). Like actin itself, α-actinin is a component of the cytoskeleton in all higher eukaryotes, where it crosslinks and stabilises actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>). Given its association with actin, α-actinin could therefore be present as a contaminant in purified actin preparations, including the ones used in our studies. Consistent with that possibility, mass spectrometry analysis revealed that α-actinin is the major contaminant of purified actin preparations and accounts for approximately 0.4% of total protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed the presence of immunodetectable α-actinin in actin preparations, confirming the mass spectrometry results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Notably, dose response curves showed that α-actinin was &gt;100 fold more potent than actin on a per molecule basis at eliciting the <italic>Drosophila</italic> STAT response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that contamination with α-actinin accounts for the activity of injected actin preparations in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38636.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>α-actinin is the most potent inducer of STAT-dependent genes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) <italic>w</italic><sup>1118</sup> flies were injected with equimolar preparations of purified actin, α-actinin, myosin and tubulin (9.4 × 10<sup>17</sup> molecules).

However, we failed to satisfactorily separate actin and α-actinin using multiple approaches, including size exclusion chromatography, ionic strength chromatography or immunodepletion with 14 different antibodies (data not shown). We therefore pursued an alternative strategy of testing recombinant actin and α-actinin expressed in BL21 <italic>E. coli</italic>, an organism that does not have an actin-based cytoskeleton and in which, therefore, co-purification of α-actinin with actin is not possible. We first assessed the functional integrity of the recombinant proteins purified from bacteria. Using a pelleting assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahrens et al., 2012</xref>), we confirmed that recombinant actin was able to form filaments when incubated in polymerisation-favouring conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and that α-actinin was able to associate with those filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Having ascertained that actin and α-actinin are functional and, therefore, correctly folded, we next tested whether they could elicit the expression of STAT-responsive genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Strikingly, injection of bacterially-expressed actin did not elicit the expression of <italic>TotM</italic> or of another STAT target gene, <italic>Diedel</italic>, unlike actin purified from rabbit muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). In contrast, bacterially-expressed α-actinin, like α-actinin purified from rabbit muscle, elicited the expression of various STAT-responsive genes, including <italic>TotM</italic>, <italic>TotA</italic> and <italic>Diedel</italic>, in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> and data not shown). Neither recombinant bacterially-expressed nor rabbit musclederived α-actinin elicited the expression of <italic>Drs</italic> and <italic>Dpt,</italic> Toll and Imd target genes, respectively, 24 hr post injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>), indicating that the proteins were devoid of microbial contaminants and confirming specificity for STAT targets. Lack of expression of <italic>Drs</italic> and <italic>Dpt</italic> by α-actinin was confirmed at multiple timepoints within a 48 hr period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). In contrast, septic injury (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic>) induced both <italic>Drs</italic> and <italic>Dpt</italic> by 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>).

Actin is difficult to produce as a recombinant protein in bacteria and commercially-available actin (&gt;99% pure) is traditionally purified from rabbit muscle or human platelets. Here, we demonstrate that the activity of such actin preparations is likely attributable to trace amounts of co-purifying α-actinin. This conclusion is supported by several findings: (1) α-actinin engages the same fat body Nox/Src42A/Shark pathway previously described for injected actin; (2) contamination with α-actinin can account stoichiometrically for the activity of actin preparations, α-actinin being more than one-hundred fold more potent that actin; (3) recombinant α-actinin expressed in bacteria retains activity while activity is lost for bacterially-expressed actin. These new findings support our earlier conclusion that exposure of cytoskeletal components is an evolutionarily-conserved sign of cell damage but suggest that the nature of the cytoskeletal element acting as a DAMP can vary across species. Thus, while (F-) actin is sensed by at least one mammalian receptor, DNGR-1, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>α-actinin appears to act as the dominant trigger for the STAT-dependent response we have studied. Consistent with the notion that α-actinin may be the common denominator of the response to extracellular proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, preliminary mass spectrometry analysis suggests that trace amounts of α-actinin are also found in tubulin and myosin preparations (data not shown). The inability to deplete α-actinin using antibodies makes it difficult to address the issue of contamination, especially in the case of large multi-subunit proteins such as myosin for which recombinant expression in bacteria is not feasible. More work is needed to clarify whether any cytoskeletal proteins besides α-actinin act as inducers of STAT-responsive genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and to identify the putative receptor(s) responsible for initiating the response.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Fly maintenance and injections</title><p>Fly maintenance, breeding, transgene induction, injections, septic injury, RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Srinivasan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The following stocks were used:</p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Fly stock</th><th valign="top">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><italic>w</italic><sup>1118</sup></td><td valign="top">Control strain</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">;UAS-<italic>Shark</italic> IR; <break/>(Shark Fr <sup>RNAi</sup>)</td><td valign="top">Interfering RNA for knockdown of <italic>Shark</italic>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Bruno Lemaître as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study is a follow up to the authors recent work, which demonstrated that actin is a DAMP in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This finding is expanded on here, with the interesting observation that actin is not actually responsible for the immunostimulatory activity observed. Rather, an actin binding protein, α-actinin, is responsible. The best evidence supporting this conclusion comes from the new studies presented, whereby actin that was purified from rabbit muscle contained immunostimulatory activity, but actin purified from bacteria did not. This finding, coupled to studies demonstrating that pure preparations of α-actinin are more stimulatory than &quot;contaminated&quot; actin preps from rabbit, are compelling. Genetic evidenced is presented to demonstrate that the pathway activated by α-actinin is the same as that described previously for actin.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is fortunate that the same authors can identify themselves that this was not actin but α-actinin the elicitor. Their conclusion would be reinforced if another laboratory could reproduce independently their observations. Was the injection experiment carried out independently in the Wood, Dionne or Teixeira lab (order the product and monitor <italic>upd3</italic> upon injection)? This should be the case and this should be mentioned in the paper.</p><p>2) Many studies have shown that <italic>upd3</italic> is produced by hemocytes not the fat-body (Agaisse, 2003; Chakrabarti, 2016). C564 is a Gal4 driver that target both hemocyte and fat body. I would recommend that the authors test their hypothesis using more specific drivers: <italic>hml</italic>Gal4 (hemocyte) and <italic>Lpp</italic>-Gal4 (fat body) to reinforce their conclusion that fat body not hemocytes is sensing actinin.</p><p>3) The three reviewers consider that the present paper is more a correction (of a mistake) than an extension. This should be mentioned in the Abstract and text (Introduction, 'corrected' instead of 'extend').</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38636.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is fortunate that the same authors can identify themselves that this was not actin but α-actinin the elicitor.

Both labs carried out experiments as per our protocol but using α-actinin that they purchased from Cytoskeleton (independently from each other and independently from the Reis e Sousa lab).

C564 is a Gal4 driver that target both hemocyte and fat body. I would recommend that the authors test their hypothesis using more specific drivers: hmlGal4 (hemocyte) and Lpp-Gal4 (fat body) to reinforce their conclusion that fat body not hemocytes is sensing actinin.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have repeated knockdown of <italic>Nox</italic>, <italic>Src42A</italic> or <italic>Shark</italic> using additional fat body drivers (<italic>Lpp</italic>-Gal4 and r4-Gal4), as well as a haemocyte driver (<italic>Hml</italic>Δ-Gal4). Knockdown with all three fat body drivers (c564-Gal4, <italic>Lpp</italic>-Gal4 and r4-Gal4) resulted in complete or nearly complete loss of <italic>TotM</italic> induction upon injection of α-actinin, whereas knockdown using <italic>Hml</italic>Δ-Gal4 did not have an appreciable effect. These data are now included in Figure 3 of the manuscript. We tried to measure <italic>upd3</italic> induction by RT-qPCR, but did not obtain clear cut results – we discussed our inability to convincingly measure <italic>upd3</italic> transcripts in our previous study (Srinivasan et al., 2016). However, in our previous study we knocked down <italic>upd3</italic> specifically in haemocytes (or depleted haemocytes altogether) and found that this had no impact on induction of STAT-responsive genes (Srinivasan et al., 2016 – Figures 5C, D). Although those experiments utilised purified actin and not α-actinin, we believe that those data, together with the experiments included in the present study, support the notion that haemocytes are dispensable for the response to cytoskeletal protein injection, which involves the fat body.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The three reviewers consider that the present paper is more a correction (of a mistake) than an extension.

In actual fact, we are revising the interpretation of those data and refining the conclusions. We therefore have altered the Abstract and Introduction, as requested, to state that we revise our earlier conclusion/revise interpretation of the earlier data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
