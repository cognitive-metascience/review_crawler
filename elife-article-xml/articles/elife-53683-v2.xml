discovered K<sup>+</sup>channels that are important for autophagosome turnover and lysosomal pH regulation and are associated with the early onset of Parkinson Disease. TMEM175 channels lack a P-loop selectivity filter, a hallmark of all known K<sup>+</sup> channels, raising the question how selectivity is achieved. Here, we report the X-ray structure of a closed bacterial TMEM175 channel in complex with a nanobody fusion-protein disclosing bound K<sup>+</sup> ions. Our analysis revealed that a highly conserved layer of threonine residues in the pore conveys a basal K<sup>+</sup> selectivity. An additional layer comprising two serines in human TMEM175 increases selectivity further and renders this channel sensitive to 4-aminopyridine and Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Our findings suggest that large hydrophobic side chains occlude the pore, forming a physical gate, and that channel opening by iris-like motions simultaneously relocates the gate and exposes the otherwise concealed selectivity filter to the pore lumen.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>nanobody</kwd><kwd>parkinson disease</kwd><kwd>selectivity filter</kwd><kwd>potassium channel</kwd><kwd>macrobody</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Grant 495 (AdG) n. 695078 noMAGIC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moroni</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><name><surname>Thiel</surname><given-names>Gerhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006474</institution-id><institution>Columbia University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016 Schaefer Research Scholars Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moroni</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and functional analysis of a recently discovered non-canonical potassium channel family reveals a unique selectivity filter that is exposed to permeating ions only in the conductive state.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Potassium is the major intracellular cation and crucial to many fundamental cellular processes such as maintenance of the resting membrane potential, repolarization of action potentials, counter-ion flux and osmoregulation. The function and distribution of K<sup>+</sup> ions in endomembrane compartments such as endosomes and lysosomes are less clear and their significance is only recently beginning to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2018</xref>). Lysosomes, the recycling organelles of the cell, are characterized by a very low luminal pH for the efficient decomposition of its contents. They have been recognized lately as a central hub in metabolic regulation of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perera and Zoncu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lamming and Bar-Peled, 2019</xref>). Like in other endomembrane compartments, ion channels and transporters, in conjunction with the vacuolar-type ATPase, are essential for the regulation of the luminal pH, the membrane potential and organelle fusion and thus regulate the transport of other solutes across the membrane and also the dynamics and fate of these organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2019</xref>). It has been known for decades that lysosomal membranes are permeable for K<sup>+</sup> and even more so for Cs<sup>+</sup>, a hallmark of this type of endo-membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Henning, 1975</xref>). The underlying channel has recently been identified as a member of the transmembrane protein family 175 (TMEM175). The TMEM175 channel was found to mediate a major K<sup>+</sup> permeability of lysosomes and late endosomes (hence also named K<sub>EL</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cang et al., 2015</xref>), and is not related to canonical K<sup>+</sup> channels. TMEM175 channels are present in animals, eubacteria and archaea but are not found in plants and fungi. They exhibit selectivities ranging from P<sub>K</sub>/P<sub>Na</sub> of ~35-20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2017</xref>) in vertebrates to P<sub>K</sub>/P<sub>Na</sub> of ~2–5 in bacteria and have been described as ‘leak-like’ channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cang et al., 2015</xref>). TMEM175 channels, unlike canonical K<sup>+</sup> channels, conduct Cs<sup>+</sup> ions and are not blocked by Ba<sup>2+</sup>, tetraethylammonium or quinine but instead by Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions. Like other K<sup>+</sup> channels, they are blocked by 4-aminopyridine (with the exception of bacterial TMEM175 proteins), and conduct Rb<sup>+</sup> but not Ca<sup>2+</sup> and N-methyl-D-glucamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cang et al., 2015</xref>). The vertebrate TMEM175 proteins are composed of two homologous non-identical repeats, each comprising six transmembrane domains forming dimers; the bacterial homologues consist of only one such repeat and form tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). In prokaryotes, the function of TMEM175 proteins is currently unclear but may be linked to the regulation of the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cang et al., 2015</xref>). In vertebrates, deletion of the TMEM175 gene leads to increased lysosomal pH under conditions of starvation, reduced proteolytic activity in lysosomes and aberrant autophagosome fusion and clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jinn et al., 2017</xref>). The human TMEM175 channel has been linked to Parkinson disease (PD) by several genome wide association studies and is considered as a highly significant risk gene for the early onset of this neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jinn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nalls et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2017</xref>). The deficiency in autophagosome clearance and the impaired proteolytic activity by loss of TMEM175 are presumably causative for the accumulation of insoluble α-synuclein fibrils in PD models and could explain why this channel is relevant for the progression of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jinn et al., 2017</xref>). In particular with its channel function, TMEM175 may thus be a viable drug-target to interfere with the pathogenesis.</p><p>Selectivity for K<sup>+</sup> ions, with the exception of the very weakly selective trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Su et al., 2017</xref>), is intimately associated with a P-loop architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>). The lack of such a P-loop motif in TMEM175 channels hence raises the question how K<sup>+</sup> conduction and selectivity is achieved in this unrelated architecture. To gain insight into the structure and mechanisms of this new family of ion channels we structurally characterized a bacterial TMEM175 member. We obtained a crystal structure at a resolution of 2.4 Å of a TMEM175 channel from <italic>Marivirga tractuosa</italic> (MtTMEM175) and in combination with functional analysis, propose how selectivity for K<sup>+</sup> ions is achieved. We further provide data that explains the increased potassium selectivity as well as the pronounced sensitivity towards 4-aminopyridine and zinc of human TMEM175 (K<sub>EL</sub>) compared to the bacterial counterparts and suggest events that lead to channel opening. Importantly, our data and conclusions deviate from a previously reported structure and functional investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2017</xref>), in particular regarding the principle of K<sup>+</sup> selectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crystallization and general architecture of MtTMEM175</title><p>From an expression screen of over 30 bacterial TMEM175 channels we identified several homologues as candidates for a structural characterization. However, the crystals for all of the tested homologues, including MtTMEM175, were diffracting maximally to a resolution of 10 Å even in complex with nanobodies (Nbs). Finally, MtTMEM175 was crystallized in complex with a Nb that in turn was engineered by fusing an N-terminally truncated Maltose Binding Protein (MBP) to its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>) which greatly improved diffraction. We solved the structure at a resolution of 2.4 Å using highly redundant data by molecular replacement based on this novel Nb-MBP chaperone, with structures of Nbs and maltose-bound MBP as search models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and could build a map of high quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). We named this chaperone scaffold ‘macrobody’ (Mb) and termed the Mb used in this study Mb<sub>51H01</sub>. Macrobodies could develop into a promising tool for structural biology applications, especially in electron cryo-microscopy, similar to the recently reported megabodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laverty et al., 2019</xref>). Each MtTMEM175 subunit is composed of six transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) which assemble to form a tetrameric channel as verified using SEC-MALLS of uncomplexed MtTMEM175 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Helix one is the pore-lining helix, as predicted earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cang et al., 2015</xref>), and constitutes the highest degree of conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of the MtTMEM175-Mb<sub>51H01</sub> complex.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Side view of the complex with MtTMEM175 channel and macrobody.

The network is similar to the one of a recently reported structure of a TMEM175 homologue (CmTMEM175, PDB accession 5VRE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e,f</xref>) and involves most of the highly conserved residues in TMEM175 channels, also the FSD motif (Phe28, Ser29, Asp30 in MtTMEM175), three consecutive amino acids at the N-terminus of helix one that were originally proposed to play a role in ion conduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cang et al., 2015</xref>). Generally, the level of conservation for TMEM175 channels is strikingly low in transmembrane helices 4–6, persuading us to exclude this region largely from our analysis. The interactions of Ser29, His77 and Asn95 are present in both structures and position the first three transmembrane helices relative to each other. Trp74 from helix two is interacting with Asp30 in helix 1 of the same subunit in MtTMEM175, whereas in CmTMEM175 this tryptophan is more involved in a cation-π stack with the phenylalanine from the FSD motif of the adjacent subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e,f</xref>). Different from CmTMEM175, Arg24 (another highly conserved residue in TMEM175 channels) is interacting with His77 and Asp30 of the adjacent subunit, thereby connecting neighboring subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g</xref>). Gel filtration profiles of Arg24 mutant proteins support a role in tetramer assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1h</xref>). We can thus assign at least one role for most of the highly conserved residues in MtTMEM175, which makes us confident that MtTMEM175 provides a clear case to characterize the TMEM175 family in general. Importantly, the conservation of these key residues in human TMEM175 suggests an overall very similar architecture. None of the aforementioned residues seems to play a distinct role in selectivity that would be immediately apparent from the structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MtTMEM175 is a weakly selective K<sup>+</sup> channel</title><p>For electrophysiological characterization MtTMEM175 was expressed in HEK293 cells as previously done with homologues from <italic>Streptomyces collinus</italic> and <italic>Chryseobacterium sp.</italic> (ScTMEM175 and CbTMEM175) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cang et al., 2015</xref>). In whole cell patch clamp experiments we recorded only from transfected cells non-rectifying, non-inactivating K<sup>+</sup> currents that showed no signs of voltage-dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). These currents were blocked by Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions and at the applied concentration of 5 mM also in a voltage-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Similar to ScTMEM175 and CbTMEM175, MtTMEM175 has also a low selectivity for K<sup>+</sup> (P<sub>K</sub>/P<sub>Na</sub> ~ 4.3). It conducts Cs<sup>+</sup> and Rb<sup>+</sup> with a similar efficiency as K<sup>+</sup>, and to lesser extent, similar to Na<sup>+</sup>, also Li<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The channel has no apparent permeability for anions; the reversal voltage was not significantly different when the same recordings were done with standard bath solution containing the large anion methanesulfonate (+0.64 ± 3 mV n = 18) or in a bath with 150 mM KCl (2.4 ± 4, n = 7). We obtained a few single channel recordings from MtTMEM175-transfected cells that revealed a unit conductance of ~70 pS and showed channel flickering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). We do not have definitive proof that these currents originate from MtTMEM175, however several arguments support this view. First, we recorded them only in transfected cells, which exhibited typical MtTMEM175 macroscopic currents after breaking into the whole cell configuration. Second, like the macroscopic MtTMEM175 current also the single channel I/V relation reverses around 0 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Finally, the unitary conductance of the channels at −100 mV is in the range of the conductance of mock transfected HEK293 cells in whole cell mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), making it unlikely that the currents originate from endogenous channels. The presence of gating events is inconsistent with the definition of a leak channel and has significance for the interpretation of the structure.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Electrophysiological characterization of MtTMEM175.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Current responses to standard voltage pulse protocol in mock (○) and MtTMEM175 (⚫) transfected HEK293 cells (upper panel) and corresponding steady state I/V relations (lower left).

The K<sup>+</sup> ion at position 2K<sup>+</sup> is located between the layers of Leu35 and Thr27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,c</xref>). It is likely that this K<sup>+</sup> ion is trapped in the pore due to the restriction at Thr27 and the lack of clear interactions with the protein. It is further worth to note that the density at 2 K<sup>+</sup> is likely also partly constituted by Na<sup>+</sup> ions. The anomalous signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>) at this position is proportionally weaker in comparison to the signal at 1K<sup>+</sup> than in the native data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,c</xref>).

No significant anomalous signal for Cs<sup>+</sup> or Rb<sup>+</sup> was found at the 2K<sup>+</sup> position, indicating that the channel would have to open for diffusion of these generally permeable ions to this position. Collectively, these results advocate the existence of a conductive conformation with a wider pore that is different from the crystal structure. Additional density in the 2F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub> map on the extracellular side in proximity to the ion binding-site was attributed to a maltose moiety from a detergent molecule. We tested for potential influence of maltose on the conductance by electrophysiology, but could not detect any effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The hydrated K<sup>+</sup> ion in the MtTMEM175 crystal is reminiscent of the one in the vestibule of a high-resolution structure of KcsA in close proximity to the selectivity filter entrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). In comparison, the two planes in the K<sup>+</sup>-hydrate in MtTMEM175 are skewed, due to interactions with the surrounding backbone oxygens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c–e</xref>). The eightfold coordination of K<sup>+</sup> ions in square antiprism is also seen inside the canonical selectivity filter, where it is mediated by backbone oxygens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). MtTMEM175 crystallized in the presence of equimolar amounts of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> which apparently did not interfere with K<sup>+</sup> coordination at 1K<sup>+</sup>. The ion binding site thus recapitulates a number of central elements seen in K<sup>+</sup> coordination of ion channels, in particular the coordination geometry. However, the low conservation, its simplicity, the indirect coupling of the K<sup>+</sup> ion to the backbone oxygens and the single binding site make it questionable that this region determines selectivity. It could be that this binding site serves to attract monovalent ions with similar properties as K<sup>+</sup> and plays a role in the resolvation or desolvation of K<sup>+</sup> ions that pass through the pore. Apart from the ion binding site, the negative electrostatic potential in the pore lumen would be another property promoting cation permeation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Bulky residues constrict the pore and form a physical gate in the closed state</title><p>In the structure of MtTMEM175 Leu35 is occluding the pore to such an extent that K<sup>+</sup> ions could not pass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This bulky residue is thus likely constituting a hydrophobic physical gate. From single channel recordings and the lack of exchangeability of 2K<sup>+</sup> with Cs<sup>+</sup> or Rb<sup>+</sup> we have indications for open and closed conformations in support of a gate in TMEM175 channels. Due to the highly constricted pore, the structure of MtTMEM175 thus very likely represents a closed state and this implies that structural rearrangements have to take place in order for the channel to become conductive. Opening of the channel would inevitably require displacement of the hydrophobic side chain of Leu35 from the pore center, probably by a helix-rotation as seen in the NaK channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alam and Jiang, 2009a</xref>) or in TRPV6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McGoldrick et al., 2018</xref>).

In particular Thr38 is of interest since it is the most conserved residue among all TMEM175 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,c</xref>). Threonine38 forms a layer that is interspersed between Leu35 and Leu39 and participates in a bifurcated hydrogen bond with the main-chain oxygen of Ala34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). A rotation of helix 1 (in clockwise direction when viewed from intracellular) as part of an iris-like opening of the gate (Leu35), would expose the side chain of Thr38 to the pore lumen. Following this line of thoughts, we reasoned that K<sup>+</sup> ions could interact with the side chain of Thr38 in a conductive conformation of MtTMEM175 and mutated Thr38 to alanine.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>K<sup>+</sup>selectivity in TMEM175 proteins.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Subunit organization of MtTMEM175 and alignment of bacterial sequences highlighting the most conserved residues in helix 1.

Ascribing a function to the extracellular ion binding site is thus currently difficult. Structural insight into the conductive conformation, which might reveal rearrangements at both ends of helix 1, will help to gain insight into potential functions of this region. The binding site could also serve an unrelated function, for example sensing of ions to modulate the open-probability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>A layer of threonines also accounts for K<sup>+</sup> selectivity in human TMEM175 channels</title><p>The layer of threonines is also conserved in vertebrate TMEM175 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) and we thus tested if mutating the corresponding residues to alanine in the human TMEM175 channel would affect selectivity. Human TMEM175 is more selective than the bacterial counterparts with reported values of P<sub>K</sub>/P<sub>Na</sub> of 35-20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). We measured currents from cells expressing hTMEM175 at the plasma membrane as previously done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). From the shift in the reversal voltage after replacing K<sup>+</sup> for Na<sup>+</sup> in the external medium (−58 ± 3, n = 7) we estimate a P<sub>K</sub>/P<sub>Na</sub> value of ~10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), somewhat lower than the previously reported P<sub>K/</sub>P<sub>Na</sub> values of hTMEM175.

Since the human channel is 2–3 times more selective as the known bacterial counterparts there must thus be an additional factor that accounts for the increased selectivity, probably in conjunction with the threonine layer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Serine45 increases K<sup>+</sup> selectivity in human TMEM175</title><p>When comparing the primary sequences of vertebrate genes, we found that the position that is corresponding to the highly conserved Ala34 in MtTMEM175 is occupied by serine in repeat one for all of the analyzed vertebrate species (Ser45 in hTMEM175), while in repeat 2, like in bacterial channels, the corresponding residue is an alanine (Ala270 in hTMEM175) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1e,f</xref>). We have thus suspected that Ser45 might also play a role for selectivity in hTMEM175 in an analogous manner as the threonines. The side chain of these serines could contribute to coordination of K<sup>+</sup> ions in close proximity to the threonine layer to increase selectivity, that is six ligands would be involved in ion coordination instead of only four as in MtTMEM175. In the S45A mutant dimer, selectivity was indeed reduced with a reversal potential of −27 ± 2 (n = 24) upon changing the major cation in the bath solution from K<sup>+</sup> to Na<sup>+</sup>. This mutant is very similar to bacterial TMEM175 channels in its primary sequence of helix one and intriguingly also with respect to its preference for K<sup>+</sup>. Consequently, a triple mutant where all of the threonine and serine residues in these two layers of the pore are exchanged for alanine (S45A/T49A/T274A) shows a similar reduction of selectivity (E<sub>rev </sub>= −22 ± 3 mV, n = 8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) as the double mutant T49A/T249A and the T38A mutant protein of MtTMEM175 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).

Indeed, the T38A mutant of MtTMEM175 retained its sensitivity for Zn<sup>2+</sup>; in WT and the mutant channel Zn<sup>2+</sup> caused at a reference voltage of −60 mV the same relative inhibition (WT 66.9 ± 12%, T38A mutant 69.7 ± 10 n = 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>). This suggests that the bacterial channel is inhibited by Zn<sup>2+</sup> through a different mechanism, that is not a pore block. In seeming contrast to this finding we could clearly localize anomalous signal of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in the pore by soaking crystals of MtTMEM175 with 0.5 mM Zn<sup>2+</sup>.

This supports an attraction for Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in the pore in close distance to, or directly at the selectivity filter and indicates that the T38A mutation changes the electrostatic environment in the pore.

Our observations and conclusions are based on two important considerations. First, scrutiny of the pore in the structure of MtTMEM175 shows that it is too narrow for the passage of ions. This demands that conformational changes have to take place in order to make the channel conductive. Second, there are highly conserved hydrophilic side chains (from threonine and additionally serine in vertebrate counterparts) that would be suited for coordinating ions on their passage. But since these residues do not face the pore lumen we anticipate a rotation of helix 1, resulting in an iris-like opening in assembled TMEM175 channels as a plausible route for transitioning into a conductive conformation. Such a rotation simultaneously exposes the hydroxyl-groups of the threonines (Thr38 in MtTMEM175 and Thr49/Thr274 in hTMEM175) and serines (Ser45 in hTMEM175) to the pore lumen and swings the bulky hydrophobic residues (Leu35 in MtTMEM175) out of the conducting pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>).

But as previously mentioned, a higher number of coordinating ligands seems to be a general mechanism for achieving a high K<sup>+</sup> selectivity also in other K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derebe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sauer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kast et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam and Jiang, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gouaux and Mackinnon, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The proposed mechanism for K<sup>+</sup> selectivity in TMEM175 channels is also backed by our finding that Ser45 is underlying a pore block by Zn<sup>2+</sup> and 4-AP in hTMEM175 at the site of the selectivity filter, underscoring that the respective Ser residues are part of the conductive pathway.

How can this be explained? We can currently only speculate but one reason could be that TMEM175 channels spontaneously open and close without a trigger, different from voltage- or ligand-gated ion channels. When they are open, the binding site for the pore blocker is accessible and the blocker could bind. It is worth to note that in our crystal soaks the small Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion was found even in the closed channel nearby the selectivity filter in the middle of the membrane plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>). This could mean that the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion (or the 4-AP molecule) is already bound at the selectivity filter before a voltage is applied for eliciting a current. In such a scenario voltage may not affect the strength of the block.</p><p>In summary, our data advocate a model which provides a coherent description of selectivity, blocking and channel opening. However, definite conclusions have to await additional evidence from an open channel structure.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Structural differences between MtTMEM175 and CmTMEM175</title><p>Comparison of the previously reported structure of CmTMEM175 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2017</xref>), with the model of MtTMEM175 highlights a number of significant differences, which potentially bear information on the function of TMEM175 type channels.</p><p>One crucial difference is located at the cytosolic entrance to the pore and could be related to a pH dependent gating mechanism. While both structures reveal a hydrogen-bond network on the intracellular side within helices 1–3, only the MtTMEM175 structure exhibits an additional interaction between His77 with Arg24, which connects two adjacent subunits. The corresponding arginine in CmTMEM175 is in contrast not clearly resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g</xref>). Since MtTMEM175 was crystallized at a pH of 8.5 and CmTMEM175 at a pH of 4.5 it is most likely that His73 in CmTMEM175 (corresponding to His77 in MtTMEM175) is protonated and hence repulsing the arginine. A transient pH-sensitive disengagement of this arginine from the histidine (and Asp30) could be a step in the opening of the channel. This would be achieved by loosening interactions of the N-terminal end of helix one with the adjacent subunit as already indicated in the CmTMEM175 structure which shows a more open pore at the intracellular side compared to MtTMEM175 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2c</xref>).</p><p>Another difference between the structures is apparent at the extracellular tip of helix one where both structures are substantially deviating. This can explain the lack of coordinated ions in the CmTMEM175 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1i,k</xref>). Notably, only the extracellular end of helix one in the CmTMEM175 structure contains a 3<sub>10</sub>-helix over a stretch of 3–4 residues and thus extends further than helix one in MtTMEM175 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1f,g</xref>). As a consequence the backbone oxygens are too distant from the pore axis for interacting, like in the MtTMEM175 structure, with the water molecules of a K<sup>+</sup>-hydrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1i,k</xref>). 3<sub>10</sub>-helices are commonly associated with transition states and thus hint to dynamic regions within a helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vieira-Pires and Morais-Cabral, 2010</xref>). Whether the CmTMEM175 structure represents such an intermediate conformation (albeit likely not a true transition state) remains to be investigated.</p><p>It is furthermore worth noting, that the short helix between the helices 1 and 2 of CmTMEM175 is involved in major crystal contacts, which might be responsible for a displacement of the tips of helix1 and formation of the 3<sub>10</sub>-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1h</xref>). Even though our results indicate that the coordinated K<sup>+</sup> ion has no direct impact on the selectivity of the MtTMEM175 channel, this configuration may still be relevant for function. However, the 3<sub>10</sub>-helix in CmTMEM175 has also an influence on the position of other pore lining side chains when compared to MtTMEM175. This is in particular true for Leu30, which is facing the pore in contrast to the equivalent Leu42 in MtTMEM175 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a,b</xref>). Leucine30, Leu27 and Ile23 in CmTMEM175 are thereby forming three layers of pore-lining hydrophobic residues. This scenario is reminiscent of the structures of bestrophins, for example a channel to which CmTMEM175 was primarily compared in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). It was proposed that Ile23, which is part of the triad of bulky pore lining residues in CmTMEM175, conveys the K<sup>+</sup> selectivity as a hydrophobic selectivity filter, as initially also proposed for bestrophins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kane Dickson et al., 2014</xref>). Mutation of Ile23 or corresponding residues in hTMEM175 to small or hydrophilic residues indeed resulted in a loss of K<sup>+</sup> selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). If Ile23 however acts as a gate to keep the channel closed, a role that we suggest for the corresponding Leu35 in MtTMEM175, an exchange for asparagine or alanine would likely result in a permanently open channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2d</xref>). For instance, in bestrophins, mutation of three layers of bulky residues along the ion path to alanine resulted in an open channel, without the requirement for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vaisey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rao et al., 2017</xref>). This supported a function of these residues as a gate instead of contributing to selectivity. Similarly, mutation of a gate built from phenylalanine in the NaK channel strongly increased flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alam and Jiang, 2009a</xref>). More recently a cryo-EM structure of chicken bestrophin in a conductive conformation provided evidence against a role of the bulky pore-occluding residues as hydrophobic selectivity filters but instead revealed that these residues are indeed physical gates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller et al., 2019</xref>). Hence mutation of hydrophobic gates with small and/or hydrophilic residues can have substantial impact on the closure and conduction of ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aryal et al., 2014</xref>). When we mutated Leu35 to alanine we could only see small effects on the selectivity, speaking against a role in selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Probably this mutant allows for some non-specific permeation in closed state due to the loss of the leucine-gate which results in slightly reduced selectivity in whole-cell recordings when compared to WT.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>TMEM175 channels are not as enigmatic as anticipated earlier but instead recapitulate classical structure-function correlates of other ion channel families: Large hydrophobic residues are acting as gates and polar contacts from side chains and the backbone are coordinating ions in the conducting pathway. On the other hand, it is remarkable that the selectivity is mediated by cryptic hydroxyl-bearing side chains inside the pore that are only available for selective ion solvation in an open conformation by concerted repositioning. In conclusion, the conductive state must thus deviate substantially from the closed state in order to be permeable to ions. This is strongly supported by the localization of the residues that mediate K<sup>+</sup> selectivity and sensitivity to the blockers Zn<sup>2+</sup> and 4-AP. Collectively this study provides insight into an alternative solution for conduction of K<sup>+</sup> ions and an unusual selectivity filter. But with respect to the geometry, chemistry and the number of ligands the channel architecture also recapitulates established concepts of K<sup>+</sup> channel biophysics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>Gene (<italic>Marivirga tractuosa)</italic> <break/></td><td>MtTMEM175 <break/></td><td>DSM 4126</td><td>E4TN31</td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>) <break/></td><td>hTMEM175 <break/></td><td>Sourcebioscience <break/></td><td>Q9BSA9, IRAUp969F1019D <break/></td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Gene (<italic>Streptomyces collinus</italic>)</td><td>scTMEM175 <break/></td><td>Synthesized by GenScript <break/></td><td>S5VBU1 <break/></td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Recombinant DNA reagent <break/></td><td>pBXC3H <break/></td><td>Dutzler lab <break/></td><td>Addgene # 47068 <break/></td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Recombinant DNA reagent <break/></td><td>pcDXC3M <break/></td><td>Dutzler lab <break/></td><td>Addgene #49030 <break/></td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Recombinant DNA reagent <break/></td><td>pcDXC3GMS <break/></td><td>Dutzler lab <break/></td><td>Addgene #49031 <break/></td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Recombinant DNA reagent <break/></td><td>pBXNPHM3 <break/></td><td>Dutzler lab <break/></td><td>Addgene #110099 <break/></td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>) <break/></td><td>HEK293</td><td>Germ.

The protein was cleaved over-night using HRV 3C protease during dialysis against 150 mM KCl, 10 mM Hepes-NaOH, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol. The MBP–His<sub>10</sub>-fragment was removed by binding to NiNTA resin and the flow-through containing the nanobodies was concentrated (Amicon) and applied to a Superdex 200 column (GE healthcare) equilibrated in 150 mM KCl, 5 mM Hepes 7.6. The peak fractions were concentrated to 10–25 mg/ml before mixing with MtTMEM175 for complex formation. Complex formation of purified nanobodies with MtTMEM175 was analyzed by SEC, where Nb<sub>51H01</sub> (corresponding macrobody is Mb<sub>51H01</sub>) was identified as a MtTMEM175 binder with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Macrobodies were expressed and purified in the same way.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Crystallization of the MtTMEM175-Mb<sub>51H01</sub> complex</title><p>Expression and monodispersity of purified TMEM175 proteins in small scale was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and SEC. Several TMEM175 proteins were expressed at reasonable rates and eluted as monodisperse species from SEC. Expression was scaled up and we could crystallize several homologues readily. However, all of the crystallized proteins, including MtTMEM175, diffracted not beyond 20 Å, even after extensive optimization of the crystallization conditions. To improve crystallization, we generated nanobodies against MtTMEM175 as described above. Nb<sub>51H01</sub>, identified by ELISA and SEC, was used for complex formation with MtTMEM175 and this complex was subjected to crystallization. The best crystals of this complex diffracted not beyond 10 Å. To improve crystallization further we decided to fuse MBP to the C-terminus of Nb<sub>51H01</sub> in order to increase possible crystal contacts and the chance for advantageous crystal lattices. We fused the Nb at the C-terminus with an N-terminally truncated MBP (starting at Lys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cang et al., 2015</xref>] without the signal sequence) linked by a valine residue as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>. This resulted in the interfacial sequence <underline>PVTV</underline><bold>V</bold><italic>KLVIWIN</italic> (Nb C-terminus underlined, linker in bold and MBP N-terminus in italics) and we named the construct Mb<sub>51H01</sub>. A complex of Mb<sub>51H01</sub> and MtTMEM175 was purified by SEC. Before subjecting the sample to SEC the mixture was left on ice for 15–30 min and eluted in 150 mM KCl, 5 mM Hepes-NaOH, 2.5 mM maltose and 0.03% DDM. The fractions containing the complex were concentrated to 8–16 mg/ml and subjected to crystallization trials.</p><p>Prior to crystallization the purified MtTMEM175-Mb<sub>51H01</sub> complex was mixed with <italic>E. coli</italic> polar lipids (Avanti) and with <italic>n</italic><bold>-</bold>decyl<bold>-</bold>β<bold>-</bold>d<bold>-</bold>maltopyranoside (DM, Anatrace) to a final concentration of 100 µg/ml and 0.3% respectively. Best crystals were obtained in a condition composed of 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl, 150 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 28–30% PEG400 grown at 20°C. After 14 days, the crystals were dehydrated for 3–4 hr using mother liquor with 36% PEG400, cryo-protected and flash-frozen in liquid propane or liquid nitrogen with similar results. The crystals giving the best datasets were additionally soaked in a cryo-protecting solution containing 5 mM KPtCl<sub>4</sub> followed by back-soaking in the cryo-protecting solution to get rid of excess platinum. For soaking in cesium and rubidium, 150 mM KCl in the cryo-protecting solution was replaced by 150 mM CsCl and 150 mM RbCl respectively. For the anomalous signal of zinc, crystals of MtTMEM175 WT protein were soaked for 15 min in a cryo-protecting solution containing 0.5 mM ZnSO<sub>4</sub> while the T38A mutant was soaked in 0.5–2.5 mM ZnSO<sub>4</sub>. The mutant MtTMEM175 with a T38A substitution was crystallized in the same condition and crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data collection and structure determination</title><p>X-ray diffraction data was collected on the X06SA beamline at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) of the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) equipped with an EIGER 16M detector (Dectris) at 100K.

Best diffracting crystals of MtTMEM175 WT were obtained after soaking in KPtCl<sub>4</sub>, but no anomalous platinum signal was detected. For the native data set seven datasets from a single crystal were merged together.

Potassium ion positions were verified by the anomalous signal at high wavelengths (λ = 2.02460 Å). Refinements using Buster-TNT indicated a high occupancy for K<sup>+</sup> at the position of 1K<sup>+</sup> and lower occupancy for K<sup>+</sup> at 2K<sup>+</sup>. Thus, the presence of both, K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>, at 2K<sup>+</sup> is possible. Native crystals were soaked with cesium, rubidium, and zinc and the respective ion position determined by the anomalous signal. The anomalous signal for cesium and rubidium ions was strong and identified their positions at the extracellular ion channel entrance (at 1K<sup>+</sup>). The anomalous signal for the data measured at the zinc K-edge (λ = 1.24610 Å) was weak, suggesting only partial occupancy.

This protein family forms endo- and lysosomal K<sup>+</sup> channels in higher eukaryotes with a protein architecture that is distinct from canonical K<sup>+</sup> channels. A series of X-ray structures in a presumed non-conducting conformation provide detailed insight into structural features of this protein and into the interaction with cations. Compared to the previously determined structure of a different prokaryotic TMEM175 homologue (CmTMEM175), the described structure shows striking novel features with respect to architectural details and ion-coordination that were related to its presumed functional properties. The authors include electrophysiological experiments on WT and mutant channels to decipher the mechanism of K<sup>+</sup> selectivity and Zn2+ block in this family of channels, and arrive at a conclusion that differs from the earlier interpretation. They propose that upon pore opening, the pore-forming helices undergo a rotation, exposing a different set of side chains to the permeation pathway compared to the ones seen in the closed-state structures. As a consequence, in an open pore K<sup>+</sup> ions are coordinated by conserved serine and threonine side chains, instead of having to pass through a narrow hydrophobic &quot;nanotube&quot;. The work raises interesting controversy in a field that is just emerging, and suggests that the general principles of K<sup>+</sup> selectivity established for &quot;canonical&quot; K<sup>+</sup> channels might also hold for the TMEM175 family.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should confirm that the electrophysiological recordings on MtTM175 indeed measure currents through that channel.</p><p>1.1) Although the whole-cell currents of MtTMEM175A recorded from HEK293 cells appear large compared to mock-transfected cells and a point mutation (T38A) has changed ion selectivity of the channel, it would still be interesting to know whether the authors have ever confirmed expression of the protein on a biochemical level. Prokaryotic membrane proteins frequently do not express in mammalian cells and detection of expression would thus provide an additional confirmation that the recorded data are describing the conduction properties of MtTMEM175. In the Materials and methods the authors have described the construction of a protein construct containing Venus-YFP fused to the C-terminus of the protein. Did the authors use this construct for transfection and did they observe fluorescent protein on the plasma membrane?</p><p>1.2) Did the authors record single channel data (shown in Figure 2D) with different pipette solutions and did these data correspond to the selectivity properties of the channel measured in whole-cell configuration? Have the authors quantified the cation over anion permeability ratio of MtTMEM175?</p><p>2) Interpretation of Zn2+ block of MtTMEM175 should be solidified.</p><p>The evidence that Zn2+ acts as pore-blocker of MtTMEM175 is currently very weak. First, the Zn2+ concentrations used in electrophysiology experiments (5 mM) and in the crystal structure (500 mM) are very high. Second, the proposed Zn2+ binding site is in the middle of the membrane, close to L35 (Figure 6A), yet the block shows no voltage dependence. Third, Zn2+ block is unaffected by the T38A mutation.</p><p>3) Regarding selectivity of MtTMEM175, the authors arrive at a mechanistic conclusion that differs completely from the earlier conclusion by the Jiang group, but they do not test the effect on selectivity of mutating the residue (L35) proposed to play a key role in the earlier study. Selectivity of the L35A mutant should be studied and the results included in the interpretation.</p><p>4) The X-ray data generally appear of high quality and all structures are well refined. Still, in case of the native data (and several other datasets) the authors have used highly redundant datasets, which makes Rmeas a meaningless quantity to estimate data quality. We suggest that the authors provide plots of I/sigI vs. resolution and an extended documentation of the electron density as figure supplements to better illustrate the quality of their data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53683.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should confirm that the electrophysiological recordings on MtTM175 indeed measure currents through that channel.</p><p>1.1) Although the whole-cell currents of MtTMEM175A recorded from HEK293 cells appear large compared to mock-transfected cells and a point mutation (T38A) has changed ion selectivity of the channel, it would still be interesting to know whether the authors have ever confirmed expression of the protein on a biochemical level.

First we expressed C-terminally Venus-YFP tagged MtTMEM175 in HEK cells. This construct has not been used for our measurements. In the latter we co-transfected GFP with untagged MtTMEM175. (Both untagged and YFP-tagged MtTMEM175 versions are expressed from the same vector, a pcDNA 3.1 derivative). YFP-tagged MtTMEM175 showed a wide expression pattern with largely intracellular fluorescence (presumably ER and endosomal compartments) as illustrated in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A. This is not unusual upon overexpression, however the bright fluorescence might overwhelm weaker signals from the plasma membrane. We therefore prepared isolated plasma membrane patches by decapitating the cell bodies by osmotic shock. The isolated membrane patches were imaged with TIRF microscopy in which the plasma membrane was stained with a PM-specific dye. Potential contaminations by ER were stained by an ER tracker dye. The results in Figure 2—figure supplement 2B demonstrate an overlap of PM with YFP-tagged MtTMEM175 and support the idea that this protein indeed also reaches the plasma membrane (it might still be only a minor fraction though). We also detected human TMEM175 on the PM. Overexpression has apparently led to a fraction of this protein in the plasma membrane of this otherwise lysosomal/endosomal channel. In this way the channel became, like in previous studies, measurable in whole-cell recordings. From an experimental point of view this is important information.</p><p>In a second experiment we generated a fluorescent version of the Nanobody that we used for co-crystallization (Nb<sub>51H01</sub>). For this we expressed the Nb with a C-terminal Venus-YFP tag followed by an SBP tag for purification and produced it in small scale by cytosolic expression in HEK cells. It was shown earlier by us (Schenck et al., 2017) and other labs that Nbs can be expressed as intrabodies. Nb<sub>51H01</sub> binds an extracellular epitope on MtTMEM175, as evident from our structure (Figure 1A). It is therefore suitable for labeling cells that express this channel on the cell surface. When we applied purified Nb-vYFP to mock and MtTMEM175 (non-fluorescent) transfected, non-permeabilized and unfixed HEK cells, only the MtTMEM175 expressing cells showed a clear fluorescent rim (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). We could abolish this labeling by pre-absorption with the antigen (bacterially expressed and purified MtTMEM175). These data provide further very good evidence that MtTMEM175 is inserted into the plasma membrane of HEK cells (we don’t know to which percentage of the total expression) and can thus account for the measured currents.</p><p>In a third example we transiently expressed C-terminally SBP-tagged MtTMEM175 in HEK cells and purified it in small scale with streptavidin beads. We obtained sufficient amounts for a coomassie stain that revealed the expected MW. In addition, the purified protein was injected to a Superdex 5/150 column and elution was monitored by Trp-fluorescence. The protein eluted at almost the same volume as bacterially expressed MtTMEM175 indicating assembled tetramers as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 4 (the minor difference could be due to the presence of a 3C-site, a myc-tag and the SBP tag, whereas the bacterial sample has been 3C-digested already). The SEC chromatogram revealed no significant higher order aggregates and we therefore think that HEK cells are capable of producing correctly folded (also backed by binding of Nb<sub>51H01</sub>-vYFP) bacterial TMEM175 channels (at least MtTMEM175).</p><p>We think these data make our work more conclusive, our data from electrophysiological recordings more trustworthy and we believe it was a very reasonable request from the reviewers to ask for experiments to clarify this. Such information was also lacking in the previous two major publications and our data gives confidence that the methodology can be applied in future investigations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.2) Did the authors record single channel data (shown in Figure 2D) with different pipette solutions and did these data correspond to the selectivity properties of the channel measured in whole-cell configuration? Have the authors quantified the cation over anion permeability ratio of MtTMEM175?</p></disp-quote><p>The observations of single channel activity were too sporadic for a systematic investigation. At this point the detection of channel activity with stochastic fluctuation is important in the context of the general view in the literature that this lysosomal channel is a leak channel and constantly open (Cang et al., 2015). The present data however underscore that TMEM175 proteins are gated to open and close.</p><p>We included data on the cation over anion selectivity using methanesulfonate as a large anion vs. chloride. The channel has no apparent permeability for anions: the reversal voltage was not significantly different when the same recordings were done with standard bath solution containing the large anion methanesulfonate (+0.64 ± 3 mV n=18) or in a bath with 150 mM KCl (2.4 ± 4, n=7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Interpretation of Zn2+ block of MtTMEM175 should be solidified.</p><p>The evidence that Zn2+ acts as pore-blocker of MtTMEM175 is currently very weak.

Third, Zn2+ block is unaffected by the T38A mutation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the data on the Zn<sup>2+</sup> block of MtTMEM175 is not clear or not clearly described in the previous version of our manuscript. In principle we state that a true Zn<sup>2+</sup> block occurs only in hTMEM175/ animal TMEM175 and that the data on MtTMEM175 is at most hinting at the site of the block and that a different effect likely accounts for the inhibition of MtTMEM175 by Zn<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>The block by Zn<sup>2+</sup> is very weak in bacterial TMEM175 channels (IC50 ~0.5mM). In hTMEM175 Zn<sup>2+</sup> is very effective (IC50 ~38µM), and in addition this channel is sensitive to 4-AP (IC50~35µM for Zn<sup>2+</sup>). Regarding the difference in selectivity between hTMEM175 and bacterial TMEM175 channels we have shown that the additional hydrophilic layer of Ser45 underlies this difference. We thus thought that this residue might also account for the very different sensitivity towards blockers. As it was shown before by Jiang’s group, 4-AP and Zn<sup>2+</sup> are equally effective in hTMEM175 if applied from the extracellular or intracellular side. Hence a block in the pore is likely. Indeed, mutating Ser45 to alanine abolished the sensitivity for both blockers. That means that in the Ser45Ala mutant blockers don’t persist in the pore and that a certain number of ligands must be present for Zn<sup>2+</sup> and 4-AP to become blocking agents. In the Ser45Ala mutant the layer of threonines (which corresponds to Thr38 in MtTMEM175) is still present, however no inhibition is occurring. This suggests that Thr38 in MtTMEM175 could in turn also not underlie the block by Zn<sup>2+</sup>. And mutation of Thr38 to alanine supports this logic, as the block persists. What is making things more complicated and confusing are the data we got from crystallography. Here, in MtTMEM175 Zn<sup>2+</sup> can be detected in WT channels in close proximity to Thr38, whereas we could not detect ions in the Thr38Ala mutant, even at higher concentrations. How could this be explained, as the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion close to the selectivity filter intuitively suggests the site of the block? Encouraged by your comments we suggest the following scenario: The pore is apparently attracting Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in MtTMEM175, and it seems that the electrostatic character of the pore is much influenced by Thr38. Mutating Thr38 to Ala obviously changes this electrostatic landscape and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions do not bind in the pore any longer. The presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> at this location in WT MtTMEM175 does not mean that a block in MtTMEM175 occurs at this location, although it is tempting to think so. Since the Ser45Ala mutant is insensitive towards Zn<sup>2+</sup> this would actually be an oddity. But Zn<sup>2+</sup> is blocking, albeit weakly also bacterial TMEM175 channels. From all the data we have we must conclude that this block is not related to what we observe in hTMEM175. We can currently not explain the mechanism of Zn<sup>2+</sup> block in MtTMEM175. To describe this difference between the structural and the functional data we still prefer to still show our data on Zn<sup>2+</sup>+ and MtTMEM175 but we move the figures to the supplement. We think it is important to provide the structural information on where Zn<sup>2+</sup> can be located in the closed pore of the protein and that mutating Thr38 is affecting this potential binding site. However, we refrain from speculating on a causal relationship between the structural and the functional data.</p><p>Regarding the concentrations, we clarify here that we have used Zn<sup>2+</sup> at a final concentration of 0.5 mM for soaks in cryo-solution, not 500 mM. For the Thr38Ala mutant of MtTMEM175 we tested concentrations of 0.5-2.5 mM. We agree that 5 mM Zn<sup>2+</sup> is a rather high concentration for electrophysiological experiments, but we did not see adverse effects in the experiments with hTMEM175 WT/ Ser45Ala, hence we have no reason to doubt our data regarding hTMEM175.</p><p>Another unusual observation is the lack of voltage-dependence for the block by Zn<sup>2+</sup>. We were initially also very surprised by this finding and we can only try to explain this effect from the existing data. It is obvious that the mechanism of Zn<sup>2+</sup> block is different from the canonical pore block of K<sup>+</sup> channel by for example Ba<sup>2+</sup>. The location of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion in the pore could help to explain the oddity of a lack of voltage-dependence of this block. MtTMEM175 crystallized in the closed state, yet in crystal soaks the small Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion could penetrate rather deep into the pore. This means that Zn<sup>2+</sup> is not pulled as a blocker into the open pore but it can localize to the middle of the membrane plane in the closed state by diffusion. Regarding the electrophysiological data this means that also all closed channels (we currently don’t know the fraction of open/closed channels) could have Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in their pores in vicinity to the selectivity filter. From all that we know so far is that the channels fluctuate between open and closed states. Hence the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion could therefore be attracted by the selectivity filter before any voltage is applied. Now, when voltage is applied during electrophysiological measurements, the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion would be already very near or at the site where the block takes place in vertebrate TMEM175 and thus the voltage dependence of a pore-block, that is a physical consequence of its location in the middle of the membrane plane, would be masked. We agree that this phenomenon needs more investigation to be coherently explained.</p><p>We have put now more focus on the human TMEM175 and its sensitivity towards Zn<sup>2+</sup> and 4-AP for which we have conclusive data. Regarding MtTMEM175 and Zn<sup>2+</sup> block, we wanted however to make our data available to readers, that is why we moved the data to the supplement (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). We elaborated the discrepancies between MtTMEM175 and hTMEM175 now more precisely in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Regarding selectivity of MtTMEM175, the authors arrive at a mechanistic conclusion that differs completely from the earlier conclusion by the Jiang group, but they do not test the effect on selectivity of mutating the residue (L35) proposed to play a key role in the earlier study. Selectivity of the L35A mutant should be studied and the results included in the interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the data on the Zn<sup>2+</sup> block of MtTMEM175 is not clear or not clearly described in the previous version of our manuscript. In principle we state that a true Zn<sup>2+</sup> block occurs only in hTMEM175/ animal TMEM175 and that the data on MtTMEM175 is at most hinting at the site of the block and that a different effect likely accounts for the inhibition of MtTMEM175 by Zn<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>The block by Zn<sup>2+</sup> is very weak in bacterial TMEM175 channels (IC50 ~0.5mM). In hTMEM175 Zn<sup>2+</sup> is very effective (IC50 ~38µM), and in addition this channel is sensitive to 4-AP (IC50~35µM for Zn<sup>2+</sup>). Regarding the difference in selectivity between hTMEM175 and bacterial TMEM175 channels we have shown that the additional hydrophilic layer of Ser45 underlies this difference. We thus thought that this residue might also account for the very different sensitivity towards blockers. As it was shown before by Jiang’s group, 4-AP and Zn<sup>2+</sup> are equally effective in hTMEM175 if applied from the extracellular or intracellular side. Hence a block in the pore is likely. Indeed, mutating Ser45 to alanine abolished the sensitivity for both blockers. That means that in the Ser45Ala mutant blockers don’t persist in the pore and that a certain number of ligands must be present for Zn<sup>2+</sup> and 4-AP to become blocking agents. In the Ser45Ala mutant the layer of threonines (which corresponds to Thr38 in MtTMEM175) is still present, however no inhibition is occurring. This suggests that Thr38 in MtTMEM175 could in turn also not underlie the block by Zn<sup>2+</sup>. And mutation of Thr38 to alanine supports this logic, as the block persists. What is making things more complicated and confusing are the data we got from crystallography. Here, in MtTMEM175 Zn<sup>2+</sup> can be detected in WT channels in close proximity to Thr38, whereas we could not detect ions in the Thr38Ala mutant, even at higher concentrations. How could this be explained, as the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion close to the selectivity filter intuitively suggests the site of the block? Encouraged by your comments we suggest the following scenario: The pore is apparently attracting Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in MtTMEM175, and it seems that the electrostatic character of the pore is much influenced by Thr38. Mutating Thr38 to Ala obviously changes this electrostatic landscape and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions do not bind in the pore any longer. The presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> at this location in WT MtTMEM175 does not mean that a block in MtTMEM175 occurs at this location, although it is tempting to think so. Since the Ser45Ala mutant is insensitive towards Zn<sup>2+</sup> this would actually be an oddity. But Zn<sup>2+</sup> is blocking, albeit weakly also bacterial TMEM175 channels. From all the data we have we must conclude that this block is not related to what we observe in hTMEM175. We can currently not explain the mechanism of Zn<sup>2+</sup> block in MtTMEM175. To describe this difference between the structural and the functional data we still prefer to still show our data on Zn<sup>2+</sup>+ and MtTMEM175 but we move the figures to the supplement. We think it is important to provide the structural information on where Zn<sup>2+</sup> can be located in the closed pore of the protein and that mutating Thr38 is affecting this potential binding site. However, we refrain from speculating on a causal relationship between the structural and the functional data.</p><p>Regarding the concentrations, we clarify here that we have used Zn<sup>2+</sup> at a final concentration of 0.5 mM for soaks in cryo-solution, not 500 mM. For the Thr38Ala mutant of MtTMEM175 we tested concentrations of 0.5-2.5 mM. We agree that 5 mM Zn<sup>2+</sup> is a rather high concentration for electrophysiological experiments, but we did not see adverse effects in the experiments with hTMEM175 WT/ Ser45Ala, hence we have no reason to doubt our data regarding hTMEM175.</p><p>Another unusual observation is the lack of voltage-dependence for the block by Zn<sup>2+</sup>. We were initially also very surprised by this finding and we can only try to explain this effect from the existing data. It is obvious that the mechanism of Zn<sup>2+</sup> block is different from the canonical pore block of K<sup>+</sup> channel by for example Ba<sup>2+</sup>. The location of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion in the pore could help to explain the oddity of a lack of voltage-dependence of this block. MtTMEM175 crystallized in the closed state, yet in crystal soaks the small Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion could penetrate rather deep into the pore. This means that Zn<sup>2+</sup> is not pulled as a blocker into the open pore but it can localize to the middle of the membrane plane in the closed state by diffusion. Regarding the electrophysiological data this means that also all closed channels (we currently don’t know the fraction of open/closed channels) could have Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in their pores in vicinity to the selectivity filter. From all that we know so far is that the channels fluctuate between open and closed states. Hence the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion could therefore be attracted by the selectivity filter before any voltage is applied. Now, when voltage is applied during electrophysiological measurements, the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion would be already very near or at the site where the block takes place in vertebrate TMEM175 and thus the voltage dependence of a pore-block, that is a physical consequence of its location in the middle of the membrane plane, would be masked. We agree that this phenomenon needs more investigation to be coherently explained.</p><p>We have put now more focus on the human TMEM175 and its sensitivity towards Zn<sup>2+</sup> and 4-AP for which we have conclusive data.

Still, in case of the native data (and several other datasets) the authors have used highly redundant datasets, which makes Rmeas a meaningless quantity to estimate data quality.

The reviewers are correct as Rmeas is indeed meaningless for high redundant data. For completeness reason we have given standard parameters of data quality in the Supplementary files 1 and 2.
