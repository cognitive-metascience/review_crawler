macrophage precursors that are recruited on demand from the blood to sites of inflammation and challenge. In steady state, classical monocytes give rise to vasculature-resident cells that patrol the luminal side of the endothelium. In addition, classical monocytes feed macrophage compartments of selected organs, including barrier tissues, such as the skin and intestine, as well as the heart. Monocyte differentiation under conditions of inflammation has been studied in considerable detail. In contrast, monocyte differentiation under non-inflammatory conditions remains less well understood. Here we took advantage of a combination of cell ablation and precursor engraftment to investigate the generation of gut macrophages from monocytes. Collectively, we identify factors associated with the gradual adaptation of monocytes to tissue residency. Moreover, comparison of monocyte differentiation into the colon and ileum-resident macrophages revealed the graduated acquisition of gut segment-specific gene expression signatures.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Macrophage cells play a crucial role in keeping the body free of disease-causing microbes and debris. They surveille the tissues, detect and clear infections, and tidy up dead cells. Most internal organs contain a population of macrophages that move into the organ during development and then persist throughout an organism’s life. However, tissues in contact with the outside world, such as the gut, need a constant supply of fresh macrophages. This supply depends on immune cells called monocytes moving into these tissues from the blood and maturing into macrophages when they arrive.</p><p>The macrophages in the gut have a challenging job to do. They need to be able to detect infections amongst healthy gut bacteria and foreign food particles. Macrophages from other tissues would overreact if they encountered this complicated environment, but gut macrophages learn to tolerate their surroundings by switching genes on and off as they mature. The exact combination of genes macrophages in the gut use depends on whether they are in the small or large intestine, which have different anatomies and resident microbes.</p><p>To understand how monocytes mature into macrophages in the gut, previous studies have focused on what happens during an infection. However, it remains unclear how monocytes develop into mature gut macrophages in the healthy gut. To address this question, Gross-Vered et al. have looked at mice in which gut macrophages can be killed when a drug is applied. This made it possible to replace the mice’s own macrophages with fluorescently labelled cells derived from monocytes.</p><p>Fluorescent monocytes were introduced into the bloodstream and arrived in the small and large intestine after the drug had been administered. Gross-Vered et al. then collected cells derived from these labelled monocytes and examined the genes that they were using. This revealed that once the monocytes entered the gut they began sensing their new environment and switching thousands of genes on and off. These changes happened rapidly at first and continued more gradually as the macrophages matured. Comparing the fluorescent macrophages from the small and large intestines revealed many similarities, but there were also hundreds of genes that differed. In the small intestine, macrophages switched on genes involved in catching and consuming bacteria, whereas macrophages in the large intestine, which has more resident healthy bacteria, turned on fewer of these bacteria-eating genes.</p><p>Inflammatory bowel disorders like ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease both involve gut macrophages. Comparing the genes that macrophages use in the healthy and diseased gut may reveal information about these disorders. For example, ulcerative colitis only affects the large intestine, so understanding how and why the monocytes mature differently there could shed light on new ways to treat the disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>monocytes</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>intestine</kwd><kwd>colon</kwd><kwd>ileum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>340345</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>Steffen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Detailed analysis of the sequence of monocyte differentiation into distinct gut tissue macrophages provides insights into monocyte biology and can serve as a platform for the design of cell therapies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The recent past has seen major advance in our understanding of the diverse origins of tissue macrophages, as well as their discrete maintenance strategies. Macrophages were shown to arise from three distinct developmental pathways that differentially contribute to the tissue compartments in the embryo and adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ginhoux and Guilliams, 2016</xref>). In the mouse, embryonic tissue macrophages first develop from primitive macrophage progenitors that originate in the yolk sac (YS). In the brain, YS-macrophage-derived macrophages persist throughout adulthood, while in most other tissues these cells are replaced by fetal monocytes that derive from multi-potent erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMP). Definitive hematopoiesis commences from E10.5 with the generation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that first also locate to the fetal liver, but eventually seed the bone marrow (BM) to maintain adult hematopoiesis. Most EMP-derived tissue macrophage compartments persevere throughout adulthood without major input from HSC-derived cells; however, in certain barrier tissues, as well as selected other organs, like the heart, embryonic macrophages are progressively replaced by HSC-derived cells involving a blood monocyte intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Varol et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Monocytes are continuously generated in the BM involving a sequence of developmental intermediates, before extravasation into the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ginhoux and Jung, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mildner et al., 2016</xref>). Once in the blood, murine classical Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes have a limited half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yona et al., 2013</xref>). On demand, Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes can be rapidly recruited to sites of injury and challenge, where they complement tissue-resident macrophages and dendritic cells. In absence of challenge, some Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes give rise to vasculature-resident Ly6C<sup>-</sup> cells, which patrol the vessel walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auffray et al., 2007</xref>). These cells display macrophage characteristics including extended life spans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yona et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mildner et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes replenish the above-mentioned selected steady state tissue macrophage compartments, including the gut and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ginhoux and Jung, 2014</xref>). Given their mobility, plasticity and key role in pathologies, the manipulation of monocytes and their differentiation could bear considerable therapeutic potential. However, monocyte differentiation into tissue resident cells remains incompletely understood.</p><p>Gut macrophages, which reside in the connective tissue underlying the gut epithelium, the <italic>lamina propria</italic>, are considered key players for the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. As such, they constantly sense their environment and respond to the unique microbiota and food challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bain and Mowat, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zigmond and Jung, 2013</xref>). Recent studies revealed that monocyte-derived <italic>lamina propria</italic> macrophages comprise in mice two populations, that is short-lived cells and long-lived cells with self-renewing capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shaw et al., 2018</xref>); the latter population might also include remnants of embryonic populations, as could additional intestinal long-lived macrophage populations that reside near blood vessels, nerves and in the Peyer's Patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Schepper et al., 2018</xref>). Evidence for macrophages with different half-lives is also emerging for the human small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bujko et al., 2018</xref>). Collectively, these findings highlight the existence of considerable macrophage heterogeneity, not only between different organs, but also within given tissues.</p><p>Monocyte differentiation into intestinal macrophages involves phenotypic changes with respect to Ly6C, CD64 and MHCII expression, a sequence described as ‘monocyte waterfall’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tamoutounour et al., 2012</xref>). Mature steady-state gut macrophages tolerate the commensal microbiota and food antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bain and Mowat, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zigmond and Jung, 2013</xref>). Their relative unresponsiveness is thought to rely on regulatory circuits that balance the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory gene products, such as cytokines and molecules participating in pattern recognition receptor signaling cascades.</p><p>Macrophages located in different tissues display characteristic enhancer landscapes and gene expression profiles, which have been attributed to the exposure of instructing factors of the microenvironment they reside in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amit et al. (2016)</xref>. Gut segments display distinct anatomy, function and microbiota load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mowat and Agace, 2014</xref>) and macrophages of small and large intestine hence also likely differ. Despite the known distinct susceptibility of the colon and ileum to pathology, such as to the IL10R deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glocker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zigmond et al., 2014</xref>) and in ulcerative colitis, so far no comparative analysis of their macrophages has been reported. Likewise, our general understanding of monocyte-derived tissue resident macrophages remains scarce and is largely restricted to settings of inflammation.</p><p>Here we investigated monocyte differentiation into intestinal macrophages in the small and large intestine. Using adoptive monocyte transfers into macrophage-depleted recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Varol et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Varol et al., 2009</xref>), we synchronized the macrophages in terms of development, isolated colonic and ileal macrophages and subjected them to transcriptome profiling. Our data establish the distinct identities of gut segment resident macrophages and shed light on the kinetics and gradual gene expression of specific factors for their establishment of their identities.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Monocyte transcriptomes acquired during differentiation into ileal and colonic gut macrophages</title><p>Tissue macrophages display distinct gene expression profiles and enhancer landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amit et al., 2016</xref>). This holds also for intestinal macrophages residing in small and large intestine. Transcriptomes of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> BM monocytes, that is the macrophage precursors, and transcriptomes of their progeny in colon and ileum displayed 6200 genes differentially expressed at least 2-fold across all analyzed data sets out of a total of 12345 detected genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). 2255 genes were expressed in monocytes and down-regulated in macrophages (cluster I). Conversely, cluster II comprised genes whose expression was absent from monocytes, but shared by both small and large intestinal macrophages. Finally, 1087 and 987 genes were either preferentially or exclusively expressed in ileal or colonic macrophages, respectively.</p><p>To further characterize adult monocyte-derived gut macrophages, we took advantage of an experimental system involving monocyte engraftment of macrophage-depleted animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Varol et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Varol et al., 2009</xref>). Analysis of transferred cells at different intervals from engraftment allows the study of intestinal macrophage development over time, since monocyte differentiation is synchronized. For the cell ablation we used [CD11c-DTR &gt; WT] BM chimeras, in which diphtheria toxin (DTx) receptor (DTR) transgenic intestinal macrophages can be conditionally ablated by DTx injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Varol et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Varol et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Two days prior to monocyte transfer, DTx was applied to the recipients to clear their intestinal macrophage niche and mice were subsequently treated with DTx every second day. The monocyte graft was isolated from BM of <italic>Cx<sub>3</sub>cr1<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jung et al., 2000</xref>) and defined as CD117<sup>-</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD115<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>+</sup> GFP<sup>int</sup> cells; donor animals also harbored an allotypic marker (CD45.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Grafted cells could be visualized in recipient gut tissue and underwent expansion, as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Varol et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Intestinal tissues of recipient mice were harvested on day 4, 8 and 12 post engraftment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to isolate graft-derived macrophages according to CD45.1 and CX<sub>3</sub>CR1/GFP expression; these cells were CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD64<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>-</sup> and mainly CD11c<sup>hi</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Of note, specifics of the system preclude harvest of graft-derived cells at later time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Varol et al., 2009</xref>).

Most tissue macrophages are currently believed to be generated in the embryo from EMP via a fetal liver monocyte intermediate and subsequently maintain themselves through self-renewal. Selected macrophages residing in barrier tissues, such as gut and skin, however rely on constant replenishment from blood monocytes. Here we report the study of this macrophage generation from monocyte precursors.</p><p>Following tissue damage and infection, classical monocytes, defined as CD14<sup>+</sup> cells in humans, and Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells in mice critically contribute to inflammatory reactions by promoting and resolving acute challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ginhoux and Jung, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mildner et al., 2016</xref>). At the sites of injury, monocytes can give rise to cells with both macrophage and DC features. Monocyte differentiation during inflammation has been studied in various pathophysiological settings, including experimental auto-immune encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yamasaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Masuda et al., 2016</xref>), colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rivollier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zigmond et al., 2012</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avraham-Davidi et al., 2013</xref>). To study less well understood physiological monocyte differentiation in absence of overt inflammation, we took advantage of an experimental system that allows synchronized reconstitution of macrophage compartments by monocyte engraftment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Varol et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Varol et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The majority of changes in gene expression, both in fold change and numbers, occurred in the transition from monocytes to either colonic or ileal macrophages at day four post transfer, that is immediately after extravasation. Engrafted colonic and ileal macrophages segregated in gene expression according to tissue. Tissue-specific macrophage imprinting occurs hence early during development, shortly after tissue infiltration. Interestingly, two samples of engrafted ileal macrophages clustered with the colonic samples rather than the ileal ones, suggesting that the colonic signature is default. Colonic macrophages at day 12 post engraftment were also more distinct from endogenous colonic macrophages, compared to their ileal counterparts, which implies that the mature colonic gene signature might take longer time to develop or could be more heterogeneous. Recent studies have noted heterogeneity within murine blood monocytes, in particular with respect to an intermediate between the Ly6C<sup>+</sup> and Ly6<sup>-</sup> populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mildner et al., 2017</xref>). While we currently cannot formally rule out that, colonic and ileal macrophages could hence derive from distinct precursors, we consider this however unlikely.</p><p>Mowat and colleagues have reported a transcriptome analysis of monocytes and colonic macrophages, including intermediates of the ‘waterfall’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schridde et al., 2017</xref>). The authors highlighted the critical role of TGFb in the differentiation process. While a comparison of these data to ours confirmed the late onset of genes that characterize long-lived gut macrophages, the use of the distinct platforms and distinct experimental set up precluded further direct alignment. Of note, monocyte-derived cells are in our system synchronized with respect to development and therefore allow additional temporal resolution, especially with respect to final population of the scheme (P4), which comprises in the cited study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schridde et al., 2017</xref>) a heterogeneous conglomerate.</p><p>With their extended half-life, Ly6C<sup>-</sup> monocytes that patrol the endothelium, have been proposed to represent vasculature-resident macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ginhoux and Jung, 2014</xref>). Indeed, these cells shared gene signatures with the gut resident macrophages, such as the reduction in IRF TFs following monocyte differentiation and induction of characteristic macrophage genes, such as PPARg and TGFbR. However, the comparison of these blood-resident cells to gut tissue-resident macrophages revealed also considerable differences likely associated with the residence in vasculature and the solid tissue, respectively.</p><p>Though anatomically close, the small and large intestine represent very distinct tissues, including structural dissimilarities, such as the extended ileal villi and Peyer’s Patches, characteristic distinct abundance of immune cells, as well as different luminal microbiome content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mowat and Agace, 2014</xref>). Highlighting these differences, ileum and colon display also unique susceptibility to perturbations, as for instance to a IL10R deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zigmond et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernshtein et al., 2019</xref>). Our comparative analysis of colonic and ileal macrophages, including their generation from monocytes, might provide critical insights into the mechanism underlying segment-specific pathology resistance or - susceptibility in the gut. Together with earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mildner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schridde et al., 2017</xref>), our data sets can provide a starting point for hypothesis-driven experiments.</p><p>To conclude, we characterized here monocyte-derived intestinal macrophages generated under conditions avoiding overt inflammation. We highlight specific genes and TFs which are regulated following monocyte differentiation to generic or segment-specific intestinal macrophages. By comparing transcriptomes of early intestinal macrophages and blood-resident Ly6C<sup>-</sup> cells, we show that the populations which share a common ancestor – the Ly6C<sup>+</sup> blood monocytes – show considerable overlap in gene expression, while they also display adaptation to their specific environments. Our data provide a gateway and reference point to further studies on monocyte differentiation to macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Mice were kept in a specific-pathogen-free (SPF), temperature-controlled (22 ± 1°C) facility on a reverse 12 hr light/dark cycle at the Weizmann Institute of Science.

studies of diphtheria toxin ablation of CD11c cells with engraftment of CX3CR1 donor cells in a well-established macrophage reconstitution model. The main conclusions of the paper are that most transcriptomic signatures of the intestinal context (compared with blood monocytes) are rapidly acquired; that there are distinct transcriptomic signatures between the small and large intestinal macrophages and that early uptake differences in line with the Mowat 'waterfall' effect can be captured.</p><p>This is a well-established model by a group with a strong track-record in the field addressing an important problem to understand the differences in intestinal macrophages between the small and large intestines.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors were asked to provide a plan for revisions before the editors issued a final decision, this was subsequently approved by the editors. What follows is the editors’ letter requesting such plan.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Defining monocyte differentiation into colonic and ileal macrophages&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation is being overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>There are two main issues where we would be very grateful for clarification. The first is how you would intend to respond to the potential bias introduced by the CD11c depletion strategy as in the major comment of reviewer 2 and the general remarks of reviewer 3. A second vital issue is that the paper could easily be very quickly superseded by a single cell approach. If you have, or intend to obtain single cell data, we would ask that it is included in this paper. Of course, we would respect your wishes if you choose to publish this data and the single cell data elsewhere, although we would have concerns if the <italic>eLife</italic> manuscript is preliminary to another publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1) A concern is that the specifics of the k-means clustering with subsequent selectivity of individual transcripts. Justification of the groupings (elbow, gap statistics) is not shown, and it is generally unclear how multiplicity of testing is dealt with. It would likely transform the paper to show 'pseudo-time' analyses (E.g. Nature Communications 9:2442). In addition, color-coding the bulk plots for the different cell populations would give a feeling for the groupings independently of the most extreme cases. It would be helpful to rationalize results according to discrimination of different intestinal contexts and may be more powerful in revealing contextual differences.</p><p>2) The authors (almost certainly correctly) argue that lamina propria macrophages are the main population being studied. Nevertheless, they are showing bulk analyses of heterogeneous populations (developmentally and according to micro-anatomical position). This data seems extremely likely to be rapidly superseded by single cell analyses. At the very least the authors should acknowledge this point. It would rather devalue the impact of the paper in <italic>eLife</italic> if the authors are able to publish single cell analyses in a different paper in the near future: to include such data would empower the above approach and transform the paper.</p><p>3) It appears that many of the annotated gene expression results selected for individual display in the histograms are derived from the bulk transcriptomic analyses. The question of reproducibility could be dealt with by qPCR methodology for critical targets.</p><p>4) The manuscript rather catalogues the microphage contextual differences without clear validation. It would help to use in enrichment plots or STRING analyses to display the biological interpretations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The present manuscript by Steffen Jung and collaborators entitled &quot;Defining monocyte differentiation into colonic and ileal macrophages&quot; represents a well-written report by experienced leaders in the field of macrophage/dendritic cell biology.</p><p>The authors used CD11c-DTR bone marrow chimeric mice to deplete CD11c+ macrophages before reconstituting with CD45.1 congenic Ly6C<sup>+</sup> bone marrow-derived monocytes. This allowed to synchronize, and, comparatively analyze, the differentiation of monocyte-macrophage differentiation under homeostatic conditions during a 12 day period in the ileum, and the colon by RNA profiling.</p><p>Hence, the authors addressed a so far under-investigated topic, i.e. the site-specific differentiation/maturation of monocyte-derived macrophages in distinct intestinal compartments under non-inflammatory, homeostatic conditions.</p><p>Novel findings reported include the identification of distinct expression profiles of macrophages in separate intestinal segments under homeostatic conditions, likely driven by site-specific microenvironmental cues which (likely) lead to the distinct expression profiles seen in resident macrophages in the ileum and the colon. Remarkably, following engraftment, the monocyte-intestinal macrophage differentiation essentially recapitulated the monocyte-macrophage waterfall as previously described by Bernard Malissen and colleagues.</p><p>Last but not least, I also agree with their conclusion that &quot;their data provide a gateway and reference point to further studies on monocyte differentiation to macrophages&quot; – despite some discrepant findings to reports in the literature -which were also acknowledged by the authors and ascribed to different experimental set-ups and use of distinct analysis platforms.</p><p>My main concern with the present manuscript is the used the cell-depletion protocol, which most likely results in a biased depletion of some, but not all, host-derived intestinal macrophage subsets in recipient mice:</p><p>The authors took advantage of a (CD11c-DTR)-targeted cell-depletion-reconstitution strategy to obtain a synchronized reconstitution of the intestinal macrophage compartment by the adoptive transfer of bone marrow-derived Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes. This experimental system was previously used by the authors, for example, to successfully dissect the different origins and functions of intestinal lamina propria DC subsets (Varol et al., 2009). In this article, the authors also acknowledge that &quot;DTx treatment of [CD11c-DTR &gt; WT] chimeras resulted in the depletion of all lamina propria DC subsets, whereas the population of CD11c-/lo CD11b<sup>+</sup> lpMø remained unaltered&quot;. Hence, in the present study even after repeated DT treatment, the intestinal lamina propria is likely to be still populated with host (CD45.2)-derived intestinal CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD11c-/lo macrophages at the time of engraftment with the CD45.1 Ly6C<sup>+</sup> BM-derived monocytes. Hence, it cannot be ruled out that these host-derived macrophages affect the differentiation pathway of the engrafted BM-monocytes in the present study, e.g. by competing with engrafted monocytes for appropriate niches for the further differentiation/maturation in the lamina propria, and/or by further influencing the site-specific microenvironment (e.g. by selective secretion of mediators that affects the differentiation of engrafted monocytes).</p><p>Hence, the presence of a biased population of host-derived macrophages during the synchronized differentiation of monocytes to macrophages need to be considered and the possible implications on the interpretations of the results obtained need to be addressed by the authors. As an example, providing information on the relative distribution and frequencies of these CD45.2<sup>+</sup> CD11c -/lo CD11b<sup>+</sup> lamina propria macrophages in untreated, and engrafted chimeric CD45.1 mice may allow assessing the consequences of the biased depletion of intestinal macrophages using this particular experimental cell-depletion system.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Gross-Vered et al. use a strategy where they ablate all CD11c+ cells and then transfer blood monocytes to repopulate intestinal macrophages. They then seek to define the transcriptional program of differentiation of monocytes into tissue resident macrophages. At 4 days post-transfer (earliest timepoint looked at), the authors find that cells which have extravasated into the tissue no longer transcriptionally resemble monocytes and are more similar to tissue resident macrophages. The authors also identify some changes between small and large intestine. However, resident cell populations examined are likely a mixed population. Others have shown that monocytes do not reconstitute all intestinal macrophage populations so differences with resident cells could be due to altered cell populations. As the ablation strategy depletes all CD11c+ cells (all lamina propria macrophages and all dendritic cells) it is unclear how physiologically relevant this system is. Finally, functional predictions from the data are lacking, making it difficult to assess significance.</p><p>1) What is the resident population? If defined as in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A they are CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD64<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup> Recent publications (Shaw et al., 2018, Schepper et al., 2018) demonstrated that this contains at least 3 macrophage populations: a self-renewing population, one with slow turnover from monocytes and one with rapid turnover from monocytes. The authors should compare with each population that repopulates (slowly and quickly) from monocytes.</p><p>2) The ablation strategy utilized will get rid of all macrophage populations as well as dendritic cells. It is unclear if transferred monocytes can repopulate all macrophage populations. Altered transcriptional profiles could be due to changed proportion of differentiated cells. Similarly, different representation of each population could lead to differences between small and large intestine.</p><p>3) Shaw et al., 2018, Schepper et al., 2018, and Schridde et al., 2017, performed transcriptional profiling of these populations during distinct developmental windows or during repopulation after ablation of individual populations. It is unclear how the data presented in Gross-Vered fits with the findings in these publications. In Discussion the authors note minimal overlap with Schridde and claim that differences in finding (which are not elaborated) are because Schridde et al. did not synchronize precursors, but this could be because the ablation strategy removes and does not repopulate a broad range of cell populations.</p><p>4) A mapping or network analysis would be helpful to understand how these cell populations could be functionally distinct. It is unclear how any described differences would lead to differential outcomes in the tissue. The authors have superficial analysis with listing of GO terms, but these are quite generic.</p><p>5) Unclear what the comparison with monocytes adds. These are functionally very different cells so it is not surprising they have distinct transcriptional profile from tissue resident macrophages.</p><p>6) What do the authors mean that since two of the ileal samples cluster with the colon it means the colon is the default? More data would need to support this statement.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49998.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ notes: the authors’ response after being formally invited to submit a revised submission follows.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) A concern is that the specifics of the k-means clustering with subsequent selectivity of individual transcripts.

Rather this independent approach will remain an important complement. Single cell transcriptome analysis bears its own shortcomings, including the limited transcriptome coverage and the fact that at least droplet-based methods inherently tend to miss certain fragile populations that fail to survive the sorting. Moreover, inference on developmental pathways have with sc transcriptomics to rely on bioinformatic ‘pseudotime analysis’. These approaches can be powerful, as for instance in the elegant RNA velocity method (La Manno, G. et al. Nature 2018), which is based on the distinction of unspliced and spliced mRNAs. However, they clearly require independent confirmation. In contrast, we synchronize the cell development by the ablation/ precursor transfer strategy and thus rely on real time analysis. We believe this remains a critical complement to the sc analyses and will be happy to discuss this further in our manuscript. We however agree that also our approach has its pitfalls, which we openly discussed in our manuscript and will expand on, in response to the constructive reviewer comments we obtained.</p><p>For the above reasons, we ourselves decided not to perform a complementary single cell transcriptome analysis on gut macrophages, but rather to launch a mutagenesis approach to functionally test a number of candidate genes that came up in our study.

Of note, we have obtained similar results with monocyte transfers in a [CX3CR1-DTR &gt; WT] system where all CX3CR1-expressing macrophages are deleted, and include these in the revised manuscript as Figure 2—figure supplement 6.
