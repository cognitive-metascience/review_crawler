Neurite outgrowth is driven in part by microtubule-sliding – the transport of microtubules along each other. We have recently demonstrated that a ‘mitotic’ kinesin-6 (Pavarotti in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) effectively inhibits microtubule-sliding and neurite outgrowth. However, mechanisms regulating Pavarotti itself in interphase cells and specifically in neurite outgrowth are unknown. Here, we use a combination of live imaging and biochemical methods to show that the inhibition of microtubule-sliding by Pavarotti is controlled by phosphorylation. We identify the Ser/Thr NDR kinase Tricornered (Trc) as a Pavarotti-dependent regulator of microtubule sliding in neurons. Further, we show that Trc-mediated phosphorylation of Pavarotti promotes its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. Loss of 14-3-3 prevents Pavarotti from associating with microtubules. Thus, we propose a pathway by which microtubule-sliding can be up- or downregulated in neurons to control neurite outgrowth, and establish parallels between microtubule-sliding in mitosis and post-mitotic neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>neurons</kwd><kwd>kinesin</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>Tricornered kinase</kwd><kwd>Pavarotti</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM052111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gelfand</surname><given-names>Vladimir I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM131752</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gelfand</surname><given-names>Vladimir I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Microtubule-microtubule sliding and neurite outgrowth in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is controlled by a Ser/Thr kinase Tricornered via phosphorylation of a 'mitotic' motor protein Pavarotti.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In order to communicate, neurons must develop an extensive and precisely regulated network of axons and dendrites, collectively called neurites. Studying the mechanisms that form these processes is key to understanding early nervous system development. Neurites are filled with cytoskeletal components including microtubules. Neurons are exceptionally dependent on microtubules for long-range transport of cargo. Also, microtubule organization is essential for powering initial neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Winding et al., 2016</xref>). In order to drive initial neurite outgrowth, microtubules themselves become the cargo and are transported relative to each other by molecular motors – a process known as microtubule sliding. Indeed, in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons, microtubules can be seen pushing the plasma membrane at the tips of growing processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">del Castillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2013</xref>). Previous work from our group has identified the classical kinesin – Kinesin-1 – as the motor responsible for the majority of microtubule sliding in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Winding et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Observation of microtubule sliding in neurons is of particular interest as this process is best described during vast cytoskeletal reorganization in mitosis, rather than in terminally differentiated neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baas, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Del Castillo et al., 2019</xref>). Microtubule sliding is observed in young neurons in culture, but decreases as neurons mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, in addition to promoting neurite extension via microtubule sliding, there must also exist mechanisms to downregulate this process. This prevents overextension of neurites when their intended synaptic targets are correctly reached. Work from our group and others has previously identified the kinesin-6 Pavarotti/MKLP1 as a powerful regulator of microtubule-microtubule sliding. Depletion of Pavarotti/MKLP1 by RNAi leads to axon hyperextension and more motile microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Del Castillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). Identifying a neuronal role for this kinesin was of interest as Kinesin-6 has well-studied roles in mitosis. It exists as a heterotetramer with MgcRacGAP (Tumbleweed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) to form the centralspindlin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basant and Glotzer, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mishima et al., 2002</xref>). This complex bundles microtubules at the bipolar spindle in late anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hutterer et al., 2009</xref>). Here, it can locally activate RhoA and promote assembly of the contractile actin ring at the cortex, and so, cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basant and Glotzer, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Verma and Maresca, 2019</xref>).</p><p>How Pavarotti itself is temporally regulated to inhibit microtubule sliding as neurons mature is unknown. Mitosis exhibits tight temporal regulation. We speculated that similar mechanisms might be at play in regulating Pavarotti activity in neurons with regard to microtubule sliding. One well-studied facet of centralspindlin regulation in regards to mitotic progression is that of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Douglas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guse et al., 2005</xref>). Based on bioinformatics and a literature search, we targeted Ser/Thr kinases known to modify Pavarotti during mitosis and tested their ability to modulate microtubule sliding in interphase cells. One potential kinase was the NDR kinase Tricornered (Trc, LATS in mammals) – shown to phosphorylate MKLP1, the human ortholog of Pavarotti, in vitro at S710 (S745 in Pavarotti) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Okamoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Trc regulates cell cycle exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hergovich et al., 2006</xref>) and also has conserved roles in neurite outgrowth, described in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Emoto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Emoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallegos and Bargmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ultanir et al., 2012</xref>). How this kinase acts warrants further investigation.</p><p>Here, we use <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, neuronal culture and in vivo imaging to show Trc regulates microtubule sliding and dendrite outgrowth in neurons. We validate Pavarotti as a Trc substrate and demonstrate that phosphorylation of Pavarotti at S745 by Trc is necessary for proper control of microtubule sliding. We also show that phosphorylation of Pavarotti affects its subcellular distribution via interaction with 14-3-3 proteins in interphase cells – a mechanism conserved from mitosis. We demonstrate the function of this pathway in regulating development of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tricornered kinase inhibits neurite outgrowth and microtubule sliding</title><p>We have previously demonstrated the requirement of microtubule-microtubule sliding, by kinesin-1, for neurite outgrowth in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Winding et al., 2016</xref>). This sliding is opposed by the mitotic kinesin-6 ‘Pavarotti’/MKLP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Del Castillo et al., 2015</xref>). However, the mechanism by which Pavarotti itself is regulated in this neuronal context is unclear. We hypothesized that Pavarotti may be regulated by phosphorylation, as in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basant and Glotzer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guse et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We targeted kinases known to modify Pavarotti during mitosis (AuroraB, Plk1 and Trc), and tested their ability to modulate neuronal development and microtubule sliding in non-dividing cells. Initially, we measured microtubule sliding using the model system of S2 cells, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell line. We have previously demonstrated that kinesin-1 carries out microtubule-microtubule sliding in these cells and that Pavarotti inhibits this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Del Castillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>). Based on these preliminary experiments, we chose to focus on the NDR kinase Trc. To test the role of Trc, we decreased its levels using dsRNA. To measure microtubule sliding, we expressed a photoconvertible tubulin probe (tdEos-αTubulin84b) in S2 cells. Tubulin was photoconverted in a region of interest, and this specific population of microtubules was imaged by timelapse confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barlan et al., 2013</xref>). Sliding is measured as percentage of photoconverted tubulin outside the original photoconversion zone – see Materials and methods. We found a significant increase in microtubule sliding upon depletion of Trc compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, quantified in B, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). We also carried out sliding experiments in S2 cells to ensure this effect was specific to Trc depletion and not an off-target effect. To do this, we decreased Trc levels with dsRNA against a non-coding region of Trc, and co-expressed wild-type Trc. The non-coding dsRNA increased microtubule sliding and expression of wild-type Trc rescued this effect. Therefore, the effect is specific to Trc depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, Trc is depleted and Pavarotti levels are unaffected.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The kinase Trc regulates neurite outgrowth and microtubule sliding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example images of timelapse imaging to measure microtubule sliding in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells.

We analyzed primary neuronal cultures from third instar larvae expressing Trc RNAi. Neuron specific expression was achieved by elav gal4 &gt;UAS Trc RNAi. This driver is derived from the elav locus which is expressed post-mitotically, exclusively in neurons and is active throughout development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Robinow and White, 1988</xref>). We found a dramatic increase in total neurite length per cell in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>).

Photoconversion was carried out in a constrained region of the cell (as indicated by the yellow dotted line) and photoconverted signal was imaged over time to determine microtubule sliding rate, in a similar fashion to S2 cells.

We expressed GFP Pavarotti in HEK 293FT cells and performed pull downs with anti-GFP antibody. Western blot analysis of precipitated GFP Pavarotti showed basal phosphorylation at S745. Mutation of Pavarotti Ser745 to Ala eliminated signal with the phospho-specific antibody, confirming the antibody specificity. Importantly, ectopic expression of constitutively active Trc (Trc CA), resulted in a roughly twofold increase in Pavarotti phosphorylated at S745. Therefore, Trc phosphorylates Pavarotti at Ser 745 in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Notably, we confirmed these findings in brain tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). We dissected brains from either control 3rd instar larvae or brains of those expressing Trc RNAi under control of the pan neuronal driver elav Gal4. We immunoprecipitated endogenous Pavarotti from these brains and immunoblotted for phosphorylation of Pavarotti at serine 745. We found that phospho Pavarotti was reduced by around 35% upon Trc depletion when compared to total immunoprecipitated Pavarotti. Therefore, Trc phosphorylates Pavarotti at serine 745 in neurons in vivo and depletion of the kinase leads to a greater pool of unphosphorylated Pavarotti at S745.</p><p>Next, we tested if phosphorylation at S745 was necessary for Pavarotti to inhibit microtubule sliding. We once more carried out sliding assays, this time with a knockdown and rescue approach. Knockdown of Pavarotti by this approach was confirmed by western blot. Expression of WT and S745A GFP Pavarotti was confirmed by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Depletion of Pavarotti with a dsRNA against a non-coding region increased sliding which could be reduced again by expression of wild-type Pavarotti.

In order to visualize microtubule-bound Pavarotti, we extracted S2 cells with Triton X-100 under conditions preserving microtubules (see Materials and methods). This approach removes soluble Pavarotti from the cell. Therefore, we analyzed microtubule area that colocalized with Pavarotti signal. In this way, nuclear Pavarotti is excluded from the analysis. A more detailed description of this analysis and images in individual channels are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>. We found that depletion of Trc led to around a 50% decrease in association of Pavarotti with microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Similar experiments with the phospho-null mutant S745A also show a decrease in association of Pavarotti with microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). Therefore, Pavarotti in its unphosphorylated state has lower affinity for microtubules. Under these conditions, microtubule sliding is permitted.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Inhibition of microtubule sliding by pavarotti requires interaction with 14-3-3 proteins</title><p>Our data so far show a role for phospho-regulation of Pavarotti in microtubule sliding, beyond its canonical function in cytokinesis. We chose to continue investigating parallels between mitosis and interphase/post-mitotic microtubule sliding, this time testing the involvement of 14-3-3 proteins. These proteins have been shown to form a complex with Pavarotti dependent upon phosphorylation at the identified S745 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Douglas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fesquet et al., 2015</xref>). This association influences microtubule bundling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Douglas et al., 2010</xref>). We chose to further probe this mechanism, both with regard to Pavarotti S745 phosphorylation by Trc and microtubule sliding. Initially, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments from HEK293 FT cells. We over- expressed WT or S745A GFP Pavarotti. We found a robust interaction between WT Pavarotti and endogenous 14-3-3 ξ. Mutation of S745 to alanine, mimicking a non-phosphorylated form of Pavarotti, abrogated the interaction. Co-expression of exogenous Trc with GFP Pavarotti, generating a greater pool of phosphorylated Pavarotti at S745, increases the interaction between Pavarotti and 14-3-3 ξ by roughly 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Therefore, we confirm that phosphorylation of Pavarotti, by Trc, leads to the recruitment of 14-3-3 proteins.</p><p>We next tested if the interaction between Pavarotti and 14-3-3s is necessary for microtubule sliding inhibition by Pavarotti in S2 cells. We depleted <italic>Drosophila</italic> 14-3-3 β and ξ isoforms in S2 cells by dsRNA and overexpressed Pavarotti. Knockdown is demonstrated by western blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. Overexpression of Pavarotti caused a decrease in microtubule sliding. However, when we depleted 14-3-3 levels, we no longer observed this decrease in sliding upon Pavarotti overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, quantified in C, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>). Thus, Pavarotti is not capable of inhibiting microtubule sliding in the absence of 14-3-3 proteins. These data are in good agreement with microtubule sliding assays performed with our S745A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), where a complex between Pavarotti and 14-3-3s does not form.

In order to test this, we measured the dendritic arbor of class IV DA (dendritic arborization) neurons (sensory neurons) in 3rd instar larvae either upon knockdown of Trc, Pavarotti, or both in conjunction. We have previously demonstrated that dendrite outgrowth in these cells is dependent upon microtubule sliding as expression of a sliding-deficient kinesin-1 leads to shorter dendritic arbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Winding et al., 2016</xref>). Class IV neurons were labeled with ppk::tdTomato (membrane localized tdTomato under direct control of the classIV DA neuron specific pickpocket promoter) and pan-neuron specific expression of RNAis was achieved with elav gal4, which is expressed in all peripheral neurons, including the class IV DA neurons, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 1994</xref>). Knockdown of Pavarotti and Trc together was confirmed by western blot as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>. In each case, we observed a roughly 40% increase in total dendrite length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). In the case of Trc, these data are consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Emoto et al., 2004</xref>) where expression was abolished by mutation rather than neuron-specific RNAi. Notably, the effect upon double knockdown was equivalent to that of the single knockdowns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). This supports the hypothesis that Trc and Pavarotti regulate neurite outgrowth in concert.</p><p>As well as total dendritic length, we also calculated the number of branch points per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Trc has been previously shown to increase dendrite branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Emoto et al., 2004</xref>). Our analyses reproduced these findings – Trc RNAi cells had roughly 30% more branch points than controls. Interestingly, Pavarotti depletion had no effect on number of branch points, and depletion of Trc and Pavarotti together mimics the effect of Trc RNAi alone. From these data, we infer that Trc and Pavarotti regulate neurite outgrowth together, but that Trc has another role, independent of Pavarotti phosphorylation, in regulating dendritic branching.</p><p>Taken together, our data demonstrate that Trc regulates microtubule sliding in neurons together with Pavarotti and that this kinase phosphorylates Pavarotti at S745. Pavarotti phosphorylation at S745 is required to brake microtubule sliding and so, correctly tailor neurite extension.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Developing neurons must extend neurites to form a network for correct communication. This outgrowth must be downregulated as the neurites reach their intended targets and form stable synapses. We have previously shown that microtubule-microtubule sliding is required for neurite outgrowth in young neurons and is diminished in mature neurons by the action of <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinesin-6, Pavarotti. However, the processes by which Pavarotti might temporally regulate microtubule sliding were unknown. Here, we report an inhibitory pathway for microtubule sliding. Our previous work has demonstrated roles for ‘mitotic’ processes (microtubule-microtubule sliding) and ‘mitotic’ motors (kinesin-6 Pavarotti) in regulating the neuronal cytoskeleton. In this study, we extended these parallels to identify the NDR kinase Trc (Tricornered) as a required component of the Pavarotti pathway, regulating neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Kinesin-1 slides microtubules along one another to facilitate neurite outgrowth.</title><p>The kinase Trc inhibits this process by phosphorylation of Pavarotti – a part of the centralspindlin complex with tumbleweed.

Therefore, neurite outgrowth is inhibited.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52009-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><sec id="s3-1"><title>Trc is a novel regulator of microtubule sliding</title><p>NDR kinases have well-studied roles in cell division and tissue morphogenesis. The yeast homologue of Trc (Dbf2p) promotes chromosome segregation and mitotic exit. These functions are conserved in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hergovich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tamaskovic et al., 2003</xref>). However, neuronal expression of some NDR kinases has additionally been reported. In neurons, depletion of Trc has been linked to increased outgrowth of both axons and dendrites across multiple taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Emoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallegos and Bargmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ultanir et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zallen et al., 1999</xref>). Our data are in good agreement with these previous reports as we measure an increase in neurite length in vitro and an increase in dendrite length in vivo. Further, our data uncover a mechanism for this increased outgrowth. Depletion of Trc leads to increased microtubule sliding in both S2 cells and in cultured primary neurons. This increased sliding allows microtubules to push at the tips of nascent neurites, providing the force required for their extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">del Castillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, this sliding has been shown to translate into dendrite outgrowth in vivo – expression of a sliding deficient kinesin-1 mutant drastically decreases the dendritic arbors of <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory neurons (Class IV DA neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Winding et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Trc phosphorylates Pavarotti to Brake microtubule sliding</title><p>Similarly to Trc, the kinesin-6 Pavarotti was thoroughly studied with regard to cell division. It is a microtubule cross linker and signaling hub to promote cleavage furrow ingress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basant and Glotzer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Verma and Maresca, 2019</xref>). Moreover, Pavarotti’s ability to localize to the spindle is dependent on its phosphorylation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guse et al., 2005</xref>). Here, we have shown that Pavarotti is a downstream effector of Trc in the sliding inhibition pathway – Trc overexpression could only decrease sliding in the presence of Pavarotti. In agreement with these data, in neurons, depletion of both Pavarotti and Trc together had the same effect as depletion of either protein individually. Using a similar approach, we have also demonstrated that Trc’s ability to regulate microtubule sliding is dependent upon its kinase activity. Knockdown and rescue experiments in S2 cells showed wild type and constitutively active Trc constructs could restore normal sliding levels but, a kinase dead variant was unable to do this. This is supported by data in neurons showing that decrease of Fry protein level increases microtubule sliding. Decreasing Fry decreases Trc kinase activity without affecting protein level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Emoto et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Further we have used a phospho-null mutant to demonstrate that phosphorylation of Pavarotti at the proposed Trc site of Serine 745 is necessary to inhibit sliding. Importantly, we confirm biochemically that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pavarotti is phosphorylated at this site by Trc in neurons. This extends previous reports to show this pathway is conserved between humans and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fesquet et al., 2015</xref>). Our in vitro data suggest that these two proteins act together to regulate sliding in developing cultured neurons. In vivo, we demonstrate that these two proteins work in concert to regulate neuronal development. Depletion of either Trc or Pavarotti leads to increased dendrite length in class IV DA neurons. Depletion of both these proteins simultaneously has no additive effect either with regards to sliding or dendrite outgrowth, therefore these proteins act in a common pathway. Notably, this is the first report of Pavarotti regulating dendrite development in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Previous work has shown Pavarotti prevents axon overgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Del Castillo et al., 2015</xref>) and reports in mammalian systems have suggested roles in both compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Whilst protein translation presents a clear alternative in regulating protein activity, we favor a phosphorylation model. Pavarotti expression is inhibited by Toll-6-FoxO signaling and Toll-6-FoxO mutants have increased microtubule stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McLaughlin et al., 2016</xref>). However, phosphorylation would provide more dynamic method for modulating Pavarotti. Moreover, phosphorylation would provide tighter spatial regulation which could be necessary in inhibiting sliding in primary neurites while secondary processes are still developing. Indeed, examining the subcellular distribution of Pavarotti showed clear differences in microtubule association based on Trc-mediated phosphorylation state. We found Pavarotti localized more robustly to microtubules in the presence of Trc and that the phospho null mutant had a decreased ability to associate with microtubules. Upon association with microtubules, Pavarotti acts as a crosslinker and inhibits microtubule sliding. These observations are consistent with our sliding data – preventing Pavarotti phosphorylation by Trc upregulated microtubule sliding. It is possible that Pavarotti phosphorylation inhibits kinesin-1-mediated microtubule sliding initially, and is subsequently regulated at the protein translational level.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Pavarotti requires 14-3-3 proteins to Brake microtubule sliding in S2 cells</title><p>Extending our hypothesis that mitotic mechanisms regulating Pavarotti may be prevalent in neurons, we chose to investigate the role of 14-3-3s in microtubule sliding. 14-3-3s are conserved acidic proteins which bind phospho-threonine and phospho-serine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cornell and Toyo-oka, 2017</xref>). Interaction and complex formation with phosphorylated proteins to facilitate cytoskeleton remodelling and axon extension has been described multiple times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cornell and Toyo-oka, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Taya et al., 2007</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic> in mitosis, 14-3-3s have been shown to bind to the centralspindlin complex when Zen-4 (the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologue of Pavarotti/MKLP1) is phosphorylated at S710 (equivalent of Pavarotti S745) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Douglas et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we show by co-immunoprecipitation experiments that Trc-mediated phosphorylation at this site promotes formation of a complex between Pavarotti and 14-3-3s, in good agreement with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fesquet et al., 2015</xref>). This complex has previously been proposed to prevent stable microtubule binding in vitro. Interestingly, our data in S2 cells are not in full agreement with in vitro data. Previous studies have proposed phosphorylation by aurora B kinase at S708/S743 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a way to release 14-3-3 binding from centralspindlin. Perhaps, this phosphorylation is differently regulated during mitosis, where the centralspindlin complex must accumulate at microtubule tips, and interphase, where the microtubule cytoskeleton must be stabilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Douglas et al., 2010</xref>). Our data suggest 14-3-3 interaction with Pavarotti promotes stable microtubule association. Considering our data together with previously published work, perhaps this is a facet of microtubule sliding regulation that is differentially controlled between mitosis and interphase. Beyond interphase, the role of 14-3-3 proteins in sliding inhibition and neurite outgrowth warrants further investigation in neurons.</p><p>Here, we present a microtubule-based mechanism for Trc and Pavarotti controlling neurite development and show how the kinase Trc directs Pavarotti intracellular localization. Beyond this, it would be of interest to investigate a concurrent role for actin remodelling in process outgrowth. Pavarotti is a component of the centralspindlin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mishima et al., 2002</xref>). The other component, tumbleweed/MgcRacGAP, gives an axon overextension phenotype upon depletion, like Pavarotti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldstein et al., 2005</xref>) and the expression levels of each are dependent on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Del Castillo et al., 2015</xref>). However, there are no described Trc kinase phosphorylation sites in tumbleweed. Therefore, while our experiments have focussed on Pavarotti phosphorylation, it is likely the downstream effects described here are a result of the centralspindlin complex. MgcRacGAP is a major orchestrator of RhoA signaling via Pebble/RhoGEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basant and Glotzer, 2018</xref>). This RhoGEF promotes formation of the cytokinetic furrow via actin assembly. Further, Trc has been proposed to inhibit Rac activity in a kinase-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Emoto et al., 2004</xref>). It has recently been demonstrated that the centralspindlin complex acts as a signaling hub to spatially and temporally regulate contraction of the actin cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Verma and Maresca, 2019</xref>). Might these signaling pathways be acting in developing neurites to tailor their development in addition to mechanical regulation via microtubule sliding?</p><p>The data presented here raise new questions beyond regulating microtubule sliding regulation. These data along with previous work from our group and others show a role for Pavarotti in controlling both axon and dendrite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Del Castillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). This is consistent with our findings that kinesin-1 mediated microtubule sliding is necessary for proper development of both these compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Winding et al., 2016</xref>). Further, does microtubule sliding play a role in specifying axon formation? A crucial and distinctive feature of axons and dendrites is that of their microtubule polarity – axonal microtubules have a uniform, plus end out microtubule orientation, whereas dendritic microtubules are of mixed polarity or uniformly minus ends out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baas et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stone et al., 2008</xref>). Kinesin-6 has been previously proposed to confer dendritic identity via transport of minus ends distal microtubules into dendrites and away from axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yu et al., 2000</xref>). Does the regulation of microtubule sliding via Pavarotti/kinesin-6 phosphorylation contribute to the microtubule polarity of nascent processes? How might these regulatory processes change over the course of axonal and dendritic development?</p><p>As well as neurite initiation, microtubule sliding occurs during axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). After axon or dendrite severing, in vitro or in vivo, large-scale rearrangements of the microtubule cytoskeleton are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stone et al., 2010</xref>). This is in contrast to in mature neurons where sliding is silenced. In this case, it could be of great interest to exploit our suggested mechanism of Pavarotti phosphorylation. Notably, the kinase Trc may be a promising candidate for chemical inhibition. Would chemical inhibition or silencing of the kinase Trc deplete the pool of phospho-Pav and prolong the time period during which microtubule sliding was upregulated? Could this, in turn, facilitate neurite regeneration after injury? Further work will be required to address any potential for modulating Trc activity in neuronal regeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>w; elav-Gal4 (III)</italic></td><td valign="top">C.

These cells came directly from DGRC and their identity was not subsequently confirmed. Transfections were carried out with Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. dsRNA was added to cells on days 1 and 3 and imaging was carried out on day 5. HEK 293 FT cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma Aldrich) supplemented with Penicillin Streptomycin and 10% FBS at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2.</sub> HEK cells were transfected by Calcium Phosphate precipitation with 5 µg DNA. Cells were confirmed mycoplasma negative by Lonza mycoalert mycoplasma detection kit.</p><p>Primary neuronal cultures were prepared by dissection of brains from 3rd instar larvae and dissociation of tissue using liberase (Roche). Cells were plated on ConA coated glass coverslips and maintained in Schneiders medium supplemented with 20% FBS, 5 µg/ml insulin, 100 µg/ml Pen-Strep, 50 µg/ml Gentamycin and 10 µg/ml Tetracycline. For sliding assays, larvae were cultured at 29°C and imaged 1 hr after plating.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunoprecipitation and western blotting</title><p>Co-Immunoprecipitation from HEK 293 cells was carried out in coIP buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 20 µg/ml Chymostatin, Leupeptin, Pepstatin, 1 mM NaVO<sub>3</sub>). Cells were lysed, debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the soluble fraction was incubated with single chain anti GFP antibody (GFP-binder) (GFP-Trap-M; Chromotek) conjugated to sepharose beads. Samples were washed 3x in lysis buffer and boiled in 5x laemmli buffer prior to loading on 10% acrylamide gels for electrophoresis. For phosphorylation experiments, GFP Pavarotti was enriched by GFP pull down in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, 0.5% Na-Deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1.5 mM NaVO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM PMSF, 20 µg/ml Chymostatin, Leupeptin, Pepstatin, 1 mM NaVO<sub>3</sub>) and samples were processed as for co-immunoprecipitation For phosphorylation experiments from brain lysate, around 50 3rd instar larvae brains were dissected per condition and lysed in RIPA buffer. The soluble fraction was subjected to IP with anti-Pavarotti antibody or rabbit IgG. Protein-G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were blocked in 1% BSA in TBS-T and added to lysates. IPs were washed 3x in RIPA buffer and boiled in 5x laemmli buffer prior to loading on 8% acrylamide gels. To assess efficient knockdown of proteins, S2 cells were lysed directly in sample buffer and boiled. After electrophoresis, transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane was carried out and blocking was performed in 4% milk in PBS-T. For phospho- specific antibody, blocking was carried out with 3% BSA in TBS-T. Western blotting was performed using advansta western bright quantum substrate and Licor Imagequant system. For quantification of western blots, Licor Image Studio software was used. In each case, phosphorylated Pavarotti levels were compared to total Pavarotti levels. Then this ratio was normalized to that of the control condition. In this way, any difference in immunoprecipitated Pavarotti levels is accounted for between the two conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fixed imaging</title><p>For subcellular localization analysis of Pavarotti, S2 cells were plated on ConA coated coverslips and allowed to attach.

Images were acquired with an Evolve EMCCD or Prime 95B (Photometrics) using Nikon NIS-Elements software (AR 4.00.07 64-bit). S2 cells expressing tdEOS-tagged Tubulin were plated in Xpress with 2.5 µM cytoD and 40 nM taxol. For photoconversion of tdEOS-tagged Tubulin in sliding assays, we applied 405 nm light from a light-emitting diode light source (89 North Heliophor) for 5 s. The 405 nm light was constrained to a small circle with an adjustable diaphragm, therefore only a region of interest within the cell was photoconverted. After photoconversion, images were collected every minute for &gt; 10 min.</p><p>To image <italic>Drosophila</italic> DA neurons, larvae were immobilized between a slide and a coverslip. A Nikon Eclipse U200 inverted microscope with a Yokogawa CSU10 spinning disk confocal head, 20×/0.75 N.A. objective was used. Images were acquired with an Evolve EMCCD (Photometrics) using Nikon NIS-Elements software (AR 4.00.07 64-bit). Images were analyzed in FIJI using the ‘tubeness’ and ‘skeletonize’ plugins. Branch point analysis was carried out in Nikon NIS-Elements software (AR 5.200 64-bit) using the detect branches function in the general analysis three module.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Microtubule sliding analysis</title><p>Analysis was carried out as previously described. Briefly, time-lapse movies of photoconverted microtubules were bleach-corrected and thresholded and the initial photoconverted zone was identified. The number of pixels corresponding to MTs was measured in total or outside the initial zone for each frame. The motile fraction (defined as MTs<sup>outside_initial_zone</sup>/MTs<sup>total</sup>) was plotted against time and the slope of the linear portion was calculated to represent microtubule sliding rate. For analysis of microtubule sliding in neurons, images were bleach corrected and denoised using despeckle in FIJI. Movies were then processed using the WEKA trainable segmenter in Fiji to generate probability maps of photoconverted microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arganda-Carreras et al., 2017</xref>). Probability maps were thresholded and analyzed in the same way as S2 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis and data presentation</title><p>Data are presented as mean ± standard error. Statistical analysis was carried out in GraphPad. Data were analyzed using student’s T-test or one-way ANOVA with Sidak’s post-hoc correction for multiple comparisons. Data are collected from at least three replicates. Statistical significance is presented as *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001.

proper communication networks and limited in mature neurons once neurites have reached their appropriate targets. The study here uses a combination of cell-based systems including <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, primary neuronal cultures, and sensory neurons to investigate microtubule-based mechanisms for neurite outgrowth. In doing so, they uncover a new mechanism for how neuronal processes are limited to ensure proper development of the nervous system.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Ser/Thr kinase Trc controls neurite outgrowth by modulating microtubule-microtubule sliding&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

In the present study, the authors describe a regulatory pathway that leads to inhibition of kinesin-1-dependent microtubule sliding, thereby limiting the extension of neuronal processes. The principle finding is that the Ser/Thr kinase Trc blocks microtubule sliding by promoting the activity of Pavarotti. The authors demonstrate that Trc phosphorylates Pavarotti on S745, and this in turn promotes a biochemical interaction between Pavarotti and 14-3-3 proteins. They conclude that this complex formation leads to microtubule binding and inhibition of microtubule sliding. The authors make use of a microtubule sliding assay in cultured cells, biochemistry, and an in vivo dendrite morphology assay to support their findings. The evidence that Trc regulates microtubule sliding and neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons is strong, and the authors show that loss of either Pav or Trc results in an increase in dendrite length in Class IV sensory neurons. However, much of the study, including the experiments arguing that the phosphorylation state of Pav is important, that Trc is the relevant kinase, and that 14-3-3 is important for this pathway, is done in cultured S2 cells. It is not clear if microtubule dynamics in these cells are regulated comparably to those in developing neurons, thus it will be important for the authors to demonstrate that the results obtained in S2 cells regarding Trc phosphorylation of Pav and the role of 14-3-3 in the regulatory pathway are recapitulated in an appropriate neuronal cell type.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data that Trc phosphorylates Pav and promotes its ability to limit sliding in S2 cells are convincing. However, there is little evidence that this phosphorylation is relevant in neurons. To address the proposed role of Trc as a neuronal regulator of Pav-mediated microtubule braking, the authors should carry out the same experiments presented in Figures 2 and 3 in neurons to show that Pav is phosphorylated on S745, that the kinase activity of Trc is important for its function, and that the Pav S745A mutant does not block sliding. In del Castillo et al., 2015, the authors addressed Pav function in third instar motor axons, which may be a good option for addressing the role of Trc in Pav regulation in a relevant cell type.</p><p>2) Contrary to the authors' claim that 14-3-3 is a key regulator of Pav's ability to regulate sliding, 14-3-3 knockdown in S2 cells has no sliding phenotype on its own. The authors only show that knockdown of 14-3-3 impedes the ability of Pav overexpression to inhibit sliding. In light of this, they may consider revising their model of 14-3-3 function.</p><p>3) Related to the above point, is Pavarotti phosphorylated and bound to 14-3-3 in neurons? In the paper, the authors demonstrate that Pavarotti is phosphorylated on S745 in HEK293T cells (and more so when Trc is co-expressed). Similarly, evidence to support a functional interaction between Pavarotti and 14-3-3 comes from experiments performed in non-neuronal cells. The authors should demonstrate that Pavarotti is phosphorylated and interacts with 14-3-3 in neurons.</p><p>4) The authors propose in their model that 14-3-3 binding to the phospho-epitope promotes the association of Pavarotti with microtubules and its crosslinking and braking activity. However, Douglas et al., 2010, published that 14-3-3 binding to the S710 residue in human kinesin-6 reduced the MT binding and bundling activity of centralspindlin. The authors should account for this discrepancy in the text.</p><p>5) Figure 5: The authors show that Pav or Trc knockdown leads to an increase in the total length of dendrites of Class IV neurons. It has been previously reported that Trc knockdown increases branching (Emoto et al., 2004). It is unclear why increased MT sliding would cause an increase in branching as opposed to dendrite growth. Do the authors observe an increase in branching after Pav knockdown? In the images presented, the effect of Pav depletion looks qualitatively different than the effect of Trc depletion; Pavarotti depletion does appear by eye to produce more secondary and tertiary branches than Trc depletion. Is this the case? These parameters should be quantified and discussed.</p><p>6) Figure 5: If possible, these analyses should be carried out at an earlier time point to demonstrate that this phenotype is the result of a defect in initial dendrite outgrowth.</p><p>7) In Figure 1G (and Video 2), there does not appear to be a clear difference in sliding between the two conditions from the images/video. This should be addressed.</p><p>8) There are a number of instances (listed below) throughout the manuscript where knockdown efficiencies and expression levels should be assessed: a) Furry knockdown in Figure 2; b) Pav depletion and expression experiments in Figure 3C, D; c) PavGFP over-expression in Figure 4; d) Knockdown efficiencies of Trc and Pav in the DA neurons in Figure 5. This is a beautiful cell type and assay but it needs to be accompanied by some assessment (IF, WB, RT-qPCR) that the RNAi is working in these cells.</p><p>9) The measurements of the% microtubule area shown in Figures 3 and 4 are unclear, especially as presented as a single merged image. Please show each individual channel and highlight the area that you designate as &quot;Pav positive&quot;. Pav is nuclear in interphase and, while the images are difficult to assess, it appears that the nuclear signal is evident in some of them. How is this taken into account when evaluating the area that is measured?</p><p>10) The authors reference a constitutively-active Trc in the subsection “Trc kinase activity is necessary to control microtubule sliding”, and refer in to data showing that this construct reduces sliding comparably to WT Trc; however, these data are not presented in Figure 2.</p><p>11) The co-IPs in Figure 4A should be quantified. In addition, the experiment shown in 4A is not currently described in sufficient detail so that readers can understand exactly what was done. Please provide a more detailed explanation.</p><p>12) Very little is mentioned in the manuscript about the other component of centralspindlin – MgcRacGAP. The authors should clarify if they believe this mechanism is being mediated by the centralspindlin complex. Part of the source of the confusion also stems from the model figure that appears to show a tetramer of Pavarotti – is that the intention or is this supposed to be a Pavarotti dimer and a Tumbleweed dimer? If it is centralspindlin then the complex should be labeled appropriately and the schematic should be changed accordingly (at least different colors for the constituents).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Ser/Thr kinase Trc controls neurite outgrowth by modulating microtubule-microtubule sliding&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We agree with the reviewers’ overall assessment that our work relied heavily on data from cultured S2 cells. Therefore, as suggested by the reviewers, we have expanded our data to include the role of Trc in neurons. We show that it is not just the Trc kinase expression level that regulates sliding, but more specifically, Trc kinase activity is required to regulate microtubule sliding (Figure 2E, F). We also show that, related to the development of Class IV sensory neuron dendrites (Figure 5C, D), microtubule sliding is regulated by Pavarotti and Trc together (Figure 5A, B). These data support our hypothesis that microtubule sliding is in S2 cells and developing neurons are regulated by similar mechanisms. Significantly, we now include biochemistry from <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae brain to demonstrate Trc dependent Pavarotti phosphorylation (Figure 3J). In addition, we greatly expand on our demonstration of relevant knockdown throughout the manuscript. For an itemized description of our revisions, please see below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data that Trc phosphorylates Pav and promotes its ability to limit sliding in S2 cells are convincing.

We have now expanded our experiments in neurons beyond demonstrating that Trc protein level regulates sliding in these cells. To address the requirement for Trc kinase activity to inhibit microtubule sliding (as in Figure 2), we have taken advantage of the fact that Trc kinase activity requires the presence of another protein – Furry (Fry). We have carried out sliding experiments in cultured neurons upon knockdown of Furry/Fry, as well as S2 cells. The results of these experiments are now shown in Figure 2E and F. We demonstrated that Fry knockdown in both S2 cells and in neurons increases microtubule sliding. The control experiments demonstrate that knock-down of Fry does not change Trc protein level. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the kinase activity of Trc is required to regulate sliding in both S2 cells and in neurons.</p><p>We have now also demonstrated that Trc and Pavarotti act together to regulate microtubule sliding in neurons, extending our experiments in Figure 3A. Unfortunately, the experiment that the reviewer suggested in 3<sup>rd</sup> instar motor axons did not give us an obvious phenotype, most likely because Trc is a kinase, so a much higher level of knock-down is required for observing an effect. Instead, we used a different approach. We show in the updated Figure 5A that knockdown of both of these proteins in neurons increases microtubule sliding to similar degree to each RNAi individually. Together with in vivoneurite outgrowth data in Figure 5C and D, these data support the conclusion that Trc and Pavarotti tailor neurite outgrowth together, by controlling microtubule sliding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Contrary to the authors' claim that 14-3-3 is a key regulator of Pav's ability to regulate sliding, 14-3-3 knockdown in S2 cells has no sliding phenotype on its own.

Therefore, we have amended our model to reflect the fact 14-3-3 RNAi only has a phenotype upon Pavarotti overexpression. Please see the revised summary figure in the Discussion section. We also expand our Discussion with regards to these data and now postulate that, while 14-3-3 appears to be a regulator of microtubule sliding, there appears to be some divergence between mitotic mechanisms and interphase mechanisms. Please see the first paragraph of the subsection “Pavarotti requires 14-3-3 proteins to brake microtubule sliding in S2 cells”, in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to the above point, is Pavarotti phosphorylated and bound to 14-3-3 in neurons?

Please see Figure 3J. To address this, we Immunoprecipitated Pavarotti from control brains of <italic>Drosophila</italic> 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae or brains expressing Trc RNAi in neurons. We carried out western blotting and showed that the phospho signal at S745 is decreased when Trc is depleted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors propose in their model that 14-3-3 binding to the phospho-epitope promotes the association of Pavarotti with microtubules and its crosslinking and braking activity.

These data are now presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 1. Interestingly, we find that Trc depletion either alone or in combination with Pav depletion increases number of dendritic branch points (consistent with previous reports). However, depletion of Pavarotti alone gives values similar to those for control cells. These data suggest that branching of the dendritic arbor is independent of microtubule sliding and also suggest that another substrate of Trc might be in charge of controlling the branching process. Therefore, we hypothesize from these data that Trc regulates dendrite outgrowth and dendrite branching via different mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 5: If possible, these analyses should be carried out at an earlier time point to demonstrate that this phenotype is the result of a defect in initial dendrite outgrowth.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted this analysis at a late embryonic stage when DA neurons can be observed but their development has not progressed very far.
