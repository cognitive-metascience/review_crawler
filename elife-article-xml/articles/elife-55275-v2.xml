a transcription-based feedback loop in which CLOCK:BMAL1 drives transcription of its repressors (PER1/2, CRY1/2), which ultimately interact with CLOCK:BMAL1 to close the feedback loop with ~24 hr periodicity. Here we pinpoint a key difference between CRY1 and CRY2 that underlies their differential strengths as transcriptional repressors. Both cryptochromes bind the BMAL1 transactivation domain similarly to sequester it from coactivators and repress CLOCK:BMAL1 activity. However, we find that CRY1 is recruited with much higher affinity to the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1, allowing it to serve as a stronger repressor that lengthens circadian period. We discovered a dynamic serine-rich loop adjacent to the secondary pocket in the photolyase homology region (PHR) domain that regulates differential binding of cryptochromes to the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1. Notably, binding of the co-repressor PER2 remodels the serine loop of CRY2, making it more CRY1-like and enhancing its affinity for CLOCK:BMAL1.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The circadian clock links our behavior and physiology to the daily light-dark cycle, providing a timekeeping system that ensures cellular processes are performed at an optimal time of day. At the cellular level, circadian rhythms are driven by a set of interlocked transcription-based feedback loops that take ~24 hr to complete. The basic helix-loop-helix PER-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) domain-containing transcription factor CLOCK:BMAL1 forms the positive component of the core feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gekakis et al., 1998</xref>). Several CLOCK:BMAL1 target genes (<italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>Cry2</italic>) constitute the repressive components that close the core feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takahashi, 2017</xref>). PER and CRY proteins interact with each other to form a large complex with the kinase CK1δ and enter the nucleus after a delay to bind directly to CLOCK:BMAL1 and inhibit its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aryal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). An additional feedback loop comprising the ROR and REV-ERB nuclear receptors controls the rhythmic expression of a subset of genes, including <italic>Bmal1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Preitner et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Cryptochromes are essential for circadian rhythms, as <italic>Cry1<sup>–/–</sup>; Cry2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice are arrhythmic in constant darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Horst et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vitaterna et al., 1999</xref>). Despite their high sequence and structural similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Michael et al., 2017b</xref>), CRY1 and CRY2 appear to have distinct roles in the molecular circadian clock because <italic>Cry1<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice have a short period, while <italic>Cry2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice have a long period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Horst et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vitaterna et al., 1999</xref>). Using a genetic reconstitution assay of <italic>Cry1<sup>–/–</sup>; Cry2<sup>–/–</sup>; Per2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> fibroblasts, we previously showed that tuning CRY1 affinity for CLOCK:BMAL1 can control circadian period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gustafson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2015</xref>); notably, the period lengthens when CRY1 binds more tightly to CLOCK:BMAL1, suggesting that the strength of CRY repression contributes to period determination. Consistent with this, CRY1 is a stronger repressor of CLOCK:BMAL1 than CRY2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Griffin et al., 1999</xref>) and a recently discovered allele of CRY1 that enhances its repressive function also lengthens circadian period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Patke et al., 2017</xref>) in humans, providing a conceptual framework to understand why the presence of one CRY or the other influences circadian period.</p><p>Another notable difference between the two cryptochromes is the delay in expression of <italic>Cry1</italic> with respect to <italic>Cry2</italic> and the <italic>Per</italic> genes in the core feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ukai-Tadenuma et al., 2011</xref>). The delayed expression of CRY1 is consistent with its recruitment to DNA-bound CLOCK:BMAL1 in two distinct phases: a minor peak at circadian time (CT) 16–20 as part of the large PER-CRY repressive complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aryal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2001</xref>), and a major peak later at CT0-4 that is independent of CRY2 and the PER proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koike et al., 2012</xref>). However, the delayed timing of CRY1 expression does not account for its differential regulation of circadian period, because expressing <italic>Cry2</italic> from a minimal <italic>Cry1</italic> promoter that recapitulates this delay in <italic>Cry1<sup>–/–</sup>; Cry2<sup>–/–</sup>; Per2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> fibroblasts or the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) ex vivo still drives CRY2-like short periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Edwards et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosensweig et al., 2018</xref>). These data demonstrate that the differences between CRY1 and CRY2 that influence circadian period are encoded by their protein structure and/or dynamics to influence their repressive function.</p><p>What structural features of CRY1 and CRY2 might lead to differential functions in the circadian clock? Both cryptochromes are defined by a highly conserved photolyase homology region (PHR) domain and divergent C-terminal tails that are intrinsically disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Partch et al., 2005</xref>). Deletion or post-translational modification of the unstructured tails can modulate rhythm amplitude and period length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu and Zhang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Patke et al., 2017</xref>), but the PHR domain is required to generate circadian rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khan et al., 2012</xref>). We recently showed that CRY1 interacts directly with both CLOCK and BMAL1 through two distinct regions on its PHR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Michael et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The CC helix binds directly to the transactivation domain (TAD) of BMAL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), sequestering it from coactivators to directly repress CLOCK:BMAL1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Czarna et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). However, repression also relies on the recruitment of CRY1 to the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1 via the CLOCK PAS-B domain, which docks into the evolutionarily conserved secondary pocket on the CRY1 PHR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Michael et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CRY1 and CRY2 bind similarly to the BMAL1 transactivation domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Crystal structure of the CRY1 PHR domain (PDB: 5T5X) highlighting the CC helix (BMAL1/2 TAD binding interface (blue)) and the secondary pocket (CLOCK PAS-B binding interface (green)).

We found that changes in the structure and dynamics of the serine loop, located adjacent to the secondary pocket, allow CRY1 to bind the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1 with significantly higher affinity than CRY2. Moreover, substitutions in the serine loop and secondary pocket between CRY1 and CRY2 that influence circadian period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosensweig et al., 2018</xref>) are sufficient to modulate affinity of the CRY PHR domain for CLOCK:BMAL1. Finally, we found that the CRY-binding domain (CBD) of PER2 differentially remodels the structure of the serine loop of CRY1 and CRY2 to help equalize their affinity for the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1. These data provide a biochemical rationale linking the repressive function of CRY2 to the PER proteins, as well as explaining how CRY1 can act as a repressor of CLOCK:BMAL1 in the presence or absence of PER proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CRY1 and CRY2 bind similarly to the transactivation domain of BMAL1</title><p>To begin to understand how CRY1 and CRY2 differ as circadian repressors, we first compared their affinity for the BMAL1 TAD, as sequestration of the TAD from coactivators represents a direct mechanism by which cryptochromes inhibit transcriptional activation by CLOCK:BMAL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gustafson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2015</xref>).

Despite the intimate association of PER2 with the BMAL-binding site on CRY1 and CRY2, we found that both CRY:PER2 complexes bound the TAD similarly to the free CRYs, while the PER2 CBD displayed negligible affinity for the TAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Comparing the Root Mean Square Fluctuations (RMSF) for wild type and mutCRY2 in MD simulations revealed that flexibility of the serine loop and secondary pocket increased in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that minor local perturbations to the serine loop could substantially impact CRY function. Moreover, reconstitution of <italic>Cry1<sup>–/–</sup>; Cry2<sup>–/–</sup>; Per2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> cells with a G43A/N46S CRY1 mutant (swapping CRY2 residues at this site into CRY1) lead to a significantly shorter period than with wild-type CRY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosensweig et al., 2018</xref>), consistent with a more CRY2-like, weaker repressor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirota et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To further explore the difference in the conformational ensemble of CRY1 and CRY2, we calculated the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the phi, psi, and chi1 dihedral angle distribution for all of the residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). KL divergence is used to quantitatively describe the differences in the conformational states of residues in two equilibrium ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McClendon et al., 2012</xref>). A high KL divergence for a particular residue signifies that its conformational state shows considerable difference between the two ensembles in torsional space. Several residues throughout the CRY1 and CRY2 PHR domains show high KL divergence; in particular, the residues with the highest divergence concentrate in and around the secondary pocket, corresponding to CRY1 residues W52, Q79, D82, Y100, R127, and W390 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, the comparison of conformational ensembles for wild-type CRY2 and the A61G/N64S CRY1-swapped CRY2 mutant reveals high divergence at the secondary pocket and, to a lesser extent, throughout the rest of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggest that the effect of substitutions in the secondary pocket that alter its rigidity may extend beyond the secondary pocket to influence the overall dynamical ensemble of CRY PHR domains.</p><p>Based on these data, alterations in the structure and dynamics of the serine loop may influence access to the secondary pocket that is located immediately adjacent to this loop. To quantify how variations in the serine loop of CRY1/CRY2 alter the conformational landscape of the secondary pocket, we calculated the volume of the pocket and the distance between center of mass of residue S62 and F123 in CRY2, located on the opposite sides of the pocket (corresponding to S44 and F105 in CRY1), for each of the independent MD trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This analysis revealed an approximately linear relationship between the interatomic distance of the loops that line the secondary pocket and its volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The overall distribution for CRY2 measurements clustered toward the upper right region of the plot, demonstrating that CRY2 samples a larger pocket volume (1215 ± 275 Å<sup>3</sup>) as well as having larger opening to the pocket. The distribution of CRY1 measurements revealed a larger variation in distance across the pocket, likely due to the flexibility of the serine loop, but consistently had a smaller pocket volume (876 ± 217 Å<sup>3</sup>, p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon ranksum test) compared to CRY2. As predicted from its enhanced flexibility, the in silico mutant of the CRY2 serine loop (i.e., A61G/N64S in mutCRY2) resulted in a significant change in its overall distribution towards a smaller volume of the secondary pocket (868 ± 230 Å<sup>3</sup>, p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon ranksum test) and shorter distances across the pocket, much like we found for CRY1.</p><p>We determined the free energy landscape (FEL) of the PHR domains using the same volumes and distances as reaction coordinates to show that the low energy basin for CRY1 corresponds to the smaller volume and shorter distances as compared to the CRY2 FEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the case of the CRY1-like mutCRY2, the FEL shows a striking similarity to CRY1, with an expanded low energy basin and minimum corresponding to lower values of volume and distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We further compared the volume and distances for the frames corresponding to the energy minimum in each FEL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Here again, the values corresponding to CRY1 and mutCRY2 showed a distinct similarity, whereas CRY2 had a higher value for both volume and distance. These observations suggest that decreasing the flexibility of the serine loop correlates with an increased volume of the secondary pocket, which could play a role in the decreased affinity of CRY2 for the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1.</p><p>We sought to experimentally test if mutations on the serine loop and around the secondary pocket could alter the affinity of CRY2 for the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1. We first utilized the CRY2 7M mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosensweig et al., 2018</xref>), which incorporates seven mutations in and around the serine loop and the secondary pocket to swap CRY2 residues with their corresponding residues from CRY1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We chose this mutant to characterize biochemically because genetic reconstitution of circadian rhythms in <italic>Cry1<sup>–/–</sup>; Cry2<sup>–/–</sup>; Per2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> cells demonstrated that CRY2 7M was sufficient to largely recapitulate a CRY1-like repression phenotype and period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosensweig et al., 2018</xref>). In line with this cell-based observation, we found that the CRY2 7M mutant had a 10-fold enhancement in affinity for the CLOCK:BMAL PAS domain core, as determined by BLI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). To further establish the contribution of substitutions on serine loop to CLOCK:BMAL1 binding, we purified the CRY2 2M mutant corresponding to mutCRY2 (A61G/N64S) and measured its affinity for the CLOCK:BMAL1 PAS domain core. As predicted by our MD simulations, we found that simply swapping two residues on the serine loop increased CRY affinity for CLOCK:BMAL1 by ~4 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>).</p><p>To characterize interactions at the serine loop that might be responsible for its conformational diversity, we measured the occurrence of hydrogen bonds formed by loop residues during the MD simulations. A comparison of frequently occurring hydrogen bonds among apo CRY1, CRY2 and mutCRY2 revealed that the serine loop in CRY2 is stabilized primarily by hydrogen bonds <italic>within</italic> the loop residues, as might be expected from the short helical structure present in the starting model. On the other hand, we observed fewer hydrogen bonds within the loop in CRY1 and mutCRY2 trajectories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that N64 forms hydrogen bonds with D400 and E401 in mutCRY2 that are not frequently seen in the CRY2 simulations. Interestingly, in its native environment, N46 of CRY1 also forms hydrogen bonds with its corresponding residues at these positions (E382 and E383) with high frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Collectively, these results establish that the A61G/N64S substitutions make the CRY2 serine loop behave more like CRY1 and significantly alter its ability to bind CLOCK:BMAL1, helping to differentiate the roles of CRY1 and CRY2 as circadian repressors in the mammalian circadian clock.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The CRY1 serine loop is disordered in the CRY1 PHR:PER2 CBD complex</title><p>In addition to binding near the BMAL1 TAD-binding site at the CC helix of CRY1 and CRY2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), the PER2 CBD also wraps around the distal side of the PHR domain to come into close contact with the serine loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nangle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schmalen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

While the CLOCK PAS-B domain was more flexible relative to the CRY1 PHR domain, the overall position of CLOCK PAS-B in Cluster 1 agrees much better with the experimental data than Cluster 2. Therefore, the integration of computational docking and experimental data support a model of PER2 CBD:CRY1 PHR:CLOCK PAS-B complex.</p><p>We previously showed that mutation of W362 to alanine in the HI loop of CLOCK PAS-B reduced binding of the CRY1 PHR and significantly decreased CRY1 repression of CLOCK:BMAL1 in 293 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Michael et al., 2017a</xref>). To examine how this mutation quantitatively influences binding of CLOCK to CRY1 and CRY2, we performed BLI-based binding studies using the CLOCK:BMAL1 PAS domain core harboring the W362A CLOCK mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

As described above, the beginning of the serine loop in the apo CRY2 PHR domain is structured with a short ɑ-helix and a stable but extended loop at the end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nangle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xing et al., 2013</xref>). However, in the CRY2 PHR: PER2 CBD complex, the end of the serine loop is stabilized in an alternate position by multiple hydrogen bonds between S64 on CRY2 and A1135 and D1136 of the PER2 CBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This interaction moves S64 of CRY2 out of the secondary pocket by ~9 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), largely mimicking the PER2-dependent interaction and subsequent loop orientation we observed with S45 on CRY1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, the PER2 CBD remodels the N-terminus of the serine loop, causing an unfolding of the short ɑ-helix and a translation of A61 by ~5 Å towards the secondary pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Therefore, the addition of PER2 CBD causes the serine loops of CRY1 and CRY2 to take on a largely similar conformation, with the loop in CRY1 becoming more structured and the loop in CRY2 becoming less structured.</p><p>Based on the rearrangement of the CRY2 serine loop induced by PER2, we anticipated that PER2 would enhance affinity of CRY2 for the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1.</p><p>We used BLI binding assays to assess binding of a CRY2:PER2 CBD complex to the immobilized PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1 and observed an increase in affinity of CRY2 for CLOCK:BMAL1 by 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). While this is a modest increase in affinity, these data are consistent with the observation that addition of PER2 enhances co-immunoprecipitation of CLOCK:BMAL1 by CRY2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosensweig et al., 2018</xref>). We also probed for a direct interaction of the PER2 CBD with the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1 by BLI, but observed no detectable binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), demonstrating that the effect of PER2 CBD is likely due to regulation of the CRY serine loop and not a via direct interaction with CLOCK:BMAL1. These results provide a mechanistic foundation for the model where formation of a complex with PER2 makes CRY2 a stronger repressor by enhancing its affinity for CLOCK:BMAL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosensweig et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Based on the structural and computational analyses presented thus far, we attribute this tighter binding to CLOCK:BMAL1 to the loss of helical structure in the serine loop observed when CRY2 is bound to the PER2 CBD. Therefore, the CRY2 7M mutant, which substitutes CRY1 residues into the serine loop and secondary pocket, might not be expected to exhibit a gain in affinity for CLOCK:BMAL1 in the presence of the PER2 CBD. To test this prediction, we collected BLI binding data on the CRY2 7M PHR domain mutant in the presence of PER2 CBD. In line with our model, the CRY2 7M:PER2 CBD complex behaved more like CRY1 and exhibited a similar drop in affinity for CLOCK:BMAL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Altogether, our study establishes that the PER2 CBD tunes affinity of the CRY PHR domains for the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1 through differential interactions at the serine loop. Notably, when CRY1 or CRY2 are associated with the co-repressor PER2, their affinity for CLOCK:BMAL1 is at its most similar (within a ~ 3 fold difference) compared to the 20-fold difference that we observe with the two proteins in the absence of the PER2 CBD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Since the identification of core mammalian clock proteins nearly two decades ago, numerous studies have revealed how they work at the network level to generate the transcriptional feedback loop that confers circadian timekeeping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takahashi, 2017</xref>). However, we still lack a mechanistic understanding of how most clock proteins interact with and/or regulate one another to fulfill their important roles as dedicated molecular ‘cogs’ in the circadian clock. In this study, we integrated biochemistry, structural biology, and computational methods to determine how the association of CLOCK:BMAL1 with CRY1 or CRY2 is differentially regulated by dynamics at the serine loop on their respective PHR domains. In contrast to CRY2, CRY1 has a flexible serine loop adjacent to its secondary pocket on the PHR domain that confers tight binding to the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1. Substitutions to CRY1 residues at serine loop and/or secondary pocket in CRY2 are sufficient to enhance its association with the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1, in line with a previous study showing that these mutants largely recapitulated isoform-dependent changes in circadian period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosensweig et al., 2018</xref>). Remarkably, we found that binding of the PER2 CBD remodels the ordered serine loop of CRY2 to enhance its affinity for CLOCK:BMAL1, conferring CRY1-like affinity and dynamics to the serine loop. Therefore, small changes in the structure and dynamics of the serine loop with and without PER2 allow cryptochromes to fine-tune their repressive power by controlling how tightly they bind to CLOCK:BMAL1.</p><p>Our data suggest that the differential effect of the PER2 CBD on CRY PHR binding to CLOCK:BMAL1 allows it to serve as a molecular equalizer—PER2 compensates for poorer binding by CRY2 by modestly enhancing its affinity for the transcription factor, while at the same time reducing CRY1 binding to bring the overall affinities of the two cryptochromes for the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1 to similar levels. This suggests that the actions of CRY1 and CRY2 within the heteromultimeric PER-CRY repressive complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aryal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2001</xref>) may be largely similar. The apparent dependency of CRY2 on PER1/2, the PER isoforms that possess a functional CRY-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyazaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yagita et al., 2002</xref>), is consistent with the expression of CRY2 that occurs in phase with the PER proteins. By contrast, the peak expression of CRY1 is delayed by several hours from the other repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ukai-Tadenuma et al., 2011</xref>). The same temporal profiles are observed in the genome-wide mapping of their DNA occupancy with CLOCK:BMAL1, revealing two distinct waves of repressive complexes: ‘early’ complexes that contain PER1/2 proteins, their associated kinase CK1δ, CRY2, and some CRY1 with a variety of non-stoichiometrically associated epigenetic regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aryal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2015</xref>), and a ‘late’ complex consisting of CRY1 bound to CLOCK:BMAL1 in the apparent absence of PER proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koike et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Partch et al., 2014</xref>). The 20-fold increase in affinity of CRY1 that we observed for the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1 relative to CRY2 therefore likely plays a critical role in its ability to participate in the PER-free ‘late’ complex, and may also give rise to the CRY1-selective extension of the repression phase observed in the <italic>Fbxl3<sup>Afh</sup></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anand et al., 2013</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that a proper balance of the biochemically distinct PER-containing early and PER-free late repressive complexes work together to generate the circadian period of ~24 hr.</p><p>Understanding precisely why the more dynamic serine loop helps CRY1 bind to the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1 awaits determination of a higher resolution structure of the complex. Like many other transcription factors, CLOCK:BMAL1 is a ‘malleable machine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuxreiter et al., 2008</xref>) and its dynamic nature presents challenges for structure determination, particularly its flexibly tethered, modular PAS domains and disordered regions that play important functional roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Michael et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). From the perspective of cryptochromes, the dynamic nature of the serine loop may be associated with allosteric changes throughout the PHR domain and evolution of transcriptional repressor function. Notably, the secondary pocket in photoreceptive cryptochromes from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brautigam et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Levy et al., 2013</xref>), as well as the evolutionarily-related DNA repair enzyme photolyase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hitomi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Park et al., 1995</xref>) is considerably smaller in volume, where it binds to small molecule cofactors that facilitate light harvesting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sancar, 2003</xref>). The ability of repressor-type cryptochromes to interact with CLOCK PAS-B appears to be deeply rooted in evolution of the metazoan circadian clock, because vertebrate-like cryptochromes that act as transcriptional repressors in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhu et al., 2005</xref>) like the monarch butterfly also depend to the same extent on multivalent interactions with CLOCK PAS-B and the BMAL1 TAD as they do in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sato et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The BMAL1 TAD is the primary driver of transcriptional activation by CLOCK:BMAL1 in mammalian and insect systems with repressor-type cryptochromes, as truncation of the TAD decimates CLOCK:BMAL1 activity and leads to arrhythmicity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kiyohara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Sequestration of the TAD by repressor-type cryptochromes allows them to compete with coactivators at a highly conserved and overlapping binding motif in the TAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gustafson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Strikingly, we did not observe differential binding to the BMAL1 TAD by CRY1 or CRY2, either in the absence or presence of the PER2 CBD. However, it remains to be seen if other regions in the disordered BMAL1 C-terminus (i.e., the G region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) or CRY C-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Czarna et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Partch et al., 2005</xref>) also participate in CRY binding. This suggests that the changes in CRY affinity for the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1 that we observed here underlie the major functional differences between CRY1 and CRY2 that contribute to differential period regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Edwards et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Horst et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vitaterna et al., 1999</xref>) and the ability of CRY1 to sustain cellular circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, cryptochrome recruitment to the PAS domain core likely represents a key regulatory node in the clock.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Using the baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen), the following constructs were expressed in Sf9 suspension insect cells (Expression Systems): His-tagged mouse CRY1 PHR domain (residues 1–491), CRY2 PHR domain (residues 1–512), CRY2 7M PHR domain (residues 1–512 with the following mutations: A61G, S64N, S394E, V396M, R397K, D400E, F408W), CRY2 2M PHR domain (residues 1–512 with the following mutations: A61G, S64N) CLOCK:BMAL1 bHLH-PAS domains (CLOCK residues 26–395, BMAL1 residues 62–441) or GST-tagged BMAL1 PAS-AB domains (residues 136–441).

Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at an OD<sub>600</sub> of ~0.8, after which cells were grown for an additional 18 hr at 18°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4°C for 4000 x rpm for 15 min. For CLOCK PAS-AB (wild-type or W362A mutant), the protein was expressed as a fusion protein with the solubilizing tag His-NusA-XL and an N-terminal biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckett et al., 1999</xref>) C-terminal to the TEV site. Cells were resuspended in 50 mM Tris buffer pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10% (vol/vol) glycerol and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol and lysed by microfluidizer. Lysate was clarified at 4°C for 19,000 rpm for 45 min.

The protein was then desalted into 50 mM Tris buffer pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5% (vol/vol) glycerol and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and the His-NusA-XL tag was cleaved with His-TEV protease overnight at 4°C. The cleaved tag and protease were removed by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Qiagen) and CLOCK PAS-AB was further purified by Superdex 75 gel filtration chromatography (GE Healthcare) into 20 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5, 125 mM NaCl, 5% (vol/vol) glycerol, and 2 mM TCEP. PER2 CBD was expressed as a fusion protein with GST and purified as described above.

Binding assays with CRY1 PHR domain, CRY1 PHR:PER2 CBD, CRY2 PHR domain and CRY2 PHR:PER2 CBD were performed in 50 mM Bis-Tris Propane buffer pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP and 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween-20. The BMAL TAD probe was diluted to a working concentration of 50 nM in assay buffer and binding was monitored by changes in fluorescence polarization with an EnVision 2103 multilabel plate reader (Perkin Elmer) with excitation at 531 nm and emission at 595 nm. Equilibrium binding dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) were calculated by fitting the dose-dependent change in millipolarization (mP) to a one-site specific total binding model in Prism 7 (GraphPad).

The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> reported (± SD) is the average of determined from the three independent assays.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Bio-layer interferometry</title><p>BLI experiments were performed using an 8-channel Octect-RED96e (ForteBio) with a BLI assay buffer of 20 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5, 125 mM NaCl, 5% (vol/vol) glycerol and 2 mM TCEP. All experiments began with a reference measurement to establish a baseline in BLI buffer for 120 s. Next, 1.5 µg/mL biotinylated CLOCK:BMAL1 PAS-AB (wild-type or W362A mutant in BLI buffer) was loaded on a streptavidin tip for 300 s at room temperature. Subsequently, a 360 s blocking step was performed with 0.5 mg/mL BSA, 0.02% (vol/vol) Tween, 20 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5, 125 mM NaCl, 5% (vol/vol) glycerol and 2 mM TCEP. Association was then measured for 300 s for eight different concentrations of the analyte (CRY, CRY:PER2 CBD, PER2 CBD) in a serial dilution starting at approximately 10x the estimated <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> in blocking buffer. Dissociation was measured for 300 s in blocking buffer. Each experiment was repeated with tips that were not loaded with CLOCK:BMAL PAS-AB to provide a reference for non-specific binding to the tip. Data were processed and fit using Octet software v.7 (ForteBio). Before fitting, all datasets were reference-subtracted, aligned on the y-axis and aligned for interstep correction through their respective dissociation steps according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For each experiment, at least four different concentrations were used to fit association and dissociation globally using a 1:1 binding model in Octet software v.7 (ForteBio). Ultimately, the goodness of fit was determined using χ<sup>2</sup> and R<sup>2</sup> values according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title><p>The crystal structure of apo CRY1 PHR domain (PDB: 5T5X) and apo CRY2 PHR domain (PDB: 4I6E) were prepared for starting models for the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by modeling non-terminal missing residues using the Prime program (Schrödinger). All crystallographically-defined water molecules were removed from the structures. In order to prepare the system with the in silico mutated CRY2 PHR domain (A61G/S64N CRY2), the corresponding amino acids were mutated in wild type apo CRY2 PHR domain using UCSF-Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) and used as starting models. Amber99sb-ildn force field was used for simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2010</xref>). The structures were solvated in a dodecahedron box using TIP3P water molecules. The systems were neutralized and then Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>–</sup> ions were added to maintain a physiological ionic concentration of 0.15 M. Energy minimization was performed for the systems until the maximum force on any atom was less than 1,000 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>nm<sup>−1</sup> in the case of apo CRY1 and CRY2 PHR domains, and 500 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>nm<sup>−1</sup> in the case of the in silico mutated CRY2 PHR domain.</p><p>After energy minimization, the systems were equilibrated in an NVT ensemble for 500 ps. The temperature was maintained at 310 K using the modified Berendsen Thermostat (V-rescale) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bussi et al., 2007</xref>). After this, the systems were equilibrated in an NPT ensemble for 500 ps. The pressure was maintained at 1 bar using a Berendsen barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berendsen et al., 1984</xref>). This was followed by a production run of 500 ns for each system in an NPT ensemble using a Parinello-Rahman barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</xref>) and modified Berendsen Thermostat (V-rescale) with the temperature maintained at 310 K and pressure at 1 bar. Three independent simulations were completed for the apo CRY1 PHR domain and apo CRY2 PHR domain systems described in the previous section and two independent simulations were run for the in silico mutated CRY2 PHR domain system. All MD simulations were performed using Gromacs 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The trajectories were analyzed using in built functions of Gromacs. RMSD, RMSF, distances and dihedral angles were calculated using gmx rmsd, gmx rmsf, gmx distance and gmx chi programs of Gromacs respectively. UCSF-Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) was used for molecular visualization. The volume of secondary pocket for 251 equally spaced trajectory frames from each run was calculated using POVME 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wagner et al., 2017</xref>). The comparison of volumes between CRY1- CRY2 PHR domain and between CRY2-mutCRY2 PHR domains was done by performing Wilcoxon ranksum test as implemented in Scipy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.scipy.org/">https://www.scipy.org/</ext-link>). Hydrogen bonds were determined for each frame of the MD trajectories using MDTraj (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McGibbon et al., 2015</xref>). The bonds with at least one residue from the serine loop (residues I36/I54 to I49/I67 in CRY1/CRY2) and with frequency of more than 5000 frames in any trajectory of a particular system were chosen as high frequency hydrogen bonds. The free energy landscape (FEL) was calculated using volume of secondary pocket and distance between center of mass of residue S62 and F123 (S44 and F105 in CRY1), as reaction coordinate. The FEL was calculated by using <italic>gmx sham</italic> utility of Gromacs. For FEL construction the volume and distance were calculated for every 100<sup>th</sup> frame from each trajectory.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Calculation of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence</title><p>The KL-divergence or relative entropy has been previously used to quantify the residue wise differences between the ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McClendon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moffett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rapp et al., 2013</xref>). To calculate the KL-divergence between the ensembles using mutinf software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McClendon et al., 2012</xref>), we divided each simulation trajectory between 100 ns and 500 ns into 4 blocks of 100 ns each. This gave a total of 12 blocks for apo CRY1 PHR domain and apo CRY2 PHR domain simulations and eight blocks for the in silico mutCRY2 PHR domain. Dihedral angles phi, psi and chi1 were calculated for 5000 equally spaced frames from each block and used as input to calculate KL-divergence. Dividing the trajectories into multiple blocks of sufficiently large number of frames enabled the calculation of bootstrap values, which were used to make a robust estimation of significant differences between the two ensembles. The divergence values greater than the bootstrap values for a given residue suggests that the dynamics of those residues differ significantly between the two ensembles, in terms of side chain rotamer distribution, main chain dihedral angle distribution or both.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Crystallization, data collection and structure determination</title><p>The CRY1 PHR:PER2 CBD complex was purified as described above.

The passive residues were specified as residues surrounding the active residues. The PAS-B domain of the CLOCK protein was used to dock an ensemble of structures comprised of 15 cluster representatives of apo CRY1 PHR domain and 12 cluster representatives of apo CRY2 PHR domain. A total of 10000, 400 or 400 models were generated, respectively, for the rigid docking, flexible docking and water refinement phase of the docking protocol. The final 400 models were clustered using Fractional Common Contacts (FCC) and sixteen clusters were obtained comprising 360 structures. Out of these sixteen, there were two large clusters with 92 and 80 complexes constituting about 48% of the clustered structures. The representatives from these two largest clusters were considered for further analysis.

By combining insights from many disciplines – X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, quantitative binding, sizing, and molecular dynamics simulations Fribourgh et al. propose an innovative model for the differing effects and phenotypes associated with the circadian transcriptional repressors, Cry1 and Cry2. Their work shows how another factor, PER2, tunes the binding affinity of CRY1and CRY2 for the CLOCK:BMAL1 transcription factor complex through modulation of a flexible serine-rich loop. They also provide a structure-based model and biochemical evidence for a high-affinity complex comprising CRY1 and CLOCK:BMAL1, in the absence of PER2, which may be the late repressive complex. Together, their data provide explanations for how CRY1 represses BMAL1/CLOCK alone in the late repressive complex. By contrast, CRY2 only suppresses BMAL1/CLOCK when bound to PER2, likely within the early repressive complex.</p><p>[Editors' note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Halil Kavakli (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between all the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at this time. We would like to add, however, that I am open to considering an appeal that addresses the reviewer's comments concerning the functional significance of the advance, the use of and interpretations of the MD simulations, and the concerns about the cryo-EM aspects of your study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic>The manuscript by Fribourgh et al., concerns the structural basis of circadian rhythm regulation by two paralogous repressors of transcription, CRY1 and CRY2, and their modulator, PER2. Each CRY protein binds to the PAS-B domain of CLOCK, which together with BMAL1, forms the heterodimeric transcription factor complex that cycles &quot;on&quot; (when free of CRY1 and CRY2) and &quot;off&quot; (when repressed by CRY1 or CRY2). Notably, CRY1 and CRY2 knockout mice have different phenotypes, with CRY2 being insufficient for ~24hour circadian cycling, despite high sequence conservation. This study attempts to explain how these repressor proteins differ in their structural dynamics and therefore differentially regulate circadian cycling.</p><p>The authors start by showing that CRY1 binds to CLOCK:BMAL(bHLH-PAS) heterodimers with an ~18 fold tighter affinity than CRY2 (K<sub>d</sub> values of ~65nM versus ~1.2uM). Comparison of different structural models (some published, some based on MD modeling, and some generated from a new crystal form in the current manuscript) suggest a plausible explanation for CRY1 versus CRY2 differential binding affinity. In short, CRY1 and CRY2 vary in sequence in the critical &quot;serine loop&quot; and the nearby PAS domain-binding &quot;secondary pocket.&quot; These sequence differences alter the size and inferred dynamics of the secondary pocket. Consistently, seven key substitutions in this region of CRY2 make that make it more like CRY1 confer tighter binding to CLOCK:BMAL(bHLH-PAS) – which is expected given published data concerning the CRY2 7M mutant.</p><p>Second, Fribourgh et al., investigate how a critical modulatory protein, PER2, binds and remodels the structure of the serine loop and the secondary binding pocket for CRY1 and CRY2. A comparison of their new crystal structure of CRY1:PER2(CBD) with prior structures (including PDBs: 6OF7,4I6E) revealed a surprise. Inclusion of PER2 in the complex partially orders the serine loop, and this correlates with weakened binding between PER2:CRY1 and CLOCK:BMAL(bHLH-PAS), by comparison with CRY1 alone. By contrast, PER2 binding to CRY2 leads to more extensive remodeling of the serine loop and secondary pocket, and this correlates with ~2 fold tighter binding between CRY2 and CLOCK:BMAL(bHLH-PAS). Synthesizing these observations, the authors conclude that PER2(CBD) can &quot;tune&quot; the affinities of CRY1 and CRY2 for CLOCK:BMAL1(bHLH-PAS) by restructuring the serine loop, and that this activity largely normalizes the ternary complex stabilities (collapsing a ~18-fold difference for the PER2-free complexes to a ~3 fold difference for the PER2-containing complexes).</p><p>Overall, this study has some crisp new insights into PER2's effects on CRY1 versus CRY2 structure and binding properties, but it remains unclear to me how this work should change our thinking about circadian rhythmicity since, as the authors wrote, after accounting for PER2's opposing effects on CRY1 versus CRY2, &quot;the actions of CRY1 and CRY2 within the heteromultimeric PER-CRY repressive complexes may be largely similar.&quot; Is the central takeaway that the ~3 fold binding difference for CRY2, in the presence of PER2, the mechanistic basis for CRY2's limitations as a suppressor? Finally, the cryo-EM and associated structural modeling efforts based on the cryo-EM suffer from limitations that make it of unclear value to the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The title of the paper seems too generic to me, bordering on insignificant since protein dynamics regulate biochemistry in all contexts, not just circadian rhythms. What mechanistic take-home message about the CRY1/2 and PER proteins would the authors suggest as an <italic>eLife</italic> title that conveys the significance of their discovery?</p><p>2) I had some trouble navigating the diverse depictions of the structures. If Figure 1A defines the standard view, please add clear labels for the serine loop, the secondary pocket, the footprint of the PAS domain, and the imprint of the TAD domain here and then use this figure with standard rotation symbols to help the reader understand which surface features are being focused on and highlighted in subsequent figures.</p><p>3) MD simulations are thought-provoking, fine-grained structural hypotheses, but I do not think of them as experimental data. I am happy to see such models in the supplemental data, but it's not clear to me how useful they were in thinking about the differences between CRY1 and CRY2, or the consequences of PER2 binding for either CRY proteins. For example, I may be confused by Figure 3 suggests that models of CRY2=&gt;CRY1 mutations (the 7M mutant) display the strongest effects for residues far away from the serine loop (near aa250 and aa300), while the serine loop and especially the secondary pocket (around aa400) are less impressively altered in RMSF.</p><p>4) The authors use unnecessarily polemical language when describing a prior structure as &quot;non-physiological&quot; and an &quot;artifact&quot;. Yes, vector residues are a problem, but all crystal structures have limitations. I would encourage the authors to describe their work as an attempt to glean explanatory power from all of the available structural data-which when considered together suggests considerable flexibility and scope for regulatory remodeling in this region of CRY1/2.</p><p>5) The authors wrote that they attempted to resolve outstanding ambiguity about the structure of PER2(CBD)CRY1(PHR):CLOCK:BMAL1(bHLH-PAS)+dsDNA using single particle cryoEM. I am afraid the uncertainty remains, and the cryo-EM data and associated analysis are both incomplete and disconnected from the rest of the study. Despite claiming a resolution between ~6Ã… and ~7Ã…, I can only appreciate a few apparent Î±-helices in the figures. For the most part, the map lacks secondary structure element separation, and this precludes a reliable interpretation of their map. The unbiased class averages shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2B bear only a partial resemblance to projections of the author's pseudoatomic model. So, while their low-resolution fitting exercise may be a reasonable guess, I cannot endorse this structural model based on the cryo-EM data as presented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic>This is a follow-on paper to the authors' earlier work which established the structure of a repressive complex involving the circadian clock proteins CRY1, CLOCK, and BMAL1. The present study seeks to understand how it is that CRY1 and CRY2 have similar structures yet function differently. The authors show experimentally that CRY1 and CRY2 have similar binding affinities for BMAL1 but different binding affinities for CLOCK; the presence of PER2 stabilizes the CRY2:CLOCK:BMAL1 complex two-fold. Based on molecular dynamics simulations, they attribute the differences in affinity to differences in flexibility of a loop adjacent to the binding pocket for CLOCK (dubbed the serine loop). This loop is unstructured (or at least largely unresolved crystallographically) in CRY1. By contrast, in CRY2, in the absence of PER2, it forms an Î± helix and, in the presence of PER2, takes on an alternate structure consistent with data for the loop in CRY1. This is an interesting result since it seems to contradict the intuition that a more well-structured complex will be tighter. Along the way, they solve a structure of the CRY1:PER2 complex that removes a vector artifact and model the CRY1:CLOCK complex based on cryoEM and biophysical data.</p><p>1) It would be nice if the authors could better explain the forces that stabilize the different serine loop conformations. Given that they use molecular dynamics simulations to generate hypotheses, they could use restrained free energy perturbation simulations to identify the interactions favoring different conformations, for example. Or try to map the (free) energy landscapes more systematically.</p><p>2) This is potentially a study of interest to readers beyond those working on circadian clocks since overall differences in function of related proteins (e.g., isoforms) are not well understood, at least quantitatively. In this regard, the manuscript could be written more accessibly for readers less familiar with the clock.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic>In the present study Fribourgh at al., use a combination of structural biology and computational methods to describe association of CRY1 and CRY2 with CLOCK:BMAL1. They found that a highly dynamic Ser looping and size of secondary packet in the CRYs is responsible for their affinity to CLOCK:BMAL1 complex. They specifically found that the binding of PER2 to CRY2 is required for its repressor activity due remodeling of Ser loop by PER2. However, they showed CRY1 can directly interact with PAS domain of CLOCK with or without PER2 and, therefore strongly repress CLOCK:BMAL1 transactivation. In this aspect this study is important and provides biochemical evidence how both CRYs have differential repressor activity. This topic is potentially appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>, followings should be address in the manuscript before publication.</p><p>1) Experiments in Figure 1C and Figure 2 should have done with a type of negative control like using photolyase or Drosphila CRY (since it has small cavity in their secondary packet) to validate their results.</p><p>2) Repression assay (commonly done in the field) should be performed using appropriate cell line to support their conclusion indicated in the Results section.</p><p>3) It is hard believe whether CRY2 binds to C:B bHLH-PAS since peak of CRY2 PHR: C:B bHLH-PAS and C:B bHLH-PAS overlaps Figure 2B.

What follows is the authors' response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:The manuscript by Fribourgh et al., concerns the structural basis of circadian rhythm regulation by two paralogous repressors of transcription, CRY1 and CRY2, and their modulator, PER2. [...] Finally, the cryo-EM and associated structural modeling efforts based on the cryo-EM suffer from limitations that make it of unclear value to the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #1 for their thorough and careful review of our manuscript. We agree that this study provides insight into the outstanding question of how PER2 influences the affinity of cryptochromes for CLOCK:BMAL1. We believe that localizing the molecular basis of this differential affinity to the serine loop in the PHR domain of CRYs represents an important advance in our understanding of the molecular circadian clock. However, another key finding that perhaps wasn't appreciated by the reviewer is our discovery that CRY1 has a very high affinity for the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1, which provides a molecular basis to understand the prior observation from ChIP-seq studies that CRY1 can act alone as a repressor of CLOCK:BMAL1, late in the circadian cycle. We too agree that the quality of the cryo-EM data were not as high as we would have hoped for, given issues with interdomain flexibility of CLOCK:BMAL1 and the severe preferred orientation of the complex in ice. We describe this in more detail below, but we believe that we have addressed reviewer #1's concern with the limitations of the cryo-EM data by removing the 3D model and instead using 2D class averages to validate a computational model of the ternary PER2:CRY1:CLOCK complex.</p><p>Altogether, we believe that our study gives rise to 3 discoveries that are important for circadian rhythms: (1) by showing that differential repressive functions of CRY1 and 2 likely don't originate from their affinity for the BMAL1 TAD, but the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1, we highlight a critical protein-protein interface that is likely to be regulated to control clock timing; (2) our discovery that PER2 acts to equalize CRY1 and CRY2 affinity for CLOCK:BMAL1 through modulation of the serine loop provides a structure-based rationale for the assembly and function of CRY1/2-containing early repressive complexes, and (3) our discovery of the very high affinity that CRY1 has for CLOCK:BMAL1 in the absence of PER2 provides a foundation to understand its important but enigmatic role in the late repressive complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:1) The title of the paper seems too generic to me, bordering on insignificant since protein dynamics regulate biochemistry in all contexts, not just circadian rhythms. What mechanistic take-home message about the CRY1/2 and PER proteins would the authors suggest as an eLife title that conveys the significance of their discovery?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that our original title was too broad and didn't fully describe the scope of the study. We have changed the title to &quot;Dynamics at the serine loop underlie differential affinity of cryptochromes for CLOCK:BMAL1 to control circadian timing.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I had some trouble navigating the diverse depictions of the structures. If Figure 1A defines the standard view, please add clear labels for the serine loop, the secondary pocket, the footprint of the PAS domain, and the imprint of the TAD domain here and then use this figure with standard rotation symbols to help the reader understand which surface features are being focused on and highlighted in subsequent figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We defined a standard view of the protein in Figure 1A and use this with proper rotation symbols in subsequent figures to orient the reader. We also altered our labeling strategy to decrease confusion. We believe that this should improve the ability to navigate the structural depictions presented in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) MD simulations are thought-provoking, fine-grained structural hypotheses, but I do not think of them as experimental data.

We feel that the MD simulations make very important contributions to our understanding of serine loop dynamics in the cryptochromes and should remain in the main figures.</p><p>With regard to the question of how useful they were in thinking about the differences between CRY1 and CRY2, we believe that the MD simulations served a critical role here, by complementing our experimental binding data and providing a molecular mechanism linking the dynamics of the serine loop near the secondary pocket to the affinity of cryptochromes for CLOCK:BMAL1. The static crystal structures of CRY1 and CRY2 only suggested that differences in the flexibility exist at the serine loop; therefore, there was no clarity about the factors that might lead to differential flexibility and whether this has a role in the functional difference observed between CRY1 and CRY2. To address this comment (and one from reviewer #2), we added new analyses of the MD simulations to demonstrate that swapping in two residues from CRY1 into the serine loop of CRY2 (i.e., mutCRY2) not only recapitulates CRY1-like flexibility in the loop, but also its pattern of hydrogen-bonding and the free energy landscape. Furthermore, we added a biochemical characterization of the MD-inspired mutant CRY2 2M to demonstrate that sequence differences in the loop that alter its dynamics do modulate CRY affinity for CLOCK:BMAL1.</p><p>With respect to the example chosen by the reviewer for RMSF differences, we highlight that proteins are dynamic in nature and MD simulations do an excellent job of capturing these dynamics computationally. The regions highlighted by reviewer are indeed both flexible loops that show considerable conformational heterogeneity with high B-factors in the crystal structures of all CRYs. Even in the simulation trajectories, the RMSF values show a large standard deviation for these residues. On the other hand, the serine loop and the secondary pocket in apo CRY2 is primarily composed of secondary structures like a-helices and b-strands, generally considered to be relatively rigid. Thus, we believe that the increase in their flexibility due to two mutations in the serine loop is functionally relevant, regardless of the magnitude in comparison to other long, flexible loops.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors use unnecessarily polemical language when describing a prior structure as &quot;non-physiological&quot; and an &quot;artifact&quot;. Yes, vector residues are a problem, but all crystal structures have limitations. I would encourage the authors to describe their work as an attempt to glean explanatory power from all of the available structural data-which when considered together suggests considerable flexibility and scope for regulatory remodeling in this region of CRY1/2.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer here––we weren't trying to use overly contentious rhetoric, but we believe that it is imperative to note that the vector sequence included in the PER2 construct used in the prior structure provided an incorrect depiction of the structure of the serine loop in the CRY1:PER2 complex. We agree that softening the language here is merited, so we modified language in this section and moved a panel from the original figure (clearly labeling the artifact) to a supplemental figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors wrote that they attempted to resolve outstanding ambiguity about the structure of PER2(CBD)CRY1(PHR):CLOCK:BMAL1(bHLH-PAS)+dsDNA using single particle cryoEM. I am afraid the uncertainty remains, and the cryo-EM data and associated analysis are both incomplete and disconnected from the rest of the study.

So, while their low-resolution fitting exercise may be a reasonable guess, I cannot endorse this structural model based on the cryo-EM data as presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer #1 about the unsatisfyingly low resolution of our single particle cryo-EM studies. In our original manuscript we did note that the resolution estimate reported by Relion is likely inflated by preferred orientation: &quot;Some anisotropy was observed in our cryo-EM density, arising from particles adopting two preferred orientations in vitrified ice (Figure S6), which was detrimental to the resolution of our 3D reconstruction and likely leads to an inflated value for our final map. This is likely arising from interaction with the air-water interface with our complex, as commonly seen in other protein samples analyzed by cryo-EM...&quot;</p><p>We were frustrated with the dynamic nature of the multidomain complex (documented earlier in small-angle x-ray scattering studies, Michael et al., (2017)) and with the several preferred orientations of the complex that we fought with throughout our EM studies. In the end, we felt that having some experimental data validating the binding of CLOCK PAS-B into the secondary pocket of a CRY1:PER2 complex was worth including in the initial draft of the manuscript. We acknowledge that the low resolution of our 3D map leaves some ambiguity in structural interpretation of the 3D model, so we have removed the 3D map from this study, instead placing more value on the 2D class averages arising from the same dataset. We note that in contrast to our 3D map, these 2D class averages contain well-resolved secondary structural features for the CRY1 PHR and are less likely to suffer from the same ambiguity in interpretation. Additionally, we have included a more expansive comparison between the 2D classes and the forward projections of the two top-scoring pseudoatomic HADDOCK models (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B). Critically, the EM data were able to clearly support one of the two models to provide a better picture of the ternary complex between PER2, CRY1, and CLOCK. However, we respectfully disagree with reviewer #1 in their assessment that our EM analyses are disconnected from the overall results of the study. To date, there is still no high resolution structure available describing the interactions between the mammalian circadian transcription factors and their repressors, giving our model considerable value to the circadian community. To that end, the EM data were instrumental in selecting the most probable structural model obtained from the integrative MD and HADDOCK results. We have added new text in subsection &quot;The CRY1 serine loop is disordered in the CRY1 PHR:PER2 CBD complex&quot; outlining this new work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:1) It would be nice if the authors could better explain the forces that stabilize the different serine loop conformations. Given that they use molecular dynamics simulations to generate hypotheses, they could use restrained free energy perturbation simulations to identify the interactions favoring different conformations, for example. Or try to map the (free) energy landscapes more systematically.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a discussion about the interactions stabilizing different conformations of the serine loop would be a valuable addition to the manuscript. However, performing restrained free energy perturbation simulations would be computationally expensive and we believe out of scope for the current manuscript. In order to more systematically explore the serine loop conformations as per the reviewer's suggestion, we have now plotted Free Energy Landscapes (FEL) corresponding to volume and distance at the entrance of the secondary pocket. The FEL clearly shows a difference in the relative distribution of frames with respect to the volume and distances among CRY1, CRY2 and mutCRY2 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). We also extracted the frames corresponding to the minimum in each FEL and compared their volume and distance. These again showed the same trend as the average values mentioned in the original manuscript with mutCRY2 behaving similar to the apo CRY1 (Supplementary file 1).</p><p>Regarding the characterization of interactions stabilizing the serine loop, it is difficult to comment here on the PER2 interactions since the simulations here were performed for apo CRY1 and CRY2. We agree that this is an interesting path forward in understanding the dynamics of this loop and its interaction with PER2 and CLOCK PAS-B. This is a part of continued work that we are pursuing for another manuscript. However, taking the reviewer's suggestion into account, we have analyzed the hydrogen bonds formed by secondary pocket loop residues over the course of the trajectories described in the manuscript and added new text describing the work in subsection &quot;The serine loop differentially gates access to the secondary pocket of CRY1 and CRY2&quot; and in Supplementary file 2. We feel that this analysis adds an important depth to the study and thank the reviewer for the suggestion to pursue this line of study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) This is potentially a study of interest to readers beyond those working on circadian clocks since overall differences in function of related proteins (e.g., isoforms) are not well understood, at least quantitatively. In this regard, the manuscript could be written more accessibly for readers less familiar with the clock.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the fundamental findings of this study could be of interest to protein aficionados beyond the circadian clock field. We have made some modest alterations to text throughout the manuscript to make it more accessible to nonclock readers. However, at its core, this study addresses an important question about the function of the molecular circadian clock and we feel that it is necessary to frame our findings in light of the transcription/translational oscillator instead of more general principles of protein behavior. Focusing on this general aspect of our study could be a great idea for a future review on this topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:1) Experiments in Figure 1C and Figure 2 should have done with a type of negative control like using photolyase or Drosphila CRY (since it has small cavity in their secondary packet) to validate their results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that negative controls are of the utmost importance. In this case, the negative controls for these assays have already been performed elsewhere and these studies are appropriately cited. We respectfully disagree that using a known non-repressive homolog like <italic>E. coli</italic> photolyase or <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRY would be the best control in this assay. The negative controls for the fluorescence polarization (FP)-based TAD binding assay in Figure 1C were originally published in Xu et al., (2015) , where we used TAD mutants that reduced repression by CRY in 293T cells and also showed decreased affinity for CRY by both FP and ITC, two gold-standard methods for determining affinity; moreover, the affinities that we measure here are in line with the data we published earlier. The negative controls for CRY binding to the PAS domain core of CLOCK:BMAL1 were published in Michael et al., (2017), where we showed that the W362A point mutant of CLOCK significantly disrupts or eliminates altogether the interaction of CLOCK with CRY1 by size exclusion chromatography and in vitro pulldown assays. Both of these citations are made in the text when describing prior knowledge in this area, so we believe that this should address the Reviewer's primary concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Repression assay (commonly done in the field) should be performed using appropriate cell line to support their conclusion indicated in the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>The ability of CRY1 and CRY2 to repress CLOCK:BMAL1 independently of PER2 was published many years ago in Shearman et al., (2000), using transfection into the heterologous S2-based insect cell system. Moreover, this observation has been repeated in numerous papers, some of which explored the nature of repression when CRYs were expressed alone or with PER2 (e.g., Akashi et al., (2014)). The emphasis in this concluding sentence was meant to summarize our current findings that both CRY proteins bind the TAD similarly (with or without PER2). To connect this claim to the observation that sequestration of the TAD by CRYs is likely the model by which they directly repress CLOCK:BMAL1 activity, we have added a citation to our earlier work where we showed that CRY1 and the KIX domain of the coactivator CBP directly compete for the same binding site on the BMAL1 TAD (e.g., in Xu et al., (2015)). We believe that linking the summary of our current findings to this prior study that rigorously explored TAD binding with in vitro and cellular repression studies should serve as proper support for this claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is hard believe whether CRY2 binds to C:B bHLH-PAS since peak of CRY2 PHR: C:B bHLH-PAS and C:B bHLH-PAS overlaps Figure 2B. For validation some other CRY type from plant/insect in both experiments. Alternatively, trimeric complex needs to be shown by either SDS PAGE (as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1) or Western blot.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the point that the reviewer makes, although we point out that binding of the bHLH-PAS heterodimer to the similarly sized CRY1 PHR domain significantly shifts the elution profile of the complex and there is no reason to think that the CRY2 PHR would behave substantively different in this assay. However, to clear up any potential confusion, we have added SDS-PAGE gel from both chromatography runs (with volume markers) to Figure 2—figure supplement 1, which clearly shows that the chromatographic peaks for CRY2 and the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer do not overlap. We respectfully disagree with the reviewer that we need to run a negative control using a non-repressive CRY from plants or insects here, as the data are quite clear that CRY2 does not stably migrate with CLOCK:BMAL1. We also probed for complex formation of CRY2 with the bHLH-PAS heterodimer using size exclusion chromatography in line with multi-angle scattering (SEC-MALS), which provides shape-independent determination of mass to unambiguously validate complex formation. However, in line with the SEC data presented here, we only identified masses for the isolated CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer and CRY2 PHR domain, and not a complex of the two (data not shown). Therefore, we believe that addition of the SDS-PAGE in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 should satisfy the reviewer's concern that we perhaps missed stable complex formation between the CRY2 PHR and the bHLH-PAS heterodimer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection &quot;The serine loop differentially gates access to the secondary pocket of CRY1 and CRY2&quot;: Change in RMSF is not clearly shown in Figure 3D for A61G. Although they cited papers (mutants that used in these papers are different than CRY2 A61G) they should confirm their findings using CRY2-A61G by measuring the mutant repressor capacity and its effect on circadian rhythm using MEF double knockout CRY cell line.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer makes a good point that mutants used in the Rosensweig et al., (2017) are, in some cases, a bit different from the ones probed in our assays here. However, this is only partially correct, as we purposefully studied the CRY2 7M mutant biochemically because it had already been validated in rigorous cellular studies by Rosensweig et al. In this manuscript, we added experimental data to bolster the MD simulations of mutCRY2, probing a CRY2 PHR with the A61G/N64S mutations that substitutes two residues from CRY1 into CRY2 to destabilize the serine loop dynamics. Rosensweig et al., studied the converse mutant in their cellular reconstitution studies––they made the G43A/N46S mutant in CRY1 to show that it weakened repression and shortened circadian period, in line with their model that this mutant had a weaker, more CRY2-like repression phenotype. Our logic for using the CRY2 2M mutant (instead of making the corresponding CRY1 mutant like Rosensweig et al.,) was that it would allow for a direct comparison to the affinity we obtained with the CRY2 7M mutant. We have added text in this draft ( subsection &quot;The serine loop differentially gates access to the secondary pocket of CRY1 and CRY2&quot;.) to explain this connection. In this regard, we believe that the data with the CRY2 2M and 7M mutations have been properly supported by citations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection &quot;The serine loop differentially gates access to the secondary pocket of CRY1 and CRY2&quot; &quot;these data demonstrate that modest sequences differences....&quot;I disagree with this statement. CRY2 7M consists of seven mutations in and around secondary packet and such number of mutations can make things complicated.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that seven mutations does not seem like a modest number, but we were referring to the actual amino acid substitutions themselves, in which residues of similar size and/or chemical character were substituted for one another (i.e., K/R, E/D, W/F, etc.). However, we acknowledge that this characterization is unclear, so we have removed the word 'modest' from our description of the 7M mutant in subsection &quot;The serine loop differentially gates access to the secondary pocket of CRY1 and CRY2&quot;.</p></body></sub-article></article>
