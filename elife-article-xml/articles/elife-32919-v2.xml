NKG2D recognizes a set of ligands typically expressed on infected or transformed cells, but recent studies have also documented NKG2D ligands on subsets of host non-tumor cells in tumor-bearing animals and humans. Here we show that in transplanted tumors and genetically engineered mouse cancer models, tumor-associated macrophages are induced to express the NKG2D ligand RAE-1δ. We find that a soluble factor produced by tumor cells is responsible for macrophage RAE-1δ induction, and we identify tumor-derived colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) as necessary and sufficient for macrophage RAE-1δ induction in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show that induction of RAE-1δ on macrophages by CSF-1 requires PI3K p110α kinase signaling. Thus, production of CSF-1 by tumor cells leading to activation of PI3K p110α represents a novel cellular and molecular pathway mediating NKG2D ligand expression on tumor-associated macrophages.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NKG2D</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>CSF-1</kwd><kwd>tumor microenvironment</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA093678</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raulet</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Innate Pharma, SAS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raulet</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 CA203262</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Thornton W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Macrophages respond to elevated levels of CSF-1 in tumor micro-environments by expressing a ligand for the NKG2D immunoreceptor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>NKG2D is a lectin-like cell surface immunoreceptor expressed on all NK cells and some T cell subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raulet, 2003</xref>). NKG2D recognizes a diverse set of MHC-like proteins. In mice, these include the RAE-1 family (including isoforms α, β, γ, δ, and ε), the H60 family (a, b, c), and MULT1. Human NKG2D ligands include the ULBP family (with isoforms 1–6) and the MICA and MICB proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Raulet et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Interactions between NKG2D and its ligands mediate diverse immunological functions. Acute ligation of NKG2D on NK cells transmits a powerful activation signal through the DAP10 and DAP12 adaptors, triggering NK cell release of cytotoxic granules and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raulet, 2003</xref>). In contrast, recent studies have shown that steady-state interactions of NKG2D with ligands in vivo, such as with endogenous expression of RAE-1ε in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>) or transgenically enforced overexpression of various NKG2D ligands in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oppenheim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wiemann et al., 2005</xref>), cause NK cells to adopt a state of global desensitization to acute activation. NKG2D has also been implicated as a co-stimulatory molecule for T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bauer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Markiewicz et al., 2005</xref>), and in some cases NKG2D can mediate lymphocyte trafficking to sites of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Markiewicz et al., 2012</xref>). Various auto-inflammatory conditions, such as atherosclerosis in a mouse model, have also been shown to be mediated in part by NKG2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ogasawara et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guerra et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, NKG2D has diverse roles in immune cell activation and regulation depending on the cellular and physiological context.</p><p>Most cells in healthy mice lack surface NKG2D ligand expression, whereas many tumors and infected cells show expression in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Raulet et al., 2013</xref>). NKG2D ligand expression is tightly regulated at multiple levels of biogenesis. In general, NKG2D ligand expression on diseased cells is usually understood as a cellular response to stresses associated with transformation or infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eagle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mistry and O'Callaghan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Raulet et al., 2013</xref>). A prominent example is the induction of NKG2D ligands in mouse and human cells as a result of an activated DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gasser et al., 2005</xref>). Subsequent studies found that rapidly proliferating fibroblasts upregulate NKG2D ligands in vitro and in vivo independently of the DNA damage response, due to transactivation of the promoter of the <italic>Raet1e</italic> gene (which encodes RAE-1ε) by E2F transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jung et al., 2012</xref>). Heat shock stress and the integrated stress response have also been implicated in NKG2D ligand expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Groh et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Venkataraman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nice et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gowen et al., 2015</xref>). In some cells, steady-state expression of micro-RNAs may confer post-transcriptional regulation of NKG2D ligand expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heinemann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Codo et al., 2014</xref>). In human but not mouse cells, activation of p53 has also been implicated in NKG2D ligand induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Textor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iannello et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, animals have evolved numerous mechanisms to sense abnormal cellular activity and alert the immune system through NKG2D.</p><p>Interestingly, some reports have described NKG2D ligand expression on cells that are not themselves infected or transformed. For example, Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists induced NKG2D ligands on mouse macrophages and human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hamerman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ebihara et al., 2007</xref>). There is also increasing evidence that subsets of tumor-associated cells show NKG2D ligand induction in animals and humans. Tumor-associated myeloid cells and circulating monocytes in glioblastoma patients were shown to upregulate NKG2D ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Crane et al., 2014</xref>). In transplant and spontaneous mouse models, tumor-associated endothelial cells were found to induce high levels of the NKG2D ligand RAE-1ε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>). Expression of RAE-1 molecules was also found on macrophages infiltrating a mouse model of melanoma and a model of lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nausch et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Tumors establish a complex microenvironment characterized by an intricate interplay between cancer cells and associated stroma. Some tumor-infiltrating cells, such as cytotoxic lymphocytes, can be activated to kill tumor cells and protect the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vesely et al., 2011</xref>). Other tumor-associated stroma can have pleiotropic effects depending on tumor type and physiological context. For example, many tumors are extensively infiltrated by macrophages, which often have pro-tumor functions such as promoting angiogenesis or impairing the functions of cytotoxic lymphocytes, but can also exert anti-tumor activities depending on the molecular and cellular milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noy and Pollard, 2014</xref>). Macrophages can sense the character of tumor microenvironments using an array of receptors and respond to different microenvironments by expressing various secreted and surface-bound immunomodulatory molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noy and Pollard, 2014</xref>). Understanding the cellular and molecular factors that control the activity and expression profile of tumor-associated macrophages is critical to understanding tumor microenvironments and revealing new targets for therapy.</p><p>Here we show that the NKG2D ligand RAE-1δ is induced on tumor-associated macrophages but not other cells that infiltrate several models of transplanted and autochthonous cancer. Unexpectedly, we find that the cytokine colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) is released by tumor cells and is necessary and sufficient to induce RAE-1δ at the mRNA and cell surface levels on macrophages in vitro and on tumor-associated macrophages in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K is required for CSF-1-mediated macrophage RAE-1δ induction. Thus, tumor cell secretion of CSF-1 is sensed by macrophages through CSF-1R and PI3K p110α, leading to induction of the NKG2D ligand RAE-1δ.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RAE-1δ induction on tumor-associated macrophages</title><p>A limited number of studies have described NKG2D ligand expression on subsets of tumor-associated hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Crane et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nausch et al., 2008</xref>). To further investigate this phenomenon, we used flow cytometry to analyze NKG2D ligands on hematopoietic cells infiltrating several transplant tumor models. First, WT C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously with a high dose (1 × 10<sup>6</sup>) of B16-BL6 melanoma cells, hereafter referred to as B16. Once established at approximately 1 cm in diameter (10–17 days post-injection), tumors were dissociated and stained with lineage markers and monoclonal antibodies for NKG2D ligands, including RAE-1δ, RAE-1ε, MULT1, or a polyclonal antibody that recognizes multiple H60 isoforms. As RAE-1 molecules are quite similar, we validated the specificity of the antibodies by staining B16 cells transduced with RAE-1δ or RAE-1ε with the antibodies targeting these ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and we previously confirmed isoform-specific blocking by these antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Tumor-associated macrophages (hereafter called TAMs) are an important subset of myeloid cells identified as CD45-pos; CD11b-hi; Ly6G-neg; F4/80-hi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, TAMs in B16 tumors expressed RAE-1δ but not other NKG2D ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition to strong expression on TAMs, RAE-1δ was weakly expressed on monocytes in B16 tumors (identified as CD45-pos; CD11b-hi; Ly6G-neg; F4/80-low; Ly6C-hi – gating strategy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>) – but negligible on other hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, RAE-1δ staining on TAMs was completely absent in RAE-1-KO mice, which contain frameshift mutations in the genes encoding RAE-1δ and RAE-1ε, confirming the specificity of the RAE-1δ staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast to robust TAM expression of RAE-1δ, splenic macrophages, peritoneal macrophages, and blood monocytes in mice bearing B16 tumors expressed little to no RAE-1δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3B,C</xref>). These data indicate that macrophages within the B16 tumor microenvironment are induced to express the NKG2D ligand RAE-1δ. Expression of RAE-1δ in TAMs within B16 tumors was similar at various stages of tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Together, these data indicate that TAMs, but not other hematopoietic cells, are induced to express RAE-1δ in some transplant and spontaneous tumors (B16 tumors and primary KP sarcomas), but not in others (RMA-S tumors and primary TRAMP adenocarcinomas) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref> for comparisons).

We find that, in a set of transplant and spontaneous cancer models, tumor cells secrete the cytokine CSF-1, which induces the NKG2D ligand RAE-1δ on tumor-associated macrophages via a CSF-1R-PI3Kα-dependent signaling pathway. These data expand our knowledge of NKG2D ligand regulation on tumor-associated cells and enhance our understanding of the complex cellular and molecular dynamics within tumor microenvironments.</p><p>The specificity of NKG2D ligand induction on tumor-associated hematopoietic cells was striking. Macrophages and monocytes were the only hematopoietic cells found to express NKG2D ligands, and ligand expression on those cells was completely limited to RAE-1δ. Along with our previous study describing RAE-1 molecules expressed on tumor-associated endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>), these datasets represent a substantial addition to our understanding of NKG2D ligand expression on tumor-associated cells in multiple tumor models.</p><p>It is notable that macrophages treated with CSF-1 upregulated RAE-1δ but not other NKG2D ligands, matching the specificity of RAE-1δ induction on TAMs. These data suggest that regulation of NKG2D ligands is tightly controlled and highly specific, which has also been noted in other cellular and molecular contexts. We show here that PI3K p110α is required for macrophage RAE-1δ by CSF-1. A previous study also implicated PI3K p110α in NKG2D ligand induction upon in vitro MCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tokuyama et al., 2011</xref>). More research is needed to ascertain whether PI3K collaborates with other signals to induce NKG2D ligands, and to uncover the downstream events linking PI3K activity to transcription of NKG2D ligands. The regulatory factors mediating this specificity remain an area of ongoing investigation.</p><p>To our knowledge, this report is the first to describe CSF-1 as an inducer of NKG2D ligands. CSF-1, but not other tested cytokines, induced RAE-1δ on macrophages. Previous reports of NKG2D ligand expression on myeloid cells are relatively limited. Stimulation of macrophages through TLRs was found to induce RAE-1 molecules but not H60 family ligands or MULT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hamerman et al., 2004</xref>). Tumor-associated myeloid cells and circulating monocytes in glioblastoma patients were found to upregulate the human NKG2D ligands ULBP1 and MICB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Crane et al., 2014</xref>). A handful of reports have indicated that dendritic cells can upregulate NKG2D ligands in vitro as a result of certain maturation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schrama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ebihara et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the data presented in this manuscript represent a novel molecular signature linked to NKG2D ligand induction. Notably, these data do not implicate RAE-1δ expression within the classical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Italiani and Boraschi, 2014</xref>) -- and controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martinez and Gordon, 2014</xref>) -- M1/M2 paradigm of macrophage activation. CSF-1 is associated with macrophage renewal and activation, but it induces a transcriptional signature distinct from M1 or M2 expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hume and MacDonald, 2012</xref>). Indeed, classical M1 and M2 cytokines (IFNγ and IL-4, respectively) both failed to induce macrophage RAE-1δ in our hands (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and not shown).</p><p>We find here that induction RAE-1δ on TAMs occurred in tumor microenvironments containing high levels of CSF-1. Steady state amounts of CSF-1 are known to be present and required for maintaining monocytes and macrophages, but those concentrations were insufficient to induce RAE-1δ expression. Hence, RAE-1δ induction requires a higher dose of CSF-1 than is necessary for survival and renewal of macrophages. These considerations suggest the intriguing possibility that macrophage detection of elevated CSF-1 levels, in this case driven by dense concentrations of CSF-1-producing tumor cells, could be considered a sensing mechanism for local disturbances in homeostasis. CSF-1 is associated with macrophage programs that promote tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hume and MacDonald, 2012</xref>), and tumor cell secretion of CSF-1 may be an adaptive feature of some cancers. It is interesting to speculate on other scenarios that might resemble these CSF-1-producing tumor microenvironments.</p><p>The physiological role of macrophage RAE-1δ expression in tumors and other contexts remains enigmatic. NKG2D interactions with RAE-1 molecules are typically thought to provide an activating signal to NKG2D-expressing cells. Indeed, in the current study, macrophage RAE-1δ had a stimulatory effect in an in vitro co-culture model, as short-term incubation of CSF-1-stimulated RAE-1δ-expressing macrophages with NK cells caused elevated NK responses to subsequent acute stimulation compared to incubation with macrophages lacking RAE-1 molecules. These findings are similar to a previous study showing that expression of RAE-1 molecules on mononuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells in certain tumor-bearing mice has a stimulatory effect on NK cells in a co-culture setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nausch et al., 2008</xref>). However, a recent study from our laboratory employed antibody blockade and genetic deletion studies to show that endogenously expressed RAE-1ε ligated NKG2D and desensitized NK cells in steady state conditions and in tumors, whereas RAE-1δ had little or no effect on NKG2D levels or desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, bone marrow chimera experiments in that study demonstrated that the impact of RAE-1 expressed by hematopoietic cells was relatively modest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>). Because NKG2D is known to induce killing of RAE-1-expressing cells by NK cells in vivo, we tested the hypothesis that RAE-1δ expression may render TAMs sensitive to NKG2D-mediated killing in tumors or select for macrophages with lower RAE-1δ surface levels. However, WT and RAE-1-KO mice had similar macrophage numbers in B16 tumors, and TAM RAE-1δ levels were similar in WT and NKG2D-KO mice.</p><p>Collectively, data here and in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diefenbach et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guerra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>) revealed multiple roles of RAE-1 molecules on macrophages, tumor cells, endothelial and other cells. It is possible that the frequency or duration of the interaction between NKG2D and RAE-1δ may modulate its functional effect on NK cells, revealing different effects in vitro vs. in vivo. Or, perhaps other signals in the tumor environment influence this outcome. It is also possible that RAE-1δ on TAMs has an as-yet-undiscovered effect on macrophage biology or other features of the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, a previous report documented expression of RAE-1 molecules in microglia in mice with experimental allergic encephalitis, and RAE-1 mRNA expression was found to correlate with CSF-1-induced microglial proliferation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Djelloul et al., 2016</xref>). It is also possible that macrophage RAE-1δ interacts with and modulates other NKG2D-expressing cells in tumors. The interactions of immune cells in vivo with NKG2D ligands expressed by distinct untransformed cell types, as well as with transformed and infected cells, appears to impact immune cell activation and function in several respects, in some cases in opposing fashion, and will be the continued subject of future research.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and in vivo procedures</title><p>C57BL/6J mice were bred from mice obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).

In particular:</p><p>- The authors should provide more details on the tumour models analyzed. It is unclear what they mean with &quot;established tumors&quot;: i.e. How many tumor cells were injected, which was the volume of the tumour analyzed, when the tumour was dissociated after transplantation, was RAE-1δ expression on tumor-infiltrating macrophages stable during tumor progression? This last point seems quite relevant as macrophages modify their phenotype during tumour progression.</p><p>- Does the in vivo treatment with anti-CSF-1 or anti-CSF1-R antibody affect the number of tumor-infiltrating macrophages?

Were TAM from the different tumors harvested at the same time point? The authors need to provide more details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study Thompson and colleagues describe a novel mechanism for induction of NKG2D ligand tumor-associated macrophages. They show that CSF-1 secreted by tumor cells drives expression of RAE-1δ on macrophages via PI3K dependent signals. This work displays an interesting and novel mechanism used by tumor cells to subvert the NKG2D mediated NK cell response. The findings described are of great interest in how the tumor microenvironment and infiltrating cells can drive immune escape.</p><p>1) For Figure 1C it would be helpful to also show pooled data for the noted tumor models, rather than just the representative histogram. If space is an issue the pooled data could be added to the supplementary figures.</p><p>2) For consistency in experimental design it would be nice, but not critical, to show anti-CSF-1 treatment on the KP sarcoma model in Figure 4B.</p><p>3) A better control for the CSF1-CRISPR KO in Figure 5A and B would be a Cas9 (alone) transfected cells (without guide RNAs) to ensure that the transfection itself is not impairing the ability of the B16 cells to produce CSF1, as well as other possible cytokines and chemokines. That being said, the add back experiment (5C) does seem to indicate that CSF1 is the main mediator of RAE-1δ induction.</p><p>4) Given the implications of tumor mediated induction of NKG2D ligands on tumor infiltrating macrophages and the expertise of the Raulet lab it seems logical to evaluate the effect of these CSF-1 induced RAE-1δ expressing macrophages on NK cells. While doing this in vivo would be interesting, evaluation of NKG2D desensitization on NK cells co-cultured with macrophages pre-treated with B16 supernatants or B16 supernatants with CSF-1 blocking antibody would be very interesting and biologically relevant. This would drive home the biologic point of tumor mediated RAE-1δ induction on TAMs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript entitled: &quot;Tumor derived CSF-1 induces the NKG2D ligand RAE-1d on tumor infiltrating macrophages&quot; by Thompson et al. reveals a mechanism of regulation of NKG2D-ligands in mice on tumor-infiltrated macrophages. The manuscript is well written, and experiments are well performed, however data are rather descriptive and the functional importance of RAE-1 expression on TAMs is not addressed. Data are cited from a submitted manuscript (Introduction, second paragraph and others) that should be potentially included in the manuscript.</p><p>The authors should address the following points to improve the manuscript:</p><p>• Introduction: There have been several reports about RAE-1 regulation on myeloid cells. These should be cited and critically discussed. For example:</p><p>Djelloul et al., 2016; Nausch et al., 2008.</p><p>• Abstract and Introduction: &quot;NKG2D ligands on subset of healthy cells in tumor bearing animals&quot; it is unclear what is meant by healthy cells.

Evidence should be provided that the mAb used is specific for RAE-1d and not for other RAE-1s (this should be cited in Materials and methods).</p><p>• In Figure 1, tumor associated monocytes are tested –.how were these cells defined? Are these cells similar to MDSC? Gating dot plots for blood monocytes and peritoneal macrophages should be included (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C).</p><p>• A comprehensive analysis of different RAE-1 members on different subsets of tumor infiltrating myeloid cells in different tumor models would be very informative.</p><p>• Functional analysis of the interaction of RAE-1+ TAMs and NKG2D expressing cells needs to be provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32919.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The primary concern for this manuscript is that the functional importance of this finding needs validation.

The recent acceptance of our companion manuscript “Endothelial cells express NKG2D ligands and desensitize anti-tumor NK responses” – PMID 29231815 – to <italic>eLife</italic> allows us to rigorously discuss this issue. We offer revisions of the current manuscript under consideration, along with the following analysis for your consideration. In this response letter, data from the companion manuscript will be referenced as (Endothelial, Figure X) for clarity.</p><p>The functional role of host RAE-1 molecules in modulating NK responses is the central focus of the Endothelial manuscript. We clearly show that host RAE-1 molecules engage NKG2D and desensitize NK cells at steady-state and in tumors (Endothelial, Figures 1, 2, and 5). Importantly, we find that radio-resistant cells are the dominant source of RAE-1 molecules responsible for NKG2D engagement and NK desensitization at steady state and in tumors, whereas radiosensitive cells have a small or negligible effect (Endothelial, Figures, 4 and 5). Macrophages in the tumor models studied are completely radio-sensitive and therefore are replaced with donor cells in chimeras (unpublished data available upon request). Using antibody blockade, we showed that RAE-1ε is the relevant RAE-1 molecule responsible for NKG2D engagement and NK desensitization, whereas RAE-1δ had little to no effect (Endothelial, Figures 1 and 5). We went on to show that endothelial cells in lymphoid tissue, but not any other non-hematopoietic cells, express RAE-1ε at steady state (Endothelial, Figure 4). Furthermore, RAE-1ε was super-induced on endothelial cells within all tumors tested (Endothelial, Figure 5). These data are consistent with a model in which endogenous expression of RAE-1ε by endothelial cells engages NKG2D and causes NK cell desensitization, mitigating anti-tumor NK responses.</p><p>The present manuscript under consideration describes parallel experiments concerning regulation of RAE-1δ (but not RAE-1ε) induction on tumor-associated macrophages. We chose not to include functional analyses in the initial draft of this manuscript because the in vivo effect of RAE-1 molecules on NK cell function seemed limited to RAE-1ε (not RAE-1δ) molecules on nonhematopoietic cells, as described in the Endothelial paper. Upon consideration of the reviewers’ helpful comments, we now include data from in vitro experiments that test the role of CSF-1 induced macrophage RAE-1δ on NK function in a cell culture system; we have also added data on the number of intra-tumor macrophages in WT vs. RAE-1-KO mice. These experiments have been added to the revised manuscript (Figure 7) and are discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>For the in vitro functional experiments, NK cells were incubated with CSF-1-stimulated macrophages from WT or RAE-1-KO mice, and subsequently analyzed for NKG2D downregulation or NK responsiveness to plate-bound antibody stimulation. NK cells were also incubated with parental B16 or RAE-1δ-overexpressing B16 cells (this was an attempt to determine if the effect of macrophage-expressed RAE-1δ differed from that of tumor-expressed RAE-1δ). In this in vitro model, incubation with RAE-1δ-expressing macrophages or RAE-1δ-expressing B16 tumor cells both caused efficient downregulation of NKG2D on NK cells and increased NK responses to subsequent stimulation compared to culture with RAE-1-deficient cells (Figure 7). This acute priming effect is similar to findings from previous studies showing heightened NK responses following co-culture with RAE-1-expressing MDSCs (Nausch, Galani, et al., 2008).</p><p>In addition, we considered the hypothesis that NK cells were killing RAE-1δ-expressing macrophages in tumors, which should result in fewer TAMs or selection for TAMs with lower RAE1δ expression. However, the number of intra-tumoral macrophages was similar in WT and RAE-1KO mice, and the expression of RAE-1δ on macrophages was similar in WT vs. NKG2D-KO mice. These data have been added to the manuscript (Figure 7—figure supplement 1) and do not support the hypothesis that RAE-1δ-expressing macrophages are targeted for killing in vivo.</p><p>Because the in vitro data showed a stimulatory effect of macrophage RAE-1δ (Macrophage, Figure 7), whereas in vivo experiments showed a desensitizing effect of RAE-1ε molecules on endothelial cells (Endothelial, Figures 1, 2, 4, and 5), we now include a robust discussion of these datasets and their implications (Discussion, last paragraph), as suggested by the reviewers. We hope that these revisions address the reviewers’ concerns, and we look forward to future studies to further elucidate the complex role of these ligands and receptors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The full reviews from all three reviewers are appended below in order to allow the authors to enhance the manuscript. They also should be addressed in the revised manuscript.

A comprehensive analysis of RAE-1 members in different myeloid cells and tumor models is not required.</p></disp-quote><p>Listed below are point-by-point responses to the remaining reviewers’ comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The paper by Thompson et al. describes the ability of CSF-1 to specifically stimulate the expression of RAE-1δ on tumor-infiltrating macrophages.</p><p>The finding is novel and interesting, but a major weakness is represented by the lack of evidence on the pathophysiological relevance of this finding.

We have attempted to address these concerns, as outlined above in the responses to Essential Revisions 1 and 2. In addition, we acknowledge that our data on the role of PI3K p110α corroborate a previous finding in CMV-infected cells (Tokoyama, Lorin, et al., 2011), and we feel that this common mechanism is an important finding because the regulation of RAE-1 molecules is mediated by diverse signaling pathways in different pathophysiological contexts (see Raulet, Gasser et al., 2014). Unfortunately, we do not have any additional data on the mediators downstream of PI3K; because of the intricacy of this regulatory system and the ongoing nature of these investigations in our lab and others, we respectfully request that such datasets be reserved for future publications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, a number of experimental details are needed to strengthen the results presented. In particular:</p><p>- The authors should provide more details on the tumour models analyzed. It is unclear what they mean with &quot;established tumors&quot;: i.e. How many tumor cells were injected, which was the volume of the tumour analyzed, when the tumour was dissociated after transplantation, was RAE-1δ expression on tumor-infiltrating macrophages stable during tumor progression? This last point seems quite relevant as macrophages modify their phenotype during tumour progression.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful feedback. We have clarified the details of our analysis in the Results and Materials and Methods sections. For all experiments, we injected high doses of tumor cells (1 x 10<sup>6</sup> B16 and 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> RMA-S) in an attempt to standardize tumor size. Tumors were typically harvested upon reaching approximately 1 cm in diameter, roughly 10-17 days after injection. According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have included time course data on macrophage RAE-1δ expression in B16 tumors. Mice were injected with 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells, and tumors were harvested at early (day 6), mid (day 11) and late (day 16) time points. Tumor-infiltrating macrophages did not show significant differences across these time points. These data have been added to the manuscript (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Does the in vivo treatment with anti-CSF-1 or anti-CSF1-R antibody affect the number of tumor-infiltrating macrophages? Can the authors show the CSF-1 tumor levels after in vivo anti-CSF-1 antibody administration?</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, intra-tumoral macrophage numbers are reduced upon anti-CSF-1R treatment as early as day 5 post-treatment, whereas macrophage RAE-1δ expression is reduced as early as day 2 post-treatment. Because cells of the macrophage/monocyte lineage are known to depend on CSF-1 for survival, these results are expected. The anti-CSF-1 antibody (5A1) is a well-established blocking antibody, but because of the technical difficulties of quantifying CSF-1 in vivo after blocking antibody injection, we do not have data on the intra-tumoral levels of CSF-1 following blockade of the cytokine. The finding that the antibody has large effects (reducing RAE-1δ expression and eventually depleting macrophages) shows that the availability of the antibody is clearly sufficient to have strong biological effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Is the growth rate of B16, B16-Cfs1 KO, and B16-Cfs1 KO with a restored expression of CFS<sup>-1</sup>, comparable? Were TAM from the different tumors harvested at the same time point? The authors need to provide more details.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Similar to the comment addressed above, mice were given high-dose tumor cells in an effort to standardize tumor growth. At the high dose of 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells, B16, B16-CSF1-KO and B16-CSF-1-add-back grew at similar rates (data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and were harvested at the same time point (14 +/- 3 days post-injection) for analysis. We have added these details to the manuscript (Results, subsection “Tumor-derived CSF-1 is required for RAE-1δ expression by TAMs in vivo”).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32919.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>WT mice were injected with 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> of the indicated tumors.</title><p>Volumes were analyzed at day of harvest (day 15).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-32919-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this study Thompson and colleagues describe a novel mechanism for induction of NKG2D ligand tumor-associated macrophages. They show that CSF-1 secreted by tumor cells drives expression of RAE-1δ on macrophages via PI3K dependent signals. This work displays an interesting and novel mechanism used by tumor cells to subvert the NKG2D mediated NK cell response. The findings described are of great interest in how the tumor microenvironment and infiltrating cells can drive immune escape.</p><p>1) For Figure 1C it would be helpful to also show pooled data for the noted tumor models, rather than just the representative histogram. If space is an issue the pooled data could be added to the supplementary figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this useful suggestion. We have added this pooled data to Figure 1—figure supplement 2C. Note that this represents compiled data from multiple experiments because we did not have a single experiment where we simultaneously analyzed RAE1δ in the different tumors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For consistency in experimental design it would be nice, but not critical, to show anti-CSF-1 treatment on the KP sarcoma model in Figure 4B.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that having this data would be good for matching the experimental setup in the B16 tumors, but unfortunately because of the lengthy tumorigenesis time for KP mice and their use in unrelated experiments, we do not have this data, and we respectfully request that the manuscript be allowed to move forward without it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A better control for the CSF1-CRISPR KO in Figure 5A and B would be a Cas9 (alone) transfected cells (without guide RNAs) to ensure that the transfection itself is not impairing the ability of the B16 cells to produce CSF1, as well as other possible cytokines and chemokines. That being said, the add back experiment (5C) does seem to indicate that CSF1 is the main mediator of RAE-1δ induction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the add back experiment represents a strong control that tumor-derived CSF1 mediates TAM RAE-1δ induction. Relatedly, we point to our use of two different CSF1-KO B16 clones (Figure 5A and 5B) as an additional control for potential off-target effects of Cas9. We believe that these data, taken together, make a compelling case that the defect is due to CSF1 deficiency and not other features of the cells. Although we did not test Cas9 transfection alone, we know that in general, transfection of B16 cells does not affect their ability to make CSF-1 (data not shown).</p><p><italic>4) Given the implications of tumor mediated induction of NKG2D ligands on tumor infiltrating macrophages and the expertise of the Raulet lab it seems logical to evaluate the effect of these CSF-1 induced RAE-1δ expressing macrophages on NK cells. While doing this</italic> in vivo <italic>would be interesting, evaluation of NKG2D desensitization on NK cells co-cultured with macrophages pre-treated with B16 supernatants or B16 supernatants with CSF-1 blocking antibody would be very interesting and biologically relevant. This would drive home the biologic point of tumor mediated RAE-1δ induction on TAMs.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and we agree that additional information on the functional role of RAE-1 would be useful. We hope that our experiments described above in response to Essential Revisions 1 and 2 are satisfactory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript entitled: &quot;Tumor derived CSF-1 induces the NKG2D ligand RAE-1d on tumor infiltrating macrophages&quot; by Thompson et al. reveals a mechanism of regulation of NKG2D-ligands in mice on tumor-infiltrated macrophages. The manuscript is well written, and experiments are well performed, however data are rather descriptive and the functional importance of RAE-1 expression on TAMs is not addressed. Data are cited from a submitted manuscript (Introduction, second paragraph and others) that should be potentially included in the manuscript.</p><p>The authors should address the following points to improve the manuscript:</p><p>• Introduction: There have been several reports about RAE-1 regulation on myeloid cells. These should be cited and critically discussed. For example:</p><p>Djelloul et al., 2016; Nausch et al., 2008.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these helpful additions; the findings from these papers are now described in the revised manuscript in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Abstract and Introduction: &quot;NKG2D ligands on subset of healthy cells in tumor bearing animals&quot; it is unclear what is meant by healthy cells. Please change accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the context of the text, we have revised this to more explicitly denote the cells referenced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• RAE-1 molecules are very similar. Evidence should be provided that the mAb used is specific for RAE-1d and not for other RAE-1s (this should be cited in Materials and methods).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We analyzed the specificity of the RAE-1 antibodies by staining B16 cells transduced to specifically express RAE-1δ or RAE-1ε. The antibodies showed high specificity for their targets. The anti-RAE-1δ did show some staining of the RAE-1ε – expressing cells, but the difference in staining intensity was nearly 100-fold. These data have been added to Figure 1—figure supplement 2A. Furthermore, we showed in the Endothelial paper that the RAE-1δ antibody blocked binding of NKG2D-Fc to RAE-1δ and had no effect in blocking binding of NKG2D-Fc to RAE-1ε – and vice-versa (Endothelial Figure 1—figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In Figure 1, tumor associated monocytes are tested – how were these cells defined? Are these cells similar to MDSC? Gating dot plots for blood monocytes and peritoneal macrophages should be included (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C).</p></disp-quote><p>Monocytes in tumors were identified as CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G-neg F4/80-low Ly6C-hi. In blood, monocytes were identified as by CD3e-neg CD19-neg Ly6G-neg Ly6C-hi. In the peritoneum, macrophages were identified clearly as the F4/80-hi cells. In accordance with the reviewer’s comment, we have added these gating strategies to the manuscript (Figure 1—figure supplement3).</p></body></sub-article></article>
