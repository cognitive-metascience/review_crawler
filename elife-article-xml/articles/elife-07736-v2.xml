Here we show how selective and non-selective lysosomal protein degradation pathways cooperate to ensure cell survival upon nutrient limitation. A quantitative analysis of starvation-induced proteome remodeling in yeast reveals comprehensive changes already in the first three hours. In this period, many different integral plasma membrane proteins undergo endocytosis and degradation in vacuoles via the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway. Their degradation becomes essential to maintain critical amino acids levels that uphold protein synthesis early during starvation. This promotes cellular adaptation, including the de novo synthesis of vacuolar hydrolases to boost the vacuolar catabolic activity. This order of events primes vacuoles for the efficient degradation of bulk cytoplasm via autophagy. Hence, a catabolic cascade including the coordinated action of the MVB pathway and autophagy is essential to enter quiescence to survive extended periods of nutrient limitation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07736.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07736.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07736.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Yeast and other organisms have evolved to survive extended periods of starvation by digesting their own proteins and other cell materials and thereby recycle them into new proteins and structures. One way in which these cell materials can be destroyed is by a process called autophagy. A membrane forms around the cell material to isolate it from the rest of the cell. In yeast, the resulting structure fuses with a cell compartment called the vacuole, which contains enzymes that break down the cargo into smaller molecules that can be re-used by the cell.</p><p>When cells experience starvation, autophagy is not very selective in what it destroys and so it is tightly controlled to avoid damaging important structures in healthy cells. Alongside autophagy, specific proteins in the membrane surrounding a yeast cell can be targeted for destruction by another process called the MVB pathway. Certain membrane proteins are tagged with a small protein called ubiquitin, which leads them to being selectively incorporated into cell compartments called MVBs that then go on to fuse with the vacuole. However, it is not clear how the MVB pathway and autophagy may cooperate to enable the cell to survive periods of starvation.</p><p>Here, Müller et al. monitored the changes in the proteins present in yeast cells during a period of starvation. The experiments show that many different membrane proteins in the yeast cells were destroyed via the MVB pathway within three hours of the removal of their food source. This was essential to allow the cells to carry on producing new proteins at this early stage in starvation. These new proteins included the enzymes found in vacuoles, which increased the ability of the cells to break down the proteins and other cell materials that were transported there via autophagy.</p><p>These findings show how the MVB pathway and autophagy are co-ordinated to allow cells to survive periods of starvation. The next challenge is to work out how the MVB pathway is regulated at the molecular level in response to fluctuations in nutrient availability.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

protein degradation pathways are essential for cell growth and survival. The <underline>u</underline>biquitin-<underline>p</underline>roteasome <underline>s</underline>ystem (UPS) mediates selective poly-ubiquitination of cytoplasmic proteins and their degradation at 26S proteasomes for regulatory and quality control functions. Mis-folded proteins in the <underline>e</underline>ndoplasmic <underline>r</underline>eticulum (ER) are also ubiquitinated, extracted by the <underline>ER</underline>-<underline>a</underline>ssociated protein <underline>d</underline>egradation system (ERAD) and degraded at 26S proteasomes in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vembar and Brodsky, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Macro-autophagy (hereafter autophagy) non-selectively transports bulk cytoplasm into lysosomes. Therefore the induction of autophagy is tightly controlled: under normal growth conditions autophagy operates on a basal level because it is suppressed by signaling from the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamada et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Loewith and Hall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zoncu et al., 2011b</xref>). In response to cellular stress, such as nutrient depletion (e.g., of amino acids), TORC1 is inactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Loewith and Hall, 2011</xref>) and autophagy is strongly induced. Deregulation of autophagic processes is implicated in metabolic and infectious diseases as well as in cancer or neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rubinsztein et al., 2012</xref>). Once induced, the autophagic machinery begins to sequester cytoplasmic components, ribosomes and organelles within a large double-membrane compartment termed the autophagosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang and Klionsky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kraft and Martens, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mizushima et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, some core components of the autophagic machinery such as LC3/Atg8 are transcriptionally induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirisako et al., 1999</xref>). Direct fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes delivers autophagic bodies and the sequestered cargo into the lysosomal lumen. Alternatively, autophagosomes can first fuse with multivesicular bodies (MVBs) to form so-called amphisomes, before they fuse with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seglen et al., 1991</xref>). Finally, the breakdown of autophagic bodies and the efficient degradation of autophagic cargo inside lysosomes is required to recycle amino acids, nucleotides, carbohydrates and lipids back to the cytoplasm. The recycling of these key metabolic building blocks protects cells from their fatal depletion and thus maintains cellular homeostasis to survive nutrient limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Onodera and Ohsumi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vabulas and Hartl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Suraweera et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore evolutionary conserved starvation programs in mammalian cells and yeast expand and strengthen this intracellular recycling system by enhancing the de novo synthesis of vacuolar/lysosomal hydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sardiello et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Settembre et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shen and Mizushima, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition to autophagy, TORC1 also regulates ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis of integral plasma membrane proteins. On the one hand, TORC1 signaling was required to promote the endocytosis of certain plasma membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MacGurn et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, inactivation of TORC1 either by rapamycin or starvation, triggered the endocytosis of other plasma membrane proteins that were subsequently degraded in an ESCRT (<underline>e</underline>ndosomal <underline>s</underline>orting <underline>c</underline>omplex <underline>r</underline>equired for <underline>t</underline>ransport)-dependent manner via the MVB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schmidt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lang et al., 2014</xref>). The extent to which starvation induces plasma membrane remodeling has yet to be determined. Furthermore, how the subsequent ubiquitin-dependent degradation of membrane proteins via the MVB pathway helps to meet the specific metabolic and energetic demands of cells during nutrient limitation is not fully understood. Therefore it is also not clear how selective (MVB) and non-selective (autophagy) lysosomal proteolysis pathways cooperate to mediate cell survival during nutrient limitation.</p><p>To comprehensively address these questions we have used quantitative proteomics. Our results demonstrate that within the first 3 hr of amino acid starvation many integral plasma membrane proteins, including high-affinity amino acid permeases, glucose transporters and G-protein coupled receptors, were selectively removed from the cell surface by endocytosis and subsequently targeted into vacuoles via the ESCRT-dependent MVB pathway and degraded, while others remained stable or were up-regulated (e.g., the general amino acid permease, Gap1). This comprehensive and selective remodeling of the plasma membrane appeared to be completed within 3–4 hr of starvation. Autophagy was also immediately activated upon starvation and remained active throughout starvation. Surprisingly, early during starvation the selective degradation of membrane proteins via the MVB pathway was mainly responsible to maintain critical levels of free intracellular amino acids that were sufficient to uphold protein synthesis and promote the corresponding adaptation of the proteome. Most notably this included the de novo synthesis of vacuolar hydrolases, which boosted the proteolytic activity of vacuoles to support the efficient degradation of autophagic cargo. The continuous delivery and degradation of autophagic cargo further enhanced intracellular amino acid recycling and was ultimately essential to restore intracellular amino acid pools of cells during extended starvation. These findings reveal an unexpected role for the MVB pathway in maintaining intracellular amino acid homeostasis and thereby promoting the up-regulation of vacuolar hydrolases early during starvation, which is tightly coordinated with autophagy. This catabolic cascade is ultimately required to allow starving cells to complete their cell division cycle and enter a quiescent state for survival.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Starvation induces selective and non-selective protein degradation pathways</title><p>To understand how the MVB pathway, autophagy and proteasomal degradation cooperate during nutrient limitation, we first analyzed the starvation-induced degradation of model proteins in yeast.</p><p>To assess selective membrane protein degradation via the MVB pathway, we followed the ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis of the plasma membrane methionine permease, Mup1-GFP and its transport into the vacuole in response to starvation (for amino acids and nitrogen sources) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Menant et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2012</xref>).

Therefore we determined the degradation of highly abundant selective (ribosomes) and non-selective (Fba1) autophagic cargoes. Growing yeast cells contain about 200,000 ribosomes that occupy up to 30–40% of the cytoplasmic volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Warner, 1999</xref>). Upon starvation, otherwise stable ribosomes are among the first autophagic cargoes and rapidly degraded by selective (ribophagy) and non-selective autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kraft et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ossareh-Nazari et al., 2014</xref>). We monitored the release of free GFP from two different ribosomal proteins by western blotting: Rpl25-GFP (large subunit) and Rps2-GFP (small subunit). Both are fully functional GFP fusion proteins that incorporate into ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kraft et al., 2008</xref>). When equal amounts of cell lysates were subjected to western-blot analysis, the protein levels of full length Mup1-GFP and the GFP-tagged ribosomal subunits were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 6, 16). After 3 hr, at a time when the majority of full length Mup1-GFP was already degraded, free GFP from Rpl25 was first detected, showing that autophagy was also delivering cytoplasmic contents into the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 8). During subsequent starvation the protein levels of free GFP from both ribosomal subunits increased. Monitoring the autophagy-dependent degradation of Fba1-GFP, one of the most abundant cytoplasmic proteins with approximately 1.000.000 molecules/cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>), yielded similar results. Free GFP was first detected after 3 hr of starvation and the protein levels free GFP strongly increased during subsequent starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To determine the earliest possible starvation-induced autophagic activity, we monitored the transport and degradation of fully functional GFP-Atg8. Atg8 is a core component of the autophagic machinery that remains conjugated to the inner membrane of all selective and non-selective autophagosomes, including <underline>c</underline>ytoplasm to <underline>v</underline>acuole <underline>t</underline>argeting (cvt)-vesicles. Therefore Atg8 is degraded together with autophagic cargo inside vacuoles. To be able to compare the degradation of GFP-Atg8 to Mup1-GFP, 10 times more lysate of cells expressing GFP-Atg8 was subjected to western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Small amounts of free GFP released from GFP-Atg8 inside vacuoles could be readily detected by western blot analysis 1 hr after the onset of starvation and the levels of free GFP strongly increased at 3 hr of starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 27–30). These findings are consistent with the strong increase of endogenous Atg8 levels during starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) as observed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirisako et al., 1999</xref>). Previous work also demonstrated that Atg8 protein levels control the size of autophagosomes but not the frequency (about 9 autophagosomes/hour) by which they are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeliovich et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xie et al., 2008</xref>). Hence, the increase in Atg8 protein levels during the first 4 hr of starvation would result in the formation of bigger (but not more) autophagosomes that could capture larger volumes of cytoplasm later during starvation. Our results for the early degradation of GFP-Atg8 and the continuous increase in autophagic degradation of highly abundant selective as well as non-selective cargoes throughout starvation are fully consistent with this model. This idea was further supported using the Pho8<italic>∆</italic>60 assay, a sensitive method to measure bulk autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Noda et al., 1995</xref>). Pho8<italic>∆</italic>60 activity was low under rich conditions, began to increase during the first 3 hr of starvation and continuously increased during extended periods of starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results show that autophagy is immediately activated upon starvation and delivers increasing volumes of cytoplasmic material into the vacuole with ongoing starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we investigated how cytoplasmic proteins were degraded at proteasomes upon starvation. Therefore, we employed a ubiquitin-GFP (Ub-GFP) fusion protein, which is an established reporter for proteasomal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vabulas and Hartl, 2005</xref>). It is detected at low levels in proliferating cells reflecting the equilibrium between its rapid degradation and its synthesis. Upon starvation, Ub-GFP was rapidly degraded at 26S proteasomes. The degradation of the reporter was exclusively dependent on proteasomal degradation but did not require autophagy or the MVB pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lanes 5–7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these findings indicate that starvation triggered protein degradation by different selective and non-selective degradation pathways: the constitutive protein degradation via the proteasome was active from the onset of starvation and was previously suggested to play a key role upon acute nutrient restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vabulas and Hartl, 2005</xref>). Our results further suggest that both autophagy and starvation induced-endocytosis were simultaneously activated early during starvation. Autophagy continuously delivered ever-increasing volumes of cytoplasm into vacuoles, whereas the starvation-induced degradation of membrane proteins was completed within 3 hr. These findings suggest an important role for the MVB pathway early during starvation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The MVB pathway and autophagy contribute differentially to maintain free amino acid levels and protein synthesis during starvation</title><p>While protein degradation at 26S proteasomes provides an immediate amino acid pool for protein synthesis already within minutes of acute starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vabulas and Hartl, 2005</xref>) and autophagy is required to supply amino acids during extended periods of starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Onodera and Ohsumi, 2005</xref>), the relative contribution of the MVB pathway to overall amino acid homeostasis was not clear.</p><p>Therefore we next measured the intracellular levels of 18 different amino acids in isogeneic WT cells, MVB (<italic>vps4∆)</italic> or autophagy (<italic>atg8∆</italic>) mutants as well as double mutants (<italic>vps4∆, atg8∆</italic>) by liquid chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altmann, 1992</xref>).

In WT cells the levels of most amino acids continued to decrease for another hour. Interestingly, at around 4 hr of starvation the overall levels of amino acids almost fully recovered, suggesting strong amino acid recycling. However, the levels of arginine and lysine, which were among the most abundant free amino acids, decreased further. The levels of glutamine, threonine and glycine did not recover very well, while the levels of other amino acids (particularly of glutamate) increased. The recovery of amino acid levels after 4 hr of starvation was strongly dependent on autophagy. These results are at large consistent with previous findings, where an approximately threefold reduction in intracellular amino acid levels was detected during the first 2 hr of starvation and autophagy was required for the partial recovery of amino acid levels from 3 to 6 hr of starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Onodera and Ohsumi, 2005</xref>). In our strain background the levels of amino acids were generally lower under rich growth and we observed an approximately twofold reduction in intracellular amino acids during the first 2 hr of starvation.

Already 1 hr after starvation, <sup>35</sup>S-label incorporation was reduced to 40% in WT cells. During the next 3 hr of starvation, WT cells managed to maintain protein synthesis at this level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lanes 1, 5, 9,13, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Amino acid- and carbohydrate-metabolic pathways were up-regulated to meet the demands of starving cells. Most vacuolar hydrolases were also up-regulated in response to nutrient limitation, indicating that starving cells enhanced the catabolic activity and thus the recycling capacity of their vacuoles. Components of the autophagic machinery, including Atg1 and Atg8, were also up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, cell wall components, proteins required for ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle/division were down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This reflects known cellular responses to starvation, such as reduced cell growth and protein synthesis, exit from mitosis and entry into quiescence.</p><p>Strikingly, the GO analysis also revealed that plasma membrane proteins were among the most frequently down-regulated cellular components during starvation. Not only Mup1, but many other plasma membrane proteins, including diverse high affinity nutrient permeases required for the transport of sugars (Itr1, Hxt2, 3), nucleobases (Fur4), amino acids (Bap3, Gnp1, Tat1, Can1) and ammonium (Ato3) but also the G-protein coupled receptor Ste2 were down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and degraded via the MVB pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This comprehensive starvation-induced remodeling of the plasma membrane was highly selective. The protein levels of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, Pma1, were not dramatically altered. The majority of Pma1 remained at the cell surface and only a small portion was delivered into the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Moreover, the general amino acid permease Gap1 and the ammonium permease Mep2 were strongly up-regulated and the majority of Gap1 was retained at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>).</p><p>To define how the MVB pathway contributed to proteome remodeling, the same proteomic experiment was performed with an isogenic ESCRT mutant (<italic>vps4∆</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> lower panel, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). To compare starvation-induced proteome remodeling in WT cells and <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants, we restricted our analysis to 2694 proteins that were reliably quantified in both strains under rich and starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Correlation analysis (R = 0.82, p &lt; 1e-16) revealed that WT cells and <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants up- or down-regulated similar proteins in response to starvation, suggesting that ESCRT mutants are not generally deficient in inducing a starvation response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, data correlation analysis indicated that a majority of proteins in <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants showed less pronounced changes during starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To address this observation over the entire datasets, we calculated the frequency by which changes in protein abundance occurred in WT cells or <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants. This analysis showed that the distribution of protein ratios was broader in WT cells (blue curve) than in the <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants (green curve) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, p &lt; 6e-16). Hence in WT cells more proteins were stronger up- or down-regulated under starvation compared to ESCRT mutants, where changes in protein levels were less pronounced.</p><p>An additional direct quantitative analysis of the proteomes of WT cells (labeled with heavy <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub><sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-lysine) and <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants growing under rich conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>) showed the narrowest ratio distribution (red curve) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These results indicate that the MVB pathway has a small and selective effect on the proteome of cells growing under rich conditions, but becomes critical to support proteome remodeling once extra-cellular amino acids become limiting.</p><p>To pinpoint processes that were particularly dependent on the MVB pathway during starvation, we identified 135 proteins that showed the most significant differences in changes of protein abundance between WT cells and <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>). From this analysis it became additionally evident that most proteins were (with few exceptions) stronger up- or down-regulated in WT cells (black bars) than in <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants (white bars). GO analysis of these 135 proteins identified three processes that were primarily differentially regulated between <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants and WT cells upon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Based on this analysis we conclude that in the first 3 hr of starvation the MVB pathway is particularly required (i) for the degradation of plasma-membrane proteins, as expected, which probably helps to maintain intracellular amino acid levels; (ii) to increase the protein levels of vacuolar hydrolases and thereby enhance the catabolic processes in vacuoles and also (iii) to down-regulate proteins that control the cell division cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Boosting vacuolar catabolism early during starvation depends on the de novo synthesis of vacuolar hydrolases, which requires the MVB pathway</title><p>Our quantitative proteomic analysis indicated that most vacuolar proteases, in particular Prb1, but also Ape1, Cps1 and Pep4, were up-regulated during the first 3 hr of starvation in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4A, 5A</xref>). Also other types of vacuolar hydrolytic enzymes were induced during that time, like the alpha-mannosidase Ams1 or the ribonuclease Rny1. To directly assess how the catabolic activity of vacuoles changed during starvation, we measured the enzymatic activity of vacuolar alkaline phosphatase, Pho8. The transmembrane protein Pho8 is delivered to the vacuole via the AP-3 pathway, which functions independently of the ESCRT machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cowles et al., 1997</xref>). Pho8 activity requires proteolytic maturation of Pho8 by Pep4 on the C-terminus. An additional uncharacterized endoproteolytic activity further cleaves mPho8 to yield a soluble sPho8 inside the vacuole that can be specifically measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Song, 2006</xref>). In a yeast mutant that was deficient for three major vacuolar peptidases (<italic>pep4∆</italic>, <italic>prb1∆</italic>, <italic>prc1∆</italic>), Pho8 was not matured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lane 1) and Pho8 activity was not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants the Pep4-dependent maturation to mPho8 was not impaired under rich growth conditions or starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lane 3–5). In all cells sPho8 levels were low under rich conditions, which corresponded to low Pho8 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Within the first 3 hr of starvation, sPho8 activity increased at least fivefold in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), consistent with the de novo synthesis of vacuolar proteases resulting in increased endoproteolytic activity generating sPho8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> lane 3). In the following 15 hr of starvation Pho8 activity only doubled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Hence the major boost for the catabolic activity of vacuoles occurs during the first 3 hr of starvation. In two different mutants that block autophagy (<italic>atg8∆</italic> and <italic>atg5∆</italic> mutants), sPho8 activity still increased 3–5 fold during the first 3 hr of starvation similar to WT cells, but failed to increase further upon extended starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that autophagy was not required to boost the catabolic activity of vacuoles early during starvation.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07736.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Boosting the catabolic activity of vacuoles during starvation requires the MVB pathway.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Starvation-induced changes in the protein levels of various vacuolar hydrolases based on SILAC data in WT (black) and <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants (white).

Upon starvation sPho8 activity merely doubled in <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants during first hours of starvation and never reached levels comparable to WT cells or autophagy mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). ESCRT-I (<italic>vps23∆</italic>) or ESCRT-II (vps36<italic>∆</italic>) mutants were also severely impaired in increasing the catabolic activity of their vacuoles during starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>SILAC based quantification of vacuolar hydrolases in starving <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants revealed that the protein levels of most vacuolar hydrolases including Prb1, Ape1, Cps1 and Pep4 were only marginally induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Therefore mPho8 was not efficiently cleaved to sPho8 in <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> lane 5) and the catabolic activity of vacuoles in ESCRT mutants failed to increase early during starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The inability of ESCRT mutants to increase the protein levels of vacuolar proteases appears to culminate in a failure to boost the catabolic activity of vacuoles early during starvation. This is best explained by the central role of the MVB pathway in maintaining intracellular amino acid levels for protein synthesis early during starvation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Boosting the catabolic activity of vacuoles requires membrane protein degradation via the MVB pathway</title><p>ESCRT mutants also have a minor sorting defect for soluble vacuolar hydrolases, which are aberrantly secreted, mainly because Vps10, the sorting receptor for multiple vacuolar hydrolases (e.g.: Pep4 and Prc1) recycles less efficiently between endosomes and the golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bankaitis et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rothman and Stevens, 1986</xref>). Hence, severe mis-sorting and strong secretion of vacuolar hydrolases might alternatively explain the failure of ESCRT mutants to recycle amino acids, maintain protein synthesis and boost the catabolic activity of vacuoles.</p><p>Therefore we next analyzed the extent to which the mis-sorting of vacuolar hydrolases would contribute to the here describe phenotypes of ESCRT mutant. First, we determined the subcellular localization of the master protease Pep4-GFP and Prc1/CPY-RFP in ESCRT mutants under rich growth or starvation using live cell fluorescence microscopy. Pep4-GFP localized to the class E compartment in ESCRT mutants, but a large fraction of Pep4-GFP was also delivered into the lumen of the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Similar results were obtained for a construct containing the vacuolar sorting signal of Prc1/CPY fused to RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Hence, a considerable fraction of vacuolar hydrolases still arrived in the lumen of the vacuole where they fully matured and were active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig5">Figures 3E, 5</xref>). Notably, ESCRT mutants, unlike other endo-lysosomal trafficking complexes including HOPS, CORVET or retromer, were never identified as <italic>pep</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones, 1977</xref>) because they displayed relatively minor mis-sorting of vacuolar hydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bankaitis et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rothman and Stevens, 1986</xref>), which kept their vacuoles catabolically active.</p><p>Earlier reports suggested that the overexpression of Vps10 can selectively rescue the partial mis-sorting of vacuolar hydrolases (CPY/Prc1, Pep4) in <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants but not the degradation of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babst et al., 1998</xref>). As expected, Mup1-GFP still localized to class E compartments and was not delivered into vacuoles in <italic>vps4∆</italic> cells overexpressing Vps10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Yet, Vps10 overexpression alleviated mis-sorting of vacuolar enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and thus increased the catabolic activity of vacuoles in <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants to 80% of WT levels under rich growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Despite this restoration of vacuolar catabolic activity prior to starvation, overexpression of Vps10 failed to rescue intracellular amino acid levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>) in <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants throughout starvation.</p><p>It seems that the cellular defects of ESCRT mutants during starvation can be mostly attributed to their inability to degrade membrane proteins. <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants but also <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants overexpressing Vps10 could not efficiently up-regulate the de novo synthesis of vacuolar hydrolases in time. Therefore the catabolic activity of vacuoles remained low during starvation in <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants overexpressing Vps10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This is further emphasized by the impairment of ESCRT mutants to efficiently increase the protein levels of two other hydrolases, Ape1 and Ams1, during starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Both Ape1 and Ams1 are delivered to vacuoles via the cvt-pathway and hence will not be secreted or mis-sorted in ESCRT mutants.</p><p>All of these findings are consistent with the idea that selective membrane protein degradation via the MVB pathway, rather than the mere sorting of vacuolar hydrolases, is essential to maintain sufficient free intracellular amino acids to uphold protein synthesis for proteome remodeling early during starvation. It thereby contributes essentially to the de novo synthesis of vacuolar hydrolases to concomitantly boost of the catabolic activity of vacuoles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Boosting the catabolic activity of vacuoles early during starvation is essential for the efficient degradation of autophagic cargo</title><p>Next we tested if the MVB-dependent de novo synthesis of vacuolar hydrolases and the subsequent boost in hydrolytic activity was also required to break down and recycle autophagic cargo.</p><p>Our proteomic studies comparing WT cells and <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants growing under rich conditions indicated that Atg8 protein levels were increased in <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants when compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

In yeast, starvation results in a stable G<sub>1</sub>/G<sub>0</sub> arrest, which can be scored by the increase of unbudded cells.

Immediately upon nutrient limitation, the degradation of cytoplasmic proteins by the UPS acutely supplies amino acids to maintain protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vabulas and Hartl, 2005</xref>). Starvation also inactivates TORC1 signaling, which probably simultaneously stimulates autophagy as well as starvation-induced endocytosis. Once TORC1 signaling is turned off, Atg13 is quickly dephosphorylated, which allows the formation of the Atg1/Ulk1 kinase complex to induce autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamada et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2010</xref>).</p><p>The TORC1/Npr1 signaling axis also controls at least in part starvation-induced endocytosis, by regulating different arrestin-like adaptors (ARTs) for Rsp5, the major ubiquitin ligase required for endocytosis in yeast. Thereby TORC1 signaling orchestrates the selective remodeling of the plasma membrane proteome under different growth conditions and additionally could increase protein turnover via the MVB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schmidt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Léon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MacGurn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boeckstaens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crapeau et al., 2014</xref>). Our results demonstrate for the first time that starvation induces a massive but still selective remodeling of the plasma membrane proteome. At least 18 different integral plasma membrane proteins undergo starvation-induced endocytosis including different amino acid permeases, sugar transporters and the G-protein coupled receptor, Ste2. Within a few hours these membrane proteins are transported via the MVB pathway into vacuoles for degradation. How TORC1 signaling could control Rsp5-dependent cargo specificity and the selective ubiquitinylation of many different cargoes at the same time is currently not clear.</p><p>Our results further demonstrate that the ESCRT-dependent degradation of these membrane proteins in vacuoles is essential to maintain a critical pool of free amino acids for protein synthesis. This enables the de novo synthesis of vacuolar hydrolases that are required to boost the catabolic activity of vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Thereby, the MVB pathway ensures that the catabolic activity of the vacuole is up-regulated in time to allow subsequent, efficient degradation of autophagic cargo. Only when these conditions are met, autophagy considerably contributes to amino acid recycling during extended starvation to restore intracellular amino acid levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Komatsu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Onodera and Ohsumi, 2005</xref>). Since the MVB pathway is also in part required for the proper targeting of hydrolases into the vacuole, it might even fulfill a dual function. Yet, our results emphasize that a significant fraction of vacuolar hydrolases are sorted into the lumen of vacuoles in ESCRT mutants, where they mature and become active. Furthermore, if the observed phenotypes in ESCRT mutants would be caused solely by mis-sorting of vacuolar hydrolases, this would lead to a delay in autophagy-mediated amino acid recycling. In this case their defects during starvation should be similar or even weaker when compared to autophagy mutants. The partial sorting defects for vacuolar hydrolases are thus not consistent with the stronger defects of ESCRT mutants in maintaining amino acid levels, protein synthesis and cell growth early during nutrient limitation. Moreover it was possible to restore the catabolic activity of vacuoles in ESCRT mutants under rich growth conditions, while this was no longer possible during starvation. Hence it seems that mainly the selective degradation of membrane proteins as a source for amino acids, rather than just the sorting of vacuolar hydrolases, contributes to the key role of the MVB pathway during starvation. At the moment it is not clear why the MVB pathway appears to be more critical than autophagy to maintain intracellular amino acids levels early during starvation. We speculate that membrane proteins that have been selected for degradation via the MVB are for the most part not re-synthesized, while non-selective autophagy will inevitably also capture and degrade proteins that are still needed and thus have to be replaced. Hence, selective protein degradation may at least initially provide a bigger added value for the free intracellular amino acid pool as compared to the non-selective degradation of bulk cytoplasm by autophagy. The ESCRT machinery has recently been described to contribute to selective micro-autophagy on late endosomes in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sahu et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, ESCRT-dependent catabolic pathways may not be limited to membrane proteins, although our study did not experimentally address this possibility.</p><p>Ultimately our results suggest that only the coordinated action of the MVB pathway and autophagy provides sufficient intracellular recycling capacity during starvation to allow efficient mitotic exit and entry into a stable G<sub>1</sub>/G<sub>0</sub> quiescent state and thereby ensures cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood but probably require amino acid recycling from the vacuole to the cytoplasm via vacuolar amino acid permeases. Alternatively, the evolutionary conserved EGO/LAMTOR/Ragulator complex in conjugation with a lysosomal amino acid sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dubouloz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sancak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zoncu et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rebsamen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) could somehow measure free amino acids in the lumen of lysosomes and transiently re-activate TORC1 to complete the final cell division cycle prior to entry into quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matsui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cells, loss of the ESCRT machinery interferes with a late step in autophagy, namely the fusion of amphisomes with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Filimonenko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rusten et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Gao, 2009</xref>). Amphisomes are acidic pre-lysosomal hybrid organelles of MVBs/late endosomes and autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stromhaug and Seglen, 1993</xref>), Thus, our findings that a functional MVB pathway is key to boost the catabolic activity may not be restricted to lysosomes but may also include MVB-derived amphisomes and thereby ensure the efficient degradation of autophagic cargo in higher eukaryotes. In yeast autophagosomes appear to fuse directly with vacuoles and amphisomes have not been described. Consistently, we and others demonstrated that loss of ESCRT function does not significantly impair the autophagic machinery itself or the delivery of autophagic cargo into lysosomes in yeast or <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reggiori et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Djeddi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our results show that the MVB pathway takes a central role in cellular homeostasis to preserve and redistribute biomass that can be used to maintain cell growth under nutrient limitation. It is tempting to speculate that during transient nutrient fluctuations or changes in metabolism a more stepwise activation of this catabolic cascade with initial selective protein degradation via UPS and the MVB pathway might help to delay massive non-selective breakdown of cytoplasm via autophagy, at least for some time. This might provide a safety mechanism to protect cells from the immediate need for non-selective protein degradation. While the ESCRT machinery has acquired additional roles in diverse biological processes in higher eukaryotes, we propose that the central role of the MVB pathway in the catabolic cascade of eukaryotic cells during starvation is evolutionary conserved.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p>All experiments were performed with SEY6210 yeast strains, except for Pho8∆60-expressing strains, strains used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref> and prototrophic strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), which were derived from BY4741 or BY4742.

Cultures from rich medium were harvested by vacuum filtration, washed twice with ice cold YNB medium (with 2% glucose and ammonium sulfate but without amino acids) and twice with ice cold 60% methanol. Starving cultures were washed twice with ice cold 60% methanol. All cell pellets were air-dried over night and weighed. Amino acids were ethanol-extracted and analyzed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altmann, 1992</xref>). Norvalin (8 nmol/mg dry weight) was the internal standard. For the representation of each individual amino acid, the measured values were normalized by the maximum measured amino acid content across all conditions and replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Bud index</title><p>Cells were briefly sonicated and visually scored for emerging buds by bright-field microscopy.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank SD Emr, RN Collins and MD Erlacher for yeast strains and reagents and DJ Klionsky and R Loewith for antibodies.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor), Noboru Mizushima (Reviewing editor), and two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript of Mueller et al. focuses on the relative contribution of the MVB pathway to cellular amino acid homeostasis during starvation. The authors reveal that cells act in a consecutive manner to mobilize amino acids from cytosolic proteins (presumably via the proteasome), membrane proteins (via the MVB pathway), and finally bulk cytosolic proteins via autophagy. Taking a proteomic approach to compare MVB mutant and wild-type cells, the authors show that starvation is coupled to a massive remodeling of the proteome, where multiple hydrolases are upregulated to allow degradation of membrane proteins. The authors conclude that the MVB pathway is critical to supply amino acids for survival of cells during the early phase of starvation, which is followed by autophagy activation.</p><p>Some of these observations on MVB were previously made (Jones et al. Traffic 2012), whereas Müller et al. take a more global comparative approach by following both MVB and autophagy pathway in parallel. Overall, we think that this paper is important and seems mostly sounds.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The data showing the sequential activation of the MVB pathway and autophagy during starvation is not strong. Autophagy can be immediately initiated after starvation. It is recommended to use GFP-Atg8 as another autophagy marker in addition to Rpl25-GFP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, which may show faster kinetics. Indeed, free GFP is clearly detected at 2h after starvation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>.</p><p>2) It is also essential to show that the amino acid pool is indeed reduced in <italic>vps4∆</italic> cells during early starvation. It was previously shown that the amino acid levels are reduced in autophagy mutants compared to wild-type cells at as early as 3h after starvation (Onodera and Ohsumi, JBC 2005). A similar experiment should be performed using MVB, autophagy, and double mutant cells, which will provide important information on relative contributions of these two pathways, in terms of both time and quantity, to the amino acid pool during starvation.</p><p>3) Although the phenotype of <italic>vps4∆</italic> cells suggests that starvation-induced cargo degradation in the MVBs is important to supply amino acids for synthesis of vacuolar enzymes, it is still possible that, in <italic>vps4∆</italic> cells, delivery of hydrolases to the vacuole is defective, which affects the vacuolar function independently of amino acid supply. These two possibilities are not clearly distinguished. In particular, the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figures 4A, 4B, and 6B</xref> suggest that there may be a defect in the vacuolar function even in growing conditions or during a very short starvation period in <italic>vps4∆</italic> cells. This needs to be further clarified to support the authors' main conclusion.</p><p>4) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> should be quantified because, as the authors mention in Discussion, several papers have reported that the ESCRT machinery is important for a late step of autophagy (i.e. autolysosome formation).</p><p>5) The authors mention that selected membrane proteins are degraded during starvation. The methionine permease Mup1 is certainly degraded very efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Do they also have examples of membrane proteins that are unaffected? Can they discuss how the cell can distinguish which proteins are degraded selectively?</p><p>6) In the same experiment, do the authors use Met/Cys free medium when they label cells under nutrient rich conditions? Otherwise, relative activity of 35S-Met/Cys would be different between the rich and starved conditions.</p><p>7) The ESCRT-mediated MVB formation would be important for degradation of not only membrane proteins but also cytosolic proteins that are engulfed inside intraluminal vesicles. This is a reminiscence of microautophagy. Indeed, it was reported by Cuervo's lab that MBV formation contributes to the degradation of cytosolic proteins (Sahu et al. Dev Cell. 2011, 20:131). This possibility should also be discussed.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the decision after re-review follows, after which the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your revised work entitled “The sequential action of the MVB pathway and autophagy ensures cell survival during starvation” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and one of the original reviewers.</p><p>The authors have responded to reviewers concerns by including new data, but major concerns still remain that preclude the publication of the paper at this time. The concerns of the reviewers follow.</p><p>1) The data presented on GFP-Atg8n in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> together with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> shows a relative rapid induction in autophagy activity during starvation. Thus, it is inappropriate to suggest: “the degradation of cytoplasmic contents via autophagy passed through an initial lag phase and peaked later during starvation, when compared to membrane protein degradation via the MVB pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>)”. The time at which degradation of a protein peaks depends not only on the degradation activity, but also its rate of synthesis and total expression level. The authors have used selective cargos to monitor MVB pathway, it is also important to use selective cargos (e.g. GFP-Atg8) to monitor autophagy and discuss their temporal relationship and relative contributions. The response of the authors to this concern is not acceptable, for example, the expression levels of Atgs are not direct indicators of autophagic activity.</p><p>2) The authors show increased amino acid levels in wild-type cells during starvation. This is puzzling and inconsistent with a previous report (Onodera and Ohsumi, JBC 2005), where the amino acid concentration was dramatically reduced even in wild-type cells and more profoundly in autophagy mutant cells. The authors do not discuss this apparent discrepancy. This should be addressed experimentally.</p><p>3) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> reveals a clear defect in processing of mPho8 into sPho8 even under growing conditions. This indicates a defect in vacuolar hydrolytic activity. Indeed, the authors describe a partial sorting defects of vacuolar hydrolases in ESCRT mutants and they have tried to rescue them by over expression of Vps10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, this was performed only for data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. Vps10 rescue experiments should be included in other experiments that measure the amino acid pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and autophagic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These are more relevant to the potential function of the MVB pathway as an amino acid generator. It is also unclear why over expression of Vps10 cannot rescue the pho8 activity under starvation conditions. Taken together, it is likely that defects in protein turnover observed in ESCRT mutants are due to a combination of defects in sorting of vacuolar enzymes and generation of amino acids.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07736.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The data showing the sequential activation of the MVB pathway and autophagy during starvation is not strong.

Therefore we have also slightly modified our model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> (upper panel) to avoid possible misunderstanding. Starvation induced cargo ubiquitination and autophagy are probably simultaneously induced once TORC1 signaling is switched off due to nutrient limitation, as discussed in the original manuscript. Yet, while the constitutive MVB pathway can readily degrade ubiquitinated membrane proteins, autophagy cannot immediately operate at maximal capacity. Throughout starvation, there is a gradual increase in the magnitude, strength and efficiency of non-selective autophagy. It takes time and cellular resources to ramp up the autophagic machinery until it efficiently captures bulk cytoplasm for efficient amino acid recycling. All our data support this concept:</p><p>A) The delivery of cytoplasm by the autophagic machinery gradually increases during extended starvation. This is a well-accepted concept and supported using a Pho8 60 assay, a sensitive method to measure autophagy early during starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (Noda, T. et al. 1995). Pho8 60 activity increases in the first 3 hours of starvation, indicating the onset of autophagy. Yet the major increase is observed later after overnight starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is also consistent with the autophagic delivery of highly abundant cytoplasmic proteins such as ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) or Fba1 (1.000.000 molecules/cell) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>B) Our new results demonstrate that at the onset of starvation, GFP-Atg8 is approximately 10–20 times less abundant and almost not detectable when directly compared to Mup1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both constructs are expressed from their endogenous promoters. Some Atg8 is transported into the vacuole about 2-3 hours after starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and overall Atg8 protein levels strongly increase to enhance autophagy during starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), Kirisako, T. 1999 JCB). In contrast Mup1-GFP and other membrane proteins (e.g.: Can1, Ste2, Fur4) are almost completely degraded after 3 hours of starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3">Figure 1, 3</xref>).</p><p>C) These findings are also consistent with the idea that higher Atg8 protein levels allow to grow larger phagophores that would engulf increasing amounts of bulk cytoplasm (Xie Z. et al. 2008, MBoC; Abelovich H. et al. 2000, JCB).</p><p>D) This induction of the autophagic machinery is also reflected by our quantitative proteomic data. The protein levels of Atg8 (3.7 fold increase) and other autophagy core components such as Atg1 (3.3 fold increase), Atg3 (1.5 fold increase), Atg7 (1.4 fold increase) and Atg15 (2.5 fold induction) increase during starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, Figure 3–source data 1).</p><p>E) The protein levels of the selective autophagic cargo Ape1 strongly increase early during starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figure 4, 6</xref>). Similarly, the protein levels of Ams1, another selective autophagic cargo molecule, increase during starvation. Hence early clipping of Atg8, at least in part, also indicates an increase of the Atg19&gt; dependent biosynthetic delivery of pApe1 and pAms1 to the vacuole alongside bulk autophagy (Scott et al. 2001 Mol. Cell; Sawa-Makarska J,. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2014).</p><p>F) All of this is consistent with our results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Even highly abundant autophagy substrates such as two different ribosomal subunits (Rps2 and Rpl25) are not immediately captured by autophagy and only efficiently delivered into vacuoles upon extended periods of starvation. Similar results were obtained using Fba1-GFP, which is one of the most abundant cytoplasmic proteins (app. 1.000.000 molecules / cell; Ghaemmaghami S, Nature 2003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>G) Finally our analysis of amino acids levels during starvation demonstrates that the MVB pathway provides amino acids prior to autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, see below).</p><p>Taken together, all our data support the idea that the MVB pathway and autophagy contribute sequentially to cell survival during nutrient limitation. Selective protein degradation pathways (UPS and MVB pathway) bridge the gap in amino acid recycling before an efficient autophagic response develops.</p><p><italic>2) It is also essential to show that the amino acid pool is indeed reduced in</italic> vps4<italic>∆ cells during early starvation. It was previously shown that the amino acid levels are reduced in autophagy mutants compared to wild-type cells at as early as 3h after starvation (Onodera and Ohsumi, JBC 2005). A similar experiment should be performed using MVB, autophagy, and double mutant cells, which will provide important information on relative contributions of these two pathways, in terms of both time and quantity, to the amino acid pool during starvation</italic>.</p><p>We have measured free amino acid levels two and four hours after starvation in WT cells, ESCRT mutants (<italic>vps4</italic>), autophagy mutants (<italic>atg8</italic>) and the double mutant (<italic>vps4</italic>, <italic>atg8</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Under rich growth conditions the amino acid levels of WT cells, ESCRT mutants, autophagy mutants and the double mutants are comparable. Already two hours after starvation the levels of free amino acids were lower in ESCRT mutants when compared to WT cells or autophagy mutants. The double mutant always showed the strongest reduction in amino acid levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Although the phenotype of</italic> vps4<italic>∆ cells suggests that starvation-induced cargo degradation in the MVBs is important to supply amino acids for synthesis of vacuolar enzymes, it is still possible that, in</italic> vps4<italic>∆ cells, delivery of hydrolases to the vacuole is defective, which affects the vacuolar function independently of amino acid supply. These two possibilities are not clearly distinguished. In particular, the data shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6"><italic>Figures 4A, 4B, and 6B</italic></xref> <italic>suggest that there may be a defect in the vacuolar function even in growing conditions or during a very short starvation period in</italic> vps4<italic>∆ cells. This needs to be further clarified to support the authors' main conclusion</italic>.</p><p>The graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> displays the starvation-induced up-regulation of vacuolar hydrolases in WT and ESCRT mutants. The results show that ESCRT mutants cannot efficiently upregulate vacuolar hydrolases during starvation. Yet, under rich conditions, the total protein levels of the vacuolar master peptidase Pep4 were only marginally decreased in ESCRT mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistently under rich and starvation conditions, pPho8, which reaches the vacuole via the AP3 pathway, efficiently matured into mPho8 in WT and ESCRT mutants in a Pep4 dependent manner. pPho8 accumulated in <italic>pep4∆, prb1∆, prc1∆</italic> mutants but not in ESCRT mutants; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lanes 1-5. Yet, the subsequent starvation-induced processing of mPho8 into sPho8 is strongly hampered in ESCRT mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>While there is certainly a subtle maturation defect of Ape1 in ESCRT mutants, not only pApe1 but also mApe1 protein levels are increased under rich conditions, so that overall Ape1 activity is compensated for (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This is in part also due to higher mRNA levels of Ape1 (and also Prb1) under rich conditions, which we determined in separate gene-expression profiling experiment to compare WT cells and ESCRT mutants. Similarly, Atg8 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and mRNA levels are increased in ESCRT mutants. None of these results suggest a strong defect in vacuolar function under rich conditions. The results are more consistent with a partial and relatively minor sorting defect of vacuolar hydrolases.</p><p>In addition, we now specifically rescued the partial sorting defects of vacuolar hydrolases in ESCRT mutants by over-expression of Vps10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Vps10 is the sorting receptor for multiple vacuolar hydrolases. Consistent with previous reports (Babst et al., Embo J., 1998), Vps10 over-expression rescued the partial mis-sorting of vacuolar hydrolases (CPY/Prc1, Pep4) in ESCRT mutants (<italic>vps4</italic>) and hence restored the catabolic activity of vacuoles to &gt;80% of WT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) but not the degradation of membrane proteins. Even though the catabolic activity of ESCRT mutants was restored under rich conditions, ESCRT mutants still failed to boost the catabolic activity of their vacuoles under starvation, and subsequently stopped to grow and failed to enter quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, loss of Vps10 caused a strong sorting defect for vacuolar hydrolases (but not a complete block), without affecting membrane protein delivery into vacuoles via the MVB pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (Whyte, JR. Curr. Biol. 2001). Yet, <italic>vps10</italic> single mutants had more modest effects on cell growth during starvation than loss of the ESCRT pathway, which could be complemented by overexpression of Vps10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings reject a mere role of the MVB pathway for vacuolar sorting of hydrolases, and instead support the idea that selective membrane protein degradation significantly contributes to maintaining cell homeostasis during starvation.</p><p><italic>4) The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5E</italic></xref> <italic>should be quantified because, as the authors mention in Discussion, several papers have reported that the ESCRT machinery is important for a late step of autophagy (i.e. autolysosome formation)</italic>.</p><p>Quantification of the localization of pHluorin-Atg8 in &gt;120 cells demonstrates that pHluorin-Atg8 fluorescence was quenched in the vacuoles of most WT cells and ESCRT (&gt;90%) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In contrast, pHluorin-Atg8 remained fluorescent in the vacuoles of &gt;90% of <italic>pep4∆, prb1∆, prc1∆</italic> and <italic>vma4∆</italic> mutant cells.</p><p><italic>5) The authors mention that selected membrane proteins are degraded during starvation. The methionine permease Mup1 is certainly degraded very efficiently (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref><italic>). Do they also have examples of membrane proteins that are unaffected? Can they discuss how the cell can distinguish which proteins are degraded selectively</italic>?</p><p>The general amino acid permease Gap1 is strongly induced during starvation and transported to the cell surface while other amino acid permeases such as Mup1 or Can1 are endocytosed and degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, Figure 3—figure supplement 2B, C). Interestingly the up -regulation of Gap1 appears to be temporally coordinated with the down-regulation of other membrane proteins and is stronger in WT as compared to ESCRT mutants, consistent with overall reduced proteome remodeling. In addition to Gap1, our quantitative proteomics data also suggest that Mep2 is upregulated and that the total levels of Pma1 do not change significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, Figure 3–figure supplement 2A, Figure 3–source data 2). After some time a portion of Gap1-GFP and Pma1-GFP is also transported to the vacuole by steady state turnover in quiescent cells, but the majority of these membrane proteins remains at the cell surface.</p><p>How growing cells or starving cells select membrane proteins for degradation is currently not entirely clear but probably involves signal transduction-mediated regulation (TORC1/Npr1) of specific adaptors for the HECT-type ubiquitin ligase RSP5. We have included this possibility in the Discussion. In addition we have new data that suggest that distinct ubiquitination sites on Mup1 are required for starvation- vs. ligand-induced endocytosis, but this would go beyond the scope of this study.</p><p><italic>6) In the same experiment, do the authors use Met/Cys free medium when they label cells under nutrient rich conditions? Otherwise, relative activity of 35S-Met/Cys would be different between the rich and starved conditions</italic>.</p><p>We have used Met/Cys free medium for all our experiments and described the media in the Material and methods section.</p><p><italic>7) The ESCRT-mediated MVB formation would be important for degradation of not only membrane proteins but also cytosolic proteins that are engulfed inside intraluminal vesicles. This is a reminiscence of microautophagy. Indeed, it was reported by Cuervo's lab that MBV formation contributes to the degradation of cytosolic proteins (Sahu et al. Dev Cell. 2011, 20:131). This possibility should also be discussed</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have changed the text in the Discussion accordingly: <bold>“</bold>Interestingly, the ESCRT machinery has recently been described to contribute to selective micro-autophagy on late endosomes in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sahu et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, ESCRT-dependent catabolic pathways may not be limited to membrane proteins, although our study did not experimentally address this possibility.”</p><p>[Editors’ note: the manuscript was accepted after being submitted for further consideration by the original reviewers.]</p><p>In the past 12 weeks we have experimentally addressed and clarified all concerns of the reviewers. The detailed answers are attached on the following pages.</p><p>Summary of key experiments:</p><p>a) We thoroughly analyzed the onset of autophagy using GFP-Atg8 in relation to other selective and non-selective autophagic cargoes as well as MVB cargo and we discuss their temporal relationships. Our results are consistent with the essential role of autophagy for amino acid recycling later during starvation (see point b).</p><p>b) We have improved the amino acid analysis. In WT cells, amino acid levels decrease to about 50% during the first 2 hours of starvation and fully recover in an autophagy-dependent manner at around 4 hours of starvation. Most importantly, our analysis also shows that the MVB pathway is essential to maintain free intracellular amino acid pools in the first 2 hours of starvation.</p><p>c) We have measured the amino acid pool, protein synthesis and autophagic activity in <italic>vps4∆</italic> mutants that overexpress Vps10. The results are consistent with the idea that selective membrane protein degradation via the MVB pathway, rather than the mere sorting of vacuolar hydrolases, is essential to maintain sufficient free intracellular amino acids to uphold protein synthesis for proteome remodeling early during starvation.</p><p>To our mind these results further strengthen our model: early during starvation, the degradation of membrane proteins via the MVB pathway is required to maintain a critical intracellular amino acid pool for the synthesis of new proteins, including vacuolar hydrolases to boost the catabolic activity of vacuoles. This primes vacuoles for the efficient degradation of bulk cellular material via autophagy, which is essential to enter a stable G1/G0-arrested, quiescent state. Thus, a coordinated action of the MVB pathway and autophagy is key to survive extended periods of nutrient limitation.</p><p><italic>1) The data presented on GFP-Atg8n in new</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref> <italic>together with</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</italic></xref> <italic>shows a relative rapid induction in autophagy activity during starvation. Thus, it is inappropriate to suggest</italic> “<italic>the degradation of cytoplasmic contents via autophagy passed through an initial lag phase and peaked later during starvation, when compared to membrane protein degradation via the MVB pathway (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1A, B</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>”<italic>. The time at which degradation of a protein peaks depends not only on the degradation activity, but also its rate of synthesis and total expression level. The authors have used selective cargos to monitor MVB pathway, it is also important to use selective cargos (e.g. GFP-Atg8) to monitor autophagy and discuss their temporal relationship and relative contributions. The response of the authors to this concern is not acceptable, for example, the expression levels of Atgs are not direct indicators of autophagic activity</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for critically pointing out that our statement ‘autophagy passed through a lag phase ’ was mis-leading, especially since we never intended to argue that the MVB pathway and autophagy are sequentially activated. Apparently, our intended message, namely that the MVB pathway has an earlier impact on the cellular amino acid levels when compared to autophagy, was not clearly put into words. To avoid this, we have now replaced ‘sequential action<italic>’</italic> with ‘coordinated action’ throughout the manuscript and also in the title.</p><p>In addition, we have performed the recommended experiments and used GFP-Atg8 as an additional marker to determine the vacuolar delivery of all selective and non-selective autophagosomes as well as cvt-vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Small amounts of free GFP released from GFP-Atg8 inside vacuoles could be readily detected by western blot analysis 1 hour after the onset of starvation and the levels of free GFP strongly increased at 3 hours of starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These findings are consistent with the de novo synthesis and the overall increase of endogenous Atg8 during starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) as observed earlier by the Ohsumi lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirisako et al., 1999</xref>). Work from the Klionsky lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeliovich et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xie et al., 2008</xref>) further demonstrated that this increase in Atg8 protein levels was required for the formation of larger (but not more) autophagosomes that could capture larger volumes of cytoplasm during ongoing starvation. Our results showing the early degradation of GFP-Atg8 and the continuous increase in autophagic degradation of highly abundant selective (Rps2, Rpl25) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and non-selective (Fba1, Pho8 60) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) cargoes throughout starvation are fully compatible with this model. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with the essential role of autophagy for amino acid recycling later during starvation (see point b and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>In summary our results suggest that both autophagy and starvation induced-endocytosis are simultaneously activated early during starvation (probably by inactivation of TORC1). Autophagy continuously delivers ever-increasing amounts of cytoplasm into vacuoles and remains active during extended periods of starvation, whereas starvation-induced degradation of membrane proteins via the MVB pathway appears to be completed relatively early (within the first 4 hours of starvation). Our analysis of intracellular amino acid recycling supports this idea and demonstrates that autophagy is essential for amino acid recycling later during starvation, whereas the MVB pathway appears to be more important to maintain intracellular amino acid levels early during starvation (see reply to concern 2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The authors show increased amino acid levels in wild-type cells during starvation. This is puzzling and inconsistent with a previous report (Onodera and Ohsumi, JBC 2005), where the amino acid concentration was dramatically reduced even in wild-type cells and more profoundly in autophagy mutant cells. The authors do not discuss this apparent discrepancy. This should be addressed experimentally</italic>.</p><p>This point was well taken and we now managed to rapidly harvest yeast cells in less than one 1 minute by filtration and thereby avoided starvation conditions during sample preparation. We measured the intracellular levels of 18 different amino acids in WT cells, MVB (<italic>vps4)</italic> or autophagy (<italic>atg8</italic>) mutants or double mutants (<italic>vps4, atg8</italic>) by HPLC. 1 hour after starvation, the total free amino acid pool decreased to similar levels in WT cells and all mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). In WT cells the levels of most amino acids continued to decrease for another hour to about 50% of the levels measured under rich conditions. At around 4 hours of starvation the overall levels of amino acids almost fully recovered in an autophagy-dependent manner. These results are at large consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Onodera and Ohsumi, 2005</xref>), where a decrease to approximately 30% of intracellular amino acid levels was detected during the first two hours of starvation and autophagy was required for the partial recovery of amino acid levels from 3 to 6 hours of starvation. We also discuss these differences in the text.</p><p>Importantly, our amino acid analysis from <italic>vps4</italic> mutants showed that the MVB pathway essentially contributed to maintain the overall levels of free intracellular amino acids at 2 hours of starvation. At this time point, the levels of 14 individual amino acids were lower in <italic>vps4</italic> mutants when compared to WT cells or autophagy mutants and failed to recover during extended starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>).</p><p>These results showed that the MVB pathway was essential to maintain the levels of most free intracellular amino acids in the first 2 hours of starvation, while autophagy was essential to restore intracellular amino acids later during starvation.</p><p><italic>3) The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4B</italic></xref> <italic>reveals a clear defect in processing of mPho8 into sPho8 even under growing conditions. This indicates a defect in vacuolar hydrolytic activity. Indeed, the authors describe a partial sorting defects of vacuolar hydrolases in ESCRT mutants and they have tried to rescue them by over expression of Vps10 (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4D</italic></xref><italic>). However, this was performed only for data shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4D</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1"><italic>Figure 7—figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>. Vps10 rescue experiments should be included in other experiments that measure the amino acid pool (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref><italic>), protein synthesis (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B</italic></xref><italic>), and autophagic activity (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6C</italic></xref><italic>). These are more relevant to the potential function of the MVB pathway as an amino acid generator. It is also unclear why over expression of Vps10 cannot rescue the pho8 activity under starvation conditions. Taken together, it is likely that defects in protein turnover observed in ESCRT mutants are due to a combination of defects in sorting of vacuolar enzymes and generation of amino acids</italic>.</p><p>Vps10 over-expression in <italic>vps4</italic> mutants rescued the partial sorting defects for vacuolar hydrolases but not membrane protein degradation. Consistently, Vps10 over-expression almost completely restored the catabolic activity of vacuoles under rich conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our new experiments further demonstrate that <italic>vps4</italic> mutants overexpressing Vps10 still failed to maintain intracellular amino acid levels and protein synthesis during starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>; Figure 5—figure supplement 2A, B). Therefore <italic>vps4</italic> mutants over-expressing Vps10, similar to <italic>vps4</italic> mutants alone, could not efficiently up-regulate the de novo synthesis of vacuolar hydrolases and thereby boost the catabolic activity of vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which in turn prevented the efficient proteolytic conversion from mPho8 into sPho8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, D</xref>). In consequence autophagic cargo (Rpl25-GFP) was not efficiently degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition, we determined the subcellular localization of the vacuolar master protease Pep4-GFP and Prc1/CPY-RFP in ESCRT mutants under rich growth or starvation using live cell fluorescence microscopy. Pep4-GFP localized to the class E compartment in ESCRT mutants, but a large fraction of Pep4-GFP was also delivered into the lumen of the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Similar results were obtained for Prc1/CPY-RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the lumen of the vacuole the hydrolases matured and were catabolically active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig5">Figure 3E, 5B</xref>). Most likely therefore ESCRT mutants were never isolated as <italic>pep</italic> mutants, unlike other endo-lysosomal trafficking complexes such as HOPS, CORVET or retromer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones, 1977</xref>, Genetics).</p><p>Hence the striking cellular defects of ESCRT mutants during starvation can be mostly attributed to their block in membrane protein degradation, rather than the mere and rather partial sorting defects for vacuolar hydrolases.</p></body></sub-article></article>
