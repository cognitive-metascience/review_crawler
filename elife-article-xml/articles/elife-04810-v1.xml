For example, the embryos were larger than normal when grown at the lower end of their temperature ranges, but were smaller when grown at temperatures close to their upper limit. Shape changes were also seen: the embryos of both species were longer when grown at higher temperatures, a change that increases their surface area relative to their volume and may improve their ability to take up oxygen. Further experiments showed that disrupting respiration in the worms could lead to similar size and shape changes within the thermal range.</p><p>Neves et al.'s findings provide experimental support that respiration plays an important role in setting the temperature ranges in which organisms can live.

Partly as a result, organisms tend to distribute in the ocean and on land according to latitude as well as depth and altitude, although other elements such as availability of food and light also play a role in shaping preferred habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pörtner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pörtner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Prasad et al., 2011</xref>). Despite their importance, the mechanisms that set the thermal limits remain incompletely understood.</p><p>A mismatch between oxygen supply and demand has been suggested to play a role in setting thermal limits in multicellular organisms. This hypothesis, referred to as the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT), derives in part from the observation that oxygen partial pressure in aquatic organisms is constant within a given thermal range and decreases both below the lower thermal limit and above the upper thermal limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pörtner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pörtner et al., 2006</xref>). In agreement with this hypothesis, the metabolic status of some aquatic organisms has been shown to peak at a given temperature and to decrease both below and above that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Melzner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wittmann et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly too, tolerance to high temperatures is increased in an amphibian crab when the animal is in the air compared to when it is in water, reflecting the reduced cost of oxygen supply in air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giomi et al., 2014</xref>), again supporting the OCLTT hypothesis. Overall, these data suggest that thermal limits in complex organisms are characterized by a mismatch in oxygen supply and demand, which would result in reduced energy production and thus limit reproduction and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pörtner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pörtner et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, the temperature-dependence of oxygen diffusion is significantly lower than that of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Woods, 1999</xref>), raising the question of how oxygen supply and demand can be matched, even within the thermal range. One possible solution is suggested by the observation that body size decreases with augmented temperature in the vast majority of ectotherms (‘temperature-size rule’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkinson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Forster et al., 2012</xref>), thereby increasing surface to volume ratio and thus potentially oxygen availability. In support of this, the slope of this ‘temperature-size rule’ is steeper for aquatic organisms than terrestrial organisms, in agreement with the lower availability of oxygen in water compared to air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Forster et al., 2012</xref>). This has led to the suggestion that alterations in cell size in response to changes in temperature within the thermal range are adaptive responses to preserve aerobic capacity, which has been dubbed the MASROS hypothesis (<underline>M</underline>aintain <underline>A</underline>erobic <underline>S</underline>cope—<underline>R</underline>egulate <underline>O</underline>xygen <underline>S</underline>upply) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Atkinson et al., 2006</xref>). What happens beyond the thermal limits within this conceptual framework? One might expect that thermal limits could be characterized by further changes in cell size and potentially also cell shape, in an attempt to increase the available surface area and thus maximize oxygen availability. Furthermore, the MASROS hypothesis predicts that aerobic metabolism, measured as respiration, should decrease beyond both the lower and the upper thermal limit as compared to within the thermal range, once the organism can no longer compensate for the insufficient oxygen availability. To our knowledge, these central predictions of the MASROS hypothesis have not been challenged experimentally in an integrative fashion. Therefore, the extent to which restricted aerobic metabolism is a general principle characterizing thermal limits remains unclear.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Defining thermal limits</title><p>We determined embryonic viability in a range of temperatures for <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis briggsae</italic> and operationally defined the thermal limits as the upper and lower edges of the temperature range within which &gt;90% of embryos hatched.

In order to systematically identify such limit-sensitive features, we first analyzed cellular processes within the thermal range. We conducted this analysis initially in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, but then also studied embryos of <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, which has been estimated to have diverged from <italic>C. elegans</italic> 18–100 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cutter, 2008</xref>), thus probing evolutionary conservation of putative limit-sensitive features. Using temperature-controlled time-lapse DIC (Differential Interference Contrast) microscopy and semi-automated quantifications of the resulting movies with in-house scripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Source code 1</xref>), we measured 35 cellular features that describe the main events of the first cell cycle of <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>). In brief, after fertilization, the female pronucleus migrates towards the male pronucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). After their meeting, the pronuclei move to the embryo center whilst undergoing a 90°C rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The nuclear envelopes then break down, followed by assembly of the mitotic spindle, which moves slightly to the posterior during the remainder of mitosis whilst oscillating perpendicular to the anterior–posterior axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This results in the asymmetric division of the one-cell stage embryo into a larger anterior cell and a smaller posterior one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Our analysis established that the vast majority of the monitored features were temperature-dependent within the thermal range (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

Such an elongation results in an increase of the surface area, thus potentially augmenting its availability for oxygen diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Another possibility is that these needs are actually fulfilled to some extent despite reduced respiration, either because other metabolic routes are used to a larger relative extent or because embryos are metabolically depressed at the thermal limits and thus require less energy altogether. We reasoned that if aerobic metabolism became insufficient beyond the thermal limits, then further compromising mitochondrial activity should have more of an impact at the thermal limits than within the thermal range. By contrast, if energetic needs could be fulfilled at the least to some extent despite reduced respiration beyond the thermal limits, then further compromising mitochondrial activity should have less of an impact at the thermal limits than within the thermal range. Therefore, to distinguish between these two possibilities, we depleted three components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain using RNAi: the beta-subunit of ATP synthase ATP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tsang et al., 2001</xref>), a complex V component, the subunit of the mitochondrial complex I NUO-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tsang et al., 2001</xref>), and the component of the mitochondrial complex III CYC-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dillin et al., 2002</xref>). We ascertained that embryonic respiration was reduced in <italic>cyc-1(RNAi)</italic> embryos, reaching on average 56% ± 13% of the wild-type levels under the assay conditions (t-test p-value &lt; 10<sup>−3</sup>; see ‘Materials and methods’). Since ATP-2 and NUO-1 are part of complex V and I, respectively, respiration may still occur upon their depletion, even if the mitochondrial respiratory chain is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Braeckman et al., 2009</xref>), so that respiration measurements may not have been telling in these cases. Importantly, we found that all three RNAi conditions were embryonic lethal to some extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>), probably owing to decreased energy production through respiration, although we cannot exclude that the observed lethality stems from changes in pH or increased reactive oxygen species. Importantly, in addition, this analysis uncovered that embryonic lethality was reduced towards the lower thermal limit as compared to within the thermal range in all three cases, as well as towards the upper thermal limit in both <italic>cyc-1(RNAi)</italic> and <italic>nuo-1(RNAi)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). These results offer strong experimental support to the notion that the capacity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is restricted beyond both thermal limits, and raise the possibility that other metabolic routes are used to a larger relative extent at those temperatures in the face of reduced respiration.</p><p>Following up on this result, we set out to test whether the changes in size or shape observed beyond the thermal limits in the wild-type reflect an adaptation response to restricted aerobic capacity. We reasoned that if this were the case, then such changes should occur already within the thermal range of embryos in which components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are compromised. Interestingly, we found that whereas embryo size was not significantly affected upon RNAi-mediated depletion of <italic>atp-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), these embryos were more elongated at both 12°C and 16°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, U-test p(12°C) = 0.0034, p(16°C) = 0.0039). In <italic>nuo-1(RNAi)</italic>, embryo size was significantly reduced at both temperatures (U-test p(12°C) = 0.02, U-test p(16°C) &lt; 10<sup>−3</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), whereas a similar response was observed in <italic>cyc-1(RNAi)</italic> embryos at 12°C (U-test p(12°C) &lt; 10<sup>−3</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). While it remains to be investigated why the cellular consequences of depleting these three components differ to some extent, remarkably, they share the net result of increasing surface to volume ratio within the thermal range, thus mimicking the situation in the wild-type beyond the thermal limits. Therefore, these results strongly support the notion that the uncovered cellular hallmarks observed at the thermal limits of wild-type embryos reflect restricted aerobic capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this work, we assessed the thermal response of cellular features during the first cell cycle of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> embryos. Interestingly, we uncovered that the thermal response of select cellular features changed precisely at the limit temperatures defined by embryonic viability tests (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). While we do not know whether these cellular hallmarks are responsible for the observed increased lethality beyond the thermal limits, we note that a mere 10% decrease in embryonic viability is associated with readily observable cellular changes during the first cell cycle. Importantly, experiments in which mitochondrial respiration is compromised revealed that aerobic metabolism plays a smaller relative role towards the thermal limits than within the thermal range, raising the possibility that other metabolic routes are favored to produce energy. Furthermore, these experiments uncover that the changes in size and shape observed beyond the thermal limits in the wild-type can be recapitulated within the thermal range by impairing aerobic metabolism, strongly supporting the view that these changes arise in response to restricted aerobic metabolism. Together, our work provides critical experimental evidence supporting the notion that restricted aerobic metabolism is a general principle characterizing thermal limits in multicellular organisms in water and on land. Other elements contribute to setting boundary conditions within which a thermal range can be envisaged. Thus, cold-induced increase in unsaturated fatty acids in cyanobacteria, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hazel, 1995</xref>) and <italic>C. elegans</italic> contributes to setting the lower thermal limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Svensk et al., 2013</xref>), although it only accounts for 16% of the observed difference in cold tolerance at 10°C vs 25°C in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Murray et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, warm-induced increase in post-translational glycosylation also contributes to setting the upper thermal limit in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Danio rerio</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Radermacher et al., 2014</xref>).

Your full submission has been evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor) and three peer reviewers, one of whom, Hans-Otto Portner, has agreed to reveal his identity. The decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We are sending you the full comments of all three reviewers. In summary, they all agree that the work is very interesting. However, they have two key criticisms. First, the work does not specifically address the mechanistic link between changes in embryo size/shape, thermal effects and aerobic metabolism. Secondly, the presentation and discussion of the work is confusing. In discussing whether to reject the manuscript or encourage a revision, the reviewers concluded that it would take more than three months to generate the data to address the first criticism. If, however, you already have some additional mechanism that addresses the first point we would, of course, consider a rebuttal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Summary: This paper explores how embryos from two related nematode species respond to changes in temperature. The authors examine 35 features of 1-cell zygotes in response to temperature and identify those features that behave differently at the animals' thermal limits. In particular, they find that embryos tend to increase their surface to volume ratio at the thermal limits. Previous theoretical studies have suggested that changes in aerobic capacity underlie thermal stress. Consistent with this hypothesis, the authors found that depleting key metabolic enzymes also causes an increase in surface-to-volume ratio. Based on this correlation, the authors conclude that “aerobic metabolism is limiting at both lower and upper thermal limits”.</p><p>Critique:</p><p>1) The main thesis of this work is based on a correlation. There is no direct evidence that aerobic metabolism is limiting at the thermal limits. It would seem that simple experiments could be done to demonstrate this hypothesis more directly. For example, do embryos depleted for key aerobic metabolism enzymes become hypersensitive to temperature changes? Without additional experiments that test the hypothesis directly, the data are too preliminary.</p><p>2) The presentation of the data is often confusing. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> reports on embryo size (do you mean volume?) and embryo shape (length/width). Surface-to-volume ratio, which in the Discussion seems to be the more relevant parameter, is not presented in the figure. As a result, it is very difficult to assess the significance of the differences/findings.</p><p>3) The data do not seem to always be fully explained in the text. The authors state that embryo size decreases below the lower thermal limit (12 to 10 degrees), but in fact embryo size increases dramatically (25% increase) between 14 to 12 degrees, before modestly going down between 12 and 10 degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This up-and-down behavior is not discussed.</p><p>4) The authors do not describe how the embryos were mounted on slides for imaging. If the embryos were placed under a coverslip, the pressure from the coverslip could affect their size and/or shape. If so, differences between different conditions could reflect differences in the resistance of the eggshell to the coverslip pressure, not actual differences in size.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting paper relating observations on functional changes to thermal limitation in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryos. This non-conventional way of addressing this issue will be stimulating for the animal biology community. Nonetheless the text should be amended and jargon reduced to make it more widely accessible. Some issues may be commonly expressed that way in the nematode world, but deserve explanation, e.g. why and how does surface to volume ratio relate to aerobic metabolism?</p><p>This writing, in the Introduction, is a bit imprecise: the biogeographic range relates to the thermal window of a species, so both upper and lower limits. This fundamental thermal range is not fully exploited but forms the basis of the exploited range.</p><p>Results and Discussion, third paragraph: it is not correct that the onset of anaerobic metabolism characterizes the first line of thermal limitation. The cited papers by Pörtner and colleagues refer to what is called the concept of oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT, cf. Pörtner 2010 J. exp Biol.). The earliest limit is a loss in performance caused by a mismatch in oxygen supply capacity and associated costs as well as hypoxemia constraining performance capacity, leaving less energy for e.g. growth (Pörtner and Knust, 2007, Science).

Your rebuttal was evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor) and the three original reviewers.</p><p>We feel that your manuscript can potentially be published in <italic>eLife</italic>, but only subject to your addressing the remaining concerns of Reviewers 1 and 3. If you choose to submit a revised version of the manuscript it will be your final opportunity to satisfy the reviewers—we are not willing to consider any further rounds of revision. This reviewers’ major criticisms concern the RNAi experiments and are described in lightly edited format below:</p><p>Overall, the manuscript presents many measurements (e.g. size, shape, viability) but how these integrate and how they relate to aerobic metabolism and thermal limits remain mostly unclear. No direct respiration rate measurements were taken in RNAi-treated animals and it remains unclear to what extent aerobic metabolism and embryonic lethality are causally linked in <italic>wt</italic> animals. Statistical analyses for the new data appear lacking and the experimental design requires more explanation. The authors show that embryos at the thermal limit are less sensitive to depletion of mitochondrial activity by RNAi, than animals in the thermal range. At the upper limit of the thermal range, the data show that RNAi depletion of two mitochondrial enzymes (but curiously not a third one) has no effect on viability. There are no controls to show that the RNAi depletion works equally well at all temperatures and for all three genes, so it is possible that this odd behavior is due to incomplete depletion at different temperatures and/or for different genes. In addition, the logic used to interpret these experiments is not clear. It would seem that if respiration becomes limiting at the thermal limit, then embryos near the limit should become more sensitive, not less, to depletion of respiratory components. In this line of reasoning, the new data would suggest that, in fact, respiration is not the rate limiting step at the thermal limit.</p><p>In addition, reviewer 1 was still troubled by the possibility that changes in eggshell composition in embryos raised at different temperatures could cause embryos to appear larger or smaller due to different resilience to the pressure of the cover slip used for imaging.

In particular, the first criticism raised by reviewers #1 and #3 concerning the lack of direct evidence for aerobic metabolism being restricted at the thermal limits has now been addressed. As we show in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, respiration measurements reveal that aerobic metabolism is indeed reduced beyond both lower and upper thermal limits. Moreover, we also uncovered that embryos depleted of distinct components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are less affected towards the thermal limits than within the thermal range (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-D</xref>). With these new findings, our work provides for the first time compelling evidence that restricted aerobic metabolism is a key feature of thermal limits in a terrestrial metazoan organism. Moreover, we altered the text to render it more accessible to a broader audience, clarifying the presentation and discussion of the work, thus addressing the second main criticism of the reviewers.</p><p><italic>We are sending you the full comments of all three reviewers. In summary, they all agree that the work is very interesting. However, they have two key criticisms. First, the work does not specifically address the mechanistic link between changes in embryo size/shape, thermal effects and aerobic metabolism. Secondly, the presentation and discussion of the work is confusing. In discussing whether to reject the manuscript or encourage a revision, the reviewers concluded that it would take more than three months to generate the data to address the first criticism. If, however, you already have some additional mechanism that addresses the first point we would, of course, consider a rebuttal.</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p><italic>Summary</italic>: <italic>This paper explores how embryos from two related nematode species respond to changes in temperature. The authors examine 35 features of 1-cell zygotes in response to temperature and identify those features that behave differently at the animals' thermal limits. In particular, they find that embryos tend to increase their surface to volume ratio at the thermal limits. Previous theoretical studies have suggested that changes in aerobic capacity underlie thermal stress. Consistent with this hypothesis, the authors found that depleting key metabolic enzymes also causes an increase in surface-to-volume ratio. Based on this correlation, the authors conclude that “aerobic metabolism is limiting at both lower and upper thermal limits”.</italic></p><p><italic>Critique</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The main thesis of this work is based on a correlation. There is no direct evidence that aerobic metabolism is limiting at the thermal limits. It would seem that simple experiments could be done to demonstrate this hypothesis more directly. For example, do embryos depleted for key aerobic metabolism enzymes become hypersensitive to temperature changes? Without additional experiments that test the hypothesis directly, the data are too preliminary</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this very important point. Indeed, our initial submission was missing direct evidence that aerobic metabolism is restricted at the thermal limits. This critical issue has now been addressed by measuring the respiration rate of wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos from 9°C to 28°C. As we now show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, this novel experiment revealed that respiration increases exponentially within the thermal range, as predicted by Arrhenius-like kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arrhenius, 1915</xref>). Strikingly in addition, we found that respiration decreases both below the lower thermal limit and above the upper thermal limit. These findings indicate that aerobic capacity is indeed reduced beyond both thermal limits as compared to within the thermal range.</p><p>Importantly in addition, as suggested by the reviewer, we further challenged our findings by now measuring embryonic viability over a wide range of temperatures upon depletion of key aerobic metabolism proteins (subunits of complex I, III and V of the mitochondrial respiratory chain). We reasoned that if aerobic capacity is utilized to a lesser extent for energy production beyond both thermal limits than within the thermal range, then compromising mitochondrial activity should also have less of an impact at the thermal limits than within the thermal range. Remarkably, we indeed found that embryonic lethality was reduced towards the thermal limits as compared to within the thermal range in <italic>atp-2(RNAi), cyc-1(RNAi)</italic> and <italic>nuo-1(RNAi)</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-D</xref>). These results offer strong experimental support to the notion that the capacity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is indeed reduced beyond both thermal limits.</p><p>All these critical findings are now presented and discussed in our manuscript in the Results section entitled “Cellular hallmarks of the thermal limits are recapitulated when impairing aerobic metabolism”<italic>.</italic></p><p><italic>2) The presentation of the data is often confusing. For example,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>reports on embryo size (do you mean volume?) and embryo shape (length/width). Surface-to-volume ratio, which in the Discussion seems to be the more relevant parameter, is not presented in the figure. As a result, it is very difficult to assess the significance of the differences/findings</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for having been insufficiently clear in our presentation of the data. We have put great effort in extensively rewriting the manuscript in order to present the data more clearly. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figure 2-3</xref>, we report embryo area, which we use as a proxy of embryo size given the rotational symmetry of <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos (see Materials and methods). In the previous version of the manuscript, surface-to-volume ratios were not reported because they were merely estimated and not measured, as explained in the Materials and methods of the initial submission. In the new version of the manuscript, we reduce the importance of surface-to-volume ratios and focus instead on the signature cellular changes at the thermal limits, namely embryo size reduction below the lower thermal limit and embryo elongation above the upper thermal limit, both of which have been directly measured. See Results section entitled “Cellular hallmarks of the thermal limits are recapitulated when impairing aerobic metabolism”.</p><p><italic>3) The data do not seem to always be fully explained in the text. The authors state that embryo size decreases below the lower thermal limit (12 to 10 degrees), but in fact embryo size increases dramatically (25% increase) between 14 to 12 degrees, before modestly going down between 12 and 10 degrees (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref><italic>). This up-and-down behavior is not discussed</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for having brought up this important point. As we now explain better (see Introduction, third paragraph and Results section “Embryo size and shape are sensitive to the thermal limits<italic>”</italic>), the fact that body size is smaller at higher temperatures within the thermal range is common among ectotherms and has been coined the temperature-size rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkinson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Forster et al., 2012</xref>). Such a size decrease with warmer temperatures is believed to be an adaptive response to preserve aerobic capacity by yielding an increase in surface-to-volume ratio and thus potentially in oxygen supply by facilitated diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Atkinson et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In the previous version of the manuscript, we had focused our attention solely on the reversal of this temperature-size rule below the lower thermal limit, which has been reported previously only in protists and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atkinson et al., 2003</xref>), and hypothesized to be driven by restricted aerobic metabolism below the lower thermal limit. The new version of the manuscript maintains this focus, while putting it in the context of the temperature-size rule delineated above, thus clarifying what may have appeared as an unexpected behavior at the lower thermal limit.</p><p><italic>4) The authors do not describe how the embryos were mounted on slides for imaging. If the embryos were placed under a coverslip, the pressure from the coverslip could affect their size and/or shape. If so, differences between different conditions could reflect differences in the resistance of the eggshell to the coverslip pressure, not actual differences in size</italic>.</p><p>This point indeed deserved some further clarification. As we now explain in the first paragraph of Materials and methods, embryos were dissected in 1x M9 medium tempered at the culture temperature, mounted on slides, placed under a coverslip and imaged using time-lapse DIC microscopy. Considering the crowded compressive environment of the uterus in the intact animal, and considering furthermore that the same mounting procedure was followed for all specimens at all temperatures, we surmise that the observed alterations in thermal response of embryo size and shape at given temperatures are not due to the mounting procedure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p><italic>This is an interesting paper relating observations on functional changes to thermal limitation in</italic> Caenorhabditis elegans <italic>embryos</italic>. <italic>This non-conventional way of addressing this issue will be stimulating for the animal biology community.

The cited papers by Pörtner and colleagues refer to what is called the concept of oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT, cf. Pörtner 2010 J. exp Biol.). The earliest limit is a loss in performance caused by a mismatch in oxygen supply capacity and associated costs as well as hypoxemia constraining performance capacity, leaving less energy for e.g. growth (Pörtner and Knust, 2007, Science). So thermal limits then lead to the onset of anaerobic metabolism. These findings have recently been set into perspective across organism domains (Storch et al., 2014, Global Change Biology), which should caution authors with respect to some of their statements on prokaryotes and get their rationale into clearer shape</italic>.</p><p>We acknowledge that our writing was far too simplistic in an attempt to accommodate a broad readership, thus loosing part of its meaning.

We now also explicitly describe the experiments in both aquatic organisms and prokaryotes to better guide the reader through what has been achieved so far and what still needed further validation prior to our work.

As we mentioned earlier in this rebuttal (see response to point 1 from reviewer #1), we conducted both respiration measurements as well as progeny tests in embryos with impaired aerobic metabolism over a wide range of temperatures. The resulting data strongly support the notion that aerobic metabolism is indeed restricted beyond the thermal limits. We also ensured that the data is clearly presented and that our interpretations are thoroughly discussed throughout the new rendition of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>1) The link between temperature effects on embryo size/shape and aerobic metabolism is not explicitly tested.

We kindly ask reviewer #3 to refer to the answer to point 1 of reviewer #1, where we explain in detail how this issue has been addressed.</p><p><italic>2) The actual data is not sufficiently discussed. For example, a number of phenotypes measured show non-linear temperature responses, including reduced embryo size at lower temperatures (e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3"><italic>Figure 2E, 3E</italic></xref><italic>). In</italic> C. elegans, <italic>embryo size seems reduced only when comparing 10C to 12C treatment; in contrast, when comparing all temperatures above 12C to 10C, embryo size seems increased. These non-linear responses are in my view incongruent with the hypothesis on aerobic metabolism—yet these experimental data are not discussed in detail</italic>.</p><p>We acknowledge that the data within the thermal range, in particular regarding embryo size, was not discussed sufficiently in the initial submission. Reviewer #1 had a similar comment, which we addressed above (see answer to her/his point 3).

This is not analysed or discussed appropriately.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. Actually, we represented the data in terms of boxplots in order to make sure that the average, the variance and any potential skew in the data would be clearly visible. We did not discuss this in our manuscript, because we had verified as prior to submission that the variance of cellular features did not increase beyond the thermal limits as compared to within the thermal range. This can be seen also from the colored boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2-3</xref> representing data beyond the thermal limits.

Results and Discussion, last line of first paragraph]</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the evolutionary context initially provided was somewhat naïve. We fully acknowledge that thermal adaptation is generally not a species-specific trait and that the introductory sentences in our initial submission were overly simplistic. We have now rephrased the first paragraph of our Introduction in order to better account for the multiple factors that may determine an organism's thermal range. It now reads:</p><p>“All organisms live within a given thermal range, beyond which growth and fecundity decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pörtner et al., 2006</xref>).

Despite their importance, the mechanisms that set the thermal limits remain incompletely understood<italic>.”</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for noting that <italic>C. briggsae</italic> also occurs in many cold regions and, therefore, that our writing was too generic.

We have also further clarified this coherence throughout the revised text of the manuscript.</p><p>1) Changes in embryo size and shape are observed beyond both thermal limits in embryos of <italic>C.</italic> elegans and <italic>C. briggsae</italic>.</p><p>2) Aerobic metabolism, measured as respiration, is reduced beyond both thermal limits in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos.</p><p>3) In order to test whether the observed changes in size and shape beyond thermal limits result from reduced aerobic capacity (i.e. whether point 1 above results from point 2 above), we analyzed cellular features within the thermal range in embryos compromised for mitochondrial respiratory chain function. We find that both embryo size and shape are altered under these conditions, providing support for the hypothesis that such changes beyond the thermal limits in the wild-type indeed reflect reduced aerobic metabolism.</p><p>4) The respiration experiments establish that aerobic metabolism is reduced at the thermal limits. This piece of data alone is insufficient to distinguish between a scenario in which the energetic needs of the embryo are not satisfied due to insufficient aerobic metabolism and one in which these needs are actually fulfilled to some extent despite reduced respiration, perhaps because other metabolic routes are used to a larger extent. Interestingly, these two scenarios predict a different outcome in embryos compromised for mitochondrial respiratory chain function. If aerobic metabolism became insufficient beyond the thermal limits, then further compromising mitochondrial activity should have more of an impact at the thermal limits than within the thermal range. By contrast, if energetic needs could be fulfilled at the least to some extent despite reduced respiration beyond the thermal limits, then further compromising mitochondrial activity should have less of an impact at the thermal limits than within the thermal range. Importantly, we uncovered that the latter is the case, demonstrating that aerobic metabolism is restricted towards the thermal limits, as reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-D</xref>. We have rewritten in an extensive manner the corresponding section in the revised manuscript to further clarify this important point (Results and Discussion section, subsection headed “Cellular hallmarks of the thermal limits are recapitulated when impairing aerobic metabolism”).</p><p><italic>No direct respiration rate measurements were taken in RNAi-treated animals.</italic></p><p>Following the suggestion of the reviewer, we set out to verify that respiration is decreased in embryos with compromised mitochondrial respiratory chain function. Since ATP-2 and NUO-1 are part of complex V and I, respectively, respiration might still be observed upon their depletion despite mitochondrial respiratory chain being compromised (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Braeckman et al. 2009</xref>), so that respiration measurements would not necessarily be telling in these cases Instead, respiration should be decreased upon compromising complex III function, as in <italic>cyc-1(RNAi)</italic> embryos. As anticipated, we found indeed that respiration is markedly diminished in such embryos, being on average 56% ± 13% of the wild-type embryonic respiration levels in these experimental conditions (t-test p-value &lt; 10<sup>-3</sup>)<italic>.</italic> These new results are reported in the Results and Discussion section, under “Cellular hallmarks of the thermal limits are recapitulated when impairing aerobic metabolism” (see also updated corresponding Materials and methods<italic>,</italic> subsection headed “Measurement of embryonic respiration”).</p><p><italic>It remains unclear to what extent aerobic metabolism and embryonic lethality are causally linked in</italic> wt <italic>animals.</italic></p><p>This point is well taken and we now explicitly state this limitation in the Results and Discussion (in the subsection headed “Cellular hallmarks of the thermal limits are recapitulated when impairing aerobic metabolism”).</p><p><italic>Statistical analyses for the new data appear lacking and the experimental design requires more explanation.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for having spotted this omission; apologies about this. We had in fact conducted an F-test analysis (as described in Supplementary file 1 for other measurements) and have now added the corresponding p-values in the subsection “Cellular hallmarks of the thermal limits are recapitulated when impairing aerobic metabolism” (F-test p-value &lt; 10<sup>-4</sup> and F-test p-value &lt; 10<sup>-10</sup> below the lower and above the upper thermal limit, respectively).</p><p>We have also expanded the text in the Materials and methods section in order to explain better the experimental design of the respiration experiments.</p><p><italic>The authors show that embryos at the thermal limit are less sensitive to depletion of mitochondrial activity by RNAi, than animals in the thermal range. At the upper limit of the thermal range, the data show that RNAi depletion of two mitochondrial enzymes (but curiously not a third one) has no effect on viability. There are no controls to show that the RNAi depletion works equally well at all temperatures and for all three genes, so it is possible that this odd behavior is due to incomplete depletion at different temperatures and/or for different genes.</italic></p><p>In order to address this potential issue, we performed progeny tests at different temperatures as a proxy for depletion efficiency using RNAi against AIR-1, a serine/threonine kinase required for spindle assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hannak et al. 2001</xref>), a process not known to be related to metabolic status. As we show below (see panel A), we found that <italic>air-1(RNAi)</italic> was 100% embryonic lethal at 12°C, 20°C and 24°C, as anticipated from previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hannak et al. 2001</xref>). In order to titrate the phenotype, we performed double RNAi by mixing bacteria expressing dsRNA against <italic>air-1</italic> with bacteria expressing dsRNA against <italic>gfp</italic> in a 1:3 ratio. Importantly, we found in this case that lethality was greater at 12°C and at 24°C than at 20°C (see panel B). Hence, the RNAi phenotype is actually stronger for <italic>air-1</italic> towards the lower and the upper thermal limit than at 20°C, indicating that the results we uncovered when targeting mitochondrial respiratory chain components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-D</xref> of the manuscript) are not due to a general temperature-dependent response of RNAi. These results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref> and reported in the Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>In addition, the logic used to interpret these experiments is not clear. It would seem that if respiration becomes limiting at the thermal limit, then embryos near the limit should become more sensitive, not less, to depletion of respiratory components. In this line of reasoning, the new data would suggest that, in fact, respiration is not the rate limiting step at the thermal limit.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that aerobic metabolism is not limiting at the thermal limits (as we wrote in our very initial submission), and apologize for probably not having been sufficiently clear on this point in our last submission. As we explain in point 4 above, our data supports a mechanism whereby aerobic metabolism is restricted (and not limited) at the thermal limits. As mentioned also above, we have extensively modified the main text to make this clearer (Results and Discussion section, in the subsection headed “Cellular hallmarks of the thermal limits are recapitulated when impairing aerobic metabolism”).</p><p><italic>In addition, reviewer 1 was still troubled by the possibility that changes in eggshell composition in embryos raised at different temperatures could cause embryos to appear larger or smaller due to different resilience to the pressure of the cover slip used for imaging. We would be grateful if you could deal with this possibility when discussing your data.</italic></p><p>We have updated the Materials and methods to explicitly raise this possibility.</p></body></sub-article></article>
