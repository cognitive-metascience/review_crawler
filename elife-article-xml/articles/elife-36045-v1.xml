cell types. However, current methods to model morphogenic events lack control over cell-type co-emergence and offer little capability to selectively perturb specific cell subpopulations. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> system interrogates cell-cell interactions and multicellular organization within human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) colonies. We examined effects of induced mosaic knockdown of molecular regulators of cortical tension (ROCK1) and cell-cell adhesion (CDH1) with CRISPR interference. Mosaic knockdown of ROCK1 or CDH1 resulted in differential patterning within hiPSC colonies due to cellular self-organization, while retaining an epithelial pluripotent phenotype. Knockdown induction stimulates a transient wave of differential gene expression within the mixed populations that stabilized in coordination with observed self-organization. Mosaic patterning enables genetic interrogation of emergent multicellular properties, which can facilitate better understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate symmetry-breaking during morphogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36045.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Embryos begin as a collection of similar cells, which progress in stages to form a huge variety of cell types in particular arrangements.

Cells that lacked ROCK1 formed bands near the edges of the group. Cells that lacked CDH1 segregated themselves from other cells, forming ‘islands’ inside the main group. The cells retained their ability to specialize into any type of cell after forming these patterns. However, specific groups of cells were more likely to become certain cell types.</p><p>The method developed by Libby et al. can be used to study a range of complex tissue development and cell organization processes.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burdsal et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leckband et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Montero and Heisenberg, 2004</xref>). A hallmark of morphogenesis is the asymmetric co-emergence of distinct cell populations that self-organize to form developmental patterns, multicellular structures, and ultimately, functional tissues and organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bronner, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sasai, 2013</xref>). For example, during gastrulation, the blastocyst transitions from a relatively homogeneous population of pluripotent cells to a spatially organized, multicellular composition of distinct progenitor cells. Therefore, to study morphogenesis, it is essential to promote the coincident development of analogous heterogeneous populations <italic>in vitro</italic>. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide an unlimited source of cells that can mimic developmental differentiation processes and maintain the ability to self-organize into tissue-like structures, such as optic cups, gut organoids, or stratified cortical tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eiraku et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eiraku et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spence et al., 2011</xref>). However, due to the intrinsic variability of organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bredenoord et al., 2017</xref>) and the lack of alternative human models that faithfully promote asymmetric emergence, many of the mechanisms that control and coordinate morphogenesis remain undefined. Therefore, new approaches to reliably control the emergence and organization of multiple cell types would greatly advance tissue modeling and organ developmental studies.</p><p>Controlling cellular heterogeneity <italic>in vitro</italic> is often achieved by independent differentiation of hPSCs followed by re-combination of distinct cell types, which fails to mimic parallel cell-type emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matthys et al., 2016</xref>). Attempts to engineer <italic>in vitro</italic> systems that yield controlled emergence of spatial organization often rely on extrinsic physical restriction of cells to direct subsequent multicellular pattern formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsiao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warmflash et al., 2014</xref>). Physical constraints allow the observational study of cell-cell interactions within defined regions, but artificially restrict cell behaviors by limiting the degrees of freedom in which morphogenic phenomena can occur. Additionally, current tools to interrogate gene function, such as genetic knockouts or siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boettcher and McManus, 2015</xref>), cannot selectively perturb gene expression of subpopulations of cells in situ, which is required to generate controlled asymmetry analogous to embryonic morphogenesis.</p><p>Several of these limitations can be addressed with inducible CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) systems in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Larson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mandegar et al., 2016</xref>). CRISPRi silencing enables temporal regulation over knockdowns (KD) of specific genetic targets with limited off-target effects. Temporal KD constraints enable the development of precisely-controlled engineered biological systems that can induce well-defined genetic perturbation at explicit times and within defined populations of cells to mimic developmental symmetry-breaking events.</p><p>Morphogenic asymmetries arise from reorganization of cells due to local changes in mechanical tissue stiffness and cell adhesions that facilitate physical organization of developing embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krieg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maître et al., 2012</xref>). Mechanical rearrangement is necessary for many aspects of morphogenesis, including cell polarity, collective movement, multicellular organization, and organ size regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arboleda-Estudillo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maître, 2017</xref>). Differential adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foty and Steinberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foty and Steinberg, 2005</xref>) and cortical tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Van Essen and Essen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krieg et al., 2008</xref>) are critical determinants of mechanically-driven cell sorting, in which both processes are known to contribute to tissue organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lecuit and Lenne, 2007</xref>). In cortical tension-dominated sorting, variable actin cytoskeleton-generated cortex tension stimulates sorting of individual cells, whereas differential adhesion sorting promotes segregation of cell populations due to intercellular homophilic adhesions.</p><p>Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK1) and E-cadherin (CDH1) are interesting orthogonal gene targets to interrogate hPSC population organization by altering the intrinsic mechanics of distinct cell populations. ROCK1 regulates actin-myosin dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which contribute to a cell’s cortical tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Salbreux et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, ROCK inhibition is often used in hPSC culture and has been implicated in pluripotency maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McBeath et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohgushi et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, CDH1, a classic type I cadherin adhesion molecule, is widely associated with pluripotency and early morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heasman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Przybyla et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ringwald et al., 1987</xref>), and its down-regulation parallels the induction of patterning events via differential adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36045.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CRISPRi of ROCK1 and CDH1 modulate physical properties of the cell.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of ROCK1 and CDH1 within a cell.

We genetically induced controlled symmetry-breaking events within hiPSC populations by creating mixed populations of hiPSCs with and without the CRISPRi system and then induced mosaic knockdown (KD). Mosaic KD was employed to interrogate how the creation of physical asymmetries in an otherwise homogeneous population leads to multicellular organization and pattern formation.

Protein KD followed a similar trend where KD populations compared to untreated controls resulted in &lt;20% ROCK1 protein and &lt;10% of CDH1 protein by day three of DOX treatment, and reduced protein levels were maintained through day six of CRISPRi induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Both the ROCK1 KD cells and the CDH1 KD cells retained epithelial hiPSC morphologies without single cell migration away from the colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, CDH1 KD hiPSCs displayed irregular colony shapes that maintained smooth peripheral edges, but contained regions lacking cells within colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Conversely, ROCK1 KD hiPSCs displayed round colony shapes (similar to wildtype hiPSCs) but individual cells along the border of ROCK1 KD colonies extended protrusions out away from the colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As expected, hiPSCs treated with the small-molecule ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 yielded a similar morphology to the ROCK1 KD hiPSCs with extended cell protrusions at the colony borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To further confirm the physical effects of knocking down CDH1 or ROCK1 selectively in hiPSCs, we performed immunofluorescent (IF) staining of CDH1 expression. After 5 days of DOX treatment, CDH1 KD hiPSCs exhibited a complete loss of CDH1 expression, as expected, whereas the ROCK1 KD hiPSCs and the control hiPSCs (with off-target CRISPRi guide) maintained robust expression of CDH1 along the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To interrogate cell cortical tension, the contact angles between cells were measured based on IF of zona occluden-1 (ZO1), a protein associated with tight junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Contact angles were not statistically different in either the ROCK1 KD or CDH1 KD cells compared to the control, but all populations displayed a subtle reduction in mean contact angle with DOX addition that was not significantly different between any of the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). However, when direct measurements of hiPSC elasticity were taken using atomic force microscopy after 6 days of KD, ROCK1 KD cells displayed a twofold higher cortical stiffness than the control and CDH1 KD populations, whereas the latter groups did not differ from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Therefore, CRISPRi silencing of targeted genes associated with cellular mechanical properties resulted in distinct physical differences between the otherwise similar cell populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mosaic CRISPRi silencing results in multicellular organization</title><p>To examine whether mosaic KD of a single molecule impacted hiPSC organization, ROCK1- or CDH1-CRISPRi populations were pretreated with DOX for 5 days and mixed with isogenic wildtype hiPSCs that constitutively expressed GFP (WT-GFP) at a 1:3 ratio.

In fact, increasing ROCK1 KD hiPSCs to 75% of the colony resulted in the entire colony morphology displaying characteristics of a pure ROCK1 KD colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). On the other hand, the CDH1 CRISPRi cells separated from the colorless CRISPRi population, irrespective of cell ratio, indicating that the spatial organization occurred regardless of relative population size within a hiPSC colony. The ability of both the ROCK1 and CDH1 CRISPRi KD populations to physically partition from otherwise identical CRISPRi-engineered hiPSCs that lacked a gRNA confirms that the production of dCas9-KRAB is not responsible for the previously observed pattern formation when CRISPRi KD hiPSCs were mixed with the WT-GFP cells, but rather that the segregation is a direct result of KD of the target gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Based on the sorting behaviors of ROCK1 KD: WT-GFP and CDH1 KD: WT-GFP colonies when the KD of ROCK1 or CDH1 was present at the time of mixing, we next examined whether induction of mosaic KD after mixing resulted in similar sorting patterns as previously observed. This scenario more accurately models the onset of initial symmetry-breaking events among homogeneous pluripotent cells during embryonic development. Non-induced CRISPRi populations were mixed with WT-GFP hiPSCs (1:3 ratio), re-plated, and then treated with DOX to induce KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). ROCK1 KD post-mixing within mosaic colonies did not result in noticeable radial segregation of ROCK1 KD hiPSCs from WT-GFP hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>), as observed for pre-mixed colonies. Instead, the post-mixing ROCK1 mosaic KD colonies exhibited greater vertical stacking of ROCK1 KD cells and WT-GFP cells in the z-plane of the mixed colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), whereas the pre-induced mixed colonies remained segregated primarily in a 2D planar manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, the mosaic silencing of CDH1 post-mixing maintained robust segregation of the CDH1 KD cells from the WT-GFP hiPSCs, although the borders between cell populations lacking CDH1 contacts and neighboring WT-GFP cells were somewhat less distinct than the pre-induced CDH1 KD: WT-GFP mixed colonies. Overall, the inducible CRISPRi mixed colonies displayed the ability to mimic several different patterns of intrinsic symmetry-breaking events that resulted in distinct cell sorting and multicellular pattern formation.</p><p>In addition to the changes in organization within colonies, significant changes were observed in the final cell ratios starting from an original seeding density of 3:1 WT to CRISPRi cells.

To determine if the accelerated growth was in response to mixing with a WT population, EdU incorporation was analyzed in pure CRISPRi and WT populations. Over 5 days of mixed culture, the WT-GFP cells displayed approximately 50% reduced DNA synthesis compared to the CRISPRi lines independent of DOX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), however cell replication rate did not account for pattern formation as the CRISPRi control mixed colonies did not display evidence of any patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mosaic hiPSC colonies retain a pluripotent phenotype</title><p>Colony morphology and expression of epithelial markers, such as epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), were examined to determine if the cells that lost CDH1 expression segregated from their WT-GFP neighbors due to delamination, or loss of the epithelial phenotype characteristic of hiPSCs.

However because the transcription factors SOX2 and OCT4 are retained by cells for a period of time during the process of differentiation, genes associated with the primitive streak (Brachyury [BRA]) and the neural crest (SOX9) were interrogated in either ROCK1 or CDH1 KD cells over 6 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

Although the CDH1 KD cells did not display any significant trends, the standard deviation of gene expression varied as much as three times greater than that of the ROCK1 KD cells. The high variation between biological replicates potentially indicates that silencing of CDH1 induces a large variability in the gene regulation of BRA and SOX9 and could indicate that the cells experience a transient fluctuation in the pluripotency state.

On day three, an upregulation of adhesion molecules (EPHA4, ITGA4) was observed, as well as NANOG, Nestin (NES), and TGFβ upregulation and FGFR2 down-regulation. Interestingly, a large number of changes in gene expression were specific to the mosaic induction of ROCK1 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, right column), for example the down-regulation of both cell-cell adhesions as well as cell-ECM adhesions. Additionally, genes that were upregulated in the pure KD context were down-regulated in the mosaic KD context, such as SNAI1, NES and NANOG. However, at day six of mosaic KD no significant changes persisted in the examined panel of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). CDH1 KD caused an upregulation in genes associated with cell-cell adhesion on day one that was exacerbated in a mosaic CDH1 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Interestingly, both Wnt3 and down-stream Wnt targets, such as SNAI1 and SNAI2, were significantly increased specifically in mosaic KDs on day one of KD. Similar to the transient wave of gene expression changes observed in ROCK1 KD cells, mosaic CDH1 KD did not exhibit any observed significant changes on day six of KD except for CDH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These results were consistent with our previous observation of the maintenance of pluripotency in the ROCK1 KD: WT-GFP and CDH1 KD: WT-GFP colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, the recovery of homeostatic gene expression profiles closely followed the dynamics of distinct pattern establishment in the mixed populations.</p><p>In addition to examining the KD cells, we examined the gene expression profiles of the neighboring WT cells that constituted the majority of cells in each colony. On day six of KD induction, the WT-GFP cells that were mixed with CDH1 KD hiPSCs had gene expression patterns that resembled the WT-GFP cells mixed with the control CRISPRi populations, whereas the WT-GFP cells mixed with ROCK1 KD hiPSCs exhibited a different expression profile. Interestingly, the WT-GFP cells mixed with ROCK1 CRISPRi hiPSCs demonstrated changes in genes associated with cell sorting and movement, such as ephrins and integrins, and up-regulation in myosin proteins (MYH9, MYH10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).

However, these methods can’t selectively discriminate between different cells, or they fail to address how the emergence of heterotypic interactions affects multicellular organization. Here, we report that silencing of target genes by CRISPRi within only subpopulations of cells provides multiple avenues to genetically control the emergence of asymmetric cell phenotypes and development of multicellular patterns. Specifically, we demonstrate that mosaic KD of target genes ROCK1 or CDH1 result in distinct patterning events wherein cell-driven segregation dictates colony organization without loss of pluripotency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36045.017</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Inducible pattern emergence through the KD of molecules that affect hiPSC physical properties.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of working model of sub-population manipulation where controlled changes in cellular stiffness or cellular adhesion result in specific colony pattern formation.

However, we found that prolonged silencing of ROCK1 in hiPSCs (6 days) resulted in cells that were twofold stiffer than either the CDH1 KD cells or the control CRISPRi cells. The increased cortical stiffness of ROCK1 KD hiPSCs could be due to the difference between the inhibition of an existing protein and KD of the gene. A small molecule inhibitor prevents the function of already existing proteins so that a small amount of functioning protein may escape the inhibitor’s influence. In contrast, CRISPRi only needs to target the ROCK1 gene loci at two alleles to completely abolish protein transcription, thus highlighting the strength of genetic perturbation. Additionally, ROCK inhibition is often used as a transient perturbation (24 hr), whereas long-term KD of ROCK1 (6 days) may induce compensatory effects within the cells that are responsible for the somewhat surprising results. Long-term ROCK1 KD compensation is a likely partial explanation why KD of ROCK1 prior to mixing resulted in radially partitioned populations, but post-mixing KD resulted in less segregated populations. The increased stacking of the ROCK1 KD population upon induction of knockdown after mixing with WT cells could also reflect the difference between short-term and long-term ROCK1 KD and potential compensation effects. For example, the 3D accumulation of ROCK1 KD cells as cytoskeletal contraction is impaired may be a result from compensatory contraction by the surrounding WT cells, resulting in multilayer colonies.</p><p>The emergence of autonomous cell patterning and cell sorting is often coincident with the onset of differentiation, and CDH1 in particular regulates morphogenesis in a diverse range of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burdsal et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Historically, CDH1 is often associated with pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soncin and Ward, 2011</xref>). However, while CDH1 is commonly expressed by pluripotent cells and CDH1 can replace OCT3/4 during fibroblast reprogramming to pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Redmer et al., 2011</xref>), CDH1 is not essential to pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Larue et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soncin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ying et al., 2008</xref>). Our results reinforce these latter observations by demonstrating that CDH1 KD in hiPSCs does not adversely affect the expression of pluripotency markers nor lead to a loss of epithelial phenotype. The maintenance of pluripotent state indicates that KD of CDH1 alone is not sufficient to induce differentiation, but other factors such as sufficient cell density and local intercellular signaling preserve pluripotent colony integrity and buffer against changes in cell state.</p><p>Furthermore, the observed maintenance of pluripotency and preferential differentiation to mesendoderm is consistent with recent studies revealing that changes in human CDH1 adhesions coordinate with <italic>in vitro</italic> human stem cell lineage decisions rather than pluripotency maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Przybyla et al., 2016</xref>). Changes in CDH1 influencing lineage fate decisions may explain the transient gene expression changes that we observed with the induction of KD in mixed colonies, where the loss of CDH1 potentially primes the cells to respond to a signal for differentiation, and without such a signal the cells return to a ground state of pluripotency. Similar priming has been described in the context of cell-matrix adhesion where differentiation in response to TGFβ signaling is primed by stiffness-dependent integrin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2012</xref>); a similar mechanism may explain the observed transient gene expression changes without loss of pluripotency in CDH1 KD hiPSCs.</p><p>The ability to manipulate distinct cell populations allows for robust modeling of human morphogenic events and, thus, an expanded understanding of human biology that can be exploited to develop physiologically realistic <italic>in vitro</italic> human tissue models. Cellular location within pluripotent colonies can be thought to parallel the effects seen in early developing blastocysts. A cell’s location within the early embryo relays signals that dictate initial symmetry-breaking events, such as the decision to become trophectoderm instead of inner cell mass. Cells located within the center of an embryo maintain different adhesion contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stephenson et al., 2010</xref>) and are subjected to higher tension generated by neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Samarage et al., 2015</xref>), which then feed back into lineage fate decisions. For example, the Hippo pathway is controlled by a cell’s position within the early blastocyst, where the outer cell layer has the ability to polarize and sequester the signaling molecule angiomotin away from adherens junctions, preventing the phosphorylation and activation that would occur in an internal cell that maintained cell-cell contacts on all sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirate et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally <italic>in vitro</italic> micro-patterned PSC colonies have been reported to display spatially dependent germ layer patterning upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Etoc et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tewary et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warmflash et al., 2014</xref>). The observed mosaic patterns of ROCK1 KD hiPSCs demonstrate that the spatial location within a colony can be affected by targeted gene KD without altering differentiation potential, and conversely, the mosaic CDH1 KD demonstrates dual control of spatial positioning and lineage potential. Therefore, the system described here enables interrogation of multicellular organization and morphogenic processes in parallel via manipulation of local multicellular domains through subpopulation organization and priming to specific lineage fates.</p><p>In addition to changes in multicellular organization as a result of ROCK1 or CDH1 KD, changes in gene expression also occurred in the WT population. In particular, the WT population displayed significant changes in several genes associated with adhesion and lineage fate. For example, GATA4 was down-regulated in WT cells in all mixed colonies. GATA4 is expressed by mesendoderm lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Molkentin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zorn and Wells, 2009</xref>) and its down-regulation may affect the ability of WT cells to properly differentiate to mesendoderm. However, there were no significant differences in EOMES expression between the WT and CRISPRi cells when ROCK1 KD mixed colonies were directed toward a mesendodermal fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), potentially due to the strength of the small molecule CHIR, a GSK3 inhibitor, in inducing mesendoderm fate. Additionally, differences between the WT and ROCK1 KD populations may arise in longer differentiations, where the cells are allowed to mature beyond a progenitor stage. However, differences in maturation or cell type within a germ lineage may assist in the controlled co-emergence of multiple cell types that normally interact within a single tissue, such as parenchymal cells along with stromal populations.</p><p>Overall, this study capitalized on the ability of CRISPRi to temporally perturb specific molecular regulators of physical cell properties, such as adhesion and tension, that resulted in differing multicellular patterns. Moreover, CRISPRi additionally offers the flexibility to target any gene of interest and timing of KD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gordon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mandegar et al., 2016</xref>), allowing for the creation of dynamic patterns through transient genetic KD that could be used to pre-pattern PSC colonies in various types of multicellular geometries before differentiation. Additionally, the ability to induce molecular asymmetry can also be applied to co-differentiation, where the temporal induction of specific heterotypic interactions, such as the presentation of a ligand or receptor, can give rise to the coordinated emergence of two (or more) cell types under the same culture conditions. In addition, mosaic induction of KD can be used to examine how signals propagate between cells, for example, interrogating how the networks between cells created by either mechanical (adhesions) or chemical gradients (gap junctions) affect lineage fate decisions. Furthermore, the predictable patterning events and potential for control over co-emergence that we establish in this study could aid the eventual control over morphogenic events in organoid systems. Organoids require coordinated heterotypic interactions in a 3D environment in order to self-organize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bredenoord et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sasai, 2013</xref>); the ability to precisely predict and control the organization of multiple cell types in parallel would significantly improve the reproducibility and robustness of <italic>in vitro</italic> tissue modeling. Ultimately, this study identifies a novel strategy to direct the emergence of heterotypic cell populations to control multicellular organization in pluripotent stem cells, and subsequently facilitates the creation of robust models of morphogenesis necessary for the mechanistic study of human developmental tissue patterning and formation.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

A LIVE/DEAD stain (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used per manufacture instructions. Prior to sorting, cells were suspended in PBS supplemented with Y-27632(10 μM) and kept on ice. A BD FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences) was used to isolate pure populations of WT-GFP and CRISPRi hiPSCs by first identifying the live cells via the LIVE/DEAD(350) stain and subsequently sorting the mCherry(+) GFP(-) populations from the mCherry(-)GFP(+) populations directly into TRIzol LS Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientifc). Samples were then stored at −80°C until subsequent mRNA extraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Fluidigm 96.96 array</title><p>Sorted hiPSCs stored in TRIzol LS were thawed on ice and mRNA was extracted using a Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Plus kit (ZYMO Research) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was converted to cDNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Forward and reverse primers for genes were designed using NCBI’s Primer-BLAST (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> - Table 3). Primers were pooled to 500 nM to enable specific-target amplification and cDNA was amplified with PreAmp Master Mix (Fluidigm) and pooled primers for 15 cycles. Pre-amplified samples mixed with 2X SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix with low ROX(Bio-Rad) and 20X DNA Binding Dye Sample Loading Reagent (Fluidigm), and 10 μM primer sets were mixed with 2X Assay Loading Reagent (Fluidigm). 5 μl of diluted cDNA and primers and were loaded onto the IFC chip per manufacturer’s instructions and loaded into the chip using the IFC Controller HX (Fluidigm). qPCR was run for 40 cycles in the IFC chip using the BioMark HD in the BioMark HD Data Collection Software. Resulting data was analyzed in the Real-Time PCR Analysis Software. All instruments and software involved with the IFC chip were manufactured by Fluidigm. Gene expression levels were calculated with respect to time-matched pure populations of WT hiPSCs, and hierarchically clustered and plotted using Genesis software (Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics, Graz University of Technology).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Human iPSC differentiation</title><p>For the dual SMAD and CHIR germ lineage differentiations, 100 cell mixed colonies were generated as previously described, cultured in mTeSR<sup>TM</sup>-1 medium (STEMCELL Technologies), and allowed to form patterns for 5 days in pluripotency maintenance conditions. After 5 days, the media was supplemented with either SB 435142 (10μM; Stemgent) and LDN 193189 (0.2μM; Sigma-Aldrich) or CHIR 99021 (12μM; Selleckchem). CHIR was pulsed for 24 hr periods on the first and fourth day of the mesendoderm directed differentiation. Dual SMAD inhibition was kept constant for 6 days by supplementing SB 435142 and LDN 193189 into MTeSR media to direct germ lineage to an ectodermal fate. After 6 days of differentiation, colonies were washed 3X with PBS and fixed for staining with 4% paraformaldehyde (VWR) as previously described.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Computational image analysis</title><p>For the radial position computational analysis, fluorescent images were split into single RGB channel images using the Python module scikit-image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">scikit-image contributors et al., 2014</xref>) where the red channel denoted CRISPRi cells, the green channel denoted WT cells, and the blue channel denoted DAPI staining of the entire colony. A mask of each channel was created by thresholding, removing small objects, and removing small holes. The radius (r) of each colony was calculated using the DAPI mask and the ratio of inner red cell area vs. outer red cell area was calculated by taking the logical AND of the red channel mask and the DAPI mask above ¾ r vs the logical AND of the red channel mask and the DAPI mask below ¼ r and normalizing to the total red mask area. To ensure accuracy, the inner vs. outer red ratio was averaged with the inverse of the inner vs. outer green ratio (calculated in the same manner using the green channel mask).</p><p>For the differentiation analysis, fluorescent images were split into single RGB channels where the red channel denoted CRISPRi cells (mCherry+), the green channel denoted WT cells (GFP+), and the blue channel denoted either PAX6 or EOMES positive cells. The pixel area of cell types was determined by thresholding the WT, CRISPRi, or EOMES/PAX6 +images before ‘removing small objects’ and ‘removing small holes’ to create a mask of the area covered by each individual cell type. The EOMES or PAX6 +population was calculated by taking the logical AND of either the WT and EOMES/PAX6 +mask or the CRISPRi and the EOMES/PAX6 +masks and then normalizing to the total area of the WT or CRISPRi mask, respectively. The ratio of EOMES/PAX6 +cells in CRISPRi cell compared to WT was calculated by dividing the normalized EOMES/PAX6 +area of the CRISPRi mask by the normalized EOMES/PAX6 +area of the WT mask.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistics</title><p>To ensure unbiased sampling of colonies in all cell mixing experiments, 10 colonies were randomly chosen on day zero before pattern formation and imaged daily thereafter. Each experiment was performed with at least three biological replicates. Unpaired T-tests were used to compare two groups. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare three or more groups, followed by post-hoc pairwise comparisons by Tukey’s tests. In gene expression analysis, three replicates were used for each condition, and all gene expression was normalized to control mixed populations (off-target guide without knockdown) to control for any gene expression changes due to mixing or the process of FACS sorting. In all comparisons, significance was specified as p≤0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Gladstone Light Microscopy and Histology Core, the Gladstone Flow Cytometry Core (NIH P30 AI027763, NIH S10 RR028962, and the James B Pendleton Charitable Trust), and the Gladstone Stem Cell Core for their support and experimental expertise.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Krishanu Saha (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Libby and colleagues report the methodology for inducing differentiation of human iPS cells into multiple populations capable of forming complex multicellular structures, by genetic control of symmetry-breaking events in cultured cells. Two molecular regulators were knocked down: ROCK1 (regulating cortical tension) and CDH1 (regulating cell-cell adhesion). Interestingly, the co-culture of gene edited cells with wild type cells resulted in spatial patterning of cell populations while their pluripotency has been maintained. The importance of this methodology will likely go way beyond the scope of this study, as a powerful and highly controllable tool for studies of development, maturation and disease using human cell and tissue models. The study is well planned and executed, with a few areas that need clarification and improvement. In addition, the impact of the findings would be further increased by providing at least one demonstration of how cell patterning could, be used in studies of signal propagation, morphogenic events in organoid systems, or modeling of diseases.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Mixing of the cells is an important part of the methodology and the way it is done may have major effects on biological outcomes. The paper would benefit from more rigorous and more extensive evaluation of mixing (segregation) using images from multiple biological replicates and multiple independent experiments. Also, the authors should explain how the individual images were selected (randomly or not; with or without exclusion criteria), and how exactly they assessed the differences between the groups and time points. In some instances, the knockout and control samples look more similar than one would expect, and it will be important to eliminate any ambiguity in data assessment and interpretation.</p><p>2) While the methodology reported in this paper is clearly applicable to a number of biological questions, the authors do not provide examples (case studies) for such applications. If possible, an example illustrating the utility of cell patterning should be included, and this would further increase the impact and value of this excellent work. We hope you have such an analysis in hand and could include it here.</p><p>3) Although the CDH1 KD population appears to maintain OCT4/SOX2 expression during the mixing studies, the β-catenin staining appears to show nuclear localization of β-catenin in the CDH1 KD colonies. If the authors would like to claim that the CDH1 KD maintains pluripotency within the pure colonies (as they do in the manuscript based on morphology of the colonies), they should show expression of Wnt targets, along with quantified expression of pluripotency-associated proteins in the pure colonies after CDH1 KD. How do BRA (primitive streak) and SOX9 (neural crest) gene or protein expression look in these CDH1 KD colonies?</p><p>4) The observation that CDH1 expression is not significantly different in the CDH1 KD fraction in the mixing study at the 6-day timepoint when the cells are mixed with the control cells for the duration is interesting. Can the authors explain why this is happening? Also, the authors should comment on the multi-layer organization of the ROCK1 KD upon mixing with the WT population in Figure 2F.</p><p>In the control images shown by the authors where WT-GFP cells are mixed with the DOX treated CRISPRi line without any gRNA added, there already appears to be some segregation likely owing to differential cell-cell adhesion between the two subpopulations (Figure 2B, first row). This makes the interpretation somewhat difficult.</p><p>5) It is not entirely clear how the cell density (clearly an important factor in cell fate and function) was established and controlled in the experiments. Consideration should also be given to the changes in cell density over culture time, which may be different for different cell types. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1, the control CRISPRi cells in the 25% condition seem to be more than 25% of the overall population on Day four. Do the control CRISPRi cells dominate over the WT iPSCs? The proportion of CRISPRi cells to WT cells in the control, ROCK1 KD, CDH1 KD cases seem to be different at the end of Day four.</p><p>6) Throughout the paper, the statements about the exact numbers of replicates and experiments, and the reproducibility of the reported data should be included.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36045.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Mixing of the cells is an important part of the methodology and the way it is done may have major effects on biological outcomes.

To provide examples of this utility, we now include a supplemental figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 2) with the results of two directed differentiation protocols targeting different germ layers (ectoderm and mesendoderm using dual SMAD inhibition or transient CHIR treatment, respectively). In both cases, we immunostained the cells after 6 days for the lineage markers PAX6 and EOMES to assess relative differentiation to ectoderm and mesoderm. We observed that the ROCK1 KD cells in mixed colonies stained for both PAX6 and EOMES with no significant differences from the control. However CDH1 KD populations predominantly expressed nuclear EOMES over control populations and had fewer cells expressing PAX6. A discussion of the potential applications of these results has been included in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Although the CDH1 KD population appears to maintain OCT4/SOX2 expression during the mixing studies, the β-catenin staining appears to show nuclear localization of β-catenin in the CDH1 KD colonies.

How do BRA (primitive streak) and SOX9 (neural crest) gene or protein expression look in these CDH1 KD colonies?</p></disp-quote><p>We fully acknowledge that expression of OCT4/SOX2 alone is not sufficient to ensure pluripotency is being retained, but the coincident expression of both markers is consistent with maintenance of a pluripotent phenotype. To further address this concern, we performed additional qPCR on both CDH1 KD and ROCK1 KD cultures to examine lineage markers associated with the primitive streak (BRA) and the neural crest (SOX9) to supplement the quantitative analysis of pluripotent-associated markers. The results of these analyses are now included in a new panel added to Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The observation that CDH1 expression is not significantly different in the CDH1 KD fraction in the mixing study at the 6-day timepoint when the cells are mixed with the control cells for the duration is interesting.

This makes the interpretation somewhat difficult.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any confusion regarding the presentation of the data in Figure 4; this was a complex study with a lot of comparative controls. We have attempted to address this by restructuring the figure to better depict the data and provide a clearer explanation of the results in the text and figure legend. Additionally, we included a separate qPCR study specific for mixed colonies interrogating genes associated with pluripotency and early germ lineages (Figure 4C, D).</p><p>As the multilayer organization of the ROCK1 KD cells occurs only during short term KD, when KD is induced after mixing with WT, we have addressed these results in the Discussion by describing how ROCK inhibition studies compare to our results and the potential implications of long term knockdown of ROCK1 on cellular biology.</p><p>We acknowledge that some differential adhesion between cell populations cultured separately beforehand may occur upon mixing. In order to better address how well the different cell populations segregate, we now include quantitative data of radial cell distribution (Figure 2D, H) and description of pattern classification as mentioned above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is not entirely clear how the cell density (clearly an important factor in cell fate and function) was established and controlled in the experiments.
