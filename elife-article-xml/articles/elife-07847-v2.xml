The aim of the current study was to analyse and compare their contribution to innate immune surveillance of the lung in the steady state with macrophage and dendritic cells (DC). ECFP and EGFP transgenic reporters based upon <italic>Csf1r</italic> and <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> distinguish monocytes from resident mononuclear phagocytes. We used these transgenes to study the migratory properties of monocytes and macrophages by functional imaging on explanted lungs. Migratory monocytes were found to be either patrolling within large vessels of the lung or locating at the interface between lung capillaries and alveoli. This spatial organisation gives to monocytes the property to capture fluorescent particles derived from both vascular and airway routes. We conclude that monocytes participate in steady-state surveillance of the lung, in a way that is complementary to resident macrophages and DC, without differentiating into macrophages.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07847.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07847.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07847.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>White blood cells form part of the immune system, which protects the body against infectious diseases and other harmful agents. Some of these cells, including ‘mononuclear phagocytes’, can reside within different tissues of the body, such as the lungs. Other less specialized cells, called monocytes, circulate in the bloodstream. It had long been thought that once these monocytes had taken up residence in a tissue, they could only develop into tissue-resident phagocytes. Several researchers, however, recently reported that monocytes can also reside within tissues without becoming more specialized. Nevertheless, it remained unclear what these cells did when they were in these tissues.</p><p>Rodero, Poupel, Loyher et al. investigated the activities of tissue-resident monocytes found in the lungs of mice. First, mice were genetically engineered to produce fluorescent markers that meant that their monocytes could be easily distinguished from the mononuclear phagocytes in their lungs when viewed under a microscope. Rodero, Poupel, Loyher et al. then showed that the monocytes and the other mononuclear phagocytes localized to different regions of the lung. Further experiments showed that these two groups of cells also moved around the lungs in different ways. The tissue-resident monocytes surveyed both the blood vessels and airways, while the other tissue-resident mononuclear phagocytes only surveyed the airways.</p><p>These findings show that lung-resident monocytes perform a different role to those found in the bloodstream. The findings also open the way to improving our understanding of what tissue-resident monocytes do in other organs, and in healthy or diseased animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07847.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07847.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>monocyte</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>lung immunology</kwd><kwd>live imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission (EC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>n 304810</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boissonnas</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission (EC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>n 241440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Combadière</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boissonnas</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boissonnas</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emergence 2012 (ANR-EMMA-050)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Combadière</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Monocytes display distinct migratory and functional activity compared to dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages in the lungs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) consists of a family of cells—including monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DC)—that are derived from common committed bone marrow progenitors and perform related functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hume, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hashimoto et al., 2011</xref>). The lung is a mucosal surface of the body, exposed constantly to inhaled particles including pathogens, as well as other potential toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nelson et al., 2012</xref>). Lung mononuclear phagocytes have been shown to adapt specifically to the lung environment, and contribute to lung homeostasis, scavenging, and immune surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kopf et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">The lungs at the frontlines of immunity, 2014</xref>). Monocytes were originally considered to be circulating precursors of macrophages, participating in renewal of tissue-resident macrophages in steady state and recruited in large numbers in response to inflammatory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auffray et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geissmann et al., 2010</xref>). Fate mapping approaches and parabiosis experiments have been used to argue that tissue-resident macrophages such as alveolar macrophages (AM) may be seeded from the yolk sac or foetal liver during embryonic development and can be maintained in the absence of monocyte recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guilliams et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hashimoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yona et al., 2013</xref>). However, others have suggested the models used in these studies may disturb the availability of the key growth factor, CSF1, and do not necessarily reflect the steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jenkins and Hume, 2014</xref>). Whatever their normal contribution to the resident macrophage pool, monocytes derived from the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chow et al., 2011</xref>) and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swirski et al., 2009</xref>) can clearly replenish tissue macrophages after their cytotoxic depletion. Beyond this precursor role, monocytes carry out specific effector functions during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Serbina et al., 2008</xref>) and may be involved in steady-state tissue surveillance by capturing and transporting antigen from tissue to lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jakubzick et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Macrophages isolated from different organs have distinct expression profiles which can be distinguished further if the cells are separated according to their surface markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gautier et al., 2013</xref>). Unfortunately, no available surface marker is well correlated with any other marker, at either the protein or mRNA level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hume, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hume et al., 2010</xref>), so the number of macrophage subsets definable by flow cytometry is essentially infinite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becher et al., 2014</xref>). Peripheral blood monocytes, on the other hand, can be subdivided into two broad functional classes. In the mouse, one subset called classical monocytes, expresses high levels of both Ly6C and the chemokine receptor CCR2 but a low level of the fractalkine (CX3CL1) receptor CX3CR1, while the second, the so-called non-classical monocytes, lacks Ly6C but expresses a high level of CX3CR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geissmann et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to what we know about tissue macrophages, very little information is available on how monocytes behave after entering tissues. Myeloid-restricted fluorescent reporter genes based upon various lineage-restricted genes have been used in live imaging and functional genomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hume, 2011</xref>). A C<italic>sf1r</italic>-EGFP reporter gene serves as a definitive marker of MPS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sasmono et al., 2003</xref>), while a <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>-EGFP reporter labels the non-classical monocytes as well as subsets of tissue macrophages, including microglia, as well as a subset of natural killer (NK) lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jung et al., 2000</xref>). The <italic>Itgax</italic>-YFP transgenic mouse was considered to provide a marker for classical ‘dendritic cells’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lindquist et al., 2004</xref>) and has been used to image so-called interstitial DC in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Looney et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thornton et al., 2012</xref>). However, this reporter is rather uniformly expressed in tissue macrophages associated with mucosa and in the lung provides a generic MPS marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hume, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2012</xref>). The deletion of a conserved distal element of the <italic>Csf1r</italic> promoter in the <italic>Csf1r-ECFP</italic><sup><italic>tg/+</italic></sup> mouse (MacBlue) ablates expression of a reporter gene in trophoblasts, osteoclasts, granulocytes, and many tissue macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ovchinnikov et al., 2008</xref>). This deleted promoter was used to construct an amplified binary transgene in which <italic>Csf1r</italic> promoter elements direct the expression of gal4-VP16, which in turn activates expression of a UAS-ECFP transgene. All blood monocytes in these MacBlue mice are strongly ECFP<sup>+</sup>, whereas most tissue macrophages do not express the reporter protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sauter et al., 2014</xref>). In the current study, we combined the myeloid-specific fluorescent reporters from MacBlue mice with either <italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>gfp/+</italic></sup> or <italic>Itgax</italic>-YFP transgenic mice to support in situ imaging of lung monocyte cell trafficking and compare their phagocytic activity with that of resident mononuclear phagocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The MacBlue×<italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>gfp/+</italic></sup> transgenic mouse discriminates lung mononuclear phagocyte subsets with specific tissue localization</title><p>The MacBlue binary transgene (<italic>Csf1r-</italic>gal4VP16/UAS-ECFP) provides a unique marker of blood monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jenkins and Hume, 2014</xref>). To confirm this restricted expression in the lung, we generated MacBlue×<italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>gfp/+</italic></sup> double transgenic mice. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy 3D-reconstruction of fresh explanted lung and histological section of cryo-preserved lungs from these mice identified distinct subsets with distinct morphologies and distributions within the organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Stellar EGFP<sup>+</sup>ECFP<sup>neg</sup> cells were seen in the collagen membrane surrounding the lung pleura (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, green squares), deeper in the lung parenchyma with small round shapes or stellar shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, green squares), and along the basal membranes of bronchial airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, green squares). The luminal side of airways and alveoli contained large round ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells, likely AM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>, pink squares). Smaller amoeboid-like ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells were located in the interstitial space of the lung parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>, purple squares). In overview, the pattern was consistent with previous evidence that the MacBlue ECFP transgene was expressed only in AM and monocyte-like cells, whereas most interstitial CX3CR1-EGFP expressing cells lacked expression.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07847.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MacBlue×<italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>gfp/+</italic></sup> transgenic mouse discriminates lung mononuclear phagocyte subsets with specific tissue localization.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Front and side views of two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) 3D reconstruction from pleura to alveolar space of explanted lung from a MacBlue×<italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>gfp/+</italic></sup> mouse. <bold>(B)</bold> MacBlue×<italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>gfp/+</italic></sup> mouse lung cryo-section showing lung pleura and parenchyma. <bold>(C)</bold> MacBlue×<italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>gfp/+</italic></sup> mouse lung cryo-section showing longitudinal view of bronchial airway. <bold>(D)</bold> MacBlue×<italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>gfp/+</italic></sup> mouse lung cryo-section showing interstitial space near bronchial airways and alveoli.

Small interstitial ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells (area 61 ± 17 μm²) with an amoeboid-like shape displayed a bimodal behaviour: they were either highly motile, going backwards and forwards between the alveoli, or relatively sessile with protrusions extending towards the lumen of the alveoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1 media2">Videos 1 and 2</xref>). Based upon these distinct behaviours, we defined ‘patrolling’ cells with high velocity (10 ± 4.6 μm/min) and a low arrest coefficient (14 ± 13%) and interstitial ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells with lower velocity (4 ± 2.2 μm/min) and a higher arrest coefficient (64 ± 21%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Intravenous injection of rhodamine dextran prior to mouse sacrifice permitted, during a short time frame before vascular leakage, to determine that fast moving patrolling ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells were located inside large vessels, whereas slow motile ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells appeared to be extravascular but in close contact with the vasculature (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). Aside from monocytes, large round ECFP<sup>bright</sup> AM (area 121 ± 23 μm²) were detected in the alveolar lumina, leisurely surveying the surface of the airways with a velocity of 2 ± 1.5 μm/min and a high arrest coefficient (76 ± 19%) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). Interstitial EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells also migrated slowly, with comparable velocity and arrest coefficient to AM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To determine their motility coefficient (MC), we plotted the mean square displacement as a function of the square root of time. The MC of patrolling monocytes was 30-fold higher than the MC of interstitial ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells (39 vs 1.3 μm²/min) and a further fourfold higher than the MC of AM (0.3 μm²/min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This higher MC in interstitial ECFP<sup>+</sup> monocytes was attributable to the protrusive activity and slow displacement suggesting scanning of the interalveolar space (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref><bold>)</bold>. Time lapse imaging of explanted non-transgenic lungs from parabiont mice showed similar scanning behaviour (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media5 media6">Videos 5 and 6</xref>), supporting the monocyte origin of these cells.

Based upon published markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guilliams et al., 2014</xref>), two sets of classical myeloid DC have been defined: CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC that were CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>−</sup>SiglecF<sup>-</sup>IAb<sup>high</sup>CD64<sup>−</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> and CD11b<sup>−</sup> DC that were CD11b<sup>−</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>−</sup>SiglecF<sup>-</sup>IAb<sup>high</sup>CD64<sup>−</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We determined the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of EGFP, ECFP, and YFP reporters from the MacBlue×<italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>gfp/+</italic></sup> and MacBlue×<italic>Itgax</italic>-YFP in these subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). EGFP and ECFP fluorescent reporter expressions were mainly restricted to lung macrophage and monocyte subsets as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Although CD11c mRNA and surface protein are expressed widely among tissue macrophages in the lung, YFP expression was mainly restricted to the defined classical DC subsets with a brighter expression for CD11b<sup>−</sup> DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Interestingly, AM only express the MacBlue transgene and despite expression of CD11c protein on their surface, YFP was detectable in only a small subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>). Thus the combination of these different transgenes permits the distinction of lung mononuclear phagocytes and lung DC. AM represented the most abundant mononuclear phagocyte subset of the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Lung monocytes represented the second main mononuclear phagocyte subset and were even more numerous than interstitial macrophages, CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC and CD11b<sup>−</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Histological analysis of a lung section of MacBlue×<italic>Itgax</italic>-YFP showed that YFP<sup>bright</sup> cells were mainly located along bronchial airways and poorly distributed in the alveolar space in contrast to ECFP<sup>+</sup> monocytes and AM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07847.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Interstitial monocyte-derived cells localized in the alveolar space whereas lung dendritic cells preferentially localized near large airways.</title><p><bold>(A</bold>) Dot plots show the gating strategy to define the different lung mononuclear phagocytes and dendritic cells from either MacBlue×<italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>gfp/+</italic></sup> or MacBlue×<italic>Itgax</italic>-YFP mice.

This approach was reported to be technically challenging due to the vascular permeability of the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jakubzick et al., 2013</xref>). Lung mononuclear phagocyte subsets and neutrophils were labelled in different proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). AM were not labelled, confirming that the antibody did not reach the airways. Overall, 27% of interstitial macrophages, 12% of CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC, and only 1% of CD11b<sup>−</sup> DC were labelled, suggesting a distinct location of these subsets related to the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Up to 90% of Ly6C<sup>high</sup> and Ly6C<sup>low</sup> lung monocytes were labelled by the anti-CD45 antibody in vivo; however, the MFI was significantly lower compared to that of blood monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). We excluded that this effect was due to collagen treatment, as similar results were obtained in non-digested lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Furthermore, the phenotype of both Ly6C<sup>high</sup> and Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes was slightly distinct from their circulating counterparts. Indeed lung monocytes displayed reduced expression of Ly6C, CD62L, and CD115 as previously observed, in addition to a higher level of CD11b, whereas only Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes displayed higher CD11c expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). The same differences were observed in monocytes isolated from lung without enzymatic digestion (data not shown). These results suggest that monocytes can be either extravascular but in close vicinity to the vessels or still intravascular and trapped in capillaries with reduced access to the bloodstream and submitted to the lung environment. MacBlue×<italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>gfp/+</italic></sup> mice were inoculated intravenously 5 min before sacrifice with a mixture of 10 µm and 0.2 µm red fluorescent beads to differentiate large vessel areas identified by the presence of both 10 µm and 0.2 µm beads, and lung capillary areas identified by only 0.2 µm beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). In large vessels, ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells were mainly round shaped, whereas in the vicinity of capillaries, interstitial ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells displayed an elongated or amoeboid-like shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Confocal analysis of the microvascular area using CD31 staining showed that interstitial ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells locate at the interface between the capillaries and the alveoli either intra- or extravascularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>). To confirm that this positioning allows the sampling of particles inoculated by the airways route, we performed in vivo CD45 staining of monocytes that had captured beads 4 hr after intranasal inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). CD45 in vivo labelling was exactly the same for both Ly6C<sup>high</sup> and Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes that had captured the beads compared to non-phagocytic monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>).

(2013</xref>) recently reported that monocytes enter and survey non-lymphoid organs (such as the lungs) at steady state. How this property differs from the already known functions of AM and DC was still unknown. Fluorescent myeloid-specific reporter transgenic mice have been widely used to study the behaviour of myeloid cells in vivo, although no transgenic reporter is restricted to a particular myeloid lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hume, 2011</xref>). LysM reporters can be used to track either neutrophils or monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Faust et al., 2000</xref>). A wide diversity of cell subsets are labelled in the <italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>gfp/+</italic></sup> system, including NK cells, which can be excluded only with a specific γc-deficient background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auffray et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, the MacGreen (Csf1r-EGFP) transgene enables labelling of a wide range of mononuclear phagocytes as well as granulocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sasmono et al., 2003</xref>). The MacBlue binary transgene, based upon a deleted Csf1r promoter, produced a transgenic line in which the reporter gene is extinguished in the majority of mature tissue macrophages and greatly reduced in granulocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ovchinnikov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sauter et al., 2014</xref>). Despite the fact that ECFP expression is not directly related to the level of Csf1r mRNA, it provides a unique marker of cells that have recently derived from monocytes.</p><p>In the current study, we intercrossed <italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>gfp/+</italic></sup> and MacBlue mice to obtain an additional dimension of resolution and specificity. Monocytes were easily distinguishable from other subsets due to their common expression of ECFP. The differential expression of EGFP enabled a further distinction between Ly6C<sup>high</sup> and Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes. Although our imaging approach did not allow us to distinguish between the two monocyte subsets, the shape, size, tissue localization, and behaviour of the ECFP<sup>+</sup> cells provided a unique opportunity to track lung tissue mononuclear phagocytes and to compare their migratory patterns. The dual reporter also avoids potential artefacts created by the γc-deficient background excluding NK cells which we have shown to be highly represented in the CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> fraction within the lungs. The combination of CCR2 and CX3CR1 deficient mice and parabionts permitted a more precise characterization of the nature and origin of the different subsets and confirmed that interstitial ECFP<sup>+</sup> were monocyte-derived according to the proposed unified nomenclature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guilliams et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Krummel’s group previously performed functional imaging of lung DC using the <italic>Itgax</italic>-YFP reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thornton et al., 2012</xref>). The combination of this reporter with the MacBlue mouse confirmed that interstitial monocyte-derived cells were distinct from lung DC. Histological analysis showed that monocyte-derived cells and DC share the surveillance activity through distinct regional distribution, the former located in the alveolar space at the interface with the bloodstream and the latter near larger bronchial airways. In vivo CD45 labelling added a new dimension of regional segregation between AM, interstitial macrophages, CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC, CD11b<sup>−</sup> DC, and lung monocytes. This specific regional segregation at steady state is likely the result of the rapid circulation of monocytes that arrest constitutively in the capillaries of the alveolar space with relatively short life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jakubzick et al., 2013</xref>), whereas DC are slow motile cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thornton et al., 2012</xref>). Of course regional segregation is likely less marked in the allergic asthma model for which important DC recruitment was observed in the vicinity of the alveoli, likely originating from monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jakubzick et al., 2008</xref>), where they exert longer transepithelial dendrites formation toward airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thornton et al., 2012</xref>). Our data demonstrate that the interstitial space of the lung is intensively surveyed by monocytes actively migrating or extending processes. The strategic positioning of lung monocytes at the interface allows for efficient capture of both blood and airway-derived particles. Four hours after intranasal inoculation, fluorescent particles remained undetectable in the mediastinal lymph nodes, as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jakubzick et al., 2008</xref>; data not shown), however after 1 d, DC seem to prevail over monocytes in the transport of the inhaled particles. This suggests that the majority of monocytes may scavenge particles to clean up the tissue and filter the blood, whereas the majority of DC aim to transport antigen to the draining lymph node.</p><p>Due to the vascular permeability of the lung, it is challenging to address the blood/tissue partitioning of the subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jakubzick et al., 2013</xref>). We combined in vivo CD45 labelling and confocal imaging to determine the precise location of lung monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Girgis et al., 2014</xref>). We determined that lung permeability does not allow it to be definitely concluded that lung monocytes share their time either intra- or extravascularly or even both. However, we showed that lung monocytes have a slightly differentiated phenotype compared to the circulating monocytes with a downregulation of CD115 and CD62L and an upregulation of CD11b and CD11c. Secondly, the proportions of Ly6C<sup>high</sup> and Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes were different in the lungs compared to the blood. Finally, monocyte localization in the vicinity of the bloodstream allows them to capture beads inoculated via the intranasal route.</p><p>Several studies used in situ imaging of the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kreisel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Looney et al., 2011</xref>), but it is likely that working on lung explants may somehow affect the dynamics of the studied cells. For instance, fast circulating monocytes in the blood flow could not be observed. Nevertheless, we still observed high velocity patrolling cells that were present within large vessels, suggesting that this migration is independent of the blood flow. This approach provides at least the advantage of better stability without breathing constraints and avoids any accumulation of inflammatory monocytes due to inflammation. Other monocyte behaviour might be observed using in vivo imaging.</p><p>By contrast to the CX3CR1-dependence of endothelium patrolling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auffray et al., 2007</xref>) as well as transepithelial dendrite formation in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), the patrolling activity of interstitial monocytes in the lung was unaffected by the absence of this receptor, whereas their scanning activity was severely impaired. Kim et al. showed that CX3CL1 was expressed by the epithelial cells of bronchioles and in the alveolar space using the CX3CL1-RFP reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), arguing in favour of the role of this axis in protrusive activity of the CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> monocyte-derived cells. Because CX3CR1 is an important survival pathway, it is unclear whether these modifications are related to defects in chemotactic signal or cell survival. We did not observe defects in phagocytosis in CX3CR1-deficient mice (unpublished data), suggesting that the recently recruited monocytes are functional, arguing in favour of a role of CX3CR1 in their survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our study provided important fundamental insights into the behaviour of tissue monocytes during the process of immune surveillance in comparison to resident macrophages and DC in a key biological tissue. We concluded that tissue monocytes represent a major first line phagocytic compartment in comparison to DC. Monocyte-derived cells developed an organized distribution at the interface between blood and airways with a specific pattern of movements in the lungs to enable them to rapidly detect danger, trigger inflammation, capture antigen, and undergo subsequent immune response. Understanding these activities is a key step towards improving the treatment of a wide range of inflammatory diseases and also vaccination strategies targeting the route of antigen uptake.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Cx3cr1</italic>-GFP-Kin (<italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>gfp/+</italic></sup>) or <italic>Itgax</italic>-YFP transgenic mice (CD11c-YFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lindquist et al., 2004</xref>) and <italic>Csf1r</italic>-Gal4VP16/UAS-ECFP (MacBlue) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ovchinnikov et al., 2008</xref>) were intercrossed to generate <italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>gfp/+</italic></sup>×<italic>Csf1r</italic>-Gal4VP16/UAS-ECFP mice herein called MacBlue×<italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>gfp/+</italic></sup> or MacBlue×<italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>gfp/gfp</italic></sup>, and MacBlue×<italic>Itgax</italic>-YFP, respectively.

For blood samples, erythrocytes were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 0.15 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 0.01 mM KHCO<sub>3</sub> and 0.1 mM EDTA and resuspended in 0.5% BSA/2 mM EDTA in PBS. FMO staining controls (full minus one) have been performed for all sets of experiment and are indicated in dot plots or histogram plots when necessary. Specific FMO gating for alveolar macrophages was required due to their bright autofluorescence. Absolute numbers were calculated by adding to each vial a fixed number (10,000) of non-fluorescent 10-µm Polybead Carboxylate Microspheres (Polysciences, Niles, IL, USA) according to the formula: no. cells = (no. acquired cells × 10,000)/(no. acquired beads).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Tissue processing for histology analysis</title><p>Briefly, organs were harvested and fixed in 10% formalin for 4 hr then incubated in 30% sucrose-PBS overnight at 4°C before being embedded in Tissue–Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek, Alphen aan den Rijn, Netherlands) and frozen at −80°C. Sectioning was completed on a HM550 Cryostat (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at −20°C and 5 μm sections were collected on Superfrost Plus Slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at −20°C until use.</p><p>Vascular staining using beads was performed on histological sections of lung from MacBlue×Cx3cr1<sup><italic>gfp/+</italic></sup> mice injected 5 min before sacrifice with a mixture of 10 µm Polybead Carboxylate Microspheres and 0.2 µm FluoroSpheres carboxylate. Lung sections were rehydrated with PBS for 10 min, counterstained and mounted with Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Vector Laboratories). Imaging used a Zeiss Axio Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). CD31 vascular staining was performed on lung cryo-sections from MacBlue×Cx3cr1<sup><italic>gfp/+</italic></sup> mice. A first blocking step was performed with 3% BSA/PBS solution for 30 min. Slides were then incubated for 1 hr at 37°C with the primary antibody rat anti-mouse CD31 (4 µg/ml) (clone MEC 13.3; Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) or the isotype control (4 µg/ml) (clone eBR2a; eBioscience). Slides were next incubated with Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit (SP-2001; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and then stained with a biotinylated donkey anti-rat IgG at 3 µg/ml for 30 min at room temperature. After three (5 min) washes in PBS, slides were incubated with Cy3-conjugated streptavidin at 2.6 µg/ml for 30 min at room temperature (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA). Slides were counterstained and mounted with Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI and analysed by using a Zeiss LSM 710 NLO confocal microscope coupled with 458 nm, 488 nm, and 543 nm lasers to detect ECFP, EGFP, and Cy3 simultaneously on three photomultipliers.</p><p>Acquisition settings were identical for both isotype and CD31 staining. Volume rendering was performed using Imaris software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) and parameters were set according to CD31 isotype staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Multiphoton imaging</title><p>Freshly explanted lungs were immobilized in an imaging chamber perfused with oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub> plus 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) RPMI medium containing 10% FCS. The local temperature was monitored and maintained at 37°C. For some experiments, 2 MkDa rhodamine dextran was injected intravenously 1 min before euthanasia and lung vasculature was ligatured to reduce leakage of the dye. The two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) set-up used consisted of a Zeiss LSM 710 NLO multiphoton microscope (Carl Zeiss) coupled to a Ti:Sapphire crystal laser (Coherent Chameleon Ultra, Santa Clara, CA, USA), which provides 140 fs pulses of NIR light, selectively tunable between 680 and 1080 nm, and an acousto-optic modulator to control laser power. The system included three external non-descanned detectors that enabled the simultaneous recording of three fluorescent channels with a combination of two dichroic mirrors (565 nm and 690 nm), 565/610 and 500/550 bandpass filters, and a 485 lowpass filter. The excitation wavelength was 870 nm. Cell motility was measured every 30 s by five consecutive 3 μm z spacing stacks (total thickness of 12 μm) with a plan apochromat × 20 (NA = 1) water immersion objective.</p><p>Fluorescent cells were monitored over time with three-dimensional automatic tracking and manual correction with Imaris software (Bitplane). The different cell subsets were defined according to the fluorescent signature, the size, the shape, the localization, and the behaviour. Typically AM are ECFP<sup>bright</sup>, large, round, and sessile cells located in the lumen of alveoli. Patrolling monocytes are ECFP<sup>+</sup> and small with an amoeboid-like shape displaying strong displacements in the interalveolar space. Interstitial monocyte-derived cells are ECFP<sup>+</sup> sessile cells displaying protrusive activity in the interalveolar space. Interstitial EGFP<sup>+</sup> are either small and round (likely NK) in the lung alveolar space, or dendritic-shaped in the pleura and along airways. Cells that could not be tracked for more than 2 min were not considered. The arrest coefficient was defined as the proportion of time each cell’s instantaneous velocity (calculated for every 30 s interval) was less than 2 μm/min. The MC was determined on a 2D-based analysis by z projection of the 3D stacks, using the formula (x²/4 t) (where x represents the slope of the mean displacement as a function of the square root of time) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cahalan and Parker, 2008</xref>) (see statistical section). Coefficient of sphericity variation was determined by calculating the coefficient of variation with Graphpad Prism (Graphpad, San Diego, CA, USA) of the sphericity determined for each cell on 10 consecutive planes (5 min). Velocity and sphericity were determined using Imaris (Bitplane). The acquisition and analysis protocols for all experimental conditions to be compared were identical.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed with Graphpad Prism. For intravital analysis of cell behaviour, each sample value was first tested for Gaussian distribution by the D'Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test. Accordingly, multigroup comparison tests were performed by one-way ANOVA for parametric distribution followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison test or Kruskal–Wallis test for non-parametric distributions, followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test. For simple comparison analysis, Student’s t test was performed to compare parametric distribution and Mann–Whitney rank sum tests were performed to compare non-parametric distribution. For MC measurement, the slope of the mean displacement as a function of the square root of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cahalan and Parker, 2008</xref>) was calculated by linear regression statistical analysis. Linearity was considered significant for r² &gt;0.9. Symbols used: *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01; ***, p&lt;0.001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank Jo Ann Cahn for manuscript editing, the Plateforme Imagerie Pitié-Salpêtrière (PICPS) for assistance with the two-photon microscopes, and the animal facility ‘NAC’ and Camille Baudesson for mice breeding assistance.

Monocytes are leukocytes classically considered to be located in the blood and believed to differentiate upon extravasation into macrophage- or DC-like cells. Recently though, a tissue-resident monocyte population has been reported. The exact dwell times of these cells in the tissue, their fates and most importantly their functional relevance remain unclear. The study of blood monocytes and tissue monocytes, and the definition of their functions, is among most important outstanding issues in the field. At the same time, it is highly challenging due to the dynamics of the system. The major novelty of the work, and a development that will be of broad interest to readers beyond those in pulmonary immunology, is the development of a mouse strain that displays unique combinations of single or double fluorescent tags, allowing one to separately distinguish monocytes from bona fide macrophages or dendritic cells. The authors employ these new tagged animals to investigate the concept previously published by Jakubzick et al., Immunity 2013 that monocytes in a relatively undifferentiated state inhabit the parenchyma of the lung and display unique functions/behavior compared with macrophages or DCs. The authors carry out 2-photon microscopy to show that monocytes and DCs are highly motile in the lung but localize to distinct anatomical regions. This is an exciting finding since it suggests that both cell types might survey the organ in distinct spaces and, as shown by Jakubzick et al., transport antigen from these different locations to the draining LNs.</p><p>A large portion of the manuscript is rightly devoted to proving that <italic>Cx3cr1-GFP</italic>/ <italic>Csf1r-EGFP</italic> double reporter positive cells are monocyte-derived cells. The authors then provide data on the migration properties of the cells and perform functional studies by challenging the mice intravenously or intra-tracheally with fluorescently-labeled latex beads and monitoring phagocytosis by the different mononuclear phagocytes. They provide evidence that tissue monocytes survey both the vascular and alveolar compartments, while surveillance of tissue resident DC and macrophages is restricted to material delivered by the tracheal route.</p><p>Altogether, this is an important study that introduces a novel, though complex, experimental system to identify tissue monocytes. The authors provide some initial functional characterization of the cells, although the latter could clearly be substantiated, for instance by the addition of a pathogen challenge.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors argue that the labeled cells are in tissue because they performed an extensive perfusion and the cells in lung differ in phenotype and subset distribution from the cells found in blood. However, to strengthen this critical point they should determine blood/tissue partitioning, using in vivo CD45 labeling, for instance as recently reported by Girgis et al. (PLOS Pathogen 2014), at least in their flow cytometric analysis but preferentially also in the imaging.</p><p>2) Among lung macrophages, alveolar macrophages are the least dependent on Csf1 since they depend on Csf2 for their survival and maturation locally, and therefore it is unclear why they should express higher levels of the Csf1R? Can the authors clarify whey they express higher ECFP levels than interstitial macrophages.</p><p>3) The demonstration that monocytes do extravasate into the interstitial space needs to be further established using confocal analysis of lung sections stained with different endothelial markers.</p><p>4) Why do monocytes fail to differentiate into macrophages in the non-inflamed lung? Would they convert if macrophages are ablated in the absence of overt inflammation? While this may be experimentally difficult to address in the near term, there should be some discussion of this issue.</p><p>5) The authors have chosen to carry out their imaging using lung explants. In situ imaging of the lung using 2-photon microscopy has been reported by several groups (Kreisel, D. et al., PNAS, 2010; Looney MR, Thornton EE, Sen D, Lamm WJ, Glenny RW, Krummel MF. Nat Methods. 2011 January;8(1):91-6). There can be differences in behavior using explants vs direct intravital imaging and in the absence of additional studies using direct in vivo methods, the authors should be careful in their interpretations of dynamics.</p><p>6) Like Jakubzick et al., the authors make use of intranasally instilled beads as phagocytic cargo for DCs, monocytes, etc. The authors conclude that monocytes are more proficient at clearing cargo than DCs. But it is important to point out that it depends upon what one means by clearance. The authors seem to mean the quantity of material engulfed by monocytes and in that sense it appears that macrophages were the most proficient. However, Jakubzick et al. showed that DCs were still far more likely than monocytes to &quot;clear&quot; cargo by migrating with it to the draining lymph node, although monocytes could do this too. So when it comes to moving cargo to the LN, DCs seem to prevail. It does not appear that the authors separately investigated this issue, but it would be important to clarify the meaning of &quot;clearance&quot; and make sure that they do not inadvertently imply migratory clearance. Better citation of past studies that used particulate antigen tracers would be desirable in general.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) Both Ly6C<sup>high</sup> and Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes express surface CX3CR1, as shown by Geissmann et al. The authors should state this more clearly in their Introduction.</p><p>2) Parabiosis: To ensure that parabiosis led to efficient mixing in the parabionts, the authors should provide the number of mixed circulating T cells, B cells, neutrophils and monocytes in parabionts.</p><p>3) The movies could be rendered more aesthetically pleasing and easier to follow if more time was spent in processing them for display to readers.</p><p>4) It might be worthwhile to indicate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> that the difference in CD115 staining is likely due to cleavage in response to digestive enzymes used.</p><p>5) The number of alveolar macrophages, interstitial macrophages and DC in the lung should also be quantified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07847.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors argue that the labeled cells are in tissue because they performed an extensive perfusion and the cells in lung differ in phenotype and subset distribution from the cells found in blood.

Jakubzick et al. 2013 state: “The method was not useful in lung; resident DCs were labeled as were lung monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that anti- CD45 mAb readily accessed the highly vascularized lung.”</p><p>We performed this experiment by injecting i.v. 1 µg of anti-CD45, 2 min before sacrifice and showed that lung mononuclear phagocyte subsets and neutrophils were labelled in different proportions (See new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Up to 90% of Ly6C<sup>high</sup> and Ly6C<sup>low</sup> lung monocytes were labelled but the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for CD45 was significantly lower than that of blood monocytes suggesting a free access to CD45 staining but reduced compared to as mentioned above. We excluded that this effect was due to collagenase treatment, as similar results were obtained in non-digested lungs (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).</p><p>We analysed the MFI of different markers expressed by lung monocytes labelled with anti-CD45 and confirmed that lung monocytes showed downregulation of the expression of Ly6C, CD115 and CD62L and upregulation of the expression of integrins CD11b and CD11c compared to blood monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Again, this was not due to collagenase treatment, as similar results were obtained in non-digested blood and lungs. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>. Collagenase digestion is however necessary to isolate monocytes from the lung tissue (right panel).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07847.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(Left colored panels) MFI of indicated markers expressed by Ly6C<sup>high</sup> Mo (blue) and Ly6C<sup>low</sup> MP (red) of the blood (full bar) and the lung (empty bars).

Lung monocytes localized in both areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Confocal imaging after CD31 staining showed that monocyte located in close contact with capillaries either inside or at the interface between CD31 + cells and lung tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>).</p><p>Finally we performed in vivo CD45 labelling of lung monocytes after intranasal inoculation of beads.</p><p>We show that the intensity of CD45 labelling was identical in phagocytic and non-phagocytic monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). This result firmly confirmed that lung monocytes localisation, either intra or extravascular, provides the ability to capture beads in the airways.</p><p>These observations are in accordance with the difference observed between lung monocytes and lung DC in their ability to survey both blood vasculature and airways. We have added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and discussed the results in the manuscript (subsection “Lung monocyte-derived cells are located at the interface between blood and airways”.)</p><p><italic>2) Among lung macrophages, alveolar macrophages are the least dependent on Csf1 since they depend on Csf2 for their survival and maturation locally, and therefore it is unclear why they should express higher levels of the Csf1R? Can the authors clarify whey they express higher ECFP levels than interstitial macrophages</italic>.</p><p>In the MacBlue mice, the expression of the ECFP transgene is not directly related to the level of Csf1r mRNA. The promoter used has a deletion of the upstream promoter element that seems to be required for expression in most tissue macrophages (Sauter et al., PLosOne 2014). Alveolar macrophages, along with microglia and Langerhans cells, do not seem to require this element and so are uniquely labelled with ECFP in the MacBlue line. We commented this point (subsection “Lung monocyte-derived cells are located at the interface between blood and airways”).</p><p>As underlined by the reviewers, Schneider et al. recently describe the mandatory role of CSF2 in alveolar macrophages maturation (Schneider et al., 2014). However Schulz et al. demonstrate using a fate mapping approach that alveolar macrophages arise from the maturation of a non-hematopoietic Csf1r + precursor (Schulz et al., Science 2012). High expression of the Csf1R transgene by the alveolar macrophages has also been previously described in the Macgreen mice. In addition, treatment with a CSF1R antibody results in alveolar macrophages depletion (Mc Donald et al., blood 2010). Thus alveolar macrophages also depend on CSF1. The relative contribution of CSF1 and CSF2 in maturation and survival of alveolar macrophages deserve further investigation.</p><p><italic>3) The demonstration that monocytes do extravasate into the interstitial space needs to be further established using confocal analysis of lung sections stained with different endothelial markers</italic>.</p><p>Confocal analysis of lung sections stained with anti-CD31 and intravital imaging of lung explants after rhodamine dextran injection have been performed (see comments above). In addition with in vivo CD45 labelling experiments, we conclude that lung monocytes localize at the interface of the vasculature and the airways either inside or outside the capillaries, giving the ability to survey both routes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="media3 media4 media5 media6 media7 media8">Supplementary video 3-8</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Why do monocytes fail to differentiate into macrophages in the non-inflamed lung?

However, we do not exclude that a proportion of interstitial macrophages that express ECFP and EGFP like monocytes and higher expression of class II may origin from monocytes.</p><p>These results are now presented and discussed in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) The authors have chosen to carry out their imaging using lung explants.</italic> In situ <italic>imaging of the lung using 2-photon microscopy has been reported by several groups (Kreisel, D. et al., PNAS, 2010; Looney MR, Thornton EE, Sen D, Lamm WJ, Glenny RW, Krummel MF.

In our experiment we only consider clearance through beads capture. Four hours after intranasal injection we were not able to detect beads in mediastinal lymph nodes (data not shown) as it was previously reported Jakubzick et al., 2008. The relative contribution of monocytes and DCs in the transport of particles to the draining lymph node would require to analyse at later time points as performed by Jakubzick et al. The meaning of clearance has been adjusted according to reviewer suggestion, We discussed the point of particle transport and citations of the past studies have been added (subsection “Lung monocyte-derived cells survey both airways and vascular routes whereas DC survey only airways” and Discussion).</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) Both Ly6C<sup>high</sup> and Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes express surface CX3CR1, as shown by Geissmann et al.
