ATPase Vps4. We report a 4.3 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of the active Vps4 hexamer with its cofactor Vta1, ADP·BeF<sub>x</sub>, and an ESCRT-III substrate peptide. Four Vps4 subunits form a helix whose interfaces are consistent with ATP binding, is stabilized by Vta1, and binds the substrate peptide. The fifth subunit approximately continues this helix but appears to be dissociating. The final Vps4 subunit completes a notched-washer configuration as if transitioning between the ends of the helix. We propose that ATP binding propagates growth at one end of the helix while hydrolysis promotes disassembly at the other end, so that Vps4 ‘walks’ along ESCRT-III until it encounters the ordered N-terminal domain to destabilize the ESCRT-III lattice. This model may be generally applicable to other protein-translocating AAA ATPases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24487.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24487.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24487.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Membranes surround multiple compartments within cells as well as the cell itself. In living cells, these membranes are remodeled continuously. This allows cells to divide, move molecules between different compartments and perform other essential activities. One important remodeling event is known as fission, which splits a membrane into separate parts.</p><p>Large repeating structures (or polymers) of ESCRT-III proteins play a crucial role in membrane fission. Breaking apart ESCRT-III polymers triggers membrane fission and also recycles the ESCRT-III proteins so that they can be used again.</p><p>An enzyme called Vps4 converts chemical energy (stored in the form of a molecule called ATP) into the mechanical force that breaks apart the ESCRT-III polymers. The active form of Vps4 consists of six Vps4 subunits working together to form a complex that includes a cofactor protein called Vta1. Monroe et al. have now used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of an active yeast Vps4-Vta1 complex while it is bound to a segment of an ESCRT-III protein. This revealed that four of the six Vps4 subunits form a helix (which resembles a spiral staircase) that binds ESCRT-III in its central pore.</p><p>The structure implies that binding of ATP causes the Vps4 helix to grow at one end and that converting ATP into a molecule called ADP (to release energy) causes disassembly at the other end. The two additional Vps4 subunits move from the disassembling end to the growing end of the helix. In this manner, Vps4 ‘walks’ along ESCRT-III, thereby pulling it through the pore at the center of the Vps4 complex and triggering breakdown of the ESCRT-III polymer. Further work is now needed to understand exactly how this activity leads to membrane fission.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24487.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24487.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>AAA ATPases</kwd><kwd>ESCRT pathway</kwd><kwd>Cryo-EM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 GM082545</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monroe</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Han</given-names></name><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Peter S</given-names></name><name><surname>Sundquist</surname><given-names>Wesley I</given-names></name><name><surname>Hill</surname><given-names>Christopher P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Microbial Pathogenesis Training Grant T32 AI055434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monroe</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A cryo-electron microscopy structure of a substrate-bound Vps4-Vta1 AAA ATPase reveals an asymmetric hexameric ring and suggests how nucleotide-induced changes in subunit interfaces translocate polypeptides into the central pore.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The AAA ATPase Vps4 drives the ESCRT (<italic>E</italic>ndosomal <italic>S</italic>orting <italic>C</italic>omplexes <italic>R</italic>equired for <italic>T</italic>ransport) pathways that mediate membrane deformation and fission in a wide range of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Monroe and Hill, 2016</xref>). These include membrane severing during cytokinetic abscission, the formation of multivesicular bodies and exosomes, shedding of microvesicles and viruses, repair of lesions in the plasma membrane, pruning of neurons, removal of defective nuclear pore complex assembly intermediates, and nuclear envelope closure at mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campsteijn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hurley, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McCullough et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Olmos and Carlton, 2016</xref>). The ESCRT pathways converge on the recruitment of ESCRT-III subunits, of which seven family members are recognized in yeast and 12 in human. The leading model is that the upstream factors recruit ESCRT-III subunits, which polymerize through their N-terminal domains to induce an inherently unstable membrane configuration that resolves by fission following Vps4-mediated disassembly or remodeling of the ESCRT-III polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McCullough et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schöneberg et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Multiple structures have been reported for domains of Vps4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Monroe and Hill, 2016</xref>).

The structure implies a helix propagation mechanism in which binding of ATP promotes growth at one end of the Vps4 helix and ATP hydrolysis promotes disassembly at the other end, such that the Vps4 hexamer ‘walks’ along the ESCRT-III polypeptide, thereby conveying the ESCRT-III substrate through the central Vps4 pore in an extended conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Formation of a stable Vps4 hexamer complex</title><p>The yeast Vps4 construct used in these studies (residues 101–437) spans the AAA ATPase cassette.

This density extends weakly at both ends and is not sufficiently clear to reliably build a model with side chains, consistent with the possibility that binding may occur in several overlapping positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The primary contacts are with pore loop 1 (residues 203–209) of the A, B, C, and D Vps4 subunits, whose closest Cα atoms are ~7.5 Å from the helix axis that is defined by these loops. There is also a contact with pore loop 1 of subunit E, although the loop density in that subunit is relatively weak. The peptide lies approximately along the helix axis, with Cα atoms modeled 1.0–2.7 Å (average 1.6 Å) from the axis, which is consistent with the model that substrates are translocated along or close to the helix axis, with some variation allowed to accommodate distinct amino acid sequences. The helical symmetry of pore loop 1 of Vps4 A-D is approximately continued by subunit E and has successive loops separated by a translation of 6.3 Å along the helix axis and a rotation of 60° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This matches the translation and rotation seen every two residues along a canonical β-strand, such that successive dipeptides of a β-strand that lies approximately along the helical axis could make equivalent interactions with pore loop 1 residues of successive Vps4 subunits. Hence, these four loops present a curved peptide-binding surface that extends into the hexamer pore. Pore loop 1 of subunit F is displaced ~14 Å from the helix axis and is therefore completely disengaged from the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Although we do not observe a contact between the peptide density and residues of Vps4 pore loop 2 (residues 241–251) and the density of pore loop 2 is generally quite poor, we note that these loops of the Vps4 A-D subunits are arrayed contiguously with the pore loop 1 residues through the hexamer pore and follow the same helical symmetry, which is consistent with the possibility that they continue the substrate binding surface used by Vps4 to translocate ESCRT-III subunits.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24487.022</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Pore loops of Vps4 form a spiral staircase to coordinate the substrate peptide.</title><p>Stereo view of the peptide and pore loop 1 (residues 203–210) of subunits A-D with density.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24487.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24487.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-24487-fig6-v2"/></fig><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24487.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Peptide binding and mechanism of translocation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The pore loop 1 residues of subunits A-D form a helix (axis, black line) that matches the symmetry of a canonical twisted β-strand, which rotates 60° and translates 6.3 Å every two residues.

In repeated cycles, the propagating 4-subunit Vps4 helix will ‘walk’ along the substrate while binding it in an extended β-strand conformation and conveying it through the hexamer pore. Some variation in strand conformation may be tolerated but the overall effect is expected to be unfolding of ESCRT-III structure as the Vps4 helix advances. The structure indicates that Vta1 will promote this process by binding adjacent Vps4 subunits in the helical conformation. Moreover, as seen in the structure, Vta1<sup>VSL</sup> forms the same helix-promoting interaction between subunits F and A, as if pulling subunit F into an ATP-binding position at the leading end of the helix. At the other end of the helix, ATP hydrolysis correlates with expansion of the D-E nucleotide site to trigger disassembly of the helix, disengagement from the substrate by subunit F, opening of the interface to allow nucleotide exchange, and subsequent rebinding at the leading end of the propagating helix. An attractive feature of this model is that the symmetry match between a β-strand ESCRT-III substrate and the pore loop 1 residues of the Vps4 helix means that each of the Vps4 subunits can make identical interactions with consecutive ESCRT-III dipeptides, and that these interactions do not need to change during the translocation process.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24487.026</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic of one step in the translocation mechanism.</title><p><italic>Left,</italic> Subunits A-D form a helical surface of pore loop 1 residues that binds substrate in a β conformation along or close to the helix axis.

As illustrated in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>, we envision that Vps4 concentrates at ESCRT-III polymers by binding of its MIT domain with MIMs at the ESCRT-III C-termini. Vta1 possesses an N-terminal tandem MIT domain (t-MIT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xiao et al., 2008</xref>) that can also bind MIM sequences and is connected to the VSL domain by a flexible ~100 residue linker. Because Vps4 and Vta1 also bind to each other, the concentrating effect at ESCRT-III polymers will be synergistic, and will promote Vps4 binding to ATP and hexamerization around the 30–170 flexible residues that lie between the MIM and the folded N-terminal domain of various ESCRT-III subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2015</xref>). The Vps4 complex can subsequently hydrolyze ATP to translocate along the polypeptide until the ESCRT-III N-terminal domain is destabilized and removed from the polymer. If the polymer remains intact after removal of one subunit, Vps4 and Vta1 would remain at high concentration due to the continuing MIM-MIT interactions and so could reassemble around another available ESCRT-III C-terminal sequence to repeat the process for as long as the ESCRT-III polymer persists to present an array of MIMs.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-24487-media3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24487.029</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Model of Vps4 assembly and ESCRT-III disassembly.</title><p>Vps4 (purple) is recruited to the ESCRT-III lattice (green) through binding of its N-terminal MIT domain to <italic><underline>M</underline></italic>IT <italic><underline>I</underline></italic>nteracting <italic><underline>M</underline></italic>otifs (MIMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kieffer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Obita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stuchell-Brereton et al., 2007</xref>), which are sequences at the ends of the long, flexible C-terminal tails of ESCRT-III subunits.

Samples were deposited on Quantifoil Graphene Oxide 2/4 200 mesh copper grids (SPI Supplies) glow-discharged for 25 s using a 10 mA current. Vitrification and data collection were performed as described above. 161,645 particles were extracted from 821 micrographs. After multiple rounds of 2D and 3D classification, particles were used for RELION auto-refinement, which yielded an ~13 Å resolution structure of the Vps4<sup>101-437</sup>-Hcp1 particle. Both 2D and 3D classes showed Vps4 features similar to those seen with the glutaraldehyde-crosslinked sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sriram Subramaniam as the Reviewing Editor and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: James M Berger and Janet Vonck.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Monroe et al. details the structure of the ESCRT-III disassembly protein, Vps4, in complex with the activating portion of its co-factor, Vta1, and both nucleotide and a peptide substrate. Vps4, a hexameric AAA+ ATPase, is found to adopt an asymmetric configuration in which five of its subunits adopt a spiral staircase configuration around what turns out to be an extended client peptide configuration; the sixth subunit is found to adopt several different positions between the upper and lower ends of the staircase. Vta1 is seen to bind to the edge of the Vps4 hexamer, in some instances serving as a bridge between adjoining subunits. The EM data acquisition and image analysis methodology is classical and seems solid. 3D classification and focused classification in RELION are used to resolve mobile or substoichiometric features.</p><p>The paper is well organized and an easy, enjoyable read. The structural data are used to suggest that this ATPAse unfolds client proteins by a rotary translocation mechanism, a model that seems eminently sensible based on the states captured here. The model of the Vps4 helix rotating along the unfolded ESCRT-III substrate in an ATP-dependent fashion is appealing and stimulating. The figures are mostly clear, but in some cases, it is difficult to follow where certain structural elements are located relative to each other, as detailed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Protein stabilization and preparation</p><p>The authors make the assumption that the Hcp1 protein fused to Vps4 to promote assembly does not influence the structure they observe. Since Hcp1 is a planar, C6 hexamer, and Vps4 is clearly asymmetric, this assumption seems reasonable. However, the authors should comment on this point a little more. For instance, is the high level of ATPase activity seen for Hcp1-fused Vps4 comparable to that of the wild-type protein on a native ESCRT- III assembly? Does changing the linker length between the Vsp4 and Hcp1 portions of the fusion protein alter activity? Additionally, regarding the fact that the Vps4 hexamer is stabilized by fusion to the hexameric Hcp1 and even further by 0.02% glutaraldehyde: although the ATPase activity is retained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), could the authors please address the possibility that this artificial stabilization by cross-linking may have implications for the physiological relevance of the structures determined in this manuscript. Finally, please provide more information regarding concentrations of proteins, buffer, and the reconstitution protocol.</p><p>2) Specific comments on 3D reconstruction to be addressed</p><p>A) The signal of Hcp1 was subtracted from the original images as proposed by Bai et al., 2015 to generate a new stack of images used for further refinement of the Vps4-Vta1<sup>VSL</sup>-ESCRT-III part.

For instance, is the high level of ATPase activity seen for Hcp1-fused Vps4 comparable to that of the wild-type protein on a native ESCRT- III assembly?

This is consistent with our earlier published finding that authentic Vps4 is active as a hexamer (Monroe et al., J.Mol.Biol. 426:510-25, 2014).</p><p>(ii) As the reviewers note, Hcp1 has not imposed its strict 6-fold rotational symmetry on Vps4, which displays marked asymmetry.</p><p>(iii) The fusion protein displays the same affinity for substrate ESCRT-III peptide as the corresponding Vps4 construct lacking the fusion partner. See Figure 1AB of the revised manuscript.</p><p>(iv) The fusion protein displays ~5-fold higher ATPase activity compared to the corresponding Vps4 construct lacking the fusion partner. These assays are done at relatively low Vps4 concentration where most of the Vps4 is disassembled, and indicate that Hcp1 is promoting formation of the active Vps4 hexamer. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> of the revised manuscript.</p><p>(v) The closest approach of Vps4 and Hcp1 atoms that have been modeled in the overall consensus structure is 7Å. This distance is too long for a direct Vps4-Hcp1 interaction and, moreover, those atoms are at the ends of inherently flexible side chains. Moreover, the Vps4 C-termini and the corresponding Hcp1 N-termini are separated by 21-31Å, which can easily be spanned by the 18-residue Vps4-Hcp1 linker, which in a fully extended conformation would be longer than 60Å. This point is noted in the first paragraph of the Results and Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>(vi) To address the concern that glutaraldehyde crosslinking might be altered the structure, we have determined the structure in the absence of glutaraldehyde crosslinking. This structure only extends to an overall resolution of 10Å, and the Vps4 portion is more poorly resolved than that. Nevertheless, the resulting low resolution structure clearly resembles the higher resolution structure determined for the glutaraldehyde-crosslinked fusion protein. These new data are shown in the revised manuscript as (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>Finally, please provide more information regarding concentrations of proteins, buffer, and the reconstitution protocol.</italic> </p><p>This has been included in the Methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Specific comments on 3D reconstruction to be addressed</italic> </p><p><italic>A) The signal of Hcp1 was subtracted from the original images as proposed by Bai et al., 2015 to generate a new stack of images used for further refinement of the Vps4-Vta1<sup>VSL</sup>-ESCRT-III part. Why didn't the authors then return to the original, non-subtracted particles for further 3D auto-refinement runs as a control as described in Bai et al.?</italic> </p><p>The motivation for signal subtraction is different between our paper and Bai et al. in two important respects:</p><p>(i) Bai et al. used signal subtraction to improve their focused 3D classification of a small (~30kDa) component of their complex. Thus, their control of returning to non-subtracted particles was needed to confirm that the focused classification indicated a component that was indeed part of the entire complex. In contrast, our goal was to improve the alignment over a large region (Vps4) that was already clearly visible before applying Hcp1 signal subtraction.</p><p>(ii) Unlike the case with Bai et al., the subtracted region in our study (Hcp1) is not really part of the functional Vps4 complex, but is just attached by an artificial flexible tether. Thus, in our case, returning to non-subtracted particles would yield lower resolution for a structure that does not need this validation and is not functionally relevant (Hcp1).</p><p><italic>B) How and which NCS restraints are applied during atomic model refinement considering that the pseudo-helical complex is asymmetric?</italic> </p><p>We have added the following information to the Methods section “Model Building and Refinement” of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Guided by visual inspection of map similarity, NCS restraints were applied to Vps4 subunits A-E with the exception of residues 240-247 and 260-267 of subunit A and residues 204-207 (pore loop 1) of subunit E.” This method is appropriate for an asymmetric structure such as the Vps4 hexamer because it makes no assumption of point group symmetry, and follows the standard approach of applying NCS restraints in the refinement of crystal structures where multiple copies of a molecule are found in the asymmetric unit in the absence of point group symmetry.</p><p><italic>C) It would be valuable to show angular distribution plots and a comparison of 3D model re-projections to several 2D class averages.</italic></p><p>As requested, the revised manuscript includes a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) that shows angular distribution plots and comparisons between reference-free 2D class averages and 3D model re-projections.</p><p><italic>D) Subsection “Model Building and Refinement”: &quot;features absent in the previously reported structures were built manually in Coot.&quot; Considering the resolution of 4.3 Å, this is not trivial. Please detail which features are involved.</italic> </p><p>The revised manuscript now explicitly lists the features that were absent in previous models and that we have built manually in the Methods section “Model Building and Refinement”. Specifically, “Residues 204-207 (pore loop 1), 240-247 (pore loop 2) and 261-266 were absent in the previously reported structures and were built manually in Coot (Emsley et al., 2010).”</p><p>Despite the modest resolution, a number of factors facilitated the building of reasonable models in these regions: (i) The ends of these missing loops are constrained by the previously reported crystal structures. (ii) The missing loops are short. (iii) The presence of large side chains such as W206 and M207 in pore loop 1 served as helpful guides. (iv) The density for these regions was closely similar between the multiple Vps4 subunits in the complex.</p><p><italic>3) Remarks on the text and figures</italic> </p><p><italic>A) Should BeF<sub>x</sub> be noted as BeF<sub>3</sub> throughout the paper? One of the reviewers notes that he/she is unaware of beryllium adopting anything other than a tri-fluoride liganded state, unlike aluminum, which can bind three or four fluorine atoms depending on solution pH. If the authors know this assumption to be false, please provide a few references.</italic> </p><p>Beryllium is reported to form a series of complexes with fluoride that are all tetragonal and coordinate 1-4 fluoride ions, with the other positions being occupied by water or hydroxyl anion (Mesmer RE &amp; Baes CF, Jr, Inorg. Chem. 8, 618-626, 1967). At pH 7.5 and at a low millimolar fluoride concentration, as used in this study, the species acting as a phosphate analog is expected to be a mixture of BeF<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sup>-</sup>·H<sub>2</sub>O and BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>·H<sub>2</sub>O (Combeau &amp; Carlier, J. Biol. Chem. 264 19017-19021, 1989, and references therein). We therefore prefer to denote beryllium fluoride as BeF<sub>x</sub>.</p><p><italic>B) Subsection “Comparison with other AAA ATPases”. In what way are the hexameric structures of E1 and Rho distinct from Vps4? It seems that the model proposed here is actually rather similar to their proposed mechanisms of translocation.</italic> </p><p>Our proposed mechanism for Vps4 is conceptually very similar to those of E1 and Rho in that sequential ATP binding and hydrolysis around the hexameric ring drives propagation of a helical set of subunits that present a binding site for the substrate. The revised manuscript explicitly states this in the “Comparison with other AAA ATPases” segment of the Results and Discussion section by inclusion of the paragraph: “Structures of the substrate-bound DNA helicase E1 (Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006) and RNA translocase Rho (Thomsen and Berger, 2009, Thomsen et al., 2016) suggested sequential mechanisms of translocation that are conceptually analogous to our proposal for translocation of protein by Vps4. Thus, the structures indicate that Vps4 and the hexameric nucleic acid translocases function by forming a helical arrangement of subunits that matches the symmetry of their translocating substrate, with one or two transitioning subunits that are disengaged from the substrate, and with translocation achieved by sequential propagation of the ATPase helix.” A more detailed comparison of the structures is interesting but beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>C) Discussion – how does the state of the ATPase region and mechanism compare to NSF? It would be useful to build upon the proteasome comparison with some additional examples, bringing up E1/Rho here as well.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is a very interesting topic, and is one that we are exploring. It is summarized in the final paragraph of the Results and Discussion section: “The structure of Vps4 superimposes with some other hexameric AAA ATPases, including the ATPases of the 26S proteasome, which, like Vps4, translocate protein substrates and adopt a right-handed helical notched-washer structure (Forster et al., 2013, Lander et al., 2013). […] It will be of considerable interest to determine the extent to which the geometry of substrate binding and the cycles of ATP-induced helix propagation envisioned here in light of the Vps4-substrate complex underlie the mechanisms of other protein-translocating AAA ATPases, and the extent to which variations on the idealized model, such as by variations in peptide binding geometry or in the sequence and timing of ATP hydrolysis, may apply.” A more detailed comparison of the structures is interesting but beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>D) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: Do the concentration values refer to peptide concentration?</italic> </p><p>Concentration values refer to Vps4 subunit concentrations.
