Here, we optimized a 3D fluorescence co-localization method that uses mean values for chromatic aberration correction to yield the mean separation with ~10 nm accuracy between green and red fluorescently labeled protein epitopes within single human kinetochores. Accuracy depended critically on achieving small standard deviations in fluorescence centroid determination, chromatic aberration across the measurement field, and coverslip thickness. Computer simulations showed that large standard deviations in these parameters significantly increase 3D measurements from their true values. Our 3D results show that at metaphase, the protein linkage between CENP-A within the inner kinetochore and the microtubule-binding domain of the Ndc80 complex within the outer kinetochore is on average ~90 nm. The Ndc80 complex appears fully extended at metaphase and exhibits the same subunit structure in vivo as found in vitro by crystallography.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Super-resolution light microscopy</kwd><kwd>cell division</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>protein architecture</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM24364</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salmon</surname><given-names>Edward</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An optimized 3D fluorescence co-localization method is a useful toolkit to obtain cellular 3D separations between green and red labeled protein domains with nanometer-scale accuracy using light microscopy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Confocal light microscopy (LM) is widely used for understanding protein localization, architecture, and functions in cells, but the maximum resolution without any image processing is still only ~200 nm in the x-y image plane and ~400 nm along the z-axis. The scale of many protein complexes is smaller than the diffraction limit of LM. In order to deduce the function of protein complexes, it is critical to develop a method to determine the three-dimensional (3D) locations of proteins within a complex in their native environment.</p><p>Kinetochores are protein assemblies at the periphery of centromeric chromatin that have vital functions for achieving accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis. A modified histone H3, CENP-A, within nucleosomes at centromeric chromatin marks the site of kinetochore assembly. CENP-A recruits ~25 different kinds of core-structural proteins including Constitutive Centromere Associated Protein Network (CCAN) proteins and outer kinetochore proteins called the KMN network (Knl1, Mis12 complex, and Ndc80 complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cheeseman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">McKinley and Cheeseman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Musacchio and Desai, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pesenti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Takeuchi and Fukagawa, 2012</xref>). Two important linkers in human kinetochores are CENP-C and CENP-T because they connect between centromeric chromatin and the KMN network proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huis In 't Veld et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Klare et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Musacchio and Desai, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nishino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nishino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Screpanti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Suzuki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>). The highly conserved Ndc80 complex (Hec1(Ndc80), Nuf2, Spc24, Spc25) is one of the best structurally characterized kinetochore proteins, and it has a major role in kinetochore microtubule (kMT) attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ciferri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Musacchio and Desai, 2017</xref>).</p><p>We previously reported a nm-scale map of how human kinetochore proteins are organized on average along the inner to outer kinetochore axis at metaphase, obtained using the ‘Delta’ two-color fluorescence co-localization method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wan et al., 2009</xref>). The Delta method provided local chromatic aberration (CA) correction in the x-y image plane by measurements along the K-K axis between pairs of sister kinetochores. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fuller and Straight (2012)</xref> developed a 3D method (termed CICADA [Co-localization and In-situ Correction of Aberration for Distance Analysis]) to measure the mean separation of red and green fluorescent centroids at individual kinetochores while locally correcting for CA in the x, y, and z directions using a third color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fuller and Straight, 2012</xref>). Their method yielded an identical value to what was obtained by the Delta method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fuller and Straight, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wan et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, a recent report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Smith et al., 2016</xref> used a 3D measurement method to obtain mean separation values for protein domains within kinetochores that were significantly greater than our Delta values and the 3D value obtained by the CICADA method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fuller and Straight, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Smith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wan et al., 2009</xref>). This group questioned the accuracy and significance of the Delta values because they were ‘1D measurements and neglected z-axis information’.</p><p>In this paper, we have tested the above conclusion by optimizing a 2D and 3D fluorescence co-localization method to obtain the mean separation between the centroids of green and red foci with ~10 nm accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The method depends on correcting CA based on mean values from a fluorescent standard, a method commonly used for fluorescence co-localization, but not previously optimized and rigorously analyzed for sources of error, as performed here. Computer simulations were used to understand how well the measurement method works and to find how accuracy is limited in our method. This study revealed major sources of error produced by standard deviations (SDs) in fluorescent centroid determination, CA correction, and coverslip thickness, as well as addressing several issues concerning fixation methods. We found that our 3D measurements applied to human kinetochores were similar to the Delta measurements and much shorter than those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Smith et al., 2016</xref>. Their larger measurements may be explained by much larger SDs in centroid determination and CA correction than typical of our experiments. We also used the known structure of the Ndc80 complex as a ‘Molecular Ruler’ to verify the accuracy of our measurement method, and to determine its subunit structure and conformation within the kinetochore.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32418.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Principle of procedure used in this study.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fixation: 3% PFA in PHEM buffer without any detergent was used as standard fixation in this study (Details in Text and Methods).

It showed that the amount of z-axis CA is highly sensitive to changes in the thickness of the coverslip. We tested this possibility by using different thickness of coverslips. We did most of our experiments reported in this paper using # 1.5 coverslips. We measured their thickness with a micrometer, and the mean value was 0.17 mm with a range of 0.16 to 0.19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, n &gt; 100).

We evaluated the method by computer simulations. Critical factors are SDs of centroid determination (CDsd) and CA (CAsd). In our simulations, kinetochores were located at 10 pixel intervals in both the X and Y axis directions for the typical image region of 0–280 pixels in the X- direction and 0 to 190 pixels in the Y-direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). At each kinetochore position (p), the separation vector extended from the origin to a length S in the x direction. The green (Xgp, Ygp, Zgp) values at the origin had a mean of zero plus a CDsd determined by sampling CDsd times a normalized random number for the x, y, and z directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The red (Xrp, Yrp, Zrp) values included S in the x-direction and Z-offset in the Z direction. They also included a value for the CA at each kinetochore position, CAp, plus CDsd for each direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Two methods were used to generate the CAp values. In the first, for each x, y, and z direction, CAp was calculated from the measured mean CA plus the CAsd times a normalized random number. In the second, CAp for the x and y directions were calculated from least square fits to the CA cellular data because of the 30 nm and 20 nm decrease respectively across the measurement field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, this second procedure gave identical results as the first method outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, which is the CA correction method we used experimentally.

Their Z-offsets varied between −17 and 4.4 nm, while their ML3D mean values varied between 86 and 93 nm.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Smith et al., 2016</xref> reported that the mean 3D separation between endogenous CENP-A and the C-terminus of Ndc80 was 81.7 ± 0.7 nm SEM (n = 3302, SD =±40 nm), about 42 nm larger than our measured value of 40 nm ± ~ 10 nm (SD) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7">Table 7</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7">Table 7</xref> also provides three more examples showing differences of 24 nm to 60 nm between their and our mean 3D separation measurements. Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Smith et al., 2016</xref> used mean CA values for CA correction as we did in this study, we investigated the possibility that significantly higher CDsd and CAsd compared to our values might be responsible for their larger 3D separation values. We estimated the CDsd from the SD of their Delta measurements for CENP-A to Spc24, which was ~35 nm, compared to our value of 6 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Smith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>). This analysis yielded values for CDsd about five times larger than ours (22 nm, 22 nm, and 44 nm compared to 4 nm, 4 nm and 8 nm in the x, y and z directions) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>). Such high CDsd values could explain why their Delta measurements are significantly larger than ours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>). Their reported CAsd was also significantly larger than ours (26 nm, 23 nm and 43 nm compared to 9 nm, 7.5 nm and 18 nm in the x, y and z directions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). Results of simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref> using the values we estimated for their CDsd and their reported CAsd produce results nearly identical to their mean separation measurements, and show how the differences in the SDs between their and our measurements could be responsible for their much larger values. In addition, the higher levels for CDsd and CAsd are likely responsible for the very large SDs they measured for the angles α and β compared to ours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). In our measurements, large values of Z-offset were rare (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>); we have no information to judge how much other sources of error like Z-offset, contributed to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Smith et al.

A previous study has shown that the accuracy of separation measurements is sensitive to the spatial staggering of the labeled molecules along the kinetochore inner to outer axis only for stagger greater than 200 nm, which has the possibility of producing two fluorescent peaks instead of a single peak if staggering is not random (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Joglekar et al., 2009</xref>). All kinetochores labeled by specific antibodies or EGFP in our study exhibited a Gaussian distribution with a single peak. This indicates that our centroid measurements correspond to the mean position of the fluorescently labeled protein epitopes within human kinetochores.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Magidson et al. (2016)</xref> questioned whether the mean separation measurements averaged from multiple kinetochores (typically 200–400 kinetochores from 5 to 20 cells in our study) hide variation in the position of proteins relative to each other between different kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Magidson et al., 2016</xref>). We tried to address this question in several ways. First, we found that mean measurements of individual kinetochores (not sister pairs) within a single cell yielded the identical value at metaphase as the mean obtained from kinetochores (sister pairs) within six different cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Thus, variations between cells or selected kinetochore measurements like in the Delta analysis is not an issue. Second, as expected for the Gaussian distribution measured for separation values (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), we found that only 10–15 kinetochores were needed to be averaged to achieve the mean and SD typical of &gt;150 kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Third, the SD of our 2D/3D measurements are small, typically less than 12 nm, and a significant part of this SD must be from the CDsd and CAsd (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6A</xref> and see above discussion) and not from differences between kinetochores. To see this more clearly, we used the same simulations as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> but with mean kinetochore-to-kinetochore variability (Ksd = ±0, ±5, ±10, or ±15 nm) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata2">Figure 9—source data 2</xref>). Simulation results showed that Ksd of about ±5 nm or less plus measurement CDsd and CAsd yielded the experimental mean SD value of 12.5 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata2">Figure 9—source data 2</xref>). These results imply that the vast majority of kinetochores at metaphase have a similar protein architecture.</p><p>We found that our PFA fixation does not shrink kinetochore structure and produces exactly the same Delta, 2D, and 3D mean separation values obtained by the GA fixation. A major problem with GA fixation is that it interferes with antibody labeling, preventing immunofluorescence with many antibodies, and reduced fluorescence for others like those used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. In addition, our data indicate that primary GA fixation may not be suitable for analysis of molecular distribution by immuno-electron microscopy because of poor recognition by antibodies. For immuno-electron microscopy, GA fixation should be used as the post-fixation solution, but only after the antibody reaction has been performed.</p><p>This study provides an optimized 3D fluorescence co-localization method with error analysis. It can achieve ~10 nm accuracy for mean separations larger than 18 nm. Our mean 3D fluorescence co-localization measurements for human kinetochore protein architecture are close to the mean values obtained using local correction of CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fuller and Straight, 2012</xref>) and successfully predict the known structural lengths of the Ndc80 complex components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ciferri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Valverde et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Musacchio and Desai, 2017</xref>).

The transfected cells were selected by Geneticin (Invitrogen) 48 hr after transfection. We collected more than 20 individual positive colonies from each transfection, then we tested expression levels of EGFP-tagged proteins by immunofluorescence.

The 2D 3D separation file had all equations and calculated S(2D) and S(3D) using the equations described in Text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. We applied Maximum likelihood fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Churchman et al., 2006</xref>) for raw 2D or raw 3D values termed ML2D and ML3D when the separation was larger than 18 nm (See Text). The Matlab program called ML2D and ML3D read the raw 2D and raw 3D values in the Excel file and applied maximum likelihood fit to produce ML2D and ML3D. Then, the final ML2D and ML3D values with SD were copied from Matlab to the 2D 3D separation Excel file. The 2D 3D separation Excel file also provided the values of angle α and β (detail in Text). Note, because angles α and β were the angles relative to K-K axis, it required placing the x, y, z coordinates of sister kinetochore pairs in order. Then, the values were reorganized based on their x coordinate values within sister kinetochore pair in the Excel file. To obtain angle α and β values and also to directly compare the separation values by using Delta, 2D and 3D methods with same data sets, we usually measured sister kinetochore pairs in this study.

In short, the method allows assigning three-dimensional coordinates to the centroids of the fluorescence distributions of selected proteins (or antibodies that bind to them), and, after appropriate corrections, determining their mean distance. The layered distribution of proteins makes this approach particularly suited to the study of kinetochores. However, two recent papers (Smith et al., 2016; Magidson et al., 2016) have questioned, on different grounds, the conclusions of the authors' previous work, and solicited this response.</p><p>The Smith et al. paper applied a conceptually similar approach to the one originally proposed by the authors, but extended the analysis to three dimensions, finding co-localization distances that were significantly larger than those originally described by the authors. The Magidson et al. paper, on the other hand, questioned the foundation of the approach, in particular because it found, through an electron microscopy analysis, that the surface of kinetochores undergoes shrinking and becomes uneven under the fixation conditions originally used by the authors. Here, the authors appear to respond convincingly to both these previous papers. Their broad and thoughtful analysis identified all potential sources of errors in their methodology (the variance in fluorescence centroid determination, the variance of the mean chromatic aberration used for correction, and the thickness of the coverslip), and demonstrates that it is possible to obtain largely consistent distance measurements in one, two, and three dimensions provided that these sources of error are adequately addressed. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that their approach provides estimates of distances that are largely independent of the specific fixation procedure.</p><p>Overall, the study provides further support to the usefulness of a method that has already contributed quite decisively to our understanding of kinetochore organization. Although the study is largely confirmatory for what regards kinetochore architecture (addressing which was not the main purpose of the manuscript), confirmation of the method's robustness has the potential to provide the community with a tool that can contribute to resolve crucial questions in kinetochore biology, in particular for what concerns the effects of force in kinetochore architecture.</p><p>On a less positive tone, as written the paper is a true heavy weight, and I rather strongly feel that the authors have to work very seriously to streamline their descriptions, simplify the figures, and shorten the text to make the paper more accessible. For instance, the mathematical analysis currently in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> could be summarized and presented in a separate box. Each figure comes with approximately 15 panels, and it would be preferable to present most of these data in form of a table in the main text and as plots in Supplementary. Also, the authors may want to harmonize font size throughout their figures, as the figures look very heterogeneous.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Summary of the work and its relation to previous publications:</p><p>This paper presents exhaustive measurements of nanoscale distances between components within the kinetochores of human tissue-culture cells (HeLa cells). It is one of a series of studies, beginning with ground-breaking work from the Salmon lab (Wan et al., 2009), aimed at mapping the arrangement of kinetochore components, i.e. &quot;the protein architecture of the kinetochore&quot;, in human cells fixed at metaphase of the cell cycle. The overall approach is to label by immunofluorescence two different kinetochore components with markers of two different colors, and then to measure the &quot;intra-kinetochore distance&quot; between the centroids of the two partially overlapping spots with sub-wavelength accuracy, from optical micrographs. The method is beautifully simple in principle. However, it is challenging in practice for technical reasons. There are limitations inherent to multi-color optical microscopy, such as the inevitable misregistration between images recorded in different color channels, and the statistical uncertainty in localization of any sub-wavelength object of finite brightness. There are also limitations due to prep-to-prep, cell-to-cell, and kinetochore-to-kinetochore variability. Nevertheless, sub-wavelength optical mapping of intra-kinetochore distances has provided very important information about how kinetochore components are arranged in cells, on average, and has had a major impact on how mitosis researchers view the kinetochore. A key concept has emerged, that changes in certain intra-kinetochore distances ('intra-kinetochore stretch') might provide the molecular basis for selective silencing of checkpoint signals and stabilization of microtubule attachments when sister kinetochores are properly bioriented.</p><p>This new paper is a response to recent publications from other groups that raised questions about the interpretation of sub-wavelength kinetochore maps (Magidson et al., 2016 and Smith, McAinsh and Burroughs, 2016). In earlier work, intra-kinetochore distances were measured as projections along a line, drawn between two sister kinetochores in the horizontal (x-y) plane, and then averaged to give a single value, called &quot;Δ&quot;, for both sister kinetochores. The Δ method corrects locally for color mis-registration, because chromatic shifts will be opposite for kinetochores facing in exactly opposite (anti-parallel) directions. However, the Δ method ignores the possibility that two sister kinetochores might have different architectures or non-anti-parallel orientations. The studies of Magidson et al. and Smith et al. suggest that there can be significant tilting or swiveling of the outer portions of a kinetochore relative to the line connecting it to its sister, especially after treatment with microtubule poisons such as taxol or nocodazole. Magidson et al. also used correlative light and electron microscopy to show that individual kinetochores can become distorted, and that deviations from the canonical trilaminar plate morphology might correlate with high Δ values. Both Magidson et al. and Smith et al. suggest intra-kinetochore distances should be measured in two or three dimensions (2D or 3D), to account for tilting/swiveling, and both warn that projection onto the (1D) line connecting sisters, and averaging over the sisters, as in the Δ method, could underestimate distances and lead to misleading conclusions about the effects of microtubule drugs. Magidson et al. further show that different fixation methods (e.g., glutaraldehyde versus formaldehyde) can change the measured distances. Overall, these papers suggest exercising caution when interpreting Δ measurements.</p><p>In response, the new paper by Suzuki et al. presents an enormous amount of data. Control experiments with two colors labeling the same epitope are used to estimate chromatic shifts in 2D and 3D, for two different types of fixation and two different mounting media. Intra-kinetochore distances from the 9G3 epitope on Ndc80 to many other epitopes, on Cenp-T, Nuf2, Spc24, Spc25, and Cenp-A, are mapped using three different analysis methods, including the 1D Δ method, 2D, and fully 3D methods. Besides raw mean intra-kinetochore distances (+/- standard deviations), maximum likelihood methods are also applied in 2D and 3D, to account for the non-gaussian distributions expected whenever distances between two imperfectly localized objects are measured. The 9G3-to-Cenp-T distance is also mapped repeatedly for nine different fixation/permabilization protocols. Simulations were performed to assess how uncertainties in spot localization and in chromatic shifts influence the estimates of intra-kinetochore distance and tilt angles when using the various (2D and 3D) analysis methods. It is suggested that the true amount of kinetochore tilting is negligible, on the basis that a large fraction of the variability in measured tilt angles can be explained by uncertainties in localization and chromatic shift. The possibility of kinetochore-to-kinetochore variability in the measured distances is likewise discounted, again on the basis that much of the apparent variability can be explained by uncertainties in localization and chromatic shift. The possibility of cell-to-cell variability is discounted on the basis that the mean intra-kinetochore distance (between 9G3 and Spc25-EGFP) for a set of 120 individual kinetochores within a single cell is indistinguishable from that of 140 sister pairs in several cells. The overall conclusions are that kinetochore architecture is quite uniform, sisters are very nearly anti-parallel, and previous suggestions to the contrary were flawed because localization uncertainty was not adequately taken into account.</p><p>General assessment:</p><p>While the shear amount of data here is impressive, it unfortunately is not presented in an accessible way. Without a much clearer presentation, I do not feel the manuscript in its current form can serve as a useful technical resource. In many instances, it is extremely difficult to understand what is being plotted, and what are the primary important messages that the authors wish to draw from each piece of data. Some interesting and potentially valuable technical concepts are considered, such as the likelihood that variation in coverslip thickness causes large chromatic shifts in the z-direction, and the possibility that kinetochore tilting seen by other groups could be an artifact due to the inherent uncertainty in localizing dim fluorescence spots. However, it is extremely difficult to discern whether either of these potentially interesting points can be supported by the data. In my view, this paper is not ready for publication. Below I have listed specific comments which I hope can help the authors improve their presentation.</p><p>Substantive concerns:</p><p>Results section: &quot;Because other Δ measurements had smaller SDs, we settled on values of Sxsd=Sysd = 4 and Szsd = 8, since there could have been some unexpected CA contribution to Δ variance from unknown local changes in refractive index.&quot; This seems arbitrary. The sentences just prior to this one suggested that larger values were needed to explain the data. Why go through the trouble to estimate carefully what is needed to explain the data, only to then impose an ad hoc reduction?</p><p>Results section: &quot;The simulation data also shows that the combination of variances in centroid measurement and CA correction can account for a large fraction of the variance in tilt angles[…]This suggests that the majority of proteins linking the inner to outer kinetochore are aligned along the kMT axis.&quot; This is one of the key conclusions of the paper but it is not well supported. A thorough analysis would state explicitly how much of the variability is explained by the uncertainties in localization and chromatic shift, and also how much real kinetochore tilting would be consistent with the data.</p><p>Results section: &quot;after depletion of the endogenous protein by RNAi&quot; How effective was the depletion?</p><p>Results section: &quot;This result indicates that most of the Z-offset in the original Sz data is not produced by unequal numbers of kinetochores from above and below the spindle axis, but likely from somewhat thinner coverslips than the standard 0.17 mm thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).&quot; This potentially interesting point is not rigorously supported without a demonstration that coverslips of known thickness but deviating from the standard 0.17 mm produce predictable changes in Z-offset. It seems that it would be a straightforward experiment to measure coverslips thicknesses and then prepare and analyze cells on those coverslips that happen to deviate from the standard.</p><p>Discussion section: &quot;[…]we found that measurements of individual kinetochores (not sister pairs) within a single cell yielded the identical value at metaphase as the mean obtained from kinetochores within several cells. Thus, variations between cells or selected kinetochore measurements like Δ analysis is not an issue.&quot; This is overstated. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> show only that mean values for populations of hundreds of kinetochores are consistent. But they say nothing about kinetochore-to-kinetochore variability. And &quot;several cells&quot; is unclear. How many cells? If the number is very small then the data cannot strongly support the conclusion that cell-to-cell variability is negligible.</p><p>The widespread, inconsistent, and redundant use of variables in this paper is extremely confusing. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> alone introduces at least 25 different variables: X1p, Y1p, Z1p, Sxsd, Sysd, Szsd, CAxp, CAyp, CAzp, CAxsd, CAysd, CAzsd, randn, Sxp, Syp, Szp, Sxyp, Sxyzp, CAxe, CAxs, CAye, CAys, CAze, CAzs. Sometimes two different variables seem to denote the same quantities, for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, where both CAx and Xg – Xr are used, whereas in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, only Xg – Xr is used. Conversely, two different calculations are sometimes represented by the same variable, such as S(3D), which does not include the correction for chromatic shift in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, but does include the correction in later figures. When the variables x and y are used in the equations for regression lines, they are often contradictory with respect to the plotted quantities, such as in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, where the regression variable x sometimes denotes Y (y-axis position in pixels) and the regression variable y sometimes denotes Xg-Xr (chromatic shift along x-axis in nanometers). When used sparingly and consistently, variables can make difficult mathematical concepts easier to follow. But here the use of variables seems to obfuscate things. It might help to adopt vector notation, to allow more compact expressions that capture the important conceptual relationships without explicitly showing all three cardinal directions.</p><p>The paper includes a huge number of scatterplots (I count ~59) and histograms (~32). Most of the scatterplots lack clear trends with respect to changes in the x-, y-, or z-position. In general, these plots seem to provide lots of clutter without adding much insight.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript addresses a significant challenge: how to appropriately localize kinetochore components to measure distances between them. Different distance measurement methods have been used, and have at times led to different results. To move forward on solid ground, discrepancies must be reconciled, understood and explained. This is what this works attempts to do: it systematically and carefully explores the effect of different parameters (centroid determination, chromatic aberration correction, coverslip thickness and fixation method) on measured distances. The authors also provide a helpful computational framework for exploring how the variance in some of these parameters affects distance measurements. Importantly, the manuscript presents a 'molecular ruler' for checking the accuracy of 1D, 2D and 3D localization of kinetochore components by using the Ndc80 complex as a standard. Pending some changes outlined below, this work can become a significant contribution as a tool and resource, not just to those interested in kinetochores but to those interested in a broad array of cellular macromolecular assemblies.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>The paper as written is challenging to read and needs significant changes to both the text and figures to become an accessible – and used – resource.</p><p>1) While it is clear that the authors achieve more accurate centroid localization than previous works, the text does not clearly synthesize which practices together made this possible, and what experimental and analysis pipeline people should use to achieve such accuracy (what's good enough, and what isn't?). As one example to help guide changes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> illustrates how Sz varies with imaging depth and kinetochore tilt, but the text describing this figure does not explain how this data relates to the rest of the work nor makes a concrete suggestion about best practices. Making a clear connection between the data and actionable outcomes is critical for this work to be a useful tool, and will help create a constructive, positive tone towards improving future measurements. On this note, it would be helpful to integrate in a single new figure the final suggested pipeline for obtaining accurate 3D measurements – unless the authors have a better idea for how to do that.</p><p>2) The figures are unnecessarily complicated and often very hard to read. The authors should take the time to think about which figures are essential for the main text and which are not, and should take the time to make their figures clear enough to stand alone. Figures should be significantly simplified. As examples, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> could be moved to the supplement and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> could be moved or condensed. (In addition, it is critical that plots in all figures have clearly labeled axes in readable font sizes, and there must be no confusion about what is measured).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;An Optimized Method for 3D Fluorescence Co-Localization Applied to Human Kinetochore Protein Architecture&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Andrea Musacchio (Senior editor) and two reviewers.</p><p>This new version of the manuscript is greatly improved and we thank you for the effort you put into your resubmission. There are however some remaining issues that you might elect to address in a final version of the manuscript before acceptance, as outlined below. I have retained the reviewers' comments without editing them, as both reviewers feel that you should feel free to decide whether to incorporate change or not. I would be grateful if you could consider these points carefully, especially the major comments expressed by Reviewer 2.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is a resubmission of a previously reviewed manuscript. This manuscript addresses a significant challenge: how to appropriately localize kinetochore components to measure distances between them. Different distance measurement methods have been used, and have at times led to different results. To move forward on solid ground, discrepancies must be reconciled, understood and explained. This is what this works does, using both experiment and computation. The new manuscript largely addresses my two previous major concerns: it now synthesizes what experimental and analysis pipeline people should be used to achieve optimal accuracy, and presents simplified/clearer figures and text. This work is now a significant contribution as a tool and resource, not just to those interested in kinetochores but to those interested in a broad array of cellular macromolecular assemblies.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper is very significantly improved. I commend the authors for their very careful reworking. I think the result is a paper that can serve as a very important resource, not only to the community of scientists interested in kinetochore architecture, but also more broadly, to microscopists studying the architectures of other large molecular assemblies inside cells. I hope the following relatively minor comments will help the authors further improve their manuscript in preparation for publication. In particular, I feel the impact of the paper could be boosted by a more quantitative analysis of the amount of true, kinetochore-to-kinetochore variability that would be compatible with the measurements, as explained in the last two comments below.</p><p>Results section: &quot;Unexpectedly, in vivo, the C-terminus of Ndc80 locates much closer to the globular domains of Spc24/Spc25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This difference might be caused by structural restrictions on the position of the EGFP tag, which was tethered to the protein end by a 9 amino acid linker.&quot; A structure for the tetramerization domain within the Ndc80 complex is available (Valverde, Ingram and Harrison, 2016). Can the apparent arrangement in vivo of the C-termini of Ndc80 and Nuf2 and the N-termini of Spc24 and Spc25 be reconciled with this published structure? Or does one need to further invoke &quot;restrictions&quot; on the epitopes/antibodies to reconcile these different views of the Ndc80 complex? More generally, the published structures for the Ndc80 complex can provide predictions for the distances between many of the antibody pairs used in this study. Why not include a comprehensive, graphical comparison of predicted versus measured distances? If the correlation is good, then such a comparison would provide very compelling additional support for the accuracy of the fluorescence colocalization technique. It would also help clarify what is the in vivo structure of the Ndc80 complex.</p><p>Discussion section: &quot;Note that their higher SDc values explains why their Δ measurements are significantly larger than ours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).&quot; This statement seems a bit overstated to me considering that the authors can only estimate the SDc values of their competitor's work – they do not know the SDc values from that work with 100% certainty. In my view, it would be more correct, and would not undercut the impact of the present paper at all, to qualify the sentence very slightly as follows: &quot;Such high SDc values could explain[…]&quot; or &quot;Such high SDc values probably explain[…]&quot;</p><p>Discussion section; &quot;A previous study has shown that the accuracy of separation measurements is sensitive to the spatial staggering of the labeled molecules along the kinetochore inner to outer axis only for stagger greater than 150 nm, which produces two fluorescent peaks instead of a single peak (Joglekar et al., 2009).&quot; This statement seems over-simplified to me, and potentially confusing. The production of two peaks is not a general consequence of staggering of the labeled molecules. It occurred in a highly idealized simulation in the cited paper, where the simulated positions of six red spots were shifted by fixed distances in the x-direction relative to a corresponding set of six green spots. More random staggered arrangements could retain a single fluorescent peak, but with a larger width compared to a case without staggering.</p><p>Discussion section: &quot;Second, the SD of our 2D/3D measurements are small, typically less than 10 nm, and a significant part of this SD must be from the SDc and CAsd (see above discussion) and not from differences between kinetochores.&quot; This is interesting, but it only weakly supports the &quot;uniform architecture&quot; hypothesis. A key question is, how much true, kinetochore-to-kinetochore variability in distance is compatible with the measured SDs? Based on the data and analyses presented in this paper, it should be possible to make a quantitative statement about how wide the underlying distribution of true distances is likely to be. The purely qualitative statement, that the architecture is &quot;very&quot; uniform, seems a bit hollow.</p><p>Discussion section: &quot;Surprisingly, only 10~15 kinetochores needed to be averaged to achieve the mean and SD typical of &gt; 150 kinetochores (Figure 9—figure supplement 2).&quot; This observation merely indicates that 10 to 15 kinetochores are sufficient to estimate the mean and width of the distribution. It does not by itself indicate anything about the width, i.e. about the level of kinetochore-to-kinetochore variability.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32418.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All this said, however, the three reviewers and the Reviewing Editor share the view that the current form of the manuscript lacks the clarity required to be accepted by the community as a generally useful technical resource.

Without a much clearer presentation, I do not feel the manuscript in its current form can serve as a useful technical resource. In many instances, it is extremely difficult to understand what is being plotted, and what are the primary important messages that the authors wish to draw from each piece of data. Some interesting and potentially valuable technical concepts are considered, such as the likelihood that variation in coverslip thickness causes large chromatic shifts in the z-direction, and the possibility that kinetochore tilting seen by other groups could be an artifact due to the inherent uncertainty in localizing dim fluorescence spots. However, it is extremely difficult to discern whether either of these potentially interesting points can be supported by the data. In my view, this paper is not ready for publication. Below I have listed specific comments which I hope can help the authors improve their presentation.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed the general “clarity” issue as summarized in “Significant modifications in revised manuscript to improve clarity”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Substantive concerns:</p><p>Results section: &quot;Because other Δ measurements had smaller SDs, we settled on values of Sxsd=Sysd = 4 and Szsd = 8, since there could have been some unexpected CA contribution to Δ variance from unknown local changes in refractive index.&quot; This seems arbitrary. The sentences just prior to this one suggested that larger values were needed to explain the data. Why go through the trouble to estimate carefully what is needed to explain the data, only to then impose an ad hoc reduction?</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify this issue, we edited the relevant paragraph in the results to read (Note Ssd is now named SDc for variance in centroid determination):</p><p>“To obtain an estimate of the error contributed from the SDc, we used results from Δ analysis which in principle have local CA correction. […] This result indicates that the variance in our centroid measurement is very small and only slightly enhances the 3D measurements from the true value.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results section: &quot;The simulation data also shows that the combination of variances in centroid measurement and CA correction can account for a large fraction of the variance in tilt angles[…]This suggests that the majority of proteins linking the inner to outer kinetochore are aligned along the kMT axis.&quot; This is one of the key conclusions of the paper but it is not well supported. A thorough analysis would state explicitly how much of the variability is explained by the uncertainties in localization and chromatic shift, and also how much real kinetochore tilting would be consistent with the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We deleted this conclusion from the simulation section of the revised manuscript and inserted the following sentence at the end of the section of the Results entitled: “The Mean Human Kinetochore Protein Architecture at Metaphase Measured by the Δ Method and Our 3D Method are Similar.” to read:</p><p>“In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the Ndc80 complex and protein linkage to the inner kinetochore are shown aligned with the axis of kMTs because the ML3D mean separation values are only slightly greater than their corresponding Δ values and the Δ value is a projection of the ML3D value along the K-K axis.”</p><p>In addition, we have added the potential errors in angle measurements in the result section of kinetochore tilt and simulation in revised manuscript to read:</p><p>“Unlike 3D separation, the mean tilt angle β was sensitive to unequal numbers of kinetochores above and below the spindle equator. The mean angle β is near zero in the middle of the spindle and reaches mean values of about 20-25 degrees at the bottom and top of the spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6 —figure supplement 2C</xref>).”</p><p>and</p><p>“To see how the SDc and CAsd of our measurement method effect the variances in the angles α and β, we entered into the simulation constant values for S between zero and 100 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The variance in the angles α and β are largest for small separations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Our SDc and CAsd caused about half to two-thirds of the variance measured in cells for separations of 60 nm (CENP-T-Hec1-9G3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) or 90 nm (CENP-A-Hec1-9G3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results section: &quot;after depletion of the endogenous protein by RNAi&quot; How effective was the depletion?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the efficiency of protein depletion in Materials and methods of the revised manuscript. The new sentences read:</p><p>“siRNA was performed with 100 nM of siRNA duplex and siRNA sequences of CENP-T, CENP-C, Ndc80, and Nuf2 were described previously (DeLuca et al., 2002; Suzuki et al., 2015). […]Although we performed siRNA for endogenous proteins when we used cell lines expressing EGFP tagged protein, there was no significant differences for Δ, 2D, and 3D separation measurements in Ndc80-EGFP stable cells with or without siRNA for Ndc80.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results section: &quot;This result indicates that most of the Z-offset in the original Sz data is not produced by unequal numbers of kinetochores from above and below the spindle axis, but likely from somewhat thinner coverslips than the standard 0.17 mm thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).&quot; This potentially interesting point is not rigorously supported without a demonstration that coverslips of known thickness but deviating from the standard 0.17 mm produce predictable changes in Z-offset. It seems that it would be a straightforward experiment to measure coverslips thicknesses and then prepare and analyze cells on those coverslips that happen to deviate from the standard.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, we added a new Graph and the following sentence:</p><p>“The plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> illustrates the sensitivity of Z-offset to coverslip thickness. A steep slope is seen when measured Z-offset values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> are plotted as a function of the mean thickness we measured for #1, #1.5 and #2 coverslips.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion section: &quot;[…]we found that measurements of individual kinetochores (not sister pairs) within a single cell yielded the identical value at metaphase as the mean obtained from kinetochores within several cells. Thus, variations between cells or selected kinetochore measurements like Δ analysis is not an issue.&quot; This is overstated. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> show only that mean values for populations of hundreds of kinetochores are consistent. But they say nothing about kinetochore-to-kinetochore variability. And &quot;several cells&quot; is unclear. How many cells? If the number is very small then the data cannot strongly support the conclusion that cell-to-cell variability is negligible.</p></disp-quote><p>The above sentence was miss-worded. The corrected sentences read:</p><p>“Sister kinetochore pairs were used for majority of measurements in this study to directly compare separations obtained by Δ and 2D/3D fluorescent co-localization methods using the same data sets. To test if selection of sister pairs influenced our measurements, we measured 120 kinetochores selected randomly in a single cell. This produced a mean separation value nearly identical to the mean value for single kinetochore measurements of sister pairs obtained from 6 metaphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The widespread, inconsistent, and redundant use of variables in this paper is extremely confusing. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> alone introduces at least 25 different variables: X1p, Y1p, Z1p, Sxsd, Sysd, Szsd, CAxp, CAyp, CAzp, CAxsd, CAysd, CAzsd, randn, Sxp, Syp, Szp, Sxyp, Sxyzp, CAxe, CAxs, CAye, CAys, CAze, CAzs. Sometimes two different variables seem to denote the same quantities, for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, where both CAx and Xg – Xr are used, whereas in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, only Xg – Xr is used. Conversely, two different calculations are sometimes represented by the same variable, such as S(3D), which does not include the correction for chromatic shift in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, but does include the correction in later figures. When the variables x and y are used in the equations for regression lines, they are often contradictory with respect to the plotted quantities, such as in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, where the regression variable x sometimes denotes Y (y-axis position in pixels) and the regression variable y sometimes denotes Xg-Xr (chromatic shift along x-axis in nanometers). When used sparingly and consistently, variables can make difficult mathematical concepts easier to follow. But here the use of variables seems to obfuscate things. It might help to adopt vector notation, to allow more compact expressions that capture the important conceptual relationships without explicitly showing all three cardinal directions.</p></disp-quote><p>We significantly unified variable names between those used for experimental analysis and those used in the computer simulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper includes a huge number of scatterplots (I count ~59) and histograms (~32). Most of the scatterplots lack clear trends with respect to changes in the x-, y-, or z-position. In general, these plots seem to provide lots of clutter without adding much insight.</p></disp-quote><p>We have significantly modified Figure construction to put key data in the major figures and supporting data in Supplemental Figures using the <italic>eLife</italic> format.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>The paper as written is challenging to read and needs significant changes to both the text and figures to become an accessible and used resource.</p><p>1) While it is clear that the authors achieve more accurate centroid localization than previous works, the text does not clearly synthesize which practices together made this possible, and what experimental and analysis pipeline people should use to achieve such accuracy (what's good enough, and what isn't?). As one example to help guide changes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> illustrates how Sz varies with imaging depth and kinetochore tilt, but the text describing this figure does not explain how this data relates to the rest of the work nor makes a concrete suggestion about best practices. Making a clear connection between the data and actionable outcomes is critical for this work to be a useful tool, and will help create a constructive, positive tone towards improving future measurements. On this note, it would be helpful to integrate in a single new figure the final suggested pipeline for obtaining accurate 3D measurements – unless the authors have a better idea for how to do that.</p></disp-quote><p>We have significantly modified the manuscript and figures to address these concerns as outlined in the first page in “Significant modifications in revised manuscript to improve clarity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The figures are unnecessarily complicated and often very hard to read. The authors should take the time to think about which figures are essential for the main text and which are not, and should take the time to make their figures clear enough to stand alone. Figures should be significantly simplified. As examples, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> could be moved to the supplement and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> could be moved or condensed. (In addition, it is critical that plots in all figures have clearly labeled axes in readable font sizes, and there must be no confusion about what is measured).</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we have significantly modified the manuscript and figures to address these concerns as outlined in the first page in “Significant modifications in revised manuscript to improve clarity.”</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper is very significantly improved. I commend the authors for their very careful reworking. I think the result is a paper that can serve as a very important resource, not only to the community of scientists interested in kinetochore architecture, but also more broadly, to microscopists studying the architectures of other large molecular assemblies inside cells. I hope the following relatively minor comments will help the authors further improve their manuscript in preparation for publication. In particular, I feel the impact of the paper could be boosted by a more quantitative analysis of the amount of true, kinetochore-to-kinetochore variability that would be compatible with the measurements, as explained in the last two comments below.</p><p>Results section: &quot;Unexpectedly, in vivo, the C-terminus of Ndc80 locates much closer to the globular domains of Spc24/Spc25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This difference might be caused by structural restrictions on the position of the EGFP tag, which was tethered to the protein end by a 9 amino acid linker.&quot; A structure for the tetramerization domain within the Ndc80 complex is available (Valverde et al., 2016). Can the apparent arrangement in vivo of the C-termini of Ndc80 and Nuf2 and the N-termini of Spc24 and Spc25 be reconciled with this published structure? Or does one need to further invoke &quot;restrictions&quot; on the epitopes/antibodies to reconcile these different views of the Ndc80 complex? More generally, the published structures for the Ndc80 complex can provide predictions for the distances between many of the antibody pairs used in this study. Why not include a comprehensive, graphical comparison of predicted versus measured distances? If the correlation is good, then such a comparison would provide very compelling additional support for the accuracy of the fluorescence colocalization technique. It would also help clarify what is the in vivo structure of the Ndc80 complex.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a detailed comparison between our measurements and previous studies in vitro (Huis In 't Veld et al., 2016; Valverde et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2005) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion section: &quot;Note that their higher SDc values explains why their Δ measurements are significantly larger than ours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).&quot; This statement seems a bit overstated to me considering that the authors can only estimate the SDc values of their competitor's work – they do not know the SDc values from that work with 100% certainty. In my view, it would be more correct, and would not undercut the impact of the present paper at all, to qualify the sentence very slightly as follows: &quot;Such high SDc values could explain[…]&quot; or &quot;Such high SDc values probably explain[…]&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for an important suggestion. We have modified this and subsequent sentences to read;</p><p>“Such high CDsd values could explain why their Δ measurements are significantly larger than ours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>). […]In our measurements, large values of Zoffset were rare (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>); we have no information to judge how much other sources of error like Z-offset, contributed to the Smith, McAinsh and Burroughs, 2016 measurements.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion section; &quot;A previous study has shown that the accuracy of separation measurements is sensitive to the spatial staggering of the labeled molecules along the kinetochore inner to outer axis only for stagger greater than 150 nm, which produces two fluorescent peaks instead of a single peak (Joglekar et al., 2009).&quot; This statement seems over-simplified to me, and potentially confusing. The production of two peaks is not a general consequence of staggering of the labeled molecules. It occurred in a highly idealized simulation in the cited paper, where the simulated positions of six red spots were shifted by fixed distances in the x-direction relative to a corresponding set of six green spots. More random staggered arrangements could retain a single fluorescent peak, but with a larger width compared to a case without staggering.</p></disp-quote><p>Our writing was not clear. This paragraph now reads:</p><p>“Human kinetochores are built from multiple copies of core-kinetochore proteins (Suzuki et al., 2016). […] This indicates that our centroid measurements correspond to the mean position of the fluorescently labeled protein epitopes within human kinetochores.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion section: &quot;Second, the SD of our 2D/3D measurements are small, typically less than 10 nm, and a significant part of this SD must be from the SDc and CAsd (see above discussion) and not from differences between kinetochores.&quot; This is interesting, but it only weakly supports the &quot;uniform architecture&quot; hypothesis. A key question is, how much true, kinetochore-to-kinetochore variability in distance is compatible with the measured SDs? Based on the data and analyses presented in this paper, it should be possible to make a quantitative statement about how wide the underlying distribution of true distances is likely to be. The purely qualitative statement, that the architecture is &quot;very&quot; uniform, seems a bit hollow.</p><p>Discussion section: &quot;Surprisingly, only 10~15 kinetochores needed to be averaged to achieve the mean and SD typical of &gt; 150 kinetochores (Figure 9—figure supplement 2).&quot; This observation merely indicates that 10 to 15 kinetochores are sufficient to estimate the mean and width of the distribution. It does not by itself indicate anything about the width, i.e. about the level of kinetochore-to-kinetochore variability.</p></disp-quote><p>We asked how much kinetochore-to-kinetochore variability can be involved in our experimental measurements using simulations in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata2">Figure 9—source data 2</xref>. Based on these results, we have modified sentences to read: “Second, as expected for the Gaussian distribution measured for separation values (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), we found that only 10~15 kinetochores were needed to be averaged to achieve the mean and SD typical of &gt; 150 kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Third, the SD of our 2D/3D measurements are small, typically less than 12 nm, and a significant part of this SD must be from the CDsd and CAsd (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6A</xref> and see above discussion) and not from differences between kinetochores. To see this more clearly, we used the same simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> with mean kinetochore-to-kinetochore variability (Ksd = ± 0, ± 5, ± 10, or ± 15 nm) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata2">Figure 9—source data 2</xref>). Simulation results showed that Ksd of about ± 5 nm or less plus measurement CDsd and CAsd yielded the experimental mean SD value of 12.5 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata2">Figure 9—source data 2</xref>). These results imply that the vast majority of kinetochores at metaphase have a similar protein architecture”</p></body></sub-article></article>
