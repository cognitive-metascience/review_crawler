phase with respiratory activity. A component of these oscillations is generated centrally, with respiratory neurons entraining the activity of pre-sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular neurons. Using a combination of optogenetic inhibition and excitation in vivo and in situ in rats, as well as neuronal tracing, we demonstrate that preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) neurons, which form the kernel for inspiratory rhythm generation, directly modulate cardiovascular activity. Specifically, inhibitory preBötC neurons modulate cardiac parasympathetic neuron activity whilst excitatory preBötC neurons modulate sympathetic vasomotor neuron activity, generating heart rate and blood pressure oscillations in phase with respiration. Our data reveal yet more functions entrained to the activity of the preBötC, with a role in generating cardiorespiratory oscillations. The findings have implications for cardiovascular pathologies, such as hypertension and heart failure, where respiratory entrainment of heart rate is diminished and respiratory entrainment of blood pressure exaggerated.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prebötzinger complex</kwd><kwd>master oscillator</kwd><kwd>cardiorespiratory control</kwd><kwd>respiratory sinus arrhythmia</kwd><kwd>respiratory-sympathetic modulation</kwd><kwd>optogenetic inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>App #1120477</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Menuet</surname><given-names>Clément</given-names></name><name><surname>McMullan</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Andrew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>App #1156727</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Menuet</surname><given-names>Clément</given-names></name><name><surname>McMullan</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Andrew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP120100920</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McMullan</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Andrew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP170104582</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Andrew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001782</institution-id><institution>University of Melbourne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>- McKenzie Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Menuet</surname><given-names>Clément</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship ARF20160936221</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Menuet</surname><given-names>Clément</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The PreBötzinger complex, which contains neurons that are the kernel for inspiratory rhythm generation, also contains sympathoexcitatory and parasympathoinhibitory neurons that drive respiratory-phase oscillations in blood pressure and heart rate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The respiratory and cardiovascular systems act in synergy to maintain blood gas homeostasis in animals. Beyond their respective separate roles, these systems are also functionally coupled, with oscillations in blood pressure (BP), called Traube-Hering waves, and in heart rate (HR), called respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), that are in phase with the respiratory cycle. This respiratory entrainment of cardiovascular activity is a highly conserved physiological property present in vertebrates, including mammals, fish, amphibians and reptiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Taylor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taylor et al., 1999</xref>), and was recently found in the early air-breathing primitive lungfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Monteiro et al., 2018</xref>). When within physiological range, Traube-Hering waves are important contributors to vascular tone changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Briant et al., 2015</xref>), RSA reduces cardiac energetic cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Tal et al., 2012</xref>), and both are believed to optimize blood tissue perfusion and gas exchange. However, an alteration in the amplitude of these oscillations, typically with enlargement of Traube-Hering waves and concurrent abolishment of RSA, occurs in common cardiovascular diseases (e.g. hypertension and heart failure) and contributes to their pathogeneses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Machado et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Menuet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palatini and Julius, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996</xref>). The pathological relevance of these oscillations extends to numerous neurological diseases, not superficially linked to cardiovascular function, including depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brush et al., 2019</xref>) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Merico and Cavinato, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Traube-Hering waves and RSA are generated by multiple mechanisms, including changes in thoracic pressure and viscerosensory afferent feedback, but their origin has a central component, as they remain in heart- and lung-denervated humans, and in paralyzed and deafferented animal preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farmer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Menuet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taha et al., 1995</xref>). Traube-Hering waves are generated by bursts of vasomotor sympathetic nerve activity that occur in phase with the respiratory cycle (RespSNA), spanning most of inspiration and the very beginning of post-inspiration (the first phase of expiration). As a result of the slow vascular contraction dynamics, Traube-Hering waves peak during post-inspiration. RespSNA is the result of respiratory modulation of the activity of pre-sympathetic neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla oblongata, and in particular of the excitatory inspiratory modulation of adrenergic C1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Menuet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moraes et al., 2013</xref>). RSA is generated by a cardio-inhibitory vagal parasympathetic tone that decreases during the second part of expiration and into inspiration, resulting in HR oscillations that peak at the end of inspiration. Cardiac vagal preganglionic neurons of the nucleus ambiguus are weakly inhibited during the second part of expiration, and strongly inhibited during inspiration, by both GABAergic and glycinergic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilbey et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neff et al., 2003</xref>). However, the specific cellular components of the central respiratory pattern generating circuit that are responsible for modulation of both vasomotor pre-sympathetic and cardiac vagal preganglionic neurons are not fully elucidated.</p><p>Respiratory and cardiovascular neurons are present in adjacent and slightly intermingled cell columns in the ventral medulla oblongata. The respiratory neurons are classified by the relationship between their activity pattern and phase of the respiratory cycle – for example inspiratory neurons fire action potentials during inspiration. Core to the respiratory column is a small, yet heterogeneous, group of neurons in the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC), which consists of excitatory (glutamatergic) inspiratory neurons, and inhibitory (GABAergic and glycinergic) neurons that can be inspiratory or expiratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baertsch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koizumi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morgado-Valle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sherman et al., 2015</xref>). The preBötC is critical for respiratory rhythm generation, and also acts as a master oscillator entraining the activity of other oscillators, like the sniffing and whisking oscillators, in a unidirectional fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deschênes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moore et al., 2013</xref>). Our recent work on the pre-synaptic connectome of C1 neurons shows that preBötC neurons have the anatomical connections to provide the inspiratory input to these pre-sympathetic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dempsey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Menuet et al., 2017</xref>). It is also proposed that the strong inspiratory inhibition of cardiac vagal preganglionic neurons comes from the preBötC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frank et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Using optogenetics, which provides the spatial resolution to restrict opsin expression to a small group of neurons such as those in the preBötC, and temporal control to excite or inhibit neurons during specific phases of the respiratory cycle, we show that the preBötC is a cardiorespiratory hub that drives RespSNA, Traube-Hering waves and RSA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Injections of lentivirus expressing the light-activated anion channel <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2 are targeted to the preBötC</title><p>To induce rapid, reversible and powerful inhibition of neural activity in the preBötC, we injected a lentivirus inducing expression of <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Govorunova et al., 2015</xref>) bilaterally.

Photoinhibition of preBötC exerts profound effects on HR and BP in both anesthetized in vivo and in situ rat models, highlighting the importance of this ongoing activity under basal conditions.

No single and exclusive marker of the preBötC has been found so far. We studied neurons in the preBötC using the pan-neuronal CBA promoter that targets neurons irrespective of phenotype. Our anatomical validation of correct transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) is supported functionally, as photoinhibition caused immediate cessation of inspiratory activity and a prolonged apnea both in vivo and in situ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), whereas photoexcitation increased respiratory frequency while decreasing inspiratory amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These effects on breathing are consistent with previous optogenetic perturbations of the preBötC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alsahafi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koizumi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vann et al., 2018</xref>).

This is likely to result from photoinhibition of some rostral ventral respiratory group phrenic premotor neurons, which intermingle with the caudal pole of the preBötC. Importantly, these neurons are not thought to project to respiratory/cardiovascular neurons other than phrenic motoneurons and lateral reticular nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2017</xref>), so they are unlikely to mediate the cardiac parasympathetic and vasomotor sympathetic effects found in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Caveats related to optically-activated chloride channels</title><p>To interrogate interactions between preBötC respiratory circuits and autonomic outputs we used the high temporal resolution of the natural light-activated anion channel <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2, which induces large chloride photocurrents with faster kinetics than other inhibitory opsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Govorunova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

The simplest pathway that could explain this result is a direct inhibitory connection between preBötC and cardiac vagal motoneurons, a scheme supported by our tracing studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) and the short latencies of vagal responses to optical excitation and inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). The preBötC contains both GABAergic and glycinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koizumi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuwana et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morgado-Valle et al., 2010</xref>) that display four activity patterns: tonic, inspiratory, pre-inspiratory and expiratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baertsch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morgado-Valle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sherman et al., 2015</xref>). It is likely that most of these functional subgroups are involved in cardiac parasympatho-modulation.</p><p>Bradycardia occurs independent of when in the respiratory cycle photoinhibition commences, showing that tonic neurons must be involved. Most interestingly, RSA, which is mediated by a progressive decrease of vagal parasympathetic drive during expiration that peaks during inspiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouairi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dergacheva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilbey et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neff et al., 2003</xref>), was nearly abolished by preBötC photoinhibition, even after the re-commencement of PNA during prolonged photoinhibition. RSA was also abolished with prolonged preBötC photoexcitation, while there was a tendency for an increase in HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This shows that prolonged photostimuli of the preBötC, that are likely to suppress phasic activities in targeted neurons and render them either inactive (photoinhibition) or tonically active (photoexcitation), are able to suppress RSA. This could be explained by suppression of the phasic activity of inhibitory preBötC neurons, composed of a small (~10%) proportion of inhibitory expiratory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baertsch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carroll et al., 2013</xref>), and a larger proportion of inhibitory pre-inspiratory and inspiratory neurons. As a result, phasic late expiratory and inspiratory inhibition of cardiac vagal parasympathetic activity would be suppressed, therefore suppressing RSA. The preBötC is therefore critically involved in tonic regulation of HR as well as the generation of RSA, through a combination of phasic inhibitory neurons.</p><p>The decrease in HR just after inspiration, during the post-inspiratory phase, likely involves an excitatory drive to cardiac parasympathetic preganglionic neurons external to the preBötC, most likely coming from the pontine Kölliker-Fuse nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farmer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilbey et al., 1984</xref>). Still, preBötC neurons exert an indirect influence on this, as a single photoinhibitory light pulse during inspiration modulated both the inspiratory and post-inspiratory phases, as well as amplitude of the following cycle of RSA, by reducing the post-inspiratory decrease in HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The preBötC provides excitatory drive to vasomotor sympathetic activity</title><p>Respiratory modulation of neurons involved in generating vasomotor sympathetic activity is found from spinal sympathetic preganglionic neurons of the intermediolateral cell column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou and Gilbey, 1992</xref>) to medullary bulbospinal pre-sympathetic neurons of the RVLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McAllen, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moraes et al., 2013</xref>) and caudal raphe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gilbey et al., 1995</xref>), as well as in baroactivated CVLM neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mandel and Schreihofer, 2006</xref>). Neurons in each of these regions display three main types of respiratory modulation, inspiratory activated, inspiratory inhibited, and post-inspiratory activated, which could be acquired mono-synaptically or poly-synaptically from respiratory neurons.</p><p>Prolonged preBötC photoinhibition reduced SNA and PP, but only for the apneic period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Single-pulse preBötC photoinhibition revealed a fast inhibition of SNA, peaking ~140 ms after the light pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This effect on SNA is delayed compared to the latencies of responses recorded in VNA, and cannot be attributed to the relatively slow conduction velocity of sympathetic pathways, as SNA responses to photostimulation of sympathetic premotor neurons are also lower than those seen here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Menuet et al., 2014</xref>). These observations are consistent with a polysynaptic pathway prior to the recorded SNA, which could potentially include recruitment of neurons in the intermediate reticular nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Toor et al., 2019</xref>). Also, inhibitory, GABAergic CVLM neurons are respiratory modulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mandel and Schreihofer, 2006</xref>) and could mediate inspiratory modulation of RVLM pre-sympathetic neurons arising from inhibitory or excitatory inspiratory preBötC neurons. Microinjection of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist muscimol into the CVLM/preBötC abolishes RespSNA and respiratory modulation of RVLM neurons, but it is not clear whether this is a direct effect to CVLM inhibition, or due to the associated total loss of respiratory drive and consequent network effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koshiya and Guyenet, 1996</xref>). Microinjections of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonists in the RVLM enhance RespSNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guyenet et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Menuet et al., 2017</xref>), which, together with our single-pulse preBötC photoinhibition experiments, favor the hypothesis that any respiratory phasic input from the CVLM is likely to inhibit presympathetic RVLM neurons.</p><p>Direct recordings show that inspiratory modulation of RVLM C1 neurons is mediated by excitatory post-synaptic potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moraes et al., 2013</xref>), and we found evidence that neurons in the preBötC, albeit not definitively demonstrated to be inspiratory-modulated neurons, send direct projections onto C1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This confirms our previous data showing retrograde trans-synaptic labeling of preBötC NK1R neurons from pre-sympathetic C1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dempsey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Menuet et al., 2017</xref>). Upon resumption of PNA, but during continued photoinhibition, the amplitude of RespSNA and Traube-Hering waves were decreased, strongly correlating with PNA amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Single-pulse preBötC photoinhibition during inspiration decreased the concomitant RespSNA burst and subsequent Traube-Hering wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). During preBötC photoexcitation, inspiratory amplitude was decreased and this also correlated with decreased RespSNA and Traube-Hering waves amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We therefore conclude the preBötC provides ongoing excitatory drive to vasomotor sympathetic activity, most likely via pre-sympathetic C1 neurons whose activity correlates with inspiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Menuet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moraes et al., 2013</xref>), and drives RespSNA and Traube-Hering waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Menuet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moraes et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Single-pulse preBötC photoinhibition had no effect on RespSNA when applied during post-inspiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Indeed, ponto-medullary transections strongly decreased RespSNA and Traube-Hering waves. Yet, this also caused a switch from eupnea to an apneustic breathing pattern, with prolonged and square shaped phrenic nerve activity. This highlights the difficulty to interrogate functional circuitry entrained by respiratory neurons, as alteration of the activity of the respiratory network will create rebound network effects and alterations of breathing, making it difficult to disentangle the direct versus indirect mechanisms inlvolving the neurons studied. Ideally, future experiments will enable modulation of individual synapses between respiratory neurons and neurons regulating sympathetic (or parasympathetic) activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Different preBötC respiratory neurons affect SNA compared to cardiac vagal activity</title><p>The current view is that excitatory preBötC neurons generate the inspiratory rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), while inhibitory preBötC neurons shape its pattern and frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baertsch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cregg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sherman et al., 2015</xref>).

By stark contrast, vagal activation and bradycardia remained affected for the entire period of photoinhibition. This observation provides strong support for affecting two different cell populations, an excitatory one involved in inspiratory rhythmogenesis and SNA modulation, and an inhibitory one involved in inspiratory patterning and cardiac vagal modulation. The most likely explanation for the return of respiratory activity during continued photoinhibition is that rhythmogenic, excitatory inspiratory neurons of the preBötC escaped <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2-mediated photoinhibition. The mechanism responsible for the rhythmogenic activity of preBötC is still debated, but involves excitatory pre-inspiratory and inspiratory neurons with cellular and/or micro-network electrophysiological properties particularly prone to burst generation, which could confer particular propensity to escape prolonged inhibition. If this is the mechanism, it appears to be a property of the excitatory neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Respiratory cardiovascular interactions in the clinical setting</title><p>Assessment of the short-term variability of HR, and to a lesser extent BP, is common in clinical evaluation of cardiovascular health. The main spectral density found in both HR and BP variability is in phase with the respiratory frequency, in the high-frequency band, and is actually a quantification of RSA and Traube-Hering waves, respectively. These measurements provide an invaluable means for non-invasive assessment of parasympathetic and sympathetic drives to the cardiovascular system and have attracted general community interested due to the connection between HR variability and ‘healthiness’ scores. However, views on the analysis and interpretation of these data vary substantially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayano and Yuda, 2019</xref>). At the core of uncertainty regarding the value of HR and BP variability lies a lack of understanding of the mechanisms driving RSA and Traube-Hering waves.</p><p>Regardless of how it is measured, substantial evidence links altered respiratory modulation of autonomic activity with cardiovascular diseases. Exaggerated inspiratory modulation of sympathetic activity leads to increased Traube-Hering waves and drives the development of hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Menuet et al., 2017</xref>). This study identifies a key source of this excitatory inspiratory modulation, and while modifying preBötC activity is not conceivable given its critical role, targeted therapeutics that only impact the preBötC to C1 neuron connection could be developed to prevent hypertension development. A common feature of many cardiovascular diseases, and prognostic indicator of poor survival, is reduced RSA, often in concert with increased Traube-Hering waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palatini and Julius, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996</xref>). Our study also identifies the preBötC as the likely source of this dual alteration of cardiac parasympathetic and vasomotor sympathetic respiratory drives.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Whilst initially characterized as a key oscillator for driving inspiratory activity, the preBötC has already been shown to have more widespread functions, acting as a master oscillator driving other activities, such as sniffing and whisking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deschênes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moore et al., 2013</xref>). Redundancy is usually a characteristic feature of neuronal networks, as it provides robustness to perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2016</xref>). It is therefore surprising to find that the preBötC is so critical for respiratory, cardiovascular and other oscillations. Our study provides evidence for another layer of influence for the preBötC as a hub oscillator that synchronizes cardio-respiratory function. This coordination is a fundamental physiological phenomenon observed across many different phyla that is likely to be of key importance for optimal perfusion, and function, of tissues.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (male Sprague Dawley rats)</td><td>WT Sprague Dawley rats</td><td>Biomedical Science Animal Facility of the University of Melbourne</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pFUGW-hGtACR2-EYFP</td><td>Addgene, gift from John Spudich</td><td>plasmid # 67877;

The secondary antibodies used were Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, USA), Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, USA), AlexaFluor-488 donkey anti-rabbit (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, USA), AlexaFluor-488 donkey anti-mouse (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, USA) and AlexaFluor-488 donkey anti-chicken (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, USA).</p><p>In situ hybridization cRNA probes for glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2) and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) were synthesized as previously described, permitting identification of glycinergic and GABAergic neurons respectively by in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bowman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Le et al., 2016</xref>). A digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probe for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2), a marker of glutamate synthesis, was synthesized as follows: cDNA template (886 bp, Genebank reference sequence NM_053427) was amplified using the PCR primers (lower case) with T7 and Sp6 RNA polymerase promotors (upper case) attached F:<named-content content-type="sequence">GGATCCATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAGtcaatgaaatccaacgtcca</named-content>; R:<named-content content-type="sequence">GAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAcaagagcacaggacaccaaa</named-content>.</p><p>Following purification of the DNA template with gel extraction, antisense riboprobes were in vitro transcribed (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI) incorporating digoxigenin-11-UTP (Roche Applied Science) and validated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Sections containing GtACR2-YFP-labeled neurons were incubated in pre-hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 100 µg/ml heparin, 5 x SSC, pH 7.0, 1 x Denhardt’s solution, 250 µg/ml herring sperm DNA, 100 µg/ml yeast tRNA, 5% dextran sulphate, 0.1% Tween-20, reagents obtained from Sigma, Australia unless otherwise indicated) at 37°C (30 min), then 58°C (1 hr) before hybridization with gentle agitation with GlyT2, GAD67 or VGluT2 riboprobe (1000 ng/ml) at 58°C (12–18 hr). Sections were washed in 2 x SSC buffer with 0.1% Tween-20, followed by 0.2 x SSC buffer with 0.1% Tween-20, and then maleic acid buffer (0.1 M maleic acid, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20). The tissue was then blocked in maleic acid buffer containing 2% Boehringer blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science, Manheim, Germany) and 10% normal horse serum.</p><p>Rabbit anti-GFP (1:500, Life Technologies, Scoresby, Australia, A-6455) was added to the blocking buffer and incubated at 4°C (24 hr), then at room temperature (4 hr). Sections were washed in TPBS (Tris–HCl 10 mM, sodium phosphate buffer 10 mM, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4, 3 × 30 min) and incubated overnight with AlexaFluor-488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:500, Life Technologies, Scoresby, Australia, A21206) with 2% normal horse serum. DIG-labeled neurons were revealed by incubation in NTMT (0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 0.1 M MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% Tween-20, 2 mM tetramisole HCl) containing nitro blue tetrazolium (Roche Applied Science) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate salts (Roche Applied Science). The reaction was stopped by washing (0.1M Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.5, 3 × 15 min) when DIG-labelling was intense with minimal background staining. No labeling was seen when the sense probe was substituted for the anti-sense probe.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Mapping of reporter expression</title><p>A complete map of the distribution of <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2-YFP expression from the 12 WHBP experiments was generated from 1:4 series of sections co-labeled with ChAT, TH and NK1R to assist with alignment of the sections into the Paxinos-Watson atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paxinos and Watson, 2004</xref>). Heatmaps of pooled <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2-YFP expression, imaged using Zeiss Axio Imager.M2 microscope with an Apocromat 20x/0.8 air objective (Carl-Zeiss, NSW, Australia) and captured using Axiocam 506 mono camera and ZEN 2.6 (blue edition) imaging software, were made using Affinity Designer software (Serif Ltd., UK). Sections from four representative animals used in the WHBP were processed to examine colocalization of preBötC <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2-YFP with GAD67, VGluT2 and GlyT2 mRNA. Sections were imaged under epifluoresence and brightfield (Zeiss Z1, 10x objective, 0.3 NA). The expression profile of ChR2-tdTomato and <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2-YFP used for in vivo experiments were similar to that of <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2-YFP from WHBP experiments, so they were mapped qualitatively rather than quantitatively. The brainstems from two animals from the <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2-YFP in vivo experiments were cut sagitally for better visualization of rostro-caudal <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2-YFP expression.</p><p>For the tracing study, tdTomato expression at the injection site was examined under Zeiss Axio Imager.M2 microscope with an Apocromat 20x/0.8 air objective (Carl-Zeiss, NSW, Australia) and captured using Axiocam 506 mono camera and ZEN 2.6 (blue edition) imaging software. TdTomato terminals were imaged with a Zeiss LSM880, Axio Imager 2 confocal microscope, with a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 oil DIC M27 objective, in a Z-stack array, acquiring up to 8 consecutive overlapping slices. All channels were acquired at a consistent pinhole setting of 1.0 μm. Each optical section was assessed for close apposition between axons labelled by tdTomato and ChAT-immunoreactive nucleus ambiguus vagal preganglionic neurons or TH-immunoreactive C1 pre-sympathetic neurons. Maximum intensity projections of 4–6 image stacks were produced using the Image J software (NIH, USA) to better represent the distribution of preBötC terminal labeling.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>Nerve signals were rectified and integrated with a 50 ms time constant. For low-frequency photostimulation (1 Hz) laser triggered averaging of tSNA and VNA, the signals were rectified and integrated with a 5 ms time constant. For triggered photostimulations, PNA signals were rectified and integrated with a 0.5 ms DC remove time constant and a 100 ms smoothing time constant, to eliminate the ECG background. Phrenic-triggered (end of inspiratory burst) averaging of tSNA, systolic PP and HR were used to quantify respiratory modulation of tSNA (RespSNA), Traube-Hering waves (mmHg) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA, bpm), respectively. Tonic levels of tSNA were measured using the phrenic-triggered averaging of tSNA, as the average of tSNA during the expiratory period, therefore outside of the burst of respiratory modulation of SNA. Phrenic-triggered (end of inspiratory burst) averaging of VNA was used to quantify the peak post-inspiratory and non-respiratory components of VNA. Details regarding the period analysed are shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>. For manual photostimulations, to avoid averaging distortion, phrenic-triggered averagings were performed on both consecutive respiratory-related activities to be analysed, and then traces were overlapped and merged at their mean intersection for further analysis. Statistical analysis was done on raw values, and then mean deltas in percentages were quantified (photostimulation vs pre-photostimulation period). Statistics shown on figures presenting only mean delta percentages (for presentation clarity, e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) were done on the raw values as shown on the associated supplementary figures (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and associated data source). Group data are presented as mean ± SEM. Normal distribution of data was verified with the Shapiro-Wilk test, and equal variance of data was tested (SigmaPlot v12, Systat Software Inc, Erkrath, Germany). Data were analyzed using one-way repeated measures or two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, followed by <italic>post hoc</italic> Holm-Sidak multiple-comparison tests, or paired student’s <italic>t</italic> tests, for data with normal distribution and equal variance. Data with failed normal distribution or failed equal variance were analyzed using Friedman repeated measures analysis of variance on ranks followed with pairwise multiple comparison Tukey test, or Wilcoxon signed rank test. Linear regression and correlation analysis was used to analyze parameters relationships (Prism v2.0, GraphPad, La Jolla, USA). When missing values were present, for instance because one photostimulation frequency could not be performed or some of the associated data were not appropriate for analysis (noise etc.), it was dealt with accordingly depending on the test used, mostly by excluding the sample from the whole analysis (cf. source data and statistics). All source data and detailed statistics are presented as supplementary information along with each figure. Differences were considered significant at p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the facilities and technical assistance of the Biological Optical Microscopy Platform (University of Melbourne) for the confocal microscopy images.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: Experiments were conducted in accordance with the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council 'Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes' and were approved by the University of Melbourne Animal Research Ethics and Biosafety Committees (ethics ID #1413273, #1614009, #1814599 and Florey 16-040).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-57288-transrepform-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

<italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Patrice Guyenet (Reviewer #1); Davi J. A. Moraes (Reviewer #2); Thomas Dick (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The proposed study examines the potential functional connections between the rhythmogenic respiratory network of the preBötzinger complex that drives inspiration and circuits involved in autonomic functions such as those controlling heart rate and blood pressure. On working-heart brainstem preparations and using optogenetics, anatomical investigations and complex measurements of diverse physiological parameters the authors aimed to demonstrate that preBötC neurons directly modulate cardiovascular activity with inhibitory preBötC neurons modulating cardiac parasympathetic activity and excitatory preBötC neurons modulating sympathetic vasomotor activity. Consequently, heart rate and blood pressure oscillate in phase with respiration.</p><p>All three reviewers and myself acknowledge the high technical quality of the study performed with the use of sophisticated approaches, nice illustrations and particularly anatomical data, and the presentation of experiments with complex measurements of physiological parameters. This paper addresses the complex question regarding the regulation exerted by the rhythmogenic network of the preBötzinger complex on the autonomic outflow to the vasculature and heart, which is definitively a topic of interest for a large audience. This work undoubtedly brings new findings that will help further identification of the actors of the coupling between respiratory circuits and cardiovascular control, but some concerns (detailed below) must be addressed and revisions on data interpretation should be considered by the authors before publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript, the authors should report not just the magnitude of the respiratory peak of SNA but the total SNA (rectified power per unit of time minus background) and where they zero SNA (noise) also. The respiratory modulation is just one input among many. Attenuation of the respiratory modulation is hard to interpret without knowing what happens to the overall signal. For example, the loss of the respiratory modulation means little if the overall signal disappears.</p><p>Based on prior evidence in anesthetized rats inhibiting the preBotC region only eliminates the respiratory oscillation of SNA and that of the presympathetic neurons of the RVLM (e.g. Koshiya and Guyenet, 1996). Inhibiting the preBotC region did not reduce the substantial basal activity of these neurons. That is the reason why the authors should report the effects of their optogenetic manipulations on the actual total SNA (rectified signal minus noise /unit of time) and not just the phasic component. This would provide a more realistic estimate of the effects of inhibiting the preBotC region on this outflow and it would help put the phasic component in some perspective.</p><p>2) Data interpretation:</p><p>The main point of the paper is that the &quot;pre-Botzinger complex&quot;, a region of the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) that is required for breathing also drives sympathetic tone to the cardiovascular system. Track tracing experiments complement the evidence by suggesting that this excitatory drive could be mediated via direct projections from the &quot;pre-Botzinger complex&quot; to a more anterior region of the VLM that contains presympathetic bulbospinal neurons. While the data are generally consistent with this hypothesis, the interpretation is based on measures of the output of the system (phrenic nerve discharge (PND) and sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and the underlying circuit is not clarified. The VLM is extremely complex and, as noted by the authors, the preBotC harbors several types of &quot;respiratory&quot; neurons. This region also contains inhibitory interneurons that mediate the baroreflex (CVLM), adrenergic neurons, cardiovagal neurons etc… The overall effects produced by optogenetic activation of a chloride channel or ChR2 expressed by a subset of these neurons can only be guessed at because the investigators did not perform unit recordings to identify the effect of the light on identified cell types. For example, 50% of prePreBotC are inhibitory neurons. These neurons could very plausibly contribute a phasic respiratory inhibitory input to nearby CVLM GABAergic neurons that innervate RVLM presympathetic neurons and mediate the sympathetic baroreflex. This hypothetical scenario could explain reasonably well the reduction in SNA caused by activating Cl channels expressed by &quot;preBotC&quot; neurons. In other words the present results can be explained by the classic notion of a respiratory gating of the baroreflex at the CVLM level. Clearly many other possibilities could be conceived of but this one should perhaps be given first consideration given that it is the only one that is directly supported by single neuron electrophysiological evidence. So the Discussion should be more careful in its interpretation of the underlying circuitry.</p><p>Also: It is not clear why the pre-Bötzinger Complex inhibition induces such sustained and robust bradycardia. The authors discuss the possible contribution of inhibitory tonic neurons in the pre-Bötzinger Complex, which control the firing of cardio-inhibitory parasympathetic neurons in the NA. This data is suggesting that the pre-Bötzinger Complex is controlling a significant component of the heart rate (from 300 to 150 bpm; Figure 3A). On the other side, the pre-Bötzinger Complex excitation did not induce tachycardia. One possibility is that the authors did not manipulate the same population of cells between the experiments (photoinhibition vs. photoexcitation). Therefore, could the authors describe whether the numbers of transfected glutamatergic, GABAergic, and glycinergic neurones were similar between the experiments?</p><p>3) An additional trace in a panel for clarification is requested in Figure 8B. Please provide a trace for the average ∫VNA.</p><p>4) The present interpretation ignores the role of the pons and plasticity in mediating cardiorespiratory coupling. How can the focus on the Pre-Bötzinger Complex explain the attenuation or even absence of cardio-respiratory coupling with pontine perturbations? How can you explain the variance of the magnitude of cardio-respiratory coupling between elite athletes and the depressed, given that both groups are breathing? There must be multiple influences coupling cardio-respiratory rhythms. Please discuss further the possibility that the respiratory modulation of SNA could come from anywhere including the dorsolateral pons.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57288.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript, the authors should report not just the magnitude of the respiratory peak of SNA but the total SNA (rectified power per unit of time minus background) and where they zero SNA (noise) also.

We did this, but obviously without sufficient clarity and emphasis. We have generated a new figure, Figure 3—figure supplement 2, that complements the Materials and methods section to explain how SNA was analysed.</p><p>In relation to the measurement of total SNA. We analysed the mean integrated tSNA over several periods, as shown on Figure 3—figure supplement 2A. All our analyses were performed using a repeated measures approach within animals, i.e. comparing photostimulation periods relative to intra-preparation pre-photostimulation control and post-photostimulation recovery periods. When comparing in this way it is not necessary to remove noise in the recordings before analysis, since it will be automatically discarded by the repeated measures analysis process. For each animal, noise is reasonably expected to be the same in each period of SNA analysis within each preparation. When measuring noise at the completion of an experiment, and then extracting it from the analysed record, it is assumed that the noise remained constant throughout, but this is less likely to be true and a comparison at relatively close experimental periods will be more accurate. Removing noise is only necessary for comparing absolute values between preparations, which we didn’t do here.</p><p>Using this approach, we analysed total SNA for both the photoinhibition and photoexcitation protocols. The SNA data included in Figure 3 only interrogates the effect of prolonged preBötC photoinhibition on total SNA. Then, we performed phrenic triggered averaging of tSNA to analyse specifically the respiratory modulation of tSNA, which we called RespSNA to highlight the difference with total SNA, and to analyse the non-respiratory component of tSNA, which we called tonic tSNA (now explained in Figure 3—figure supplement 2B). Figure 6B shows the analysis of RespSNA and tonic SNA which demonstrates little change in tonic SNA and substantial reduction in the RespSNA. We made this detailed analysis with the same reasoning as expressed by the reviewers, to enable interpretation of the RespSNA changes compared to non-respiratory, tonic tSNA and compared to total tSNA.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for mentioning the study by Koshiya and Guyenet, 1996, which suggests similar conclusions to our present study. It should be noted that in the cited study, muscimol injection in the preBötC area removes the respiratory component of SNA, but it is concomitant with total arrest of the respiratory nerves recorded. It is therefore difficult to conclude from this study, if the respiratory component of SNA is removed directly because of the inhibition of the preBötC area, or indirectly because of the global respiratory arrest. We now discuss this in the subsection “The preBötC provides excitatory drive to vasomotor sympathetic activity”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Data interpretation:</p><p>The main point of the paper is that the &quot;pre-Botzinger complex&quot;, a region of the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) that is required for breathing also drives sympathetic tone to the cardiovascular system.

This could indeed lead to multiple neuronal pathways being affected during photostimulations. We have altered the Discussion accordingly, subsection “The preBötC provides excitatory drive to vasomotor sympathetic activity”, including the preBötC-CVLM-RVLM hypothesis. Still, the preBötC-RVLM connectivity is robust, as supported by both functional and anatomical evidence. C1 neurons show inspiratory-phase excitatory post-synaptic potentials (Moraes et al., 2013 ). There is mono-synaptic connection between NK1-R positive preBötC neurons and RVLM bulbo-spinal neurons including C1 neurons (Dempsey et al., 2017, and Menuet et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also: It is not clear why the pre-Bötzinger Complex inhibition induces such sustained and robust bradycardia.

Still, macroscopically, the same area was transfected for both ChR2 and GtACR2 sets of experiments, and the same promoter was used, so it is highly likely that the same profile of cell transduction would be observed between both sets of experiments.</p><p>Still, the point raised by the reviewers on why preBötC photoexcitation didn’t produce tachycardia is indeed interesting. Our interpretation is that it reflects the ongoing level of cardiac parasympathetic activity in the working heart-brainstem model. Examination of the response to atropine (Figure 4C) reveals a very small and variable tachycardia, with a mean change of ~15 bpm across the group. If we consider the simplest circuitry, involving a direct respiratory phasic inhibitory output from the preBötC to the cardiac parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, it is not surprising that excitation of these preBötC neurons has little effect. Further inhibition of parasympathetic activity, due to excitation of these inhibitory preBötC neurons, would have little ability to produce further inhibition or tachycardia. This is also consistent with the loss of RSA during preBötC excitation. In contrast, removal of this inhibition, with photoinhibition of the putative inhibitory preBötC neurons, has the potential to induce large changes in heart rate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) An additional trace in a panel for clarification is requested in Figure 8B.

There must be multiple influences coupling cardio-respiratory rhythms. Please discuss further the possibility that the respiratory modulation of SNA could come from anywhere including the dorsolateral pons.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that there are likely multiple influences on cardio-respiratory rhythms. We have chosen to focus on the input from one region where our tracing studies demonstrate a direct, monosynaptic input to RVLM presympathetic and RVLM C1 neurons (Dempsey et al., 2017, and Menuet et al., 2017). Our interest is in the inspiratory modulation of SNA, which is the key component that is amplified in the Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat (SHR). This component is directed through C1 neurons, and removal of these C1 neurons during development substantially reduces the blood pressure of the adult SHR. A prominent source of inspiratory activity in the brain is the Pre-Bötzinger Complex and thus the focus of this study.</p><p>In response to the direct comment about the dorsolateral pons, examination of the data indicates that interruption of the pons alters respiratory drive (for a study using the same in situ perfused rat preparation, see Baekey et al., 2008). The problem we have as a field of researchers is in interpreting whether the observed alteration in respiratory-cardiovascular modulation is direct, i.e. the pons directly influences the RVLM pre-sympathetic neurons or the cardiac parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, or, is a result of the altered state of the respiratory network. The key advantage of using photoinhibition, as applied in this study, is being able to apply single pulse stimulation (Figure 5) and observe the response in the absence of any changes to network dynamics. We show a clear effect of the preBötC. We make no attempt to provide an over-arching conclusion in relation to how other brain regions impact cardio-respiratory coupling. In response to the helpful suggestions of the reviewers, we have added to the Discussion, in an attempt to cover some understanding of how other brain regions might impact cardio-respiratory coupling. However with space limitations, and not wishing to over-speculate on the basis of our direct data, this discussion cannot be comprehensive.</p><p>Regarding the variance of the magnitude of cardio-respiratory coupling in elite athletes, or in diseased people (hypertension, chronic heart failure etc.), we believe one must differentiate between mechanisms generating cardio-respiratory coupling, and mechanisms regulating it. Indeed, it is likely that external regulation of the gain of the respiratory-sympathetic and respiratory-parasympathetic connections is causing most of the variance in cardio-respiratory coupling magnitude. For example, in rats submitted to chronic intermittent hypoxia, adrenomedullin was shown to induce long-term potentiation of sympathetic vasomotor activity and specifically increase respiratory modulation of SNA (Zoccal et al., Exp Physiol, DOI: 10.1113/EP087613). On the parasympathetic side, Dr Mendelowitz and his lab have produced several studies demonstrating that nicotine enhances neurotransmission to cardiac parasympathetic neurons, including inspiratory GABAergic inputs resulting in enhanced respiratory sinus arrhythmia (Neff et al., 2003). Our study doesn’t investigate the mechanisms regulating cardio-respiratory coupling magnitude, it investigates one specific mechanism generating it. We therefore prefer not to discuss these aspects.</p></body></sub-article></article>
