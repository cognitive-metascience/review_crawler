These gametes are produced by meiosis, a specialized cell division program during which a single round of DNA replication is followed by two rounds of chromosome segregation (the meiotic divisions), Meiosis I (MI) and Meiosis II (MII). In contrast, mitotically–dividing cells maintain their ploidy by strictly alternating rounds of DNA replication and chromosome segregation. The lack of DNA replication between MI and MII is essential for the reduction in ploidy inherent to meiosis, but it is unclear how the meiotic program differs from mitosis to allow for two sequential chromosome segregation events without an intervening S phase.</p><p>In mitotic cells, both DNA replication and chromosome segregation require cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity to oscillate during the cell cycle. A low–CDK state during G1 phase allows both events to initiate, and a high–CDK state is required for their completion. During meiosis, the CDK–oscillation dependence of both events presents a unique problem between MI and MII, a period known as the MI–MII transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After MI has been completed, CDK activity decreases, and then increases again upon entry into MII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlile and Amon, 2008</xref>). This oscillation is required for multiple essential chromosome–segregation events, including duplication of the spindle pole body (SPB, the yeast centrosome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buonomo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fox et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marston et al., 2003</xref>). However, the DNA replication program must remain inhibited between MI and MII to achieve the hallmark of meiosis, reductive cell division. Given that an oscillation of CDK activity is sufficient for re–replication of the entire genome in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dahmann et al., 1995</xref>), it is not fully understood how meiotic cells reset the chromosome segregation program while retaining inhibition of the DNA replication program.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33309.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mcm2–7 loading onto replication origins is inhibited during the MI–MII transition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The DNA replication program and chromosome segregation program are uncoupled during the MI–MII transition.

During G1 phase, low CDK activity allows for the Mcm2–7 complex, the core enzyme of the replicative helicase, to be loaded onto origins of replication in an inactive state. This event, known as origin licensing or helicase loading, cannot occur in the presence of high CDK activity and requires the cooperative action of three proteins: Cdc6, Cdt1, and the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Remus et al., 2009</xref>). Upon S–phase entry, S–CDK (CDK bound to S-phase cyclins Clb5/6) is activated and impacts DNA replication in two ways. First, S–CDK phosphorylates two essential proteins, Sld2 and Sld3, that subsequently promote helicase activation, replisome assembly, and chromosome duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Masumoto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zegerman and Diffley, 2007</xref>). Second, both S–CDK and M-CDK (CDK bound to mitotic cyclins Clb1-4) inhibit new helicase loading during S, G2, and M phases. These kinases directly phosphorylate Cdc6, Mcm3, and ORC to trigger the proteolytic degradation of Cdc6, the nuclear export of Mcm2–7–Cdt1, and inhibition of ORC helicase–loading activity, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calzada et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen and Bell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drury et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Labib et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nguyen et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>CDK oscillations also ensure that chromosome segregation occurs once per mitotic cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Winey and Bloom, 2012</xref>). At the end of G1 phase, G1–CDK (CDK bound to G1 cyclins Cln1-3) is required for duplication of the SPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jaspersen et al., 2004</xref>). Later in the cell cycle, S–CDK and M–CDK prevent re–duplication of SPBs, and M-CDK is essential for the assembly of metaphase spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avena et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elserafy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haase et al., 2001</xref>). Finally, downregulation of CDK activity is required for anaphase spindle disassembly upon completion of chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shirayama et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thornton and Toczyski, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wäsch and Cross, 2002</xref>). From this point forward, we will refer only to total CDK activity without specifying G1–, S–, or M–CDK, as the events we will be discussing are similarly regulated by all three kinases.</p><p>Two models have been proposed to explain how meiotic cells uncouple DNA replication and chromosome segregation during the MI–MII transition. The CDK–balance model suggests that partially inactivating CDK is sufficient to reset the chromosome segregation program while still inhibiting Mcm2–7 loading and replication initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iwabuchi et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, the alternative–kinase model suggests that a second kinase inhibits Mcm2–7 loading during the MI–MII transition, allowing the oscillation of CDK activity to reset the chromosome segregation program without resetting the DNA replication program. Ime2, a yeast meiosis–specific kinase that is evolutionarily related to CDK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krylov et al., 2003</xref>), has been proposed to have this role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holt et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We set out to systematically address how DNA replication is inhibited between the meiotic divisions using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches. We found that Mcm2–7 loading is the earliest inhibited step of replisome assembly during the MI–MII transition, and that this inhibition can be bypassed by simultaneous inhibition of CDK and Ime2. Furthermore, we identified two previously uncharacterized mechanisms used by Ime2 to inhibit origin licensing. First, Ime2 phosphorylation of Mcm2–7 directly inhibited its ability to be loaded onto replication origins. Second, we found that Ime2 and CDK cooperate to repress expression of Cdc6. In addition to the inhibition of helicase loading, meiotic cells promote degradation of Sld2, an essential helicase–activation protein, using phosphorylation sites for CDK and the polo–like kinase Cdc5. Together, these data show that meiotic cells use multiple kinases to inhibit both Mcm2–7 loading and activation, ensuring that MI and MII occur sequentially without an intervening S–phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mcm2–7 loading is the first inhibited step of DNA replication initiation</title><p>To address how DNA replication is inhibited between MI and MII, we sought to identify the earliest inhibited step of replisome assembly. During replication initiation, the first proteins to stably associate with replication origins are ORC followed by the Mcm2–7 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>). To analyze ORC and Mcm2–7 binding to origins in populations of cells, it was necessary for us to obtain synchronized cultures of cells undergoing meiosis. To this end, we used a previously–described block–release procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benjamin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlile and Amon, 2008</xref>). This method allows meiotic cells to proceed through G1 and S phase but arrest in Prophase I (hereafter referred to as G2 phase). Subsequent release from this cell cycle arrest results in cells progressing synchronously through Metaphase I, Anaphase I, Metaphase II, and Anaphase II with &gt;90% of cells completing meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Using ChIP–qPCR, we found that ORC was bound to a representative early–firing (<italic>ARS1</italic>) and late–firing (<italic>ARS1413</italic>) replication origin throughout both meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top). ORC binding to DNA is therefore not limiting for replication initiation during meiosis. In contrast, although Mcm2–7 was present at origins during pre–meiotic G1 phase, this complex did not associate with either <italic>ARS1</italic> or <italic>ARS1413</italic> throughout MI and MII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, top). We also tested two additional origins, <italic>ARS305</italic> and <italic>ARS418</italic>, that are prone to Mcm2–7 reloading and DNA re–replication in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Green et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nguyen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanny et al., 2006</xref>). As with the other origins tested, ORC bound to these origins throughout the meiotic divisions but Mcm2–7 loading was not observed after pre–meiotic G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, bottom). Both ORC and Mcm2-7 associated specifically with origin DNA sequences compared to non-origin DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The lack of Mcm2–7 binding to origins was not due to the absence of Mcm2–7 proteins or the essential helicase–loading protein Cdt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, Mcm2–7 loading onto origins of replication is inhibited during the MI–MII transition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CDK-dependent mechanisms inhibiting Mcm2–7 loading are weakened during the MI–MII transition</title><p>We considered two reasons that Mcm2–7 complexes were not reloaded upon decreased CDK activity during the MI–MII transition: (1) the known CDK-dependent mechanisms remain active enough to completely inhibit helicase loading (the CDK-balance model); or (2) meiosis–specific mechanisms inhibit helicase loading while CDK activity is reduced (the alternative-kinase model). To test the first possibility, we asked whether any of the CDK–dependent mechanisms preventing Mcm2–7 loading in mitotic cells were weakened during the MI–MII transition. In mitotically dividing cells, CDK inhibits helicase loading by three mechanisms: inhibition of ORC function, Cdc6 protein degradation, and Mcm2–7 nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias and Walter, 2007</xref>).

A strong candidate to mediate these potential mechanisms was Ime2, a CDK–related meiosis–specific kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krylov et al., 2003</xref>). Previous studies found that Ime2 is active during the meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berchowitz et al., 2013</xref>) and that, like CDK, this kinase can promote Mcm2–7 nuclear export upon completion of meiotic S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holt et al., 2007</xref>). However, if Ime2 were replacing CDK–dependent inhibition of helicase loading during the MI–MII transition, we hypothesized that it would inhibit Mcm2–7 loading by more than one mechanism (as CDK is known to do).</p><p>To identify additional mechanisms by which Ime2 inhibits Mcm2–7 loading, we asked if Ime2 could inhibit helicase loading in vitro. To this end, we used an assay that reconstitutes helicase loading on origin–containing DNA with four purified proteins (ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, and Mcm2–7; see reaction scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Remus et al., 2009</xref>). We found that pre-treating the helicase-loading proteins with purified Ime2 fully inhibited Mcm2–7 loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). To demonstrate that this inhibition depended on Ime2 kinase activity, we purified an analog–sensitive Ime2 protein (Ime2–AS). Analog–sensitive kinases are active in the presence of ATP but are inhibited by specific bulky ATP analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bishop et al., 2000</xref>). In the case of Ime2–AS, addition of the ATP analog 1–NA–PP1 strongly inhibits its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benjamin et al., 2003</xref>). In the presence of ATP, Ime2–AS inhibited Mcm2–7 loading to the same extent as wild–type (WT) Ime2 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, the addition of 1–NA–PP1 to assays treated with Ime2–AS (but not WT Ime2) fully restored helicase loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> lanes 3–10). Consistent with Ime2 phosphorylation being responsible for the inhibition, the extent of helicase-loading inhibition correlated with the extent of phosphorylation of helicase–loading proteins for both WT Ime2 and Ime2–AS, with and without 1–NA–PP1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Ime2-phosphorylation of one or more helicase-loading proteins directly inhibits origin licensing. Furthermore, because these experiments use only purified proteins, the mechanism preventing helicase loading must be due to the intrinsic inhibition of a specific protein’s function, as opposed to indirect inhibitory mechanisms such as nuclear export or protein degradation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33309.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Ime2 is sufficient to inhibit helicase loading in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of helicase–loading and OCCM–complex–formation assays.

After OCCM formation, multiple conformational changes and ATP hydrolysis events are required for the first Mcm2–7 complex to be stably loaded around the DNA and a second Mcm2–7 to be recruited and loaded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coster and Diffley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ticau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhai et al., 2017</xref>). To determine whether Ime2 inhibits initial Mcm2–7 recruitment, we conducted in vitro association assays with the slowly hydrolyzable analog ATPγS instead of ATP, stalling helicase loading after OCCM formation (reaction scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Randell et al., 2006</xref>). Prior phosphorylation of the helicase–loading proteins with Ime2 (in the presence of ATP) did not prevent subsequent OCCM formation in the presence of excess ATPγS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, Ime2 phosphorylation does not block the protein–protein interactions necessary for initial Mcm2–7 recruitment, but instead must inhibit a downstream step during Mcm2–7 loading.</p><p>Next, we sought to identify the Ime2-target(s) that result in the inhibition of helicase loading. In vitro kinase assays showed that Ime2 phosphorylates Cdc6, Cdt1, and subunits of both ORC and the Mcm2–7 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To identify which of these phosphorylation events inhibits helicase loading, we used Ime2–AS to phosphorylate each of these proteins separately. We then inhibited Ime2–AS by the addition of 1–NA–PP1 before adding the three remaining, non–phosphorylated proteins and origin DNA to initiate helicase loading. Strikingly, we found that phosphorylation of the Mcm2–7 complex alone resulted in a &gt;90% decrease in helicase loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). In contrast, Ime2 phosphorylation of ORC resulted in a ~50% reduction in loading, whereas reactions with phosphorylated Cdc6 and Cdt1 showed only minor defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Although CDK also inhibits helicase loading in vitro, the equivalent experiment using CDK confirmed previous results showing that CDK only strongly inhibits ORC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen and Bell, 2011</xref>).

During mitotic divisions, total Sld2 protein levels do not change dramatically until the end of mitosis, at which point CDK– and Cdc5– phosphorylation sites within a phospho–degron domain on Sld2 become important for its degradation. In addition, Cdc5 and the M–phase cyclins Clb1, Clb3, and Clb4 are transcriptionally induced by the meiosis-specific transcription factor Ndt80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chu and Herskowitz, 1998</xref>), and both Cdc5 and CDK are active during the meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benjamin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlile and Amon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clyne et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dahmann and Futcher, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee and Amon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sourirajan and Lichten, 2008</xref>).</p><p>To test whether Cdc5 and CDK contribute to Sld2 degradation during meiosis, we mutated their previously identified phosphorylation sites on Sld2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reusswig et al., 2016</xref>). Mutation of either Cdc5–phosphorylation sites (<italic>sld2-2TA</italic> = T122A and T143A), CDK–phosphorylation sites (<italic>sld2-2SA</italic> = S128A and S138A), or both together (<italic>sld2-4A</italic>) resulted in stabilization of Sld2 during the meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). To directly compare the effects of these mutations, we ran samples from all four strains side–by–side at each stage of meiosis and quantified Sld2 levels relative to a PGK1 loading control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). No more than a 2–fold difference in Sld2 levels was detected during meiotic G2 between all four strains. From metaphase I until metaphase II, wild type (WT) Sld2 abundance decreased to ~10% of the levels observed in G2 phase. In contrast, the abundance of the Sld2-4A mutant remained almost unchanged during this time. The levels of the Sld2-2TA and Sld2-2SA protein were marginally less than the Sld2-4A protein at these same times. Because both Sld2-2SA or Sld2-2TA were expressed at much higher levels than the WT protein during the meiotic divisions, both CDK– and Cdc5–phosphorylation are required to drive substantial Sld2 degradation. Upon entry into anaphase II, WT Sld2 protein levels began to recover while the mutant protein levels decreased, suggesting that other mechanisms were impacting Sld2 expression. Together, these data indicate that CDK and Cdc5 inhibit Mcm2–7 activation during the meiotic divisions by promoting Sld2 degradation. Thus, if an origin escapes the inhibition of Mcm2-7 loading during the meiotic divisions, Sld2 degradation would prevent activation of the associated helicases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we address a fundamental question concerning the regulation of meiosis; how do meiotic cells undergo two sequential rounds of chromosome segregation without an intervening S–phase? We found that meiotic cells prevent DNA replication between the meiotic divisions using CDK, Ime2, and Cdc5 to inhibit both helicase loading and activation. Ime2 and CDK cooperate to inhibit helicase loading, and their co–inhibition was sufficient for aberrant origin licensing during the MI–MII transition. Compared with CDK, Ime2 inhibits origin licensing using both overlapping and distinct mechanisms. In particular, we found that unlike CDK, Ime2 phosphorylation of Mcm2–7 directly inhibits its participation in helicase loading. In addition to the inhibition of origin licensing, meiotic cells use CDK and the polo–like kinase Cdc5 to promote degradation of Sld2, a key helicase-activation protein. Together, these data reveal that multiple kinases inhibit DNA replication between the two meiotic divisions by targeting both many components of the helicase-loading machinery and at least one helicase-activation protein. These mechanisms combine to ensure the hallmark reduction in ploidy associated with meiotic cell division.</p><p>Elements of both the CDK–balance model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iwabuchi et al., 2000</xref>) and the alternative–kinase model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holt et al., 2007</xref>) are evident in our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In support of the CDK–balance model, the amount of CDK activity present during the MI–MII transition is sufficient to inhibit most origin licensing, because Ime2 inhibition does not result in strong Mcm2–7 reloading. Thus, the decrease in CDK activity that resets the chromosome segregation program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bizzari and Marston, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buonomo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlile and Amon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fox et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marston et al., 2003</xref>) is not sufficient to fully reset the DNA replication program. In support of the alternative–kinase model, we found that CDK inhibition similarly did not result in extensive Mcm2–7 reloading during the MI-MII transition. Instead, we show that two additional kinases contribute to the inhibition of DNA replication between the meiotic divisions. Ime2 inhibits helicase loading, and Cdc5 helps stimulate the degradation of Sld2.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33309.026</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of how meiotic cells inhibit DNA replication during the MI–MII transition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Graphical representation of CDK (blue) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlile and Amon, 2008</xref>) and Ime2 (red) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berchowitz et al., 2013</xref>) kinase activities during meiosis, and how they regulate the chromosome segregation and DNA replication programs. Chromosome segregation is regulated by CDK, whereas DNA replication is regulated by CDK, Ime2, and Cdc5. During the MI-MII transition, CDK activity decreases enough to reset the chromosome segregation program for MII. Although CDK remains active enough to mostly inhibit the DNA replication program, the decreased activity is a significant threat to the inhibition of origin licensing. Ime2 is also mostly sufficient to inhibit Mcm2-7 loading during the MI-MII transition. Cdc5 activity has not been precisely determined and is thus not shown, but it contributes to the inhibition of DNA replication by limiting Mcm2–7 activation.

That meiotic cells use Ime2 and Cdc5 to inhibit helicase loading and activation, respectively, suggests that CDK–dependent inhibition of origin licensing is not adequate to ensure genome stability during meiosis. Furthermore, a subset of the mechanisms by which CDK and Ime2 inhibit helicase loading are non–overlapping, providing additional avenues to prevent inappropriate replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). It is important to note that our helicase reloading results are population–based experiments. Accordingly, the slight helicase reloading and Cdc6 reaccumulation that occurred upon inhibition of each kinase separately suggests that, at some point during the MI-MII transition or at a subset of replication origins, each kinase is required to prevent origin licensing.</p><p>Why do meiotic cells use so many mechanisms to inhibit DNA replication between the meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>)? We speculate that this is due to the difficulty of preventing &gt;300 replication origins from initiating while CDK activity oscillates. Emphasizing the importance of completely inhibiting DNA replication at unwanted periods of the cell cycle, previous studies have shown that reinitiating replication from even a single origin can cause gene amplification and chromosome missegregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Green et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanlon and Li, 2015</xref>). The transient weakening of both Cdc6 repression and ORC phosphorylation during the MI–MII transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) indicates that the associated decrease in CDK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlile and Amon, 2008</xref>) is a significant threat to origin licensing. Even the additional repression of Cdc6 by Ime2 is not sufficient to fully eliminate the protein during the MI-MII transition, although Ime2 has a larger role than CDK for Cdc6 repression at this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It is worth noting that in multicellular eukaryotes, preventing DNA re-replication in meiotic cells is more important than in mitotic cells to ensure that the inherited genome remains intact.</p><p>In addition to helicase loading, our studies strongly suggest that meiotic cells inhibit downstream steps of DNA replication. In mitotic cells, prevention of DNA re–replication relies on inhibiting Mcm2–7 loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias and Walter, 2007</xref>). Inhibiting early steps of replication makes sense, as there is less danger of aberrant DNA unwinding and polymerase recruitment. Although helicase loading is an earlier event in replication initiation, we note that Sld2 is required to form the active eukaryotic replicative helicase, the Cdc45–Mcm2–7–GINS (CMG) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kamimura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Muramatsu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yeeles et al., 2015</xref>). Activation of the replicative helicase is the committed step of replication initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>) and preventing this step would still stop replication before initial DNA unwinding and synthesis. Previous studies found that Sld2 degradation in mitotic cells is important for ensuring genome stability at the M–G1 transition, but not during other parts of the mitotic cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reusswig et al., 2016</xref>). Our finding that Sld2 is absent during both meiotic divisions suggests that mechanisms preventing DNA re–replication at the mitotic M–G1 transition also function during meiosis at the MI–MII transition, a partially G1-like state. Consistent with this idea, Dbf4, which binds to Cdc7 to form the kinase DDK and is also required for helicase activation, is degraded during both mitotic anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferreira et al., 2000</xref>) as well as meiotic anaphase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matos et al., 2008</xref>). The degradation of these two proteins strongly suggests that meiotic cells further protect themselves from replication initiation during the meiotic divisions by inhibiting multiple steps during Mcm2–7 activation.</p><p>Ime2 is not just a backup for the known inhibitory mechanisms used by CDK. We found that in addition to using at least two mechanisms similar to CDK (Cdc6 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drury et al., 2000</xref>) and Mcm2-7 nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holt et al., 2007</xref>)), Ime2-phosphorylation of Mcm2-7 results in a distinct mechanism of inhibition not seen after CDK-phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Origin licensing is inhibited by a number of different mechanisms across eukaryotic evolution, but previous studies have not identified a mechanism that directly prevents Mcm2-7 from completing helicase loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias and Walter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Siddiqui et al., 2013</xref>). Understanding how helicase loading is inhibited by CDK-phosphorylation of ORC and Ime2-phosphoryation of Mcm2-7 will reveal whether these two kinases target the same or different steps of this process.</p><p>The ability of Ime2 to inhibit helicase loading also suggests an important role for this kinase during the meiotic G1–S transition. During the mitotic G1–S transition, helicase loading is inhibited by G1–CDK before helicase activation is stimulated by S–phase CDK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drury et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Labib et al., 1999</xref>). This ‘insulation’ prevents cells from being in a state that permits both helicase loading and activation (e.g. at an intermediate level of CDK activity). During meiosis, G1 cyclins are not expressed and it is Ime2 that triggers activation of S–CDK at the G1–S transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benjamin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dirick et al., 1998</xref>). Our data and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holt et al., 2007</xref>) show that Ime2 can robustly inhibit helicase loading by multiple mechanisms, similar to G1-CDK. These observations strongly suggest that Ime2 insulates helicase loading from helicase activation during the meiotic G1–S transition in an analogous manner to G1–CDK during the mitotic G1–S transition.</p><p>The problem of uncoupling DNA replication and chromosome segregation during meiosis is conserved in other eukaryotes. Metazoans also use CDK to regulate both chromosome segregation and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias and Walter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Siddiqui et al., 2013</xref>). Although metazoans mostly rely on CDK–independent mechanisms to inhibit Mcm2–7 loading during S and G2 phase, these mechanisms are not as potent during M–phase at which point Cdk1 becomes a critical inhibitor of origin licensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias and Walter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Siddiqui et al., 2013</xref>). Transient inactivation of Cdk1 in human cells is sufficient for DNA re–replication, just as it is in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dahmann et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Itzhaki et al., 1997</xref>). An oscillation of Cdk1 activity is also required for correct chromosome segregation in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009</xref>). With regard to how DNA replication and chromosome segregation are uncoupled during mammalian meiosis, previous studies raise the intriguing possibility that mammalian Cdk2 may have a similar role during meiosis as Ime2 does in yeast. Human Cdk2 can rescue some meiotic defects associated with ime2∆ in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Szwarcwort-Cohen et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, Cdk2 is not required for mitosis in mice, but it is required for both male and female meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ortega et al., 2003</xref>). Together, our results provide new insight into how meiotic cells use multiple cell–cycle regulators and mechanisms to uncouple DNA replication and chromosome segregation.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

After mixing the proteins and DNA, reactions were shaken at 1,250 rpm at 25°C for 30 min (Thermomixer, Eppendorf), and then washed three times. For helicase–loading experiments, the three washes had buffer containing 300 mM K–Glut, 500 mM NaCl, and 300 mM KGlut respectively. DNA–bound proteins were eluted using DNase, run on SDS–PAGE gels, and detected using Krypton fluorescent stain (Fisher, PI–46629). To monitor OCCM formation, 5 mM ATPγS was used in place of ATP, and only washed with buffers containing 300 mM KGlut. Ime2 or CDK (150 nM or buffer control) was pre–incubated with the four purified proteins for 45 min before adding the bead–bound <italic>ARS1</italic> DNA. For experiments examining the effects of phosphorylating individual proteins, 150 nM kinase was pre–incubated with the indicated protein in the ‘+kinase’ reactions, and the other three proteins were mock phosphorylated. After 1 hr, the kinase inhibitor (1–NA–PP1 for Ime2, Sic1 for CDK) was added to both the ‘+kinase’ and ‘–kinase’ reactions, and the kinase itself was then added to the ‘–kinase’ reactions to control for any effects that didn’t depend on kinase activity.

The parameters for the full scan MS were: resolution of 70,000 across 350–2000 <italic>m/z</italic>, AGC 3e<sup>6</sup>, and maximum IT 50 ms. The full MS scan was followed by MS/MS for the top 10 precursor ions in each cycle with a NCE of 28 and dynamic exclusion of 30 s. Raw mass spectral data files (.raw) were searched using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo) and Mascot version 2.4.1 (Matrix Science). Mascot search parameters were: 10 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ions; 15 mmu for fragment ion mass tolerance; 2 missed cleavages of trypsin; fixed modification were carbamidomethylation of cysteine and TMT 6plex modification of lysines and peptide N–termini; variable modifications were methionine oxidation, tyrosine phosphorylation, and serine/threonine phosphorylation. TMT quantification was obtained using Proteome Discoverer and isotopically corrected per manufacturer’s instructions, and were normalized to the mean of each TMT channel. Only peptides with a Mascot score greater than or equal to 25 and an isolation interference less than or equal to 30 were included in the data analysis. Mascot peptide identifications, phosphorylation site assignments, and quantification were verified manually with the assistance of CAMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Curran et al., 2013</xref>). Phosphorylation sites were assigned based on having an average enrichment of &gt;4–fold in the Ime2–treated samples compared to control samples.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Angelika Amon, Iain Cheeseman, Audra Amasino, Ishara Azmi, Caitlin Blank, and Annie Zhang for comments on the manuscript.

The authors elucidate several distinct mechanisms which inhibit replication initiation between two consecutive meiotic nuclear divisions (MI and MII). In mitotically dividing cells, oscillation of CDK ensures that replication origins fire once per cell cycle: MCM helicase loading occurs when the cellular CDK level is low, and MCM is activated while loading is prevented when CDK level is high. In meiosis, the CDK level drops once at the MI to MII transition, but replication initiation does not occur. In frog oocyte extracts, addition of a CDK inhibitor promotes S phase between MI and MII, and in yeast simultaneous inhibition of CDK and Ime2 (a meiosis specific kinase related to CDK) leads to nuclear accumulation of an MCM protein during nuclear division stages. Thus, it is suggested that the two kinases function to prevent replication initiation when MCM associates to replication origins. But it was not known precisely how these two kinases do so.</p><p>The authors employed a previously developed system to synchronize meiosis progression in which they use a yeast strain with inducible Ndt80 (a transcription factor that triggers exit from meiotic prophase). This strain arrests in meiotic prophase and resumes progression upon Ndt80 induction. Using this system, authors found that MCM ChIP signals at replication origins are decreased after the release from prophase arrest and that either CDK or Ime2 activity is required to keep MCM ChIP signal at a low level. Results of an in vitro MCM loading assay demonstrate that Ime2 and CDK prevent MCM loading by phosphorylating both overlapping and distinct targets. Furthermore, during nuclear meiotic division stages, CDK and Ime2 repress Cdc6 (a protein that recruits MCM to origins) in part by phosphorylating Cdc6 within phospho-degron domains, and Sld2 (an MCM activator) degradation is dependent on phosphorylation sites for CDK and Cdc5 (the polo-like kinase).</p><p>This elegant paper provides detailed mechanistic insight into how replication is inhibited at the MI-MII transition stage in meiosis. The data are excellent and the paper is very well written. The paper is highly appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there are a few areas that should be addressed to strengthen the paper.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) The dephosphorylation of Orc2 and Orc6 are very subtle and it is not clear if there is &quot;a partial but detectable reversal of ORC inhibition&quot; since the authors do not know if partial dephosphorylation is sufficient for reversing inhibition of ORC function. This statement should be qualified.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. The amount of Ime1 kinase that inhibits Mcm207 loading is near stoichiometric with the pre-RC assembly proteins. Similarly, the kinase assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref> suggests stoichiometric phosphorylation. These data might suggest that like CDK, Ime2 binds one or more of the pre-RC proteins. Has this been tested?</p><p>3) A rather obvious question is whether DNA re-replication does in fact occur when the mechanisms delineated here are compromised. Have the authors tried to see if replication occurs when CDK and Ime2 are artificially oscillated by inhibition followed by washing out of the inhibitors in the non-phosphorylatable sld2 mutant background? The discussion point about Cdc7-Dbf4 regulation raises the possibility of yet other mechanisms to inhibit re-replication, but it would strengthen the paper to test just how redundant these mechanisms are.</p><p>4) Please show representative micrographs to illustrate the cell cycle staging. This could be provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> (would not be needed for all).</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and C. No negative control is presented to evaluate ChIP signal specificity. This is more important for the ORC ChIP, but would have been good to show for MCM as well. Also, it would be better if the y-axis in this and other ChIP plots showed efficiency (% of input), rather than the max-normalized value (arbitrary units).</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B and D</xref>. Experiments here and elsewhere were conducted in an artificially synchronized meiosis using inducible Ndt80. Normally, the pachytene checkpoint monitors failures in homologous recombination and chromosome synapsis, and inhibits NDT80 expression until the checkpoint is satisfied. But even in wild-type meiosis, normal recombination processes delay Ndt80 activation to prevent premature meiotic entry. Thus, it is important to consider that the artificial synchrony system allows for cells to be driven out of prophase before they have completed recombination and other events. Normally, the majority of cells have completed prophase by 6 hr after the induction of sporulation. However, the sporulation is intrinsically variable. In the case of cells that are progressing somewhat slowly, &quot;premature&quot; induction of Ndt80 could cause a substantial number of achiasmate chromosomes, which would lead to activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. This could be problematic especially when the next manipulations take place within a fixed time interval. Such a scenario perhaps explains why a lower fraction of cells completed MI in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B and D</xref>. If possible, it might be useful to supplement or replace these data with better cultures or with cultures synchronized with an alternative method (e.g., pCUP1-IME4/IME4 strain or cdc7-as inhibition followed by inhibitor washout). At the least, it is not appropriate to claim the 7h45' time point as MI-MII, since nearly half of the cells are still in metaphase I, so the text should be modified accordingly.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> needs to be bolstered with additional data. The western signals need to be normalized to input control, for which Ponceau staining is probably sub-optimal. A dilution series to demonstrate linearity of the western blot quantification is needed (can be supplemental). There are no error bars on this experiment; how many times was this repeated?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33309.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] This elegant paper provides detailed mechanistic insight into how replication is inhibited at the MI-MII transition stage in meiosis.

Because this is a stable complex containing all the components required for helicase loading we felt this was the best test for Ime2 binding. In contrast to a model in which Ime2 inhibits helicase loading through binding to helicase-loading proteins, we found that Ime2 did not stoichiometrically bind to these proteins in this experimental condition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We realize that this does not exclude binding of Ime2 to these proteins at other times in the reaction. On the other hand, we show that Ime2-mediated inhibition of helicase loading is completely dependent on its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating that any potential role for Ime2-binding to its substrates is not sufficient for inhibition.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33309.030</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>OCCM Formation Assay.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33309-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A rather obvious question is whether DNA re-replication does in fact occur when the mechanisms delineated here are compromised.

Unfortunately, we found that inhibition of Cdk1-as during meiosis followed by washing away the inhibitor does not allow Cdk1-as to be reactivated. These results are consistent with previous experiments showing that transient inhibition of Cdk1-as at any point during meiosis caused cells to be unable to progress any further in meiosis (Holt et al., 2007 – see Discussion). Like Holt et al., we believe that these data suggest a requirement for basal CDK activity during meiosis. It is possible that complete CDK inhibition allows for Sic1 to accumulate preventing CDK reactivation upon inhibitor washout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please show representative micrographs to illustrate the cell cycle staging.

We specifically highlight the percentage of cells in anaphase I and acknowledge in the text that not all cells are at this stage of meiosis (first paragraph of the aforementioned subsection). We focus on these cells because anaphase I is good marker for cells as CDK activity decreases upon entry into the MI-MII transition. Two pieces of evidence support this claim. First, previous work demonstrated that Cdk1-cyclin B complexes have decreased activity in anaphase I relative to metaphase I (Carlile and Amon, 2008). Second, the peak of anaphase I corresponds with the decreased ORC phosphorylation and the beginning of Cdc6 reaccumulation we observe in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, markers of decreased CDK activity. We note that it is likely that CDK, and potentially Ime2, inhibits helicase loading throughout the meiotic divisions and not just at the MIMII transition. Thus, the fact that we see helicase reloading at any time during the meiotic divisions (there is little doubt that the majority of the cells have at least entered MI) strongly supports our primary conclusion: that the two kinases both contribute to inhibiting helicase loading.</p><p>The order of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and 2 have been switched from the previously submitted version to account for changes in the text.</p><p>With regard to why fewer cells have completed MI in the current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref> and 1D relative to 1A and 1C of the same figure, this difference is because CDK has been inhibited in the 1B and 1D cultures but not in the other two cultures. CDK is required for progression through MI, and thus its inhibition prevents MI completion in a large proportion of cells. We have now included immunofluorescence quantification from an 8h30min time point from these same cultures that was not treated with the kinase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This data shows that &gt;85% of cells have completed MI at this time point in all four cultures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> needs to be bolstered with additional data. The western signals need to be normalized to input control, for which Ponceau staining is probably sub-optimal. A dilution series to demonstrate linearity of the western blot quantification is needed (can be supplemental). There are no error bars on this experiment; how many times was this repeated?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewers’ concern with the data in this form. We generally prefer Ponceau staining over an individual protein since monitoring many proteins as opposed to just PGK1 make the normalization less dependent on the stable expression of one protein. However, we do understand that it is more difficult to quantify the Ponceau staining. Thus, we have now normalized our western signals to a PGK1 loading control and found the same results. This experiment has now been repeated three times, and we report the mean and standard deviation from these three experiments. The text has been modified to reflect the quantification shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> (subsection “Cdc5 and CDK promote the degradation of Sld2, an essential helicase- activation protein”, last paragraph). We have also included a dilution series to show that the western blot quantification is accurate within a factor of two across a 32-fold dilution range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
