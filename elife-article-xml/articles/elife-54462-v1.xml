widespread behaviour that integrates across many traits. The European blackcap exhibits enormous variation in migration and is renowned for research on its evolution and genetic basis. We assembled a reference genome for blackcaps and obtained whole genome resequencing data from individuals across its breeding range. Analyses of population structure and demography suggested divergence began ~30,000 ya, with evidence for one admixture event between migrant and resident continent birds ~5000 ya. The propensity to migrate, orientation and distance of migration all map to a small number of genomic regions that do not overlap with results from other species, suggesting that there are multiple ways to generate variation in migration. Strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were located in regulatory regions of candidate genes that may serve as major regulators of the migratory syndrome. Evidence for selection on shared variation was documented, providing a mechanism by which rapid changes may evolve.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every year as the seasons change, thousands of animals migrate huge distances in search of food or better climates. As far as migrations go, there might be none so impressive as the trans-oceanic flights made by small migrating songbirds. These birds can weigh as little as three grams and travel up to 15,000 kilometres. Most migrate alone and at night and yet still manage to return to the same location each year. Several strands of research suggest there could be a genetic basis to their migratory behaviour, but exactly which genes control this phenomenon remains poorly understood.</p><p>One small songbird that has been studied for decades is the European blackcap. This species exhibits a real variety of migration patterns. Some blackcaps travel rather short distances, others much further, and some populations do not migrate at all. Populations that share the same breeding grounds in the summer may migrate in different directions in the autumn. These features make it a good species to study the genetic variation between populations that migrate in different directions and over different distances. However, only in recent years has advancing technology made it possible to comprehensively study an animal’s entire genome, leaving no gene unturned.</p><p>Now, Delmore et al. have used high-throughput sequencing technologies to trace the evolutionary history of migration in European blackcap and started by assembling a reference genome for the species. Then, the genomes of 110 blackcaps from several populations that take different annual migrations were compared to the reference. This revealed that the populations began to diverge some 30,000 years ago and that there was some apparent gene mixing between groups of migrating and resident blackcaps around 5,000 years ago. The analysis showed only a small set of genes code for their differences in migration. Additionally, while the candidate genes were shown to be common among blackcaps, the genes identified did not match those reported from studies of other migrating songbirds. Finally, Delmore et al. also noted that the differences between the populations tend to be in the parts of the genome that control whether a given gene is switched on or off, which could explain how new migratory behaviours can rapidly evolve.</p><p>This study is one of the most comprehensive genomic analysis of migration to date. It is important work as songbirds, like other animals, are responding to increasing pressures of environmental and climate change. In time, the findings could be used to support conservation efforts whereby genetic analyses could determine if certain populations possess enough variation to respond to coming changes in their habitats.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>behaviour</kwd><kwd>bird</kwd><kwd>population structure</kwd><kwd>demography</kwd><kwd>genomic architecture</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PDF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delmore</surname><given-names>Kira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MPRG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liedvogel</surname><given-names>Miriam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Regional Government of Asturias</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRUPIN: IDI/2018/000151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Illera</surname><given-names>Juan Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Variation in migration can evolve rapidly and traits that comprise this behaviour may be determined by standing variation at a few regulatory regions that are not common across taxonomic groups.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bird migration is a fascinating and highly variable behaviour that integrates many traits – morphological, physiological and behavioural. Research on a wide range of species has provided important insight into this behaviour, from the incredible distances that birds cover during their journeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alerstam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Egevang et al., 2010</xref>), to the fine-tuned and precisely controlled timing of migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gwinner and Helm, 2003</xref>) and the fascinating sensory modalities that allow birds to navigate with amazing precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mouritsen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wiltschko and Wiltschko, 1972</xref>). The European blackcap <italic>Sylvia atricapilla</italic> is an iconic migratory species that is well suited to work on the genetics of migration. Blackcaps exhibit dramatic differences in migratory behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), spanning the entire spectrum from exclusively migratory populations in the northern portion of their range to short distance and partially migratory populations in the Mediterranean; non-migratory, or resident, populations occur on both the European continent (Iberian Peninsula) and the Atlantic islands. In addition to variation in the propensity to migrate and the distance covered, blackcaps vary in migratory orientation, with a migratory divide (contact zone between populations that breed adjacent to one another but take different migratory routes) occurring between populations that migrate southwest (SW) and southeast (SE) from their breeding grounds in Central Europe in the autumn. A novel migratory route also evolved very recently in this species, with an increasing number of birds migrating northwest (NW) from the Central European breeding grounds in the autumn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cramp, 1992</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sampling design and population structure.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Sampling sites and migratory phenotypes.

Common garden experiments showed that selectively bred individuals that were reared in isolation from their parents maintain population-specific behaviour, suggesting that there is a genetic component to migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Helbig, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Helbig et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Helbig, 1991a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berthold and Querner, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pulido and Berthold, 2010</xref>). F<sub>1</sub> hybrids crossbred between populations that differ in migratory traits exhibited intermediate phenotypes (orientation, distance and propensity to migrate), suggesting that these traits are additively inherited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berthold and Querner, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pulido and Berthold, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Helbig, 1991b</xref>). Further work with F<sub>2</sub> hybrids showed a wider distribution of phenotypes and the recovery of parental phenotypes, indicative of traits that are controlled by only a few major genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Helbig, 1996</xref>), and selection experiments mating birds according to migratory status showed that the transition between resident and migratory behaviour can occur in just a few generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pulido et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berthold et al., 1990</xref>). The rapidity with which migratory behaviour can evolve has been supported in natural populations; the NW route taken by some birds was only established in the past 70 years and probably in response to increased food availability during the winter in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berthold et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>The blackcap has also been the subject of extensive phylogeographic study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pérez-Tris et al. (2004)</xref> used mitochondrial (control) data from 241 birds and 12 populations across the entire breeding range to show that migratory variation in this species arose recently (4,000–13,000 years ago [ya]) and has not yet resulted in significant population differentiation. These results could suggest that the genes that control migratory variation have small effect sizes or are restricted to a small portion of the genome. The only populations showing substantial genetic differentiation occurred in the Central European migratory divide (i.e., between SW and SE migrants), indicating that differences in orientation may help to maintain population differentiation. Resident populations showed evidence of historical bottlenecks followed by sudden expansions, suggesting that blackcaps lost their ability to migrate after secondary colonization of mild areas in southern Europe and on the Atlantic islands. This finding was supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Voelker and Light (2011)</xref> who used mitochondrial (ND2 and cytb) data to reconstruct ancestral states within the genus <italic>Sylvia</italic>. Limited genetic differentiation between blackcaps was also documented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dietzen et al. (2008)</xref> using mitochondrial (cytb) data; these authors also estimated dates for the colonization of Atlantic islands and for an earlier colonisation of the Canary Islands (the latter occurring 300,000–3,000,000 ya vs. 4,000–40,000 ya for colonisation of other islands including the Azores and Cape Verde).</p><p>The phylogeographic studies described above provided important insight into the evolution of migration in blackcaps and other temperate species more generally. When these studies and experimental work are considered together, the thorough set of studies conducted on blackcap migration is arguably unequalled in other species. Surprisingly, these classic experiments and molecular marker-based approaches have been followed by a dearth of genetic work on migration in blackcaps. Here, we leverage our knowledge of this excellent study system by using high-throughput sequencing techniques to provide the first genome-wide characterization of the blackcap. The major objectives of this study were to assemble a high-quality reference genome de novo, and to use whole genome resequencing data from 110 blackcaps (including birds from each migratory phenotype and encompassing the entire breeding range, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) to (1) examine population structure and demography in this system, and (2) study the genetic basis of three migratory traits in unison: the propensity to migrate, migratory distance and orientation.</p><p>Analyses of population structure and demography revealed novel insights that are important for understanding both the evolutionary history of migration in blackcaps and the underlying genetics of this behaviour. A small number of studies on the genomics of migration have been conducted in songbirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delmore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lundberg et al., 2017</xref>). We compare our results to theirs, evaluating a long held hypothesis of a common genetic basis to migratory behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liedvogel et al., 2011</xref>). Our results are not only relevant to understanding the genetics of migration in the blackcap. Data on the genetics of complex behaviours is at a premium in the evolutionary literature, which has focused primarily on morphological traits, and migration probably plays an important role in the early stages of speciation in many systems. Our results will speak to the genetic basis of this process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Assembly of a high-quality draft reference genome</title><p>We used whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and an optical map (Illumina and Bionano Irys technology, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>) to de novo assemble a hybrid reference genome for the blackcap (BioProject number PRJNA545868; Guojie Zhang, personal communication). The final genome is 1.02 Gb in length, comprised of only 96 scaffolds and has a large N<sub>50</sub> scaffold length of 22 Mb. Ninety scaffolds mapped to the collared flycatcher <italic>Ficedula albicollis</italic> genome (average three scaffolds/chromosome; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) and our annotation strategy, which used both in silico and evidence-based approaches, identified 17,982 protein-coding genes. Results from BUSCO and an analysis of UCEs (ultra-conserved elements) suggest that our reference is nearly complete, with 92% of single-copy orthologues unique to birds and 97% of UCEs identified in amniotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Faircloth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Population structure and demography</title><p>We aligned WGS data from 110 blackcaps (including the two birds used in our assembly) to this reference (average coverage 17.5x, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) and estimated genotype likelihoods at genome-wide <underline>single nucleotide polymorphisms</underline> (SNPs). Genomic differentiation was low between migratory populations of different distances and orientations, but unlike earlier work using mitochondrial data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pérez-Tris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dietzen et al., 2008</xref>), we documented considerable differentiation between migrant and resident populations on both the continent and islands. A PCA separated resident island birds from continental populations on PC1, and resident continental birds from migrants on PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Migrants were not clearly distinguished on either PC (we obtained the same result when we re-ran the PCA excluding islands; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Results from an ADMIXTURE analysis and estimates of <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> confirm this pattern. At a cluster value of two, ADMIXTURE distinguished between island and continental birds (similar to PC1). At a cluster value of three, populations on the continent were further divided into resident and migratory groups (similar to PC2), and resident island and continent birds showed some admixture with the migratory group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). No further structure was observed beyond these three clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Estimates of <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> ranged from 0.018 to 0.11, with the highest estimates occurring between migrants and both resident groups (0.06–0.11 for islands, 0.042–0.05 for continent residents; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Evidence for limited population differentiation combined with dramatic differences in the migratory behaviour of blackcaps is ideal for identifying genomic regions that are associated with this focal trait. Specifically, genomic regions associated with migration should standout against this backdrop of limited differentiation, although analyses involving residents will need to account for elevated values of differentiation.</p><p>A phylogeographic analysis using mitochondrial data suggested that variation in migratory behaviour evolved recently, 4000–13,000 ya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pérez-Tris et al., 2004</xref>). Our results move this date further back in time, to 30,000 ya and the start of the last glacial maximum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2009</xref>). Specifically, we used multiple sequentially Markovian coalescent (MSMC, implemented in MSMC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schiffels and Durbin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Malaspinas et al., 2016</xref>) to characterize the demographic history of blackcaps. The demographic trajectories of migratory, resident continent and resident island birds began to diverge ~30,000 ya. The effective population size of migrant and resident island populations expanded and contracted, respectively, while continental residents exhibited a relatively constant effective population size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Relative cross-coalescence rates (CCR) between all three groups exhibited a concomitant drop ~30,000 ya (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The drop of relative CCR between migratory and resident island populations was steeper than that between migratory and resident continent populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), suggesting that genetic separation following the colonization of islands resulted in greater separation than that between continental populations of migrants and residents. Increased differentiation between migrants and resident island birds (vs. resident continent birds) was also documented in our PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Results for medium-distance migrants (NW, SW and SE) and long-distance migrants are indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Demographic history.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Effective population size by time estimated by MSMC2 using five individuals per blackcap phenotype.

Specifically, the relative CCR between migrant and resident continent populations started to increase at ~5000 ya (~25,000 years after initial divergence; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This admixture event may reflect secondary contact between migrant and resident continent populations and is line with our results from ADMIXUTRE, with admixture documented between these groups at a cluster value of three. The last glacial maximum ended ~19,000–11,500 ya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2009</xref>). After this time, populations would have expanded out of their glacial refugia, and perhaps migrant and resident continent populations came into secondary contact ~5000 years after these expansions began. Similar to our results on population differentiation, island populations exhibit their own evolutionary trajectories following divergence. This result is in line with results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dietzen et al. (2008)</xref>, who suggested that at least one separate colonization to the Atlantic islands occurred (earlier than that to the Canaries).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Genetic basis of migratory traits</title><p>Here, we transition to study local patterns of genomic differentiation, identifying specific genomic regions that have signatures of selection related to three phenotypes: the propensity to migrate, orientation of migration and distance of migration (resident continent, short distance SW, medium distance NW, SW, SE and long distance SE populations). We excluded resident island birds from these analyses (because of limited sample size [n = 5] and potential effects from founder events) and focused on a single resident continent population (Gibraltar, we obtained similar results using Cazalla de la Sierra, total number of birds included in these analyses = 82, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><p>Positive selection was more common in residents and limited to a few, small genomic regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1a</xref>). For example, hapFLK is a tree-based method that controls for hierarchical population structure. Global and local NJ trees are constructed using haplotype frequencies and regions under selection show longer branch lengths. Only nine regions were found to be under selection (permutation test, see 'Materials and methods') according to this method, and six of these appeared in residents. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> shows estimates of hapFLK for the entire genome, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> exemplifies one region on Super-Scaffold 99 (syntenic with flycatcher chromosome 3).

2010</xref>) and the number of segregating sites by length (nSL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferrer-Admetlla et al., 2014</xref>). PBS is an <italic>F<sub>ST</sub>-</italic>based statistic that estimates allele frequency differences between three or more populations. This parameter can be elevated by linked purifying selection (or background selection) within populations that is unrelated to positive selection (in our case selection related to migration). We removed these confounding effects by scaling PBS and subtracting the maximum value of PBS in orthologous windows from that in the non-focal population (hereafter ‘ΔPBS’, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vijay et al., 2017</xref>). nSL is a haplotype-based statistic that focuses on patterns within populations, using segregating sites to measure the length of haplotypes. Linked selection should increase haplotype lengths at genomic regions that are under positive selection. Eight of the nine regions identified by hapFLK also exhibited extreme values of ΔPBS and nSL (in the top 1% of the distribution) in the same population as that identified by hapFLK (ΔPBS <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> for resident birds [estimates for short distance SW, medium distance SE, SW, NW, and long distance SE, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>]; nSL <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p><p>As noted already, population structure and linked selection can elevate differentiation between populations. We controlled for these effects using hapFLK and ΔPBS, respectively, and emphasise that genomic differentiation between populations of blackcaps is low to begin with (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). In addition, linked purifying selection would be expected to increase PBS in all populations (i.e., not just the focal population), but this is not the case. This is exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> where estimates of ΔPBS for all populations are shown but these are only elevated in the resident continent population. As a final test of population structure, we re-estimated ΔPBS using resident island birds (instead of resident continent birds). We conservatively excluded these populations from our initial analyses because their sample sizes are small and because genetic drift can affect estimates of differentiation in island populations. Nevertheless, the island populations are also resident and thus these estimates could help to validate the genomic regions that were identified as being under selection in resident populations on the continent. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1a</xref> summarizes these results, noting which genomic regions exhibited elevated values of PBS on islands. Of particular interest, PBS was elevated in all three island populations at the genomic region on Super-Scaffold 99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Combined with findings from hapFLK (controlling for population structure and relying on haplotypes), ΔPBS (controlling for linked selection and relying on SNP data) and nLS (estimated within populations and relying on haplotypes), these results provide strong evidence that this specific region contains important variation for the transition to residency, not only on the continent but also on the islands.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Estimates of ΔPBS on Super-Scaffold 99 corresponding with the region shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> (smoothed using the geom_smooth function in ggplot to summarize data in 2500-bp windows).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Estimates for resident continent, medium-distance NW, SW and SE migrants, and short- and long-distance birds.

The transition to residency is shared, probably representing one of the only shared selection pressures experienced by all of these populations. Note that the lack of consistent results for other regions under selection in the resident continent population does not preclude the potential importance of these regions as, for example, genetic drift on islands would affect which genetic variants were present on islands for selection to act on.</p><p>Our finding that only a few genomic regions under selection contain genes and that the strongly associated SNPs identified by CAVIAR are in non-coding regions could suggest that cis-regulatory changes are important for the transition from migration to residency. In support of this suggestion, an alignment of predicted mRNAs from several bird species and transcripts from a testis transcriptome of the blackcap placed two of the SNPs from CAVIAR in the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTRs) of two genes (GPR83-L on Super-Scaffold 12 and CHST4 on Super-Scaffold 13, syntenic with flycatcher chromosomes 11 and 4a, respectively). Three prime3′ UTRs can act as posttranscriptional regulators; they contain binding sides for microRNAs, which can inhibit translation or target mRNA for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mayr, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrett et al., 2012</xref>). In fact, previous work with monarch butterflies identified 55 conserved microRNAs that are differentially expressed between summer and migratory butterflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhan et al., 2011</xref>). Future analyses to validate this suggestion could include the use of qPCR to determine whether GPR83-L and/or CHST4 are in fact differentially regulated between the migratory phenotypes.</p><p>Future work using techniques aimed at identifying binding sites for transcription factors (e.g., ChIP-seq) could also be useful. We conducted a preliminary analysis here, using HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) to detect known transcription factor motifs in the genomic regions that are under selection in residents. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ruegg et al. (2014)</xref> used a literature search to identify 25 candidate genes for migration. Four of these genes are transcription factors whose motifs are in the libraries searched by HOMER: three basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (bHLH) (<italic>Clock</italic>, <italic>Npas2</italic>, and <italic>Bmal1</italic>) and one basic leucine zipper domain (<italic>Nfil3</italic>). We found a bHLH motif (GHCACGTG) on Super-Scaffolds 12 and 99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The motif on Super-Scaffold 99 is particularly interesting as there is a SNP (G/T) at the beginning of the motif that is nearly fixed in continental residents (the allele frequency for G in Asni, Gibraltar and Cazalla de la Sierra is 1, 0.85 and 0.9, respectively; <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> between Gibraltar and medium-distance NW, SW and SE migratory populations is 0.15, 0.25 and 0.44, respectively). This motif could disrupt or weaken transcription factor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kasowski et al., 2010</xref>). This is also the genomic region that showed elevated PBS in both resident continent and island populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). <italic>Clock</italic>, <italic>Npas2</italic> and <italic>Bmal1</italic> are involved in maintaining circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms synchronize circannual clocks, which are important cues controlling seasonal migratory behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gwinner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Visser et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Concerning the actual identity of genes within regions that are under selection, several have functions that could be related to the transition from migration to residency. For example, LOC100859173 (located on in the genomic region under selection on Super-Scaffold 12, the region with a bHLH motif mentioned above; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1a</xref>) has been annotated as a probable G-protein coupled receptor that mediates the function of neuropeptide Y (NPY). NPY is localized in the brain of birds and works with Agouti-related peptide (AGRP) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) to control energy balance. Specifically, NPY/AGRP neurons stimulate appetite, food intake and fat deposition, while POMC inhibits these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boswell and Dunn, 2017</xref>). It has been hypothesized that the effects of NPY may extend to seasonal changes in energy balance that are important for migration, including hyperphagia and fat deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boswell and Dunn, 2017</xref>). Beyond its role in energy balance, NPY also facilitates learning and memory via the modulation of hippocampal activity and has an effect on circadian rhythms, reproduction, and the contraction of vascular smooth muscles. It has been suggested that a common genetic mechanism or major regulator may control migratory traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liedvogel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liedvogel and Lundberg, 2014</xref>). A protein such as NPY, or the transcription factors that bind the bHLH motif identified in the prior analysis, could fill this role.</p><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>Analysis focused on migratory orientation and distance</title><p>So far, we have considered all three migratory traits exhibited by blackcaps together (propensity, orientation and distance) and our results relate mostly to residents. The elevated population differentiation that we noted between resident and migratory birds could reduce our power to identify selection that is specific to migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fariello et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, we ran a second set of analyses excluding resident birds and examining migratory orientation and distance independently. Starting with orientation and limiting our analysis to medium-distance migrants with varying orientations (medium-distance NW, SW and SE migrants, total number of birds included in these analyses = 54, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), hapFLK identified only six regions that are under positive selection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1b</xref>).

For example, SDC1 is a region on Super-Scaffold_17 that is under selection in NW migrants. This gene codes for a transmembrane protein that helps to regulate the Wnt signalling pathway. This pathway plays a role in embryonic development and has been shown to influence feather and beak morphogenesis, along with feather molt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mallarino et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhullar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Widelitz, 2008</xref>). NW migrants have rounder wings and more narrow beaks than southern migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rolshausen et al., 2009</xref>). Differences in the timing of migration probably mean that birds also molt at different times. This has not been evaluated directly in comparisons between migrants, but variation in molt patterns have been documented between NW migrants and birds that are resident on the continent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de la Hera et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Two previous studies attempted to identify de novo genomic regions under selection related to differences in orientation: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Delmore and Liedvogel (2016)</xref> with Swainson’s thrushes (<italic>Catharus ustulatus</italic>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lundberg et al.

It is tempting to suggest that migration may be controlled by similar genes across broad taxonomic scales, with early results from candidate genes (e.g., the poly-glutamine repeat in <italic>Clock</italic>) showing consistent results across groups as divergent as insects, fishes and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Delmore and Liedvogel, 2016</xref>).

This is an important finding as it has long been hypothesized that there may be a shared genetic mechanism for migration, not only in birds but also in other taxonomic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liedvogel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liedvogel and Lundberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liedvogel and Delmore, 2018</xref>).</p><p>None of the regions identified by hapFLK and PBS were fixed for alternate haplotypes or alleles. This fact is evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, in which the regions under selection still include haplotypes from a different cluster, and it could suggest that selection is acting on shared genetic variation (i.e., variation that is already present in the population rather than newly derived mutations). The idea that transitions between migratory phenotypes have been facilitated by shared genetic variation has been around for quite some time in the blackcap literature, particularly as rapid transitions have been observed and include the evolution of a new NW migratory route in the past 70 years. Shared variation can facilitate these rapid changes as these variants are already present in the population and have been tested by selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrett and Schluter, 2008</xref>). The fact that regions under selection are quite narrow (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) also supports a role for shared genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrett and Schluter, 2008</xref>) and we provide further evidence below.</p><p>First, we estimated the genetic distance between one haplotype in each cluster and an ancestral sequence that we derived using WGS from the two most closely related sister taxa, hill babbler (<italic>Pseudoalcippe abyssinica</italic>, an African resident) and garden warbler (<italic>Sylvia borin</italic>, a long distance migrant) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Voelker and Light, 2011</xref>). Using the region on Super-Scaffold 73 that shows selection in NW migrants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), we predicted that if haplotypes in the light blue cluster were present in the population already, they should exhibit similar levels of divergence from the ancestral sequence as haplotypes from all other clusters. This is precisely what we found; genetic distance from the ancestral sequence was similar for haplotypes from all clusters (181 differences for the NW haplotype vs. 178, 179 and 181 [x3] and 182 differences in the rest). We reran this analysis limiting our data to synonymous substitutions in predicted coding regions (i.e., those that are likely to be evolving neutrally and located in ATG2B and BDKDB) and obtained similar results. Specifically, we identified six synonymous substitutions between all three medium-distance migrant populations and both garden warblers and hill babblers, suggesting that there is no difference in the age of these haplotypes.</p><p>To follow up on the former analysis, we constructed a maximum likelihood (ML) tree using sequence data from the region under selection on Super-Scaffold 73. We built this tree using data from all continental blackcaps, garden warblers, and hill babblers, using the willow warbler as an outgroup, and compared this tree to a consensus tree summarizing ML trees constructed for each scaffold in the blackcap reference genome (i.e., a tree built using genome-wide data; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Supporting previous phylogenetic work in the system, garden warblers and hill babblers formed a sister clade to blackcaps in the consensus tree, and relationships among blackcaps were largely unresolved. By contrast, garden warblers were more closely related to blackcaps than were hill babblers in the tree built using data from the region on Super-Scaffold 73 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). In addition, the medium-distance NW population (in which positive selection is acting in this particular region) occurs at the base of the blackcap clade. Recall that garden warblers are obligate migrants whereas hill babblers are residents, supporting the suggestion that haplotypes favoured in the NW phenotype were already present in the population before divergence, perhaps even in ancestral populations. Unfortunately we do not have data from any closely related species to determine how old this haplotype is (i.e., if it is older than the split between garden warblers, hill babblers and blackcaps sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colosimo et al., 2005</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Evidence for the use of shared variation on Super-Scaffold 73.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A rooted extended majority rule consensus tree summarizing maximum likelihood (ML) trees constructed for all scaffolds in the blackcap reference genome (96 scaffolds).

By contrast, the SFS of Super-Scaffold 73 shows an excess of mid-frequency alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Greater variance in SFSs are expected when selection makes use of standing variation because alleles have been recombining onto different backgrounds in ancestral populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Przeworski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pennings and Hermisson, 2006</xref>).</p><p>We conclude our study by examining the genetic architecture of migratory distance. We included all migrants in this analysis, quantified migratory distance as an ordinal variable from short- (1), to medium- (2), to long-distance (3) migrants, and used a Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model (BSLMM, 87) to identify SNPs that are associated with migratory distance (total number of birds included in these analyses = 72, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). BSLMMs are a form of genome-wide association analysis that includes a term for other factors that influence the phenotype and are correlated with genotype (e.g., population structure and ancestry; a kinship matrix based on genome-wide SNP data) and can be used to estimate both the combined effects of multiple SNPs and the effects of SNPs on their own.</p><p>Our results suggest that a large percentage of variance in migratory distance can be explained by our SNP set (PVE = 0.90 ± 0.28), but only one SNP showed a strong association with this focal trait (posterior inclusion probability &gt;0.01). This SNP is located on Super-Scaffold 79, occurs in an area of elevated <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> between long- and short-distance migrants (<italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> = 0.31, in 0.018 percentile <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> values) and is 627-bp downstream from the gene KCNIP1, which encodes a potassium channel interacting protein (major determinants of neuronal cell excitability). Combined with the haplotype identified in the hapFLK analysis, which provides a signature of positive selection in short-distance migrants on Super-Scaffold 17 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1a</xref>), these loci represent good candidates for controlling migratory distance, but future analyses with a larger sample size are needed to confirm the robustness of this finding. Direct information on migratory distance could also inform this analysis by allowing us to code the phenotype as continuous.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Early research on blackcaps was pivotal for demonstrating the existence of a genetic basis of migration and studying its evolution. This is due in large part to the tractability of this species and its variability in migratory behaviour. Here, we have expanded this study system beyond phenotypic and marker-based approaches, launching it into the genomic era and conducting one of the most comprehensive genome-wide analyses of migration to date. Populations of blackcaps began to diverge ~30,000 years ago, but differentiation remains low between migratory populations. There is evidence for past gene flow between migratory and resident populations on the European continent but comparison of the contemporary structure of these populations suggests that gene flow may be limited. This is certainly the case for resident island birds. It has been suggested that one single genetic mechanism controls migratory traits and may be shared across broad taxonomic groups. We do not find evidence for one common genetic mechanism across species here, and no protein-coding change is shared across the three focal traits (propensity, distance and orientation) that we examined in unison. Future work on gene expression may identify major regulators that control multiple migratory traits, and both NPY and bHLH transcription factors are good candidates. Combined with the additional results that we presented here (such as the importance of standing genetic variation), this information is vital for understanding how predictable the evolution of migration and other complex behavioural traits may be.</p><p>Blackcaps have not only been relevant to work on the evolution and genetics of migration. Early work in this system suggested that differences in migration might serve as reproductive isolating barriers early in speciation. For example, hybrids were shown to exhibit intermediate orientation behaviour that was predicted to be inferior because it would bring hybrids over large ecological barriers that pure forms avoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Helbig, 1991b</xref>). More recently, it was shown that NW migrants arrive on the breeding grounds earlier than SW migrants, and that these birds mate assortatively on the basis of arrival time, helping to reduce gene flow between phenotypically distinct groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bearhop et al., 2005</xref>). The role of migration in speciation has gained considerable traction in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rolshausen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bearhop et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Irwin and Irwin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rohwer and Irwin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Turbek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delmore and Irwin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bensch et al., 2009</xref>) and results from our study suggest that selection at a very small number of loci may be sufficient to initiate reductions in gene flow very early in the process of population differentiation and speciation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Genome assembly</title><p>Blood samples from two male blackcaps from the Mooswald breeding population at Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, classified as medium-distance SW migrants (on the basis of morphometrics and isotope signatures) were used to assemble the reference genome.

Briefly, genomic DNA from one individual was used to sequence Illumina sequencing libraries (fragment and mate pair libraries with insert sizes of 2, 5 and 10 kb). 275.9 Gb of raw high throughput sequence (HTS) data were generated and assembled using ALLPATHS-LG. This assembly was improved several ways (e.g., by removing duplicates and closing gaps). DNA from the second individual was used to generate two BioNano optical maps (one using BspQI and the other BssSI). These maps were used to super-scaffold HTS scaffolds.

Population phenotype was scored on the basis of morphometry, stable isotope signature and/or ringing-recovery data from selected individuals (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> for a description of how each population was phenotyped).

Specifically, we randomly shuffled population labels 100 times, re-estimated hapFLK and p-values, recorded the lowest p-value for each randomization and set the threshold to the fifth percentile across randomizations. Once these regions were identified, we determined which population was experiencing selection by comparing branch lengths for a tree built using data from the entire genome and one built using data from the region under selection. Note that results from analyses using medium-distance migrants are plotted using the resident phenotype for illustrative purposes, but the analysis was not run using these birds.</p><p>We include birds from three resident continent populations – Cazalla de la Sierra and Gibraltar in the Iberian Peninsula along with Asni in Morocco (only three birds were sampled from this African population, precluding its use in the present analysis; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The Iberian Peninsula where the other two populations are found is highly heterogeneous as a result of the effects of mountains and plateaus that create variation in seasonality and, consequently, in the intensity of blackcap migratory behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pérez-Tris and Tellería, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tellería et al., 2001</xref>). There is also some evidence in our PCA to show that this heterogeneity has led to some differentiation between populations, as birds from Cazalla de la Sierra exhibit values more similar to migrants on PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Accordingly, to avoid any confounding effects from population structure, we limited our analysis to birds from Gibraltar. Results using Cazalla de la Sierra instead were very similar. For example, all of the genomic regions identified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1b</xref> were also in the top 1% of the ΔPBS distribution when Cazalla de la Sierra was used as the continental reference population instead of Gibraltar.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>CAVIAR</title><p>The principle described above for hapFLK focusing on haplotype clusters can also be applied to SNPs (FLK). We used results from an analysis with FLK and limited to genomic regions, which showed evidence of positive selection from hapFLK, to identify independent strongly associated SNPs with CAVIAR (CAusal Variants Identification in Associated Regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hormozdiari et al., 2014</xref>]). CAVIAR was originally designed to identify independent causal SNPs in GWAS studies. We followed methods described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rochus et al. (2018)</xref> to modify this method for FLK, identifying SNPs with p-values &lt;0.0001 in hapFLK outlier regions and using a correlation matrix generated by FLK by decomposing signals into loading on orthogonal components (vs. p-values from a GWAS and LD as is traditionally done with CAVIAR).</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Δ PBS</title><p>We used a modified version of PBS (Population Branch Statistic) to complement results from hapFLK. PBS is similar to <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic>, but can include more than two populations and identifies regions within each population that exhibit differences in allele frequencies. This statistic was originally designed for three populations, but can be expanded to include more populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhan et al., 2014</xref>). We used GL from ANGSD to obtain estimates of <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> following the procedure described above (summarized into windows of 2500 kb) and used the equation below to estimate PBS from these values. This equation is an example that was applied to resident populations (R), where T is log transformed <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> between the populations indicated in exponents:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>-</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>-</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Recent papers have noted that <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> can be elevated by reductions in within-population variation alone and that there are many factors that can reduce variation within populations, including linked selection in areas of reduced recombination that may result from purifying selection (background selection, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cruickshank and Hahn, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Noor and Bennett, 2009</xref>]). It is unlikely that this process affects our results because recombination rate should elevate estimates of PBS in all populations, but this is not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Regardless, we followed methods from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vijay et al. (2017)</xref> to reduce any effects that linked selection may have on our results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vijay et al. (2017)</xref> used estimates of <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> between allopatric populations of crows that did not differ in their trait of interest to control for the effects of linked selection, estimating the difference in estimates of <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> in focal populations and maximum <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> in non-focal allopatric populations (ΔFST). <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> in focal populations would have to extend beyond that in non-focal populations to be considered important in generating the trait of interest. We used the same approach for PBS. For example, ΔPBS for resident continent populations was estimated by finding the difference between PBS in residents and maximum PBS in medium-, short- and long-distance migrants.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>nSL</title><p>The former analyses (hapFLK and PBS) rely on comparisons between phenotypes. In this last analysis, we focus on the affects that selection can have within a population instead. Specifically, selective sweeps can reduce variation at both the locus under selection and its neighbours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Smith and Haigh, 1974</xref>). Local reductions in variation result in the presence of extended regions of haplotype homozygosity within phenotypes (long haplotypes at high frequency). nSL (number of segregating sites by length) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferrer-Admetlla et al., 2014</xref>) is similar to the more common iHS, but instead of measuring the decay of haplotype identity as a function of recombination distance, it quantifies this decay of how many mutations remain in other haplotypes present in the dataset. In this way, nSL does not require a genetic map and is more robust to variation in not only recombination rate but also mutation rate.</p><p>For this analysis, we used selscan (v.1.20a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/szpiech/selscan">https://github.com/szpiech/selscan</ext-link>) and the same vcf used in hapFLK, but split by phenotype (and scaffold). We ran the data through fastPHASE first to phase haplotypes (using 50 iterations of the EM algorithm, sampling 100 haplotypes from the posterior distribution and using same number of clusters identified for hapFLK). We normalized estimates of nSL into the same 2500-kb windows used for PBS.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Regulatory variants</title><p>Two sets of preliminary analyses were used to identify regulatory SNPs in the regions identified by hapFLK and PBS as being under selection. First, we focused on 3′ UTRs, downloading predicted mRNAs from Ensembl and NCBI for several bird species, including the Atlantic canary, White-throated sparrow, American crow, Great tit, Collared flycatcher, Zebra finch, Wild turkey, White-rumped munia, Hooded crow, Blue tit and Ground tit. We aligned these sequences with our annotation for the blackcap, and with transcripts assembled from RNAseq data obtained from the testes of a single male blackcap, to determine whether any of the strongly associated SNPs identified by CAVIAR were within 3' UTRs. Alignment files are available upon request.</p><p>In a second set of analyses, we used HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) to identify known transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in genomic regions under selection. Specifically, we used findMotifsGenome.pl with default settings to identify known motifs in each region and scanMotifGenomeWide.pl to identify the specific location in each region where the motif could be found (permitting no mismatches). HOMER includes known motifs for thousands of transcription factors (mostly for model organisms); we chose to focus on candidate transcription factors identified by previous studies as having an association with migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ruegg et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-12"><title>GWAS</title><p>In our final analysis on migratory distance, we limited our dataset to short-, medium- and long-distance migrants. We coded distance phenotype as an ordinal variable from 1 to 3 and conducted a GWAS analysis using a Bayesian sparse linear mixed model (BSLMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). We chose BSLMM models here (instead of hapFLK) because they allow the inclusion of ordinal variable (vs. categorical with hapFLK). BSLMM models include the phenotype as the response variable and allele frequencies at a set of SNPs as the predictor variable. They also include a term for factors that influence the phenotype and are correlated with genotype (e.g., population structure). BSLMMs are adaptive models that include linear mixed models (LMM) and Bayesian variable selection regression (BVSR) as special cases and that learn the genetic architecture from the data. We ran four independent chains for each BSLMM, with a burnin of 5 million steps and a subsequent 20 million MCMC steps (sampling every 1000 steps). We report one hyperparameter from this model (PVE: the proportion of variance in phenotypes explained by all SNPs, also called chip heritability) and consider SNPs with inclusion probabilities &gt;0.01 following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gompert et al. (2013)</xref>. Note, we chose to run this analysis with GEMMA instead of hapFLK as we did with our other migratory traits (orientation and propensity). This is because our focal variable here (distance) is ordinal in nature and this fact would have been lost in hapFLK. We could not code this variable as continuous because the average distance individuals in each population travel on migration is not exactly known.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge funding from the Max Planck Society (MPRG grant to ML), NSERC (PDF to KD) and Regional Government of Asturias (GRUPIN to JCI, Ref.: IDI/2018/000151).

revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;The evolutionary history and genomics of European blackcap migration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>This manuscript compiles an enormous dataset to address questions about the genetic basis of migratory behavior in a classic model system in the field. The reviewers and reviewing editor were enthusiastic about the topic and united in finding the dataset extremely impressive. They also thought several key results of the paper were important. In particular, the data add to growing evidence that there is not a common genetic mechanism underlying migratory behavior. Furthermore, the attempt to decompose a complex behavior into component parts (propensity, distance, and orientation) was novel and interesting.</p><p>Despite this enthusiasm for the work, a number of significant issues were raised about the current presentation of the data and some of the analyses. These major concerns are synthesized below. After extensive discussion, the revisions required for the paper to be acceptable were deemed to be too substantial to be completed in the two month period allowed for revisions at <italic>eLife</italic>. We have therefore recommended rejection of this manuscript in its current state. Given the great promise of the dataset, however, the reviewers encourage submission of a significantly revised manuscript as a new submission in the future.</p><p>1) A primary issue identified by all reviewers is that the paper was generally hard to follow and contained many unrelated analyses. The Introduction does not set up clear questions and gives little background information on why the blackcap system is uniquely well-suited for addressing questions about the genetic basis of migratory behavior. The Introduction also does not set up the key findings of the paper. It is recommended that the authors re-focus the overall framing of the paper to highlight their key results, remove tangential analyses (see below for specifics), and generally streamline and contextualize results within the existing literature throughout the entire paper.</p><p>2) There was concern from all reviewers about the phylogeography section. These analyses were not clearly integrated with the rest the paper. Furthermore, the way the PCA and ADMIXTURE plots were used to interpret ancestral state seemed very ad-hoc, and the maximum likelihood tree was not well supported. The inference that migration is the ancestral state and was lost on islands is generally reasonable, as that is a pattern found in other taxa. However, if the authors choose to include the phylogeography section moving forward, removal of the PCA and ADMIXTURE interpretations is recommended. The authors should also acknowledge the limitations of their inference more openly, given the weak support in their data. Further, the overall contribution of the phylogeographic analysis to the main conclusions of the paper should be clarified throughout the text.</p><p>3) The use of SMC++ to infer divergence times was considered problematic, as this method assumes populations do not exchange genes after divergence. To more accurately date divergence times, the authors should use a demographic modeling approach based on the joint site frequency spectrum (e.g. dadi or moments) or evaluate alternative models with and without migration in an ABC framework. Alternatively, the authors could refocus that section on variable demography rather than the timing of splits. Demographic trajectories diverging earlier than previously estimated split times could then be a &quot;suggestive&quot; point, but shouldn't be the primary finding of that analysis. It might be useful to refer to Mazet et al., 2016 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4806692/) for guidance with these interpretations.</p><p>4) There were concerns about the authors overinterpreting causal associations between migratory behavior and loci putatively under selection in both the orientation and residency sections. Particularly in the transition to residency section, outliers cannot be separated from population structure, and could therefore be due to a variety of factors unrelated to migration. The authors suggest that finding an elevated region on super scaffold 99 in both island and resident populations indicates this region may be associated with the transition to residency. This analysis is rather unconvincing, as these shared elevated regions could be due to shared ancestry. It is also not clear if the extensive subsequent discussion of candidate loci focuses only on this shared elevated region on scaffold 99, or looks at all outliers. The language in this section should tempered, alternative explanations discussed, and it should be made clear which populations are included when identifying candidate loci.</p><p>5) Analyses of selection on standing genetic variation: as with the inferences about phylogeography, these sections read as somewhat ad-hoc and did not use previously validated methods. The first section about standing genetic variation (dealing with short distance migrants) is weakly supported- removal this section is recommended. The second section, if retained, should use methods that have been previously shown through theory or simulation to distinguish selection on standing genetic variation. It is also recommended that the authors articulate clear predictions about expected results if migratory behavior arises from selection on novel vs. standing variation.</p><p>6) More information needs to be given about sampling and phenotyping. This is particularly important for explaining how phenotypes were assigned to &quot;short-distance SW migrants,&quot; which fall into two different clusters on PC2. This is a major gap in the paper.</p><p>7) There were concerns about the analysis of migratory distance, both in classifying distance as a categorical trait and in why a different method for identifying outliers was used in this section. The analysis of distance, if retained, should either apply the same approaches for outlier detections as were used for the analyses of propensity and orientation, or clearly explain use of a different approach. There should also be further justification for classifying distance as a categorical variable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper uses the European blackcap, a classic model system in migration research, to reconstruct the evolution of migratory behavior and identify genomic regions associated with different components of migratory phenotype. To me, the most impactful results are that the authors do not find candidate loci associated with migratory behavior in other systems to be under selection in the blackcap, adding to growing evidence against a common underlying genetic architecture of migratory behavior. Also important is that the authors looked at multiple components of migratory behavior (propensity, orientation, and distance). However, while the dataset and analyses are very impressive, I think that the authors try to do too much at the expense of clarity and a focused message. Several sections of results are unclear, key information about sampling is missing, there are many tangential and speculative sections, and the paper as a whole does not have a strong unifying framework or question.</p><p>1) While the dataset here is remarkable, the structure of the paper is quite challenging. The Introduction, in my opinion, does not articulate a clear overarching question, and the questions that are laid out in the Introduction are not linked well to the analyses presented in the paper. For example, the Introduction seems to set up a study focused on the genetic architecture of migration. However, the first part of the paper is a lengthy analysis of population structure and phylogeography that seems unrelated to any topics introduced in the Introduction and is not connected to the background provided on the system. When we get to the genetic architecture component of the paper, it is not contextualized well with previous knowledge of the system, and it is therefore hard to evaluate the significance of the results. It is also not clear how the earlier pop structure and phylogeography component is related to analyses of selection and genetic architecture.</p><p>2) Very little information is given about the sampling or how phenotypes were identified. The only information provided is in the legend of Figure 1, which states that samples were collected on the breeding grounds with the exception of a few collected during the winter or during migration. This is problematic, given that the paper relies on individual-level phenotype assignments for these samples in all analyses. Explanations of how migratory distance, propensity, and orientation are determined for individual samples are needed.</p><p>3) The section on inferring ancestral state reads as very ad-hoc and confusing. The way the PCA is interpreted is not convincing and is not supported by any citations. The results from TREEMIX and ADMIXTURE are conflicting, but no explanation for how to interpret this discordance is offered. The purpose of this section overall is also not entirely clear- how do these analyses link back to overall questions about genetic architecture of migration?</p><p>4) The treatment of short-distance migrants is confusing. Based on the PCA, ADMIXTURE plot, and the map, it looks to me like these populations are admixed between residents and migrants (possibly due to post-Pleistocene secondary contact, based on the authors' explanation of biogeography). It is unclear to me how any of these data support variation in migratory behavior arising from standing genetic variation. Are the authors suggesting that individuals in the short-distance migrant population have different migratory strategies (e.g. some are residents and some are migrants) due to variation within the population? Later evidence for the role of standing genetic variation is more convincing. The purpose of this section needs to be made clearer.</p><p>5) I was surprised, given low support for the maximum likelihood tree and the history of gene flow indicated by TREEMIX, that the authors didn't use a method of demographic reconstruction that allows migration and determination of the timing of admixture events.</p><p>6) The way results on the propensity to migrate are presented strongly suggests that regions under selection in non-migratory populations are directly associated with loss of migratory behavior. However, these regions could just as reasonably be under other sources of divergent selection between these populations (e.g. ecological differences, differences in diet, etc). Couldn't shared regions under selection in island and resident populations also be due to gene flow and shared ancestry in these populations, as indicated by TREEMIX? Overall, I don't find it very convincing that regions under selection in non-migratory populations are directly associated with migratory propensity. The authors should either temper this section and discuss alternative explanations, or make the support for their assertion clearer.</p><p>7) In the first analyses of genomic regions under selection, the authors &quot;consider all three traits together.&quot; What does this mean? What groups of samples were actually compared?</p><p>8) I wondered why a different method was used for the analysis of migratory distance than was used for orientation and propensity. Why not make these analyses comparable? This last section in general felt somewhat tacked-on and not well integrated into the rest of the paper.</p><p>9) Overall, I think the results could be more clearly contextualized within the broader literature throughout the paper. The authors have a very cool dataset, but the parts that are novel and exciting are not highlighted very well throughout. The amount of background information given seems to assume familiarity with the blackcap system, which limits the accessibility of the paper to a broad audience. I think more effort needs to be put towards explaining why this system is so well-suited for asking these questions, and what new things we learn about migratory behavior from these analyses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors use whole-genome data to study the genetic basis of three migratory traits in European blackcaps: the propensity to migrate, distance, and orientation. Leveraging the diversity of migratory strategies in blackcaps, the authors document associations between migratory behavior and SNPs in regulatory regions – providing the first genome-wide characterization of migratory behavior in this species. Not only is this an interesting study system, but the sampling and experimental design also provide a robust foundation for investigating the genomic basis of migratory behavior. In addition, I found the methodological approach to be sound and thorough and was particularly impressed with the sample sizes/coverage for re-sequencing data as well as the quality of the reference genome. Overall, I thought it was an interesting data set and enjoyed reading the manuscript.</p><p>I have a few comments/questions outlined below. It is my opinion that, if these concerns are addressed, this work would make a nice contribution to the existing literature.</p><p>Subsection “Resident populations evolved from a migratory ancestor”: While I like this section, I think you can combine the TREEMIX and demographic analyses to cover most of this section in a more compelling way. While I don't entirely disagree, I find the use of the PCA and ADMIXTURE results to infer ancestral state a bit weak compared to the demographic data. I think you have enough analyses outside of the PCA and ADMIXTURE results to draw conclusions regarding ancestral state that are more appropriate for this type of question. I would recommend that you narrow this section down to focus on fewer, but more definitive, analyses, as it would strengthen the overall argument.</p><p>Subsection “Evidence for standing genetic variation in short distance migrants”: Similar to my comment above, I found parts of this section distracting and less compelling compared to the rest of the manuscript. I think you could remove this section as I am not really sure it adds much to the paper. I feel similarly about subsection “Selection on shared genetic variation could facilitate rapid changes in migration”.</p><p>Subsection “Resequencing analysis” paragraph three: This is more just curiosity: did you try using HaplotypeCaller from GATK? I think the fact that variant calling in GATK is combined with other programs makes this a robust approach but was wondering why you chose UnifiedGenotyper.</p><p>Subsection “Linkage disequilibrium”: I don't believe that there is any mention of linkage disequilibrium in the main text of the manuscript. May be worth mentioning somewhere in the results</p><p>Figure 4: Add a Y-axis label to panel c</p><p>Figure 5: I think the figure is very aesthetically pleasing, but I am really struggling to understand what is going on in this figure. It may just be a matter of clarifying the legend, or perhaps it is just me. But I am not convinced this figure adds much. Also, I think you mean to say &quot;panel f shows haplotype.….&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study the authors analyze genetic variation in what has historically been the model species for songbird migration and present a set of results covering both phylogeographic history and selection on genes putatively associated with migratory behaviors. Helbig and Berthold's captive breeding studies in black-caps showing that migratory orientation is heritable are classics in ornithology, and an obvious followup question is &quot;what genes are responsible for this behavior?&quot;, so I was excited to see a rigorous genome-wide analysis of the species. From that perspective I think one of the most interesting thing here is that this is now the third study (fourth if you count the brand new Toews et al. PNAS study) looking for associations of specific genomic regions with migratory behavior, and as far as I can tell there are zero overlapping outlier regions across these studies. The authors make this point but I think it could be emphasized, particularly given that much of the interest in migration as a tractable trait for genetic mapping is driven by the captive breeding studies conducted in this species.</p><p>In general I thought the new data in this paper was very good, but the results presented cover so much territory that individual analyses sometimes feel rushed and the whole picture is hard to follow. I have a few methodological issues with the phylogeography, and for the selection/association analyses I think the more speculative post-hoc analyses of specific genes should be limited. One general issue that should be addressed more directly when describing results for regions putatively associated with migratory behaviors is that migration itself may be tangential to the actual selective force – climatic variation on either the breeding or wintering range, dietary differences across geographic regions, or any other environmental factor varying among populations could create the basis for selection that could be detected by approaches like PBS. Because migratory phenotypes covary with many of these other environmental factors, it is inevitably going to be difficult to identify genes that drive (rather than being driven by) aspects of migration like orientation, distance, or phenology.</p><p>That being said I think this is an important paper in the area of migration genomics because it is in the only system with truly compelling captive-breeding results from crosses and because the dataset is excellent.</p><p>Subsection “Differentiation between populations is low”: Are migrant populations differentiable on other PC's? What about if PCA is run on just continental, or just migrant populations alone? Because PCA will represent variance in the full dataset, running it with divergent island populations may mask differentiation among migrant populations. Probably same issues in the admixture analysis. I'd like to see a supplemental figure showing at least PC1-2 when the analysis is run on just continental birds.</p><p>Subsection “Resident populations evolved from a migratory ancestor”: The methods for ancestral state reconstruction here were unfamiliar to me and seemed ad-hoc. Are there citations available for studies outlining the logic of using PCA and/or admixture results for this task? As it is the clearest evidence seemed to be from the phylogenetic analysis, which relies on poorly supported nodes in a topology constructed using a method that effectively assumes no gene flow.</p><p>Subsection “Divergence began ~250,000 year ago”: SMC++ assumes populations are isolated, so it isn't an appropriate method for dating population splits in groups that continue to exchange genes after divergence. In addition, the mutation rate and generation times (though they look about right relative to other migratory birds) don't appear to be pulled from the citation listed (Noor and Bennett, 2009 – apologies if I missed it buried in there somewhere), and these will directly scale the inferred timing of population size changes. The message that divergence is old is likely right – if gene flow occurs but isn't being captured by the analysis then divergence times should be *even older*, but if divergence time estimation is the goal then a demographic inference method explicitly incorporating gene flow and returning estimates of split times should be employed, and the empirical rates should be better justified. I'd suggest demographic modeling of the joint site frequency spectrum in dadi or moments. In addition, the end of this section regarding the possible speed of evolution of variation in migratory traits should acknowledge that much of that literature is based on the documented contemporary evolution of the NW migration and not on biogeographic reconstruction of island colonizations.</p><p>Subsection “The transition to residency may be controlled by regulatory elements” paragraph two: It was hard to tell what in this paragraph referred to results from this study, vs results from previous studies. Are Clock/Npas2/bmal1 in an outlier region here? Or is it just that there is one bHLH motif found in an outlier region? If the latter, I'd suggest cutting the second half of this section as the evidence of any specific regulatory element being involved seems quite weak.</p><p>Subsection “Examining genes associated with the transition to residency” paragraph one: Needs citations.</p><p>Subsection “Limited overlap with previous genomic studies examining this trait” paragraph two: Worth making the point here that though this gene is *associated* with migratory orientation, the proposed mechanism is not at all *causal* for orientation. This point could be more generally made in the Introduction, as well.</p><p>Subsection “Considerable variance in migratory distance is controlled by genetic variation”: This analysis did not seem particularly compelling, and (given that migratory distance is actually a continuous trait) the binning of distance as an ordinal trait seems likely to offer little power to identify causal alleles in a small cohort like this. It also isn't clear to me why a new method is used here that wasn't used in the previous association/selection analyses. I suggest cutting this section.</p><p>Subsection “Selection on shared genetic variation could facilitate rapid changes in migration”: I like this question quite a bit and think there are some cool results here, but I found this section hard to follow. I think it needs a rewrite, and the methods should be better justified. I suggest starting with a paragraph laying out expectations for what you expect given selection from novel vs standing variation (see Barret and Schluter, 2008), and using only analyses that have been previously proposed and shown through either theory or simulation to distinguish these processes.</p><p>Subsection “GWAS.”: What specifically was the factor used to represent population structure here? A matrix of pairwise genetic distance over the whole genome? Please provide a little more detail on your implementation of this method.</p><p>Figure 1C: These colors seem to partially but not entirely match the map, which is confusing (especially when referring back to this figure for color references). I'd use different colors than in the map. Greyscale would work ok with K=3.</p><p>Figure 5 legend: the letters seem to be off here – please check that e and f are correctly referenced, and discuss panels in order (a-e).</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The evolutionary history and genomics of European blackcap migration&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors are to be commended for their thorough revision and for incorporating reviewer comments.</p><p>The only major comment from my previous review that I feel is not clarified in the revision is the way the three different migratory phenotypes are combined in the demographic analyses and the initial hapFLK/PBS/nSL analyses that include all populations (point #7 from my review). Let me better explain my confusion: in the analyses of population structure (Figure 1 Fst plot), there are nine populations with distinct phenotypes: continental residents, short distance sw migrants, long distance SE migrants, medium distance SW, SE, and NE migrants, and the three island populations. However, in subsequent analyses, these populations are grouped together in different ways that are not clearly explained. For the demographic analysis, the medium- and long- distance migrants are grouped together, despite variation in orientation among these populations. Why is this? Likewise, in the analyses of the genetic basis of traits, the authors describe analyzing all three phenotypes (orientation, distance, and propensity); however, each of these of course has multiple categories (e.g. SW, SE, and NE orientation). In the legend for Figure 3, they note that they are grouping birds into 5 phenotypes for panels A and B and 3 phenotypes for panels B and C. Figure 3—figure supplement 1 shows six different phenotypes (7 including those shown in Figure 3) for the ΔPBS analysis. The authors note that islands were excluded and residents limited to a single population, but it is otherwise unclear to me what these different phenotype groups are. Adding to the confusion is that 1) the analysis of differentiation and selection comes after the demographic modeling, which did not consider orientation in the grouping of phenotypes; 2) Figure 5 also combines the medium and long- distance migrants and removes orientation; and 3) sample sizes are not given for each population used in the comparisons. Some clarification of exactly which populations and phenotypes are being compared in the analyses, throughout this this section is needed, as well as justification for why medium- and long- distance migrants are combined for some analyses but not others, and clear reporting of sample sizes for each comparison in the main text (please remove from legend in Figure 3).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have done a commendable job revising this manuscript. The Introduction is much easier to follow and sets up the study nicely.

We have taken them on board, re-writing the Introduction entirely and reducing the phylogeographic portion of our study substantially, including all discussion of ancestral state derived from our results (see our response to your second comment).</p><p>Our new Introduction highlights the importance of phylogeographic studies with blackcaps. For example, these studies provided important evolutionary context for work on the genetics of migration. Limited genetic differentiation was documented between blackcap populations suggesting transitions between migratory states must be very rapid and may involve on a small number of genetic changes. These studies also speak to the timing and number of transitions that have occurred within blackcaps between migratory and resident behaviour. This information is important for interpreting local signatures of differentiation.</p><p>All of the phylogeographic work conducted prior to our study relied on limited mitochondrial sequence data making our work – updating results with genome-wide data – essential. Our results support previous findings and uncover novel patterns that are important for interpreting our findings on the genetics of migration. For example, we document genomic differentiation between migrants and both resident continent and island populations. This had not been observed before and guided our analysis on the genetics of migratory orientation specifically as we knew the inclusion of genomically differentiated resident birds was limiting our power to detect signatures related to this trait. The exclusion of residents allowed us to identify regions under positive selection in the NW phenotype, one of the most exciting aspects of the blackcap system that we have been able to underline with our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There was concern from all reviewers about the phylogeography section. These analyses were not clearly integrated with the rest the paper. Furthermore, the way the PCA and ADMIXTURE plots were used to interpret ancestral state seemed very ad-hoc, and the maximum likelihood tree was not well supported. The inference that migration is the ancestral state and was lost on islands is generally reasonable, as that is a pattern found in other taxa. However, if the authors choose to include the phylogeography section moving forward, removal of the PCA and ADMIXTURE interpretations is recommended. The authors should also acknowledge the limitations of their inference more openly, given the weak support in their data. Further, the overall contribution of the phylogeographic analysis to the main conclusions of the paper should be clarified throughout the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We are confident that our new Introduction integrates our phylogeographic work much better than before. We discuss findings in the blackcap on the genetics of migration first and devote a second paragraph to phylogeographic studies, highlighting their importance for interpreting data on the former topic.</p><p>We have kept the PCA and ADMIXTURE analyses in our study but removed TREEMIX and ML trees. We do not use any of these analyses to infer ancestral states; we only use them to discuss patterns of genomic differentiation between populations and study demographic history. As we mentioned above, these analyses highlighted new results for the blackcap system that were important for setting up subsequent analyses (e.g. removing resident continent birds) and interpreting findings (e.g. given the low levels of population differentiation we documented in the phylogeographic portion of our work we can be confident population differentiation between migratory phenotypes (i.e. NW, SW and SE migrants) is not affecting our local genomic results). Combined with other observations from the system, genomic differentiation between resident populations also suggests that parallel signatures of selection are independent but make use of the same variation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The use of SMC++ to infer divergence times was considered problematic, as this method assumes populations do not exchange genes after divergence.

Accordingly, in the revised version of our manuscript we used a different program for demographic inference and complimented this analysis with cross-coalescent rate analyses. The approach that we used was introduced by the MSMC model (Schiffels and Durbin, 2011) and extended in MSMC2 (Malaspinas et al., 2012). Comparing the rate of coalescence between pairs of individuals taken in two populations to the rate of coalescence within each population allows dating the differentiation of two populations. This approach is particularly well suited to our dataset as it does not require extensive sample sizes (as for instance needed by SFS estimation) and makes use of complete genome data as it intrinsically accounts for linkage disequilibrium. In addition to the dating of population differentiation, cross-coalescence rates can be used to infer the temporal pattern of migration rate between populations (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/585265v1.full). As our aim is to date population divergence, we decided to restrict our analyses to the differentiation timing and did not compute estimates of migration rates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There were concerns about the authors overinterpreting causal associations between migratory behavior and loci putatively under selection in both the orientation and residency sections. Particularly in the transition to residency section, outliers cannot be separated from population structure, and could therefore be due to a variety of factors unrelated to migration. The authors suggest that finding an elevated region on super scaffold 99 in both island and resident populations indicates this region may be associated with the transition to residency. This analysis is rather unconvincing, as these shared elevated regions could be due to shared ancestry. It is also not clear if the extensive subsequent discussion of candidate loci focuses only on this shared elevated region on scaffold 99, or looks at all outliers. The language in this section should tempered, alternative explanations discussed, and it should be made clear which populations are included when identifying candidate loci.</p></disp-quote><p>We have noted the potential for other selection pressures to lead to the patterns of positive selection.</p><p>We believe we have presented strong evidence for parallel positive selection on Super-Scaffold_99 related to the transition from migrants to residents. We outline our reasons below and include them in our manuscript but are of course open to further discussion on the topic.</p><p>– Three separate population genetic measures suggest this region is under positive selection: hapFLK (which relies on haplotypes and controls for hierarchical population structure), ΔPBS (which uses SNPs and controls for linked selection) and nLS (which is a measure of within population variation that relies on haplotypes). The effect linked selection can have on signatures of selection is a very prominent problem discussed in the literature and we have used ΔPBS to address this problem (proposed in Vijay et al., 2017). Population structure between populations is low to begin with and while there was some evidence for differentiation between migrants and residents, the actual level of differentiation between migrant and resident populations is low (~0.03), should have more of a genome-wide effect and is controlled for in the analysis using hapFLK.</p><p>– It is very unlikely that selection related to other ecological features is responsible for repeated patterns of positive selection on Super-Scaffold_99 in resident continent and island birds as ecological features (both biotic and abiotic) are very different between these regions. For example, considering climate, the Iberian Peninsula is quite variable but in general it would be considered mediterranean in nature (hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters). By contrast, many of the Atlantic islands have limited seasonality and are dominated by hot desert like conditions (the Canary Islands and Cape Verde). The Azores are more seasonal (temperate with no dry season and a mild/hot summer) and these islands occur across a broad latitudinal range with increasing temperatures (and decreasing precipitation) as you move towards the equator (Cropper, 2013). Community assemblages experienced by resident populations are also different, with islands having lower diversity in general but exhibiting their own variation as well. For example, the Canary Islands host ~3x the number of bird species and endemics owing to their proximity to the mainland and greater surface area (Valente et al., 2017).</p><p>– Finally, very similar findings and interpretations have been made by other authors, including Zhan et al., 2014, who documented parallel signatures of positive selection in transitions from migratory monarchs in North America to islands. We are lucky we have a system where this kind of comparison (multiple transitions) can be made, providing more support than a single comparison.</p><p>We do not see why the source of variation upon which selection acts precludes the region on Super-Scaffold_99 from being involved in the transition to residency. Whether the variation comes from new mutations, gene flow or standing genetic variation should not matter. It is still variation in this region (with its specific genes and regulatory regions) that experiences positive selection and is likely involved in the transition. The Atlantic islands were colonized by blackcaps in different waves and before areas in southern Europe (Perez-Tris et al., 2004, Dietzen et al., 2008). It seems the use of shared variation (gene flow or standing genetic variation) could have facilitated these transitions and is actually quite interesting re. how rapid phenotypic transitions can occur.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Analyses of selection on standing genetic variation: as with the inferences about phylogeography, these sections read as somewhat ad-hoc and did not use previously validated methods. The first section about standing genetic variation (dealing with short distance migrants) is weakly supported- removal this section is recommended. The second section, if retained, should use methods that have been previously shown through theory or simulation to distinguish selection on standing genetic variation. It is also recommended that the authors articulate clear predictions about expected results if migratory behavior arises from selection on novel vs. standing variation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the first section on standing genetic variation and short distance migrants. Please see our response to reviewer 3 concerning the use of previous methods for inferring standing genetic variation. Briefly, we used methods outlined in the reference they suggested (Barrett and Schluter 2008) to the best of our ability; most of the methods described rely on the availability of an ancestral population (e.g. marine sticklebacks for freshwater adaptation in the three-spinned stickleback) and the authors themselves (i.e. Barrett and Schluter 2008) note there are limitations to the methods they suggest (e.g. looking for a “soft” sweep requires knowledge of what a “hard” sweep would look like in our system).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) More information needs to be given about sampling and phenotyping. This is particularly important for explaining how phenotypes were assigned to &quot;short-distance SW migrants,&quot; which fall into two different clusters on PC2. This is a major gap in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We had summarised all phenotyping and sampling details in Supplementary file 4, but now more prominently further added descriptions in the respective Materials and method part. Here we clarify that in most cases we scored populations, not individuals (i.e. all individuals in a population had equal phenotype even if we assume that there may be some within-population variation). This being said, our scoring methods in these locations (specifically those sampled on the Iberian Peninsula) were based on morphometry of individuals, and there is a strong correlation between wing length and migration distance in blackcaps. Specifically, the two north-Iberian populations are short winged compared to central and northern European blackcaps, indicating short-distance movements. With respect to the short-distance SW migrants we know they are migratory because they leave in winter (winter blackcap censuses in these localities resulted in zero counts in all cases). Southern residents are known to be resident because of the combination of extremely short and rounded wings and individual ringing recoveries of individuals that spend the whole year in the same territory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There were concerns about the analysis of migratory distance, both in classifying distance as a categorical trait and in why a different method for identifying outliers was used in this section. The analysis of distance, if retained, should either apply the same approaches for outlier detections as were used for the analyses of propensity and orientation, or clearly explain use of a different approach. There should also be further justification for classifying distance as a categorical variable.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided more context for this analysis in our response to reviewers 1 and 2. We cannot quantify migratory distance as continuous as we do not know how far an average individual from each population travels and we chose to retain some of this variation by quantifying distance as an ordinal variable. If we had used the same method as our work on migratory orientation (hapFLK) we would have lost the continuous nature of this variable all together. We have included a note in the manuscript to this effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1) While the dataset here is remarkable, the structure of the paper is quite challenging. The Introduction, in my opinion, does not articulate a clear overarching question, and the questions that are laid out in the intro are not linked well to the analyses presented in the paper. For example, the Introduction seems to set up a study focused on the genetic architecture of migration. However, the first part of the paper is a lengthy analysis of population structure and phylogeography that seems unrelated to any topics introduced in the Introduction and is not connected to the background provided on the system. When we get to the genetic architecture component of the paper, it is not contextualized well with previous knowledge of the system, and it is therefore hard to evaluate the significance of the results. It is also not clear how the earlier pop structure and phylogeography component is related to analyses of selection and genetic architecture.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions. We have re-written the Introduction, providing a more equitable consideration of both migration genetics and phylogeography and highlighting how results from phlogeographic studies are relevant to our understanding of migration genetics. For example, classic studies on both migration genetics and phylogeography highlight how rapidly migratory behaviour can evolve and limited genetic differentiation between blackcap phenotypes could suggest the effect sizes of loci underlying migration are small (or that a small number of genes control these traits). Concerning the inclusion of phylogeographic analyses as a whole, we feel they provide an important setting for subsequent analyses of migration genetics. For example, in the first analyses on this topic using hapFLK and all phenotypes we find most signatures of selection are limited to residents, likely reflecting the fact these populations evolved resident phenotypes as they colonized areas further south in Europe and on the Atlantic islands. Note we have reduced the section on phylogeography substantially including the exclusion of several analyses including TREEMIX and the ML tree.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Very little information is given about the sampling or how phenotypes were identified. The only information provided is in the legend of Figure 1, which states that samples were collected on the breeding grounds with the exception of a few collected during the winter or during migration. This is problematic, given that the paper relies on individual-level phenotype assignments for these samples in all analyses. Explanations of how migratory distance, propensity, and orientation are determined for individual samples are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have summarised all phenotyping and sampling details in Supplementary file 4, but now more prominently further added descriptions in the respective method part, we have also fully replied to a similar comment raised by the editor, see above. There we clarify that in most cases we scored populations, not individuals (i.e. all individuals in a population had equal phenotype even if we assume that there may be some within-population variation). Scoring methods in these locations (specifically those sampled on the Iberian Peninsula) were based on morphometry of individuals, and there is a strong correlation between wing length and migration distance in blackcaps. Other measures of phenotype are based on ringing-recovery data, stable isotope assessments as detailed in Supplementary file 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The section on inferring ancestral state reads as very ad-hoc and confusing. The way the PCA is interpreted is not convincing and is not supported by any citations. The results from TREEMIX and ADMIXTURE are conflicting, but no explanation for how to interpret this discordance is offered. The purpose of this section overall is also not entirely clear- how do these analyses link back to overall questions about genetic architecture of migration?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We have removed all discussion of ancestral state from our Results. For example, we have excluded the ML tree and discuss results from the PCA, ADMIXTIRE and FST in terms of population differentiation only. All speculation has been removed. This section has been reduced substantially in response to comments from all reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The treatment of short-distance migrants is confusing. Based on the PCA, ADMIXTURE plot, and the map, it looks to me like these populations are admixed between residents and migrants (possibly due to post-Pleistocene secondary contact, based on the authors' explanation of biogeography). It is unclear to me how any of these data support variation in migratory behavior arising from standing genetic variation. Are the authors suggesting that individuals in the short-distance migrant population have different migratory strategies (e.g. some are residents and some are migrants) due to variation within the population? Later evidence for the role of standing genetic variation is more convincing. The purpose of this section needs to be made clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noting this. We have removed this section to focus on our main questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I was surprised, given low support for the maximum likelihood tree and the history of gene flow indicated by TREEMIX, that the authors didn't use a method of demographic reconstruction that allows migration and determination of the timing of admixture events.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noting this. In the revised version of our manuscript, we complemented our demographic inference with cross-coalescent rate analyses. The approach that we used was introduced by the MSMC model (Schiffels and Durbin, 2011) and extended in MSMC2 (Malaspinas et al., 2012). Comparing the rate of coalescence between pairs of individuals taken in two populations to the rate of coalescence within each population allows dating the differentiation of two populations. This approach is particularly well-suited to our dataset as it does not require extensive sample sizes (as for instance needed by SFS estimation) and make use of complete genome data as it intrinsically accounts for linkage disequilibrium. In addition to the dating of population differentiation, cross-coalescence rates can be used to infer the temporal pattern of migration rate between populations (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/585265v1.full). As our aim is to date population divergence, we decided to restrict our analyses to the differentiation timing and did not compute estimates of migration rates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The way results on the propensity to migrate are presented strongly suggests that regions under selection in non-migratory populations are directly associated with loss of migratory behavior. However, these regions could just as reasonably be under other sources of divergent selection between these populations (e.g. ecological differences, differences in diet, etc). Couldn't shared regions under selection in island and resident populations also be due to gene flow and shared ancestry in these populations, as indicated by TREEMIX? Overall, I don't find it very convincing that regions under selection in non-migratory populations are directly associated with migratory propensity. The authors should either temper this section and discuss alternative explanations, or make the support for their assertion clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a note in the manuscript that parallel signatures of divergent selection in resident populations could derive from a different source of selection than migration but do not believe this is the case as ecological features (biotic and abiotic) experienced by birds on the continent and islands are very different. For example, climate on the Iberian Peninsula is variable but in general it would be considered mediterranean in nature (hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters). By contrast, many of the Atlantic islands have limited seasonality and are dominated by hot desert like conditions (the Canary Islands and Cape Verde). The Azores are more seasonal (temperate with no dry season and a mild/hot summer) and more generally, these islands occur across a broad latitudinal range with increasing temperatures (and decreasing precipitation) as you move towards the equator, Cropper, 2013). Community assemblages experienced by resident populations are also different, with islands having lower diversity in general but exhibiting their own variation as well. For example, the Canary islands host ~3x the number of birds species and endemics owing to their proximity to the mainland and greater surface area (Valente et al., 2017). A very similar argument was made by Zhan et al., 2014, in their observation that resident monarch butterflies on islands derive from continent migrant monarchs.</p><p>Concerning the source of these parallel signatures of selection, we agree these signatures could be due to gene flow or shared ancestry. We are not sure how this affects our results or interpretations. Whether the source of variation is from new mutations or shared variation does not affect our conclusion that the same regions are under selection in resident continent and island populations. Wherever the variation comes from it’s under positive selection that we believe is related to the transition from migratory to resident in these locations following their colonization (although as we discuss above we have included a note about the role other selection pressures could play). There is strong evidence from previous phylogeographic studies that colonization of the islands and southern regions of the continent occurred at different times (and at least two colonizations of the islands have occurred [0.3-3 Myr to Canaries and 4,000-40,000 ya to the other islands], Perez-Tris et al., 2004, Dietzen et al., 2008).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the first analyses of genomic regions under selection, the authors &quot;consider all three traits together.&quot; What does this mean? What groups of samples were actually compared?</p></disp-quote><p>The three phenotypes are orientation, distance and propensity. This means that all birds were included except for resident island populations (n=15), and resident continent birds from Asni and Cazalla (see text, n=13). We have made this clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) I wondered why a different method was used for the analysis of migratory distance than was used for orientation and propensity. Why not make these analyses comparable? This last section in general felt somewhat tacked-on and not well integrated into the rest of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Migration distance is an ordinal variable: short (1), medium (2), and long (3) distance migrants. We did not want to lose this information by running this analysis through hapFLK where it would be considered a categorical variable. GEMMA allows you to code your phenotype as ordinal. We have made this clear in the manuscript and think this analysis is integrated well enough as it is clear in our statement of objectives we will be studying the genetic basis of all three traits and this is restated at the start of the localized analyses as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Overall, I think the results could be more clearly contextualized within the broader literature throughout the paper. The authors have a very cool dataset, but the parts that are novel and exciting are not highlighted very well throughout. The amount of background information given seems to assume familiarity with the blackcap system, which limits the accessibility of the paper to a broad audience. I think more effort needs to be put towards explaining why this system is so well-suited for asking these questions, and what new things we learn about migratory behavior from these analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.

I have a few methodological issues with the phylogeography, and for the selection/association analyses I think the more speculative post-hoc analyses of specific genes should be limited. One general issue that should be addressed more directly when describing results for regions putatively associated with migratory behaviors is that migration itself may be tangential to the actual selective force – climatic variation on either the breeding or wintering range, dietary differences across geographic regions, or any other environmental factor varying among populations could create the basis for selection that could be detected by approaches like PBS. Because migratory phenotypes covary with many of these other environmental factors, it is inevitably going to be difficult to identify genes that drive (rather than being driven by) aspects of migration like orientation, distance, or phenology.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included this caveat, that other selection pressures may be responsible for signatures of positive selection in our study but note, in the case of consistent patterns exhibited by resident island and continent populations this is unlikely (see our response to editor and the revised text for a full description).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>That being said I think this is an important paper in the area of migration genomics because it is in the only system with truly compelling captive-breeding results from crosses and because the dataset is excellent.</p><p>Subsection “Differentiation between populations is low”: Are migrant populations differentiable on other PC's?

In addition, the mutation rate and generation times (though they look about right relative to other migratory birds) don't appear to be pulled from the citation listed (Noor and Bennett, 2009 – apologies if I missed it buried in there somewhere), and these will directly scale the inferred timing of population size changes. The message that divergence is old is likely right – if gene flow occurs but isn't being captured by the analysis then divergence times should be *even older*, but if divergence time estimation is the goal then a demographic inference method explicitly incorporating gene flow and returning estimates of split times should be employed, and the empirical rates should be better justified. I'd suggest demographic modeling of the joint site frequency spectrum in dadi or moments. In addition, the end of this section regarding the possible speed of evolution of variation in migratory traits should acknowledge that much of that literature is based on the documented contemporary evolution of the NW migration and not on biogeographic reconstruction of island colonizations.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.

I think it needs a rewrite, and the methods should be better justified. I suggest starting with a paragraph laying out expectations for what you expect given selection from novel vs standing variation (see Barret and Schluter, 2008, citation 67), and using only analyses that have been previously proposed and shown through either theory or simulation to distinguish these processes.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers comment. Barrett and Schluter, 2008, make three suggestions for showing selection acts on standing genetic variation. We go through each of these below and note that the authors themselves stated that “none of [their] approaches [are] infallible” and they “identify possible difficulties with each”.</p><p>1) Barrett and Schluter, 2008, suggest looking for evidence of soft sweeps around regions under selection using different population parameters. This analysis relies on the assumption that nearby neutral alleles will sweep with beneficial allele and is largely descriptive. For example, recombination around an allele that has been segregating in an ancestral population for some time will break up associations with nearby neutral sites. This should result in a narrow, shallow reduction in polymorphism compared to hard sweeps. Barrett and Schluter, 2008, do not provide any guidance on how to quantify how “narrow” and “shallow” regions have to be under this scenario. In addition, by their nature these signatures are more difficult to detect (narrow and shallow signatures will stand out less than broad, deep patterns). Finally, depending on how long the allele has been in the population any signature of a sweep could be eliminated completely by recombination. The latter point was noted by Barrett and Schluter, 2008. Given the difficulties associated with this method we have chosen not to employ it but we do note in the text that the peaks we identified are quite narrow.</p><p>2) Barrett and Schluter, 2008, also suggest finding evidence the allele under selection still occurs as standing variation in the ancestral population. This suggestion obviously requires us to know and still have an ancestral population to sample. This is easier to do in some systems (e.g. Colosimo et al., 2005 focus on an allele associated with armour in freshwater sticklebacks and are able to sample that marine population for this allele); we have done our best, noting that the migratory phenotype is likely ancestral in blackcaps (based on previous work to ours) and most of the haplotypes under selection are present in migratory populations (e.g. Figure 4). If these are the ancestral populations (suggested by previous authors including Perez-Tris et al., 2004 and Voelker and Light, 2011) our data on this topic support the use of standing genetic variation. A similar argument was made by Zhan et al. (2014) focusing on monarch butterflies where multiple losses of migratory behaviour involved selection at the same haplotype that is still present in the migratory population.</p><p>3) The last suggestion by Barrett and Schluter, 2008, is to use a phylogenetic study to determine the age of genomic regions under selection. Again their example comes from the Colosimo et al., 2005 paper on sticklebacks. These authors compared estimates of neutral sequence divergence between populations that differ in their armour phenotype to splits of known age within the same system to show the allele under selection is quite old. Unfortunately we do not have any closely related population pairs of known age to calibrate estimates of divergence in blackcaps but we have estimated neutral sequence divergence (the number of synonymous segregating sites) in all migratory populations and do not find a difference. Please note, this suggestion by Barrett and Schluter, 2008, may not be very reliable as the regions we’re looking at have undergone selective sweeps and patterns of neutral divergence may be obscured by the effects of selective sweeps on polymorphisms. This would make it difficult to use diversity to age divergence between haplotypes and was not noted by Barrett and Schluter, 2008.</p><p>We have also compared sequence divergence between all haplotypes and our ancestral sequence (derived using a comparison with two closely related species, the garden warbler (migratory) and hill babbler (resident)]).</p><p>We have also added two new analyses. First, we compare a phylogeny built using all data (ML tree) to one built using data from the genomic region under selection on Super-Scaffold 73 only (Figure 6). The genome-wide phylogeny is largely unresolved and has the garden warbler and hill babbler as a sister clade to blackcaps (as noted in many other phylogenetic studies on the <italic>Sylvia</italic> clade). By contrast, the phylogeny built using data from Super-Scaffold 73 suggests garden warblers are more closely related to blackcaps and medium distance NW birds diverged first, with the remaining blackcaps forming a polytomy as in the genome-wide tree. Garden warblers are migratory and the placement of NW birds at the base of the phylogeny suggests the haplotype in this population old and had been in the population before it underwent selection in the NW phenotype.</p><p>Our second new analysis is related to a pattern documented by Przeworski and Coop, 2011. These authors showed that SFS for regions experiencing selection from standing genetic variation are often more variable then those from de novo mutations and have more alleles at intermediate frequencies (see text for additional details). We note exactly this pattern in our study (Figure 6). Note this analysis involves resampling and a comparison of SFS from our data and the resamples. It would be ideal to compare the distribution of our observed data to resamples but at this time we are not aware of any way to compare distributions with these patterns (e.g. high frequencies at one end.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “GWAS.”: What specifically was the factor used to represent population structure here?

The authors are to be commended for their thorough revision and for incorporating reviewer comments.</p><p>The only major comment from my previous review that I feel is not clarified in the revision is the way the three different migratory phenotypes are combined in the demographic analyses and the initial hapFLK/PBS/nSL analyses that include all populations (point #7 from my review). […] Some clarification of exactly which populations and phenotypes are being compared in the analyses, throughout this this section is needed, as well as justification for why medium- and long- distance migrants are combined for some analyses but not others, and clear reporting of sample sizes for each comparison in the main text (please remove from legend in Figure 3).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. There appear to be two problems here: (1) why were medium and long distance migrants combined for the demographic analysis (and in Figure 5A) and (2) what samples were used for analyses on the genetic basis of different migratory traits. We will address these concerns in turn below.</p><p>1) Why were medium and long distance migrants combined for demographic analyses (and in Figure 5A)?</p><p>Each one of the orientations (NW, SW and SE) were plotted individually in Figure 5A. They show similar trends making this difficult to see and our figure legend lacked clarity. We have improved the legend for Figure 5A stating that medium distance migrants were not combined for this plot.</p><p>We combined medium and long distance migrants for the demographic analyses because they exhibited very little population structure or differentiation (Figure 1) and thus we assumed they would exhibit similar demographic trajectories. We have confirmed this assumption now, running demographic analyses separately for each phenotype. The trajectories are indistinguishable and can now be found in Figure 2—figure supplement 4. We also reran cross-coalescent analyses and no population splits were observed (relative CCR stay close to 1 all the time; Figure 3—figure supplement 1). This information is in the main text as well.</p><p>2) What samples were used for analyses on the genetic basis of different migratory traits?</p><p>Analyses of population structure and demography included the full dataset. Subsets of the dataset were used in analyses focused on the genetics of migratory traits. We have included three new columns in Supplementary file 4 showing the exact birds used in each subset and – as requested by the reviewer – we have moved information on sample sizes from figure captions to the main text.</p><p>We have also removed the panel in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 showing estimates of PBS for residents as this is already shown in the main text (Figure 3A). Six groups (residents [shown in Figure 3A], short distance SW, medium distance NW, SW, SE and long distance SE birds were used in this analysis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
