potassium ion. Previous crystal structures of a homologous archaeal sodium and aspartate symporter showed that a dedicated transport domain carries the substrate and ions across the membrane. Here, we report new crystal structures of this homologue in ligand-free and ions-only bound outward- and inward-facing conformations. We show that after ligand release, the apo transport domain adopts a compact and occluded conformation that can traverse the membrane, completing the transport cycle. Sodium binding primes the transport domain to accept its substrate and triggers extracellular gate opening, which prevents inward domain translocation until substrate binding takes place. Furthermore, we describe a new cation-binding site ideally suited to bind a counter-transported ion. We suggest that potassium binding at this site stabilizes the translocation-competent conformation of the unloaded transport domain in mammalian homologues.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02283.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02283.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02283.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Molecules of glutamate can carry messages between cells in the brain, and these signals are essential for thought and memory. Glutamate molecules can also act as signals to build new connections between brain cells and to prune away unnecessary ones. However, too much glutamate outside of the cells kills the brain tissue and can lead to devastating brain diseases.</p><p>In a healthy brain, special pumps called glutamate transporters move these molecules back into the brain cells, where they can be stored safely. However, when brain cells are damaged—by, for example, a stroke or an injury,—the glutamate stored inside spills out, killing the surrounding cells. This leads to a cascade of dying cells and leaking glutamate, which causes even more damage and slows the recovery.</p><p>Glutamate transporters ensure that there are more glutamate molecules inside cells than outside. However, it requires energy to maintain this gradient in the concentration of glutamate molecules. The transporters get this energy by moving three sodium ions into the cell with each glutamate molecule, and moving one potassium ion out of the cell. However, it is not clear how these transporters ensure that they move the glutamate molecules and the sodium ions at the same time.</p><p>Now, Verdon, Oh et al. have uncovered the 3D structure of a glutamate transporter homologue at each step of the transport process. These structures reveal that, on the outside of the cell membrane, sodium ions attach to the so-called ‘transporter domain’ and make it better able to bind glutamate. The transporter domain then carries the sodium ions and glutamate through the cell membrane and releases them into the cell. Verdon, Oh et al. suggest that a potassium ion then binds to the empty transport domain, stabilizing it into a more compact shape that easily makes the return trip to the outside of the cell.</p><p>Most experiments on glutamate transporters, including the work of Verdon, Oh et al., are carried out on model proteins taken from bacteria. An important challenge for the future will be to obtain structural information on human glutamate transporters, as these could be therapeutic targets for the treatment of various neurological conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02283.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02283.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>glutamate transporter</kwd><kwd>crystal structure</kwd><kwd>coupling mechanism</kwd><kwd>ion binding site</kwd><kwd>gating</kwd><kwd>mechanism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS064357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boudker</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Crystal structures of an archaeal homologue of mammalian glutamate transporters in apo and ion-only bound outward- and inward-facing states reveal ion-coupled conformational changes supporting mechanisms of coupling, gating, and transport.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glutamate transporters, or excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), reside in the plasma membranes of glial cells and neurons, where they catalyze the re-uptake of the neurotransmitters glutamate and aspartate (L-asp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Danbolt, 2001</xref>). EAATs terminate neurotransmission events supporting memory formation and cognition, and also prevent excitotoxicity caused by overstimulation of glutamate receptors. Dysfunction of EAATs is linked to neurological disorders, poor recovery from stroke and traumatic brain injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yi and Hazell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sheldon and Robinson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). To maintain steep trans-membrane glutamate gradients, EAATs transport one substrate molecule together with three sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) and one proton. After their release into the cytoplasm, counter-transport of one potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>) resets the transporter for the next cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zerangue and Kavanaugh, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Levy et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Owe et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Key mechanistic and structural insights into this family of transporters come from studies on an archaeal homologue from <italic>Pyrococcus horikoshii</italic>, Glt<sub>Ph</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which symports L-asp together with three Na<sup>+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groeneveld and Slotboom, 2010</xref>); however, it shows no dependence on counter-transport of K<sup>+</sup> under the conditions tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ryan et al., 2009</xref>). Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, like EAATs, is a homo-trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gendreau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yernool et al., 2004</xref>). Each protomer consists of a central scaffolding trimerization domain and a peripheral transport domain containing the substrate and ion binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>). When bound to Na<sup>+</sup> and L-asp (‘fully bound’ from here on), each transport domain moves by ∼15 Å across the membrane from an outward- to an inward-facing position, in which the substrate binding site is near the extracellular solution and the cytoplasm, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>). Structurally symmetric helical hairpins, HP1 and HP2, occlude the bound substrate from the solvent and are thought to serve as gates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang and Tajkhorshid, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shrivastava et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeChancie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Focke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zomot and Bahar, 2013</xref>). Two Na<sup>+</sup>-binding sites (Na1 and Na2), neither of which directly coordinates the substrate, were identified crystallographically using thallium (Tl<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>). The location of the third Na<sup>+</sup>-binding site is being debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holley and Kavanaugh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang and Tajkhorshid, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larsson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastug et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Teichman et al., 2012</xref>). A highly conserved non-helical Asn310-Met311-Asp312 (NMD) motif interrupts trans-membrane segment (TM) 7 (see below). It lines the back of the substrate- and ion-binding sites and is involved in binding of the ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rosental et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rosental and Kanner, 2010</xref>). The main chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn310 contributes to Na1 site, while the side chain of Met311 protrudes between the substrate, Na1 and Na2 binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Symport requires that neither the substrate nor the ions alone are efficiently transported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crane, 1977</xref>). Therefore to traverse the membrane, the transport domains of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and EAATs must be loaded with both Na<sup>+</sup> ions and substrate. To complete the transport cycle, the transport domain of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> must also translocate readily when it is free of both solutes (apo), while in EAATs it requires binding of a K<sup>+</sup> ion. To establish the structural underpinnings of these processes, we determined crystal structures of the outward- and inward-facing states of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> in apo and ions-only bound forms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1 tbl2 tbl3">Tables 1, 2 and 3</xref>). We find that the apo transport domain shows identical structures when facing outward or inward. While ligand-binding sites are distorted, the domain remains compact, suggesting that it relocates across the membrane as a rigid body, similarly to when it is fully bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>). Ion binding to Na1 site, located deep in the core of the transport domain, triggers structural changes that are propagated to the extracellular gate HP2, at least in part, by the side chain of Met311 in the NMD motif. Consequently HP2, which in the apo form is collapsed into the substrate binding and Na2 sites, frees the sites, assuming conformations more similar to the conformation observed in the fully bound transporter. We suggest that these Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent structural changes underlie the high cooperativity of Na<sup>+</sup> and substrate binding, which is thought to be one of the key coupling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reyes et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, in the structure of Na<sup>+</sup>-bound outward-facing Glt<sub>Ph</sub> we observe opening of HP2 tip, which may facilitate L-asp access to its binding site and prevent the inward movement of the Na<sup>+</sup>-only bound transport domain, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Focke et al., 2011</xref>). Remarkably, soaks of apo Glt<sub>Ph</sub> crystals in Tl<sup>+</sup> reveal new cation-binding sites within the apo-like protein architecture. One such site overlaps with the substrate-binding site. Because binding of a cation to this site would compete with binding of Na<sup>+</sup> and the transported substrate, it is well suited to serve as a binding site for a counter-transported ion. We propose that the closed translocation-competent conformation of the transport domain free of Na<sup>+</sup> and substrate is intrinsically stable in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> but not in EAATs, in which K<sup>+</sup> binding at the newly identified site is required, coupling transport cycle completion to K<sup>+</sup> counter-transport.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id

When fully bound, Glt<sub>Ph</sub>-R397A crystallizes in the outward-facing state, like wild type Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, except that L-asp coordination is slightly altered because the mutant is missing the key coordinating side chain of Arg397 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bendahan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>). These results suggest that R397A is suitable to capture the apo and ions-only bound outward-facing states for their structural characterization.

Our structures of the apo and fully bound Glt<sub>Ph</sub> suggest that binding of L-asp and Na<sup>+</sup> at the Na2 site is coupled because the same structural element, the tip of HP2, contributes to both sites and is restructured upon binding. Thus, structural changes in HP2 upon binding of either L-asp or Na<sup>+</sup> ion should greatly favor binding of the other.</p><p>Met311 in the NMD motif is the only residue that is shared between the Na1 site and the substrate and Na2 sites and also undergoes a conformational change upon ligand binding. To examine whether the structural changes in HP2 upon binding of L-asp and Na<sup>+</sup> at the Na2 site could occur independently from those in the NMD motif upon Na<sup>+</sup> binding at the Na1 site, we modeled transport domains with HP2 in the bound conformation and the NMD motif in the apo conformation, or <italic>vice versa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

For these mutants, generated in the context of unconstrained wild type Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and inward cross-linked Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>in</sup>, we measured the dependence of L-asp dissociation constant on Na<sup>+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). While this dependence is very steep for the wild type Glt<sub>Ph</sub> constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reyes et al., 2013</xref>) and nearly as steep for the M311L mutants, it is substantially shallower for the M311A mutants. The most parsimonious interpretation of these results is that M311A mutation reduces binding cooperativity between the substrate and Na<sup>+</sup> ions. However, it is also possible, though we think unlikely, that the mutation abrogates ion binding at one or more Na<sup>+</sup>-binding sites in the tested concentration range (1–100 mM). Mutating the equivalent methionine to smaller residues in EAAT3 also resulted in less steep dependence of the ionic currents on Na<sup>+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rosental and Kanner, 2010</xref>). Based on these results, we hypothesize that Met311 is key to the allosteric coupling between the Na1, L-asp and Na2 sites. Consistently, bulky methionine or leucine residues are found at this position in ∼85% of glutamate transporter homologues. However, it should be noted that methionine is conserved in the Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and EAATs, while a characterized proton-coupled homologue has leucine at this position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaillard et al., 1996</xref>). Hence, it is possible that the methionine thioether, which is proximal to both Na1 and Na2 sites, plays a direct role in Na<sup>+</sup> binding.</p><p>Our hypothesis further predicts that binding of an ion at Na1 site should prime the transporter to accept its substrate. Therefore, we crystallized Glt<sub>Ph</sub>-R397A in the presence of 400 mM Na<sup>+</sup>, but in the absence of L-asp. We also soaked crystals of apo Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>in</sup> in Tl<sup>+</sup>, an ion with strong anomalous signal that seems to mimic some aspects of Na<sup>+</sup> in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and EAATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tao et al., 2008</xref>). The obtained outward- and inward-facing structures pictured the transport domains in conformations overall similar to those observed in the fully bound transporter: straightened TM3, Met311 pointing toward the binding sites, extended helix in HP2a and HP2 tip raised out of the substrate binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). Indeed, the structure of Tl<sup>+</sup>-bound Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>in</sup> is indistinguishable from the fully bound Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>in</sup> and both Na1 and Na2 sites are occupied by Tl<sup>+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The structure of Na<sup>+</sup>-bound Glt<sub>Ph</sub>-R397A differs significantly from the fully bound Glt<sub>Ph</sub>-R397A only at the tip of HP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, also see below). The coordinating residues at the Na1 site are correctly positioned and the site is likely occupied by a Na<sup>+</sup> ion. The Na2 site still shows a distorted geometry: the last helical turn of HP2a points away from the site due to the altered conformation of the tip of HP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Collectively, our results demonstrate that binding of the coupled ions, notably at the Na1 site, is sufficient to trigger isomerization of the transport domain from the apo conformation to the bound-like conformation. The energetic penalty associated with this isomerization likely explains why Na<sup>+</sup> ions alone bind weakly to the transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reyes et al., 2013</xref>). This experimental observation contrasts with highly favorable calculated binding energies (approximately −10 kcal/mol for Na1) that were obtained using fully bound protein conformation and where the reference ion-free state is the same as the bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larsson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastug et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heinzelmann et al., 2013</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02283.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Structures of ions-only bound transport domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Superimposition of the fully bound transport domains (grey) and Tl<sup>+</sup>-bound Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>in</sup> transport domain in the bound-like conformation (colors), with the averaged anomalous difference Fourier map contoured at 8σ (cyan mesh).

In this structure, the transport domain tilts towards the trimerization domain but does not yet undergo a significant translation toward the cytoplasm. We find that such intermediate state with the opened tip of HP2 can be achieved without major steric clashes, while further progression of the transport domain to the inward-facing position could be impeded because the tip is likely to clash with TM5 in the trimerization domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Also in the inward-facing state HP2 is packed against the trimerization domain and cannot open in a manner observed in the outward-facing state.

We suggest that the structural changes in the NMD motif and HP2 that are triggered upon Na<sup>+</sup> binding at the Na1 site may lead to the loss of direct interactions between the tip of HP2 and the rest of the transport domain, resulting in tip opening. Subsequent binding of L-asp and Na<sup>+</sup> at the Na2 site is then required to provide compensatory interactions, allowing HP2 tip to close. Similar conformational behavior has been observed for transporters with the LeuT fold: when bound to Na<sup>+</sup> ions only, substrate binding sites are open to the extracellular solution, and substrate binding is required for occlusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weyand et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</xref>).</p><p>We do not see a transition into an open conformation in the inward-facing Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>in</sup> bound to Tl<sup>+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This may be because Tl<sup>+</sup> ions do not faithfully mimic Na<sup>+</sup> ions and fail to induce an open state or it may be because Na<sup>+</sup> bound inward-facing state is, indeed, closed. This latter possibility does not contradict the requirements of symport because the measured dissociation constant for Na<sup>+</sup> ions in the inward-facing state (250 mM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reyes et al., 2013</xref>), is far above Na<sup>+</sup> concentration in the cytoplasm (10 mM) and therefore, Na<sup>+</sup>-bound inward-facing state is not expected to be significantly populated.</p><p>We and others have proposed that transition intermediates mediate fluxes of polar solutes, including anions, because potentially hydrated cavities form in such intermediates at the interface between the trimerization and transport domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stolzenberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Verdon and Boudker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2013</xref>).

However, it is remarkable that the Ct site is positioned exactly at the same place as the amino group of the bound L-asp and share several coordinating moieties. Therefore, binding of a cation at the Ct site and binding of the substrate are mutually exclusive. Because the Ct site is observed only in the apo-like conformation, cation binding at this site would also inhibit the transition into the bound-like conformation upon Na<sup>+</sup> binding at the Na1 site. Finally, the Ct site is observed in both the inward- and outward-facing states, suggesting that the apo-like transport domain could carry the ion across the membrane. These are the exact properties expected for the K<sup>+</sup>-binding site in EAATs. Moreover, it has been previously proposed that K<sup>+</sup> binds to EAATs at a similar position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holley and Kavanaugh, 2009</xref>). Most remarkably, in an insect K<sup>+</sup>-independent dicarboxylate transporter, an asparagine to aspartate mutation at the position equivalent to Asp394 in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> changes the transporter substrate specificity to amino acid glutamate, and also leads to dependence on K<sup>+</sup> counter-transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore this aspartate plays a key role in both binding the amino group of substrate and coupling to K<sup>+</sup> counter-transport. Consistently, Asp394 in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> coordinates both the amino group of the bound substrate and Tl<sup>+</sup> in the Ct site. Notably, while Tl<sup>+</sup> mimics, to some extent, Na<sup>+</sup> ions in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and EAATs, it is a better mimic of K<sup>+</sup> ions in EAATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tao et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Movement of HP1 in the inward-facing state</title><p>To examine whether a complete removal of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions had an effect on the structure of Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>in</sup>, we soaked apo Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>in</sup> crystals (typically grown in the presence of K<sup>+</sup>) in alkali-free buffer. Interestingly, we observed a small, but reproducible structural change in several crystals examined: HP1 and TM7a that form the transport domain cytoplasmic surface moved slightly towards TM8, with the tip of HP1 detaching from that of HP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Consistently, previous spectroscopic studies showed that the transport domains continuously sample the outward- and inward-facing positions with nearly equal probabilities either when bound to Na<sup>+</sup> and L-asp or when free of the solutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akyuz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erkens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Georgieva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanelt et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, these transitions are more frequent in the apo transporter, consistent with a lack of large energetic barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akyuz et al., 2013</xref>). In Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, the compact translocation-competent apo conformation of the transport domain is stabilized by interactions between the collapsed HP2, and HP1, TM7, and TM8. In EAATs, by contrast, we speculate that these interactions are insufficient and that K<sup>+</sup> binding to the Ct site is required to stabilize the translocation-competent closed conformation that can return to the outside, ensuring coupling between substrate uptake and counter-transport of K<sup>+</sup> ion. Local structural differences in EAATs in the vicinity of the Ct site may underlie the higher affinity and specificity of this site for K<sup>+</sup> ion.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown structurally that ion binding and unbinding events in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and, by analogy, in EAATs control the conformational state of the transporter, determining its competence to bind substrate and undergo transitions between the outward- and inward-facing states. Studies establishing the location of the Na3 binding site; the potential role of the Ct site in binding K<sup>+</sup>; and the gating mechanism in the inward-facing state will be necessary to verify and refine our proposed mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA constructs, mutagenesis, protein expression, and purification</title><p>R397A mutation was introduced by PCR into Glt<sub>Ph</sub> containing seven point mutations to histidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yernool et al., 2004</xref>), referred as wild type Glt<sub>Ph</sub> for brevity.

Your article has been very favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, John Kuriyan, a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Lucy Forrest, has agreed to reveal her identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Senior editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Boudker and colleagues present a manuscript describing structures and binding data for the prokaryotic asparate transporter GltPh, an important reference system for the neuronal glutamate transporters of the EAAT family. The manuscript contains an array of important data, including substrate-free states, and sodium-only states, that together provide crucial insights into ion-substrate coupling and transporter conformational dynamics. The several crystal structures for ion-bound apo state allow for the first time a dissection of the exact mechanism of coupling in this system. The findings are in line with previous work and the proposed mechanisms of translocation of the apo states and the Na coupling makes perfect sense. The discussion on a tentative location of K+ binding site, while offering a plausible explanation (and a novel one) remains a little speculative. However, the authors are careful in the interpretation of the K sites and these sites might be the ones used in EAATs. Nevertheless, this is novel and rigorous study of a high caliber! One of the reviewers describes the paper as “a great manuscript”.</p><p>The following comments are collated from the individual reviews. The authors should pay attention to them when submitting a revised manuscript, and provide an itemized response. The revised manuscript will be dealt with by the editors, and will not be sent out for further external review, so you should expect a quick final decision.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1</italic>:</p><p>1) Introduction section; not clear what “reflect weaker coupling” refers to. The slope only tells something about how many Na could be involved in the conformational changes, not anything about coupling. Maybe it would be good to clearly state what the measurement really mean. A Hill coefficient of 1 doesn't mean that only 1 ion binds. Is this the same case here?</p><p>2) The off rate of aspartate is dependent on all conformational changes in the cycle and the coupling could be very indirect by Na affecting another step in the cycle. This should be stated.</p><p>3) Not clear what is meant by “trigger isomerization from apo... to bound ... conformation”; Isomerization of what?</p><p>4) It is also not clear why the isomerization would make the Na affinity low. Previous molecular modelling has proposed that Na binds with low affinity to the GltPh sites (without any isomerization needed to explain this low affinity).</p><p>5) Are the two Tl<sup>+</sup> sites occupied at the same time or in different crystals?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. It is not clear from the model figure how the substrate and ions come of the transporter in the inward state?</p><p>7) In the Introduction, it is stated that Na1 binding form the Na2 and asp binding sites. However, this is confusing, since also Na1 binding opens the Hp2 gate which should prevent Na2 binding. Please state carefully what Na1 does.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref> is not very legible.</p><p>9) Previous experiments and modeling have suggested that the apo state returns by adopting a similar conformation as the fully loaded transporter. The present crystals fully support this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2</italic>:</p><p>1) General remark. R/A mutation used in this paper may affect overall electrostatic of the pocket and thus bias packing of ions. Some cautious remarks should be put in the manuscript.</p><p>2) While describing replacement of M311 with Leu the authors states: “similarly bulky” for L311 replacement. I am unsure if it is exactly correct statement. Furthermore, M311 was assigned a variety of roles in the past including tentative participation in stabilization of Tl<sup>+</sup> in the binding pocket due to high polarizability. Any comments/discussions to that end would be beneficial. Tl<sup>+</sup> marking of Na1/Na2 site remains a little bit of a mystery. Thus, it is not only volume but also chemistry of a side-chain that may be important.</p><p>3) The hypothesis about ion “priming” the site for substrate acceptance is interesting. Zhao et al. (PLoS Comput Biol 9(10): e1003296) described recently a fairly similar mechanism for MhP1 where transporter appears to get “primed” for substrate by binding of an ion stabilizing one of the states. Some discussion on this seemingly general mechanism, which may exist in other systems may benefit this manuscript. It is entirely up to the authors, but again it may represent a general mechanism of allosteric coupling during secondary transport.</p><p>4) Furthermore, the idea of shuttling of a “compact” state of this transporter is interesting and well supported by two side-by-side publications in Nat Stuct Biology, but still some additional discussion on possible energetics of this process would be advantageous! The large protein has to move a great length across the membrane plain.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3</italic>:</p><p>1) My only substantive query is why several of the structures have not been deposited in the PDB. These are all structures at &gt;4 Angstrom resolution, but I'm not sure that is sufficient reason; this may come down to journal policy.</p><p>2) I didn't follow the arguments regarding the evidence for priming of the transporter by Na1. For example, the Na2 site is distorted in GltPh-R397A+Na, so its structure is not really similar to the bound state. Maybe it would help to separate out the figures of the outward-open R397A+Na from those of the inward-facing Tl-bound. Or perhaps the phrasing just needs a little reworking.</p><p>3) In the Introduction section I was confused by these statements: “Met311 in the NMD motif is the only residue that is shared between the Na1 site and the substrate and Na2 sites and also undergoes a conformational change upon ligand binding.” Which are the reference states in each case? Are the authors only comparing the trimerization domains?</p><p>4) I would welcome quantitation of the similarity between domains in the different states, using RMSDs of the backbone and of all atoms. It would put the differences in context relative to the crystallographic resolution.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>, it is not yet explained what is meant by the Ct site, so the labeling is confusing.</p><p>6) It would be good to label/show S92 and T93 in TM3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> or Figure 3–supplement, as they are referenced in the text.</p><p>7) The phrase “in the context of unconstrained GltPh and GltPh-in” is not immediately clear.</p><p>8) The legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> should clarify which structure is in colors. In that figure, I found it difficult to keep track of which structure was which.</p><p>9) Which figure is referred to for the Tl data? Could the authors comment on why Na2 is bound in GltPh-in in the absence of substrate? How does this relate to the point about coupling requiring?</p><p>10) I would say that since <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref> does not illustrate the progression of the transport domain beyond the intermediate structure, the authors should rephrase to “because the tip would presumably clash with TM5”</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> legend: I think that the word dynamic should be removed from the legend title; the figure clearly shows changes between two structures under two conditions, but dynamics aren't clearly demonstrated by the figure.</p><p>12) PDB identifiers will need to be added to the tables.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02283.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p><italic>1) Introduction section; not clear what “reflect weaker coupling” refers to.

This should be stated</italic>.</p><p>This could be indeed the case in the wild-type transporter. However, we note that the loss of cooperativity is also observed in the transporter that is cross-linked in the inward facing state, suggesting that binding/dissociation in this isolated state is affected. We hope that using “binding cooperativity” rather than “coupling” in the revised manuscript eliminates the ambiguity.</p><p><italic>3) Not clear what is meant by “trigger isomerization from apo... to bound ... conformation”: Isomerization of what?</italic></p><p>Here, we refer to the isomerization of the transport domain.

Although the same soaking conditions were used, we obtained two types of crystals. In one, Tl<sup>+</sup> ions incorporated at the canonical Na1 and Na2 sites, and the protein was in a bound -like conformation. In the other, Tl<sup>+</sup> ions incorporated at the two new Ct and Na2’ sites in the apo conformation. Both Ct and Na2’ sites were occupied in all three protomers. To determine whether the two sites were occupied at the same time in each molecule in the crystal, we would have to refine the occupancies of the Tl sites. Our occupancy estimates are 40-80%. However, the resolution of the data is not sufficient to estimate reliably these occupancies. Hence, we think that the sites are very likely occupied at the same time, but cannot state this with certainty. Therefore, we did not include such discussion in the text.</p><p><italic>6)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10"><italic>Figure 10</italic></xref><italic>.

However, this is confusing, since also Na1 binding opens the Hp2 gate which should prevent Na2 binding. Please state carefully what Na1 does</italic>.</p><p>We have restated this more clearly. In brief, Na<sup>+</sup> binding to the Na1 site is coupled through movements of Met311 to the structural transitions in HP2. While HP2 is collapsed in the apo form of the transporter and occupies the substrate binding and Na2 sites, in the Na<sup>+</sup>-bound form it frees these sites and assumes conformations that are more similar to the fully bound form. We have clarified this point in the text.</p><p><italic>8)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6e</italic></xref> <italic>is not very legible</italic>.</p><p>We have increased the size of the panel and the font size for the residue numbers.</p><p><italic>9) Previous experiments and modeling have suggested that the apo state returns by adopting a similar conformation as the fully loaded transporter.

R/A mutation used in this paper may affect overall electrostatic of the pocket and thus bias packing of ions. Some cautious remarks should be put in the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We have added the following statement in the Introduction section: “These results suggest that R397A is suitable to capture the apo and ions-only bound outward-facing states for their structural characterization.

We agree with the reviewer that the role of the methionine residue side chain in Tl<sup>+</sup> and/or Na<sup>+</sup> binding remains poorly understood. We also note that from sequence analysis, it appears that Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled members of the family have Met at this position. In contrast, the members that are more likely to be proton-coupled (those, for example, that lack Asp405, one amino acid whose side chain is clearly involved in Na<sup>+</sup>-binding) have Leu at this position. While our data do not allow us to explain the role that the other group of Met311 may play in Na<sup>+</sup> binding, we made a relevant comment in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) The hypothesis about ion “priming” the site for substrate acceptance is interesting.

(PLoS Comput Biol 9(10): e1003296) described recently a fairly similar mechanism for MhP1 where transporter appears to get “primed” for substrate by binding of an ion stabilizing one of the states. Some discussion on this seemingly general mechanism, which may exist in other systems may benefit this manuscript. It is entirely up to the authors, but again it may represent a general mechanism of allosteric coupling during secondary transport</italic>.</p><p>We feel that the “priming” role for the Na<sup>+</sup> ions in Mhp transporters proposed by Zhao and Noskov is distinct from their role in Glt<sub>Ph</sub>. In Mhp, the proposed key role of Na<sup>+</sup> ions is to stabilize outward facing state compared to the inward facing state. In Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, we propose that the role of Na<sup>+</sup> ions is local: structurally organizing the substrate-binding site within either the outward-facing or the inward-facing state. Hence, we feel that inclusion of the reference to Zhao and Noskov’s work may bring confusion. We have however added references to the crystal structures of Na<sup>+</sup>-only bound Mhp and LeuT transporters that, like Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, show open structures.</p><p><italic>4) Furthermore, the idea of shuttling of a “compact” state of this transporter is interesting and well supported by two side-by-side publications in Nat Stuct Biology, but still some additional discussion on possible energetics of this process would be advantageous! The large protein has to move a great length across the membrane plain</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is fascinating that such large conformational changes can occur readily in membranes. We note also that large and rapid transitions somewhat reminiscent of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> have recently been proposed for the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger. While the dynamics is an important question for us, the current manuscript does not add significantly to the topic, other than to suggest that the apo transport domain may move in a manner overall similar to that of the fully loaded protein. We feel that extending the discussion on energetics here would not be appropriate.</p><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p><italic>1) My only substantive query is why several of the structures have not been deposited in the PDB. These are all structures at &gt;4 Angstrom resolution, but I'm not sure that is sufficient reason; this may come down to journal policy</italic>.</p><p>We have also deposited the structure of Tl-bound GltPhin in the bound-like conformation. Regarding the other structures, we think that the structures do not provide additional structural information. They were used only to evaluate monitor the anomalous signal of Tl<sup>+</sup> ions at the Ct and Na2’ sites.</p><p><italic>2) I didn't follow the arguments regarding the evidence for priming of the transporter by Na1. For example, the Na2 site is distorted in GltPh-R397A+Na, so its structure is not really similar to the bound state. Maybe it would help to separate out the figures of the outward-open R397A+Na from those of the inward-facing Tl-bound. Or perhaps the phrasing just needs a little reworking</italic>.</p><p>We have improved this paragraph. The key clarification is: “The obtained outward- and inward-facing structures pictured the transport domains in conformations overall similar to those observed in the fully bound transporter: straightened TM3, Met311 pointing towards the binding sites, extended helix in HP2a and HP2 tip raised out of the substrate binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6a-d</xref>).” The remainder of the paragraph better separates the discussion on the inward and outward facings states to avoid confusion. Finally, we added a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>), which shows RMSDs per residue between the transport domains of the various states presented. From this figure, it is clear that Na<sup>+</sup>-binding triggers most of the structural changes that are associated with loading of the transport domain.</p><p><italic>3) In the Introduction</italic> <italic>section I</italic> <italic>was confused by these statements: “Met311 in the NMD motif is the only residue that is shared between the Na1 site and the substrate and Na2 sites and also undergoes a conformational change upon ligand binding</italic>.<italic>” Which are the reference states in each case? Are the authors only comparing the trimerization domains?</italic></p><p>We wanted to point out that the positions and orientations of the transport domains relative to the trimerization domains are the same in the apo and fully bound forms. The conformations of the transport domains themselves are significantly different. We have rephrased the sentence.</p><p><italic>4) I would welcome quantitation of the similarity between domains in the different states, using RMSDs of the backbone and of all atoms. It would put the differences in context relative to the crystallographic resolution</italic>.</p><p>We have generated new figures, including <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c</xref>, where we show RMSDs for main chain atoms of the transport domains calculated between equivalent residues in different structural states. These figures clarify the extent of the structural changes and similarities between the various states.</p><p><italic>5) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1"><italic>Figure 4–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>, it is not yet explained what is meant by the Ct site, so the labeling is confusing</italic>.</p><p>We have moved the figure and the corresponding discussion to the section on Ct site so that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref> has become <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–Figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) It would be good to label/show S92 and T93 in TM3 in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>or</italic> <italic>Figure 3–supplement</italic><italic>, as they are referenced in the text</italic>.</p><p>We have added the labels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–Figure supplement 1</xref></p><p><italic>7) The phrase “in the context of unconstrained GltPh and GltPh-in” is not immediately clear</italic>.</p><p>We have clarified this: “unconstrained wild-type GltPh and inward cross-linked Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>in</sup>”</p><p><italic>8) The legend of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6c</italic></xref> <italic>should clarify which structure is in colors.

We have also added the discussion on coupling. In brief, it is possible that the closed Tl<sup>+</sup>-bound inward-facing state observed in crystallo reflects the closed Na<sup>+</sup>-bound inward -facing state of the transporter. This does not violate the principle of coupled symport because the affinity for Na<sup>+</sup> in this state is very low (Kd∼250 mM) and in the cytoplasm where the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration is expected to be around ∼ 10 mM, so this state is not expected to be significantly populated.</p><p><italic>10) I would say that since</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7b</italic></xref> <italic>does not illustrate the progression of the transport domain beyond the intermediate structure, the authors should rephrase to “because the tip would presumably clash with TM5”</italic>.</p><p>We have rephrased this part of the sentence as follows: “further progression of the transport domain to the inward-facing position could be impeded because the tip is likely to clash with TM5 in the trimerization domain”.</p><p><italic>11)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9</italic></xref> <italic>legend: I think that the word dynamic should be removed from the legend title; the figure clearly shows changes between two structures under two conditions, but dynamics aren't clearly demonstrated by the figure</italic>.</p><p><italic>We have changed the title to “Movements of the HP1-TM7a structural module”</italic></p><p><italic>12) PDB identifiers will need to be added to the tables</italic>.</p><p>PDB codes have been added to the tables.</p></body></sub-article></article>
