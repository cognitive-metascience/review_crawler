In addition to intrinsic developmental programmes and the pattern of electrical activity, a wide variety of extrinsic signals orchestrate the growth and remodeling of dendrites during development and maturation, including delta-notch, Eph-Ephrins, cell adhesion molecules, neurotrophins, semaphorins and slits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Metzger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Valnegri et al., 2015</xref>). One of the latest groups of proteins recognized to modulate growth of neural processes during development is the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF), the 19 members of which are best understood for their many roles in the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hehlgans and Pfeffer, 2005</xref>). They are active both as membrane-integrated ligands and as soluble ligands following cleavage from the cell membrane, and bind to one or more members of the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF). In addition, several TNFRSF members can also function as ligands for membrane-integrated TNFSF binding partners and initiate reverse signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sun and Fink, 2007</xref>). Most of the work on the TNFSF and TNFRSF on the regulation of neural process growth has focused on PNS neurons, where several members of these superfamilies act on different kinds of neurons during circumscribed phases of development, either enhancing or inhibiting axon growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Desbarats et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Gavaldà et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gutierrez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kisiswa et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">McWilliams et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">O'Keeffe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wheeler et al., 2014</xref>).

CD40 and its ligand CD40L play key roles in immune responses and in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Peters et al., 2009</xref>). CD40 and CD40L have also recently been implicated in regulating sympathetic axon growth and are required for establishing the innervation of particular tissues in the developing PNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">McWilliams et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we focused on the two most extensively characterized populations of excitatory and inhibitory projection neurons in the mouse brain, the excitatory glutamatergic pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and the inhibitory GABA-ergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum. Hippocampal pyramidal neurons are one of the best-characterized models for studying the differentiation and growth of axons and dendrites during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kaech and Banker, 2006</xref>). MSNs comprise the majority of neurons in the striatum, have extensive dendritic arbors, project to the surrounding nuclei of the basal ganglia and their degeneration is the pathognomonic feature of Huntington’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Reiner et al., 1988</xref>). Both kinds of neurons are easily recognized by their distinctive morphologies in vivo and can be cultured at a stage when they are elaborating dendrites and are the major cell type in culture. Our demonstration that CD40-activated CD40L reverse signaling has pronounced and distinctive effects on the growth and elaboration of dendrites from different classes of neurons in vitro and in vivo has important implications for neural development and the establishment and function of neural circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phenotypic changes in the dendrites of excitatory and inhibitory neurons of <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice</title><p>Golgi preparations carried out on <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice at postnatal day 10 (P10) revealed that the size and complexity of the dendritic arbors of hippocampal pyramidal neurons and striatal MSNs were markedly affected in the absence of CD40, but in opposite ways. The dendritic arbors of the excitatory pyramidal neurons of the CA fields of the hippocampus of <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were dramatically stunted compared with those of <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>+/+</sup> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Representative high power images show that the reduction of dendrite size and complexity in <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice affected both apical and basal dendrite compartments of these excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Because the dendrite arbors of pyramidal neurons in CA1 are normally less exuberant than those of other CA regions, CA1 pyramidal dendrites were especially amenable to analysis, which was carried out separately on the apical and basal compartments. This revealed marked and highly significant reductions in total dendrite length in both apical (p=6.02×10<sup>−16</sup>) and basal (p=4.75×10<sup>−14</sup>) compartments of <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice compared with <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>+/+</sup> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Western blotting revealed that both CD40 and CD40L are expressed in the hippocampus and striatum throughout development and in the adult, with highest levels of both proteins postnatally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Double labelling with anti-MAP2, which labels dendrites, showed that CD40 and CD40L are expressed throughout the dendrite fields of pyramidal and striatal neurons and double labelling with anti-GFAP, which labels astrocytes, showed that CD40 and CD40L are also expressed by these cells.

Analysis of Golgi preparations of CD40-deficient postnatal mice revealed that the apical and basal dendrite arbors of excitatory hippocampal pyramidal neurons were very much smaller and less branched than those of wild type littermates whereas the dendrite arbors of inhibitory striatal medium spiny neurons were greatly increased in size and more branched in the absence of CD40. These pronounced and opposite in vivo phenotypic changes were replicated in excitatory and inhibitory neurons cultured from <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. In both cases, these distinctive in vitro phenotypes were completely rescued in neurons cultured from <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice by soluble CD40 (CD40-Fc), and were mimicked in neurons cultured from <italic>Cd40</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice by soluble CD40L treatment. These observations together with our demonstration that both hippocampal excitatory and striatal inhibitory neurons display CD40L immunoreactivity, suggests that CD40 exerts its distinctive effects on dendrite arborisation in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons by a reverse signalling mechanism.</p><p>Our demonstration that both hippocampal excitatory pyramidal neurons and striatal inhibitory medium spiny neurons co-express CD40L and CD40 raise the possibility that CD40 activates CD40L in both kinds of neurons by an autocrine mechanism. We have previously reported that CD40-activated CD40L reverse signaling enhances axon growth from developing sympathetic neurons in vitro and contributes to the establishment of the sympathetic innervation of a specific subset of tissues in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">McWilliams et al., 2015</xref>). Because sympathetic neurons co-express CD40 and CD40L and can be cultured at exceptionally low density, it was possible to demonstrate that CD40-activates CD40L in sympathetic neurons by an autocrine mechanism. Because pyramidal neurons and MSNs have to be grown at much higher density and because these cultures contain a variety of cell types, including glial cells, it has not been possible to exclude the possibility that CD40L is also activated by paracrine mechanism in CNS neurons. Our demonstration that GFAP-positive astrocytes express CD40 and reports that microglia express low levels of CD40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Carson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nguyen et al., 1998</xref>) raise the possibility that CNS glia may play a role in activating CD40L in neurons. However, since CD40L and CD40 play a central role in immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Peters et al., 2009</xref>), it is possible that microglial CD40 is related primarily to immune function, especially as CD40 is upregulated in these cells by proinflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Carson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nguyen et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>A growing body of evidence has implicated several members of the TNFSF in the regulation of axon growth and tissue innervation in developing PNS by either forward or reverse signalling mechanisms. Typically, individual TNFSF members act on restricted populations of PNS neurons and either promote axon growth or inhibit axon growth-promoting effects of neurotrophins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Desbarats et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Gavaldà et al., 2009</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kisiswa et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">McWilliams et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">O'Keeffe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wheeler et al., 2014</xref>). Here we not only demonstrate marked physiologically relevant effects of CD40L reverse signalling on dendrite growth and branching in functionally different kinds of CNS neurons but show that CD40-activated CD40L reverse signalling can either promote or inhibit dendritic arborisation in different kinds of neurons. Our work reveals that a particular TNFSF member exerts distinctive, neuron-specific effects on CNS dendrite growth. In addition to the hippocampal and striatal neurons studied here, it is clear that CD40 and CD40L are widely expressed in the developing brain neurons (not shown). Thus, it is possible that CD40 has more widespread effects on the growth of neural processes in the developing brain than those documented here.</p><p>In addition to our demonstration that CD40 is physiologically relevant regulator of dendrite growth in the developing brain in vivo, we showed that CD40-activated CD40L-mediated reverse signalling promotes hippocampal pyramidal axon growth in vitro. This raises the possibility that CD40-activated CD40L-mediated reverse signalling may be a physiologically important regulator of pyramidal neuron axon growth in vivo. However, because the full extent of hippocampal pyramidal axons cannot be reliably discerned in Golgi preparations, we were not able to establish whether CD40L reverse signalling is physiological relevant for pyramidal axon growth in vivo. We have reported that the TNFSF member APRIL enhances the axon growth, but not dendrite growth, from cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Osório et al., 2014</xref>), although the physiological relevance of this observation is unclear. However, we have recently shown that APRIL enhances axon growth from cultured midbrain dopaminergic neurons and that the initial nigrostriatal projection is significantly compromised in <italic>April</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">McWilliams et al., 2017</xref>)</p><p>It has been reported that CD40 expression is retained in the adult brain, with most of the neurons of the dentate gyrus, hippocampal pyramidal layer and 60% of neurons in cerebral neocortex retaining expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tan et al., 2002</xref>). There is also some evidence for a neurodegenerative phenotype in aged CD40-deficient mice, with TUNEL-positive cells in the dentate gyrus, hippocampal pyramidal cell layer and neocortex and decreased level of neurofilament isoforms in whole brain lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tan et al., 2002</xref>). Although the reason for these late degenerative changes is unclear, it is possible that the marked reduction in the size and complexity of pyramidal neuron dendritic arbors that we have documented in the postnatal and adult brain may contribute by impairing trophic maintenance of the degenerating neurons.</p><p>Our demonstration that pharmacological inhibition of PKC completely prevented the rescue of the distinctive dendrite phenotypes of CD40-deficient hippocampal and striatal neurons by soluble CD40-Fc and that pharmacological activation of PKC was as effective as CD40-Fc in rescuing these phenotypes suggests that PKC activation is an essential step in the effect of CD40-activated CD40L reverse signalling on dendrite growth in both kinds of neurons. This finding extends the importance of PKC in mediating the axon growth response of developing sympathetic neurons to TNFR1-activated TNF reverse signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kisiswa et al., 2017</xref>) to another example of TNFSF reverse signaling affecting neural process growth. Moreover, it shows that PKC activation mediates both the growth-promoting and growth-inhibitory effects of reverse signaling in different kinds of neurons. PKC inhibition also prevents enhanced neurite growth from cultured embryonic hippocampal neurons by neuregulin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gerecke et al., 2004</xref>), whereas PKC activation increases dendrite growth and branching from these neurons by modulating neurotrophin synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lim and Alkon, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Using specific siRNA to knockdown the expression of different PKC isoforms, we have implicated the selective participation of PKC-β and PKC-γ in mediating the opposite effects of CD40L reverse signaling on dendrite growth from hippocampal pyramidal neurons and MSNs, respectively. While our findings do to exclude the participation of additional PKC isoforms in the signaling networks leading to increases or decreases in dendrite growth and branching, it will be intriguing in future work to ascertain how PKC-β and PKC-γ play these distinctive roles in neurons.</p><p>Our current study extends the role of CD40L reverse signalling from modulating the growth of a subset of sympathetic axons in the PNS to that of a major, physiologically relevant regulator of dendrite growth and elaboration in the developing CNS, having distinctive and opposite effects on excitatory and inhibitory neurons. This work raises a host of important questions for future work, including how extensively CD40L reverse signalling regulates neuronal morphology and the functional properties of neural circuits, what are behavioural consequences of the major cellular phenotypes observed in CD40-deficient mice, its role in neural plasticity in the adult and what its contribution to the neurological sequelae of CNS inflammatory conditions might be.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Mice were housed in a 12 hr light-dark cycle with access to food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>.

The work uses both in vivo and in vitro analysis and identifies PKC as a mediator of CD40 function. Since CD40 and CD40L have generally been studied in the immune system, this work will have a very high impact on both fields. Given that the authors uncover distinct effects on excitatory and inhibitory neurons, this work is distinct from the work on CD40 and CD40L in the PNS.</p><p>The manuscript is well-written and very easy to follow. The data are of high quality and appropriate controls were performed.</p><p>I have two questions.</p><p>1) Did the authors observe any changes to inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus in the knockout animals? Or in culture (although this may be difficult to study as only 10% of neurons are inhibitory)?</p><p>2) Please perform two-way ANOVA for Sholl curve statistics.</p><p>In sum, this is a complete story.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Carriba and Davies report on a novel role of CD40/CD40 ligand signaling in developing CNS neurons. Interestingly, the effects of CD40 gene knockout on hippocampal pyramidal neurons and striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) are opposite, both in vivo and in vitro: Loss of CD40 decreased hippocampal neuron complexity, whereas MSN complexity increased. The authors then used soluble CD40L as dominantly-interfering agent to inhibit CD40/CD40L interaction in cultured wild-type neurons, and soluble CD40-Fc to activate CD40L reverse signaling in cultured CD40-/- neurons. The results suggest that CD40-induced CD40L reverse signaling promotes and restricts growth of hippocampal neurons and MSNs, respectively. In a first attempt to get at the underlying mechanism, the authors pharmacologically interfered with PKC activity and found, somewhat unsatisfactorily, that PKC activity mediates both the growth of hippocampal neurons and growth suppression of MSNs.</p><p>I find that the experiments were executed with care and competence, the results convincing and reasonably comprehensive, and most importantly unexpected and somewhat surprising, such that they may spark the interest of readers outside the immediate field of TNF superfamily cytokines.</p><p>1) The in vivo neuron complexity data were taken from only one time point (P10). To raise significance of their findings, the authors need to add at least one later time point (e.g. P30) to exclude that the effects of CD40 elimination on hippocampal neurons and MSNs are transient.</p><p>2) The observation of a morphological change in a mutant mouse brain is interesting and an excellent starting point; however, the description of a correlating alteration in physiological properties of the neurons or in a relevant behavioral paradigm would be so much more interesting and at the same time validate the observed morphological changes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Carriba and Davies examines the role of CD40, an integral membrane protein, in dendritic development. Several studies have demonstrated that activation of CD40 by its ligand CD40L or CD154 in T cells results in the activation of antigen presenting cells. However, the role of these proteins remains poorly understood in the nervous system.</p><p>By analysing CD40 knock out mutant mice the authors discovered the exciting find that this protein plays contrasting roles in dendritic arborisation in different neuronal cell types. Loss of function of CD40 in hippocampal neurons results in decreased dendritic branching. In contrast, in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum deficiency in CD40 results in the formation of more elaborated dendrites.

Moreover, using pharmacological approaches, the authors demonstrated a role of PKC in mediating these effects.</p><p>The paper presents new and exciting data. Importantly, the experiments are well conducted and the phenotype is striking and clear. However, the authors need to examine in more detail the mechanisms by which CD40 promotes and suppresses dendritic arborisation in these different cell types.

Hippocampal pyramidal and striatal medium spiny neurons are among the most extensively characterized major classes of neurons in the developing CNS. They have characteristic morphologies in vivo, facilitating studies of dendrite morphology in the intact animal. They can be easily cultured as the predominant cell type in cultures set up from particular embryonic stages, facilitating signaling studies. Because the stages of dendritogensis are very well-characterized in these neurons in vitro, cultures are especially suitable for studying the factors that influence dendrite growth and branching. We make these points in the revised text.</p><p>CD40 and CD40L are indeed widely expressed in CNS, and we have preliminary evidence that CD40 reverse signaling influences the growth of dendrites from cortical pyramidal neurons, but have not followed this up because dendritogenesis in hippocampal pyramidal neurons is a much better model system in which to study this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data presented in all the figures is clear, convincing and well quantified. However, it is not clear why the neurons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> top panels (CD40+/+ and CD40-/-) are different from those represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (DMSO and Fc). The neurons were isolated from the same stage and cultured for the same period of time.</p></disp-quote><p>There are two issues here. First, to match the size of the micrographs with the size of the bar charts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, we used different magnifications, making the scale bars different lengths. This gives the impression that the neurons shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are larger than the equivalent neurons shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. To avoid confusion, we have adjusted the magnification so the scale bars in these figures are the same length in both figures. Second, there is a good deal of variation in the morphology of individual neurons, making selection of “representative neurons” problematic. For this reason, we quantify a very large number of neurons in multiple experiments. So what’s really important is the quantification shown in the bar charts. Indeed, this is remarkably consistent given that the different kinds of experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> were done over 3 years. We show micrographs only to give the reader some idea of what the cultured neurons look like. That said, we have selected a few different micrographs where necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the authors present data demonstrating a role for PKC in mediating the effects of CD40 using pharmacological approaches. It would be important to also present complementary results using for example genetic approaches to validate the role of PKC.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, we studied the effects of siRNA knock down of selected PKC isoforms on dendrite growth from hippocampal pyramidal neurons and MSNs. Because PMA activates conventional and novel PKC isoforms, we first checked expression of the conventional and novel PKC isoforms that have been reported to be abundantly expressed in whole brain. Using Western blotting, we demonstrated expression of PKC-α, β, γ and ε in the developing hippocampus and striatum. Because we were able to consistently and efficiently knock down PKC-β and PKC-γ expression in hippocampal and striatal neuron cultures with specific siRNA, we focused subsequent experiments on these isoforms. We were able to show that these isoforms selectively participate in mediating the opposite effects of CD40L reverse signaling on dendrite growth from hippocampal and striatal neurons.</p><p>In initial experiments using wild type neurons, we showed that transfection of PKC-β siRNA but not PKC-γ siRNA significantly decreased dendrite growth from hippocampal neurons and that transfection of PKC-γ siRNA but not PKC-β siRNA significantly increased dendrite growth from MSNs. In subsequent experiments on CD40-deficient neurons, we showed that PKC-β siRNA completely prevented CD40-Fc from rescuing the stunted dendrite phenotype of CD40-deficient hippocampal pyramidal neurons and that PKC-γ siRNA significantly prevented CD40-Fc from rescuing the exuberant dendrite phenotype of CD40-deficient MSNs.</p><p>In summary, we have not only used an alternative experimental approach to validate the role of PKC, but have additionally shown that different PKC isoforms are selectively involved in hippocampal and striatal neurons. These data are reported in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, the authors clearly demonstrate the specificity of the CD4 by western blots.

One possibility is that the authors explore the precise location of the CD40 and CD40L along the dendrites and whether Rho GTPases are differentially regulated in different neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>To begin to explore this intriguing possibility, we used Western blotting to assess the relative levels of expression of RhoA/B/C, Rac1/2/3 and Cdc42 in developing hippocampus and striatum. While all proteins were expressed in these tissues, there were no obvious differences in the relative levels between these tissues. We used immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry in wild type and CD40-deficient neurons to ascertain whether there were differences in the distribution of these proteins, but we did not observe any obvious differences between hippocampal and striatal neurons. Finally, considering that there is a redistribution of these proteins when they are activated, we also tried to detect changes in the distribution after treating CD40-deficient neurons with CD40-Fc, but again, we did not observe any clear differences in distribution. Although these results do not exclude that possibility that Rho GTPases play a role in the differential response of pyramidal and medium spiny neurons to CD40 reverse signaling, these results do not give us sufficient reason to pursue this line of enquiry at this stage.</p></body></sub-article></article>
