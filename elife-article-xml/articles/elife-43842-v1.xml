Nonetheless, landing ability, and its ecological significance, remain unstudied. We show that for auks, 60% of attempts to land at their cliff nests fail in a strong breeze (80% in near-gale winds). This is most likely because wind interferes with the ability to maintain flight control in the last phase of landing. Their extreme flight costs mean that the energetic penalty for multiple landing attempts is high. We propose that exposure, and ability to respond to, such conditions will influence the suitability of breeding habitat. In support of this (i) auk colonies appear to be orientated away from prevailing winds and (ii) landing success within colonies is higher on crowded ledges with more airspace for manoeuvring. More generally, the interplay between wind and flight capacities could impact breeding distributions across species and scales.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>wind</kwd><kwd>seabird</kwd><kwd>flight control</kwd><kwd>manoeuvrability</kwd><kwd>aeroecology</kwd><kwd>auk</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>715874</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shepard</surname><given-names>Emily</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Even moderate winds cause auks to abort landing attempts at nest-sites, and as a result, wind characteristics may affect where these, and other seabirds, choose to breed.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to fly profoundly affects the ecology of volant species: increasing the speed of travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmidt-Nielsen, 1972</xref>), enabling animals to cross substantial barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawkes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmaljohann et al., 2007</xref>) and giving enhanced access to space across scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kranstauber et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, flight underpins the most extensive and rapid annual migrations on the planet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kranstauber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Egevang et al., 2010</xref>). In fact, the freedom that flight affords is such that the question of whether or not animals are able to access a given location within their range, or whether this ability is affected by environmental conditions, is almost never considered. Nonetheless, airflow characteristics can promote, impede or even prevent flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shaffer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ortega-Jimenez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shepard et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crall et al., 2017</xref>), and this should have implications for an animal’s ability to access key locations, when it comes to both moving through them and landing within them.</p><p>In aircraft, it is well recognised that landing is a period of high workload and relatively high risk. For instance, a Boeing review of worldwide commercial jet accidents between 2007 and 2016 showed that 48% of fatal accidents occurred during the final approach and landing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boeing, 2017</xref>). Even for vehicles that move as fast as commercial jets, disturbed wind fields near runways can have a critical impact on flight control and safety, as highlighted by a European Aviation Safety Agency report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van Es, 2012</xref>). Yet in the biological literature, the process of landing has been examined mainly in relation to the sensory processes that guide it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baird et al., 2013</xref>) and the biomechanics of force reduction on impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonser and Rayner, 1996</xref>). How either of these may be affected by fluctuations in the wind field that are ubiquitous in the real-world flight environment, and the ecological consequences of this, remain unknown. Indeed, in the only study that seems to have addressed this to date, Chang <italic>et al</italic> report that bumblebees (<italic>Bombus impatiens</italic>) landing on flowers shift from a multi-directional landing approach to a unidirectional approach upon the introduction of wind and, furthermore, that bees are unable to perform low-impact landings in windy conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The forces of impact, and associated landing risks, will increase with animal mass and flight speed. Landing should therefore become more of a constraint for large animals, which also have lower available power (a factor that may be relevant if it is necessary to manoeuvre above the landing spot). Some of the largest birds, namely swans, overcome this by landing on water, where the impact can be reduced by extending the collision time and where momentum is transferred via the deformation of the water surface. For birds landing on solid substrates, regulation of their groundspeed is crucial during landing, as this will determine their impact with the landing surface. Airspeed, which is linked to lift production, must also be sufficient to remain airborne and maintain flight control. Both components must be modulated with respect to the wind speed. This is likely to be challenging in particular environmental conditions. For instance, it is reported that albatrosses have difficulty landing in low winds and that this can result in crash landings, broken bones and even death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cone, 1964</xref>).</p><p>We quantify how landing ability varies in relation to wind speed at arguably the single most important location of all: the nest. Here, birds must be able to make repeated and safe landings, whatever the weather. We take colonially nesting seabirds as our study system. Cliff-nesting auks, including our study species, the common guillemot (<italic>Uria aalge</italic>) and razorbill (<italic>Alca torda</italic>), have among the highest wing loading recorded in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elliott et al., 2013</xref>). This adaption for reduced diving costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elliott et al., 2013</xref>) means they have characteristically high flight speeds and low manoeuvrability. We therefore predict that the success of landing at the breeding cliffs will decline with the wind speed and/or turbulence experienced. We quantify the latter by combining direct observations of landing success and wind speed with outputs from computational fluid dynamics models, which are powerful tools with which to both visualise and estimate airflow characteristics around inaccessible places such as cliffs. We then develop a probabilistic model to assess how the ability to access nest sites, and the energetic costs of doing so, vary in relation to general wind conditions (i.e. a given mean wind speed and variance). Overall, this should provide new insight into the ways in which wind affects birds and other flying organisms, which is becoming increasingly important in light of the changing global wind conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weimerskirch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Young et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study site and landing observations</title><p>Data were collected on Skomer Island, Pembrokeshire, UK (51.73611°N 5.29628°W). Here guillemots and razorbills form large, sympatric breeding colonies. Colony location and density were defined as follows: a digital elevation model (DEM, 0.5 m resolution, Lle Geo-Portal for Wales) was used to identify coastal cliffs, taken as regions with slopes &gt; 20°. Cliffs were divided into breeding and non-breeding areas by digitising the 2015 Skomer Island breeding bird survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stubbings et al., 2015</xref>). Colonies were then defined as areas where birds were breeding, separated by distinct, unoccupied regions. The density of each colony was estimated by allocating the bird count to the associated cliff area, where the minimum height of the cliff was taken as 10 m ASL (to account for wave and tidal height [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 1997</xref>]) extending to 15 m from the top of each cliff (using measurements made for the three largest colonies, E Shepard <italic>unpubl. data</italic>). We identified the densest colonies using a breakpoint in the density distribution. The mean orientation of each of these colonies was calculated, and a Rayleigh test was used to assess whether they were uniformly distributed. Analyses were conducted in ArcMap 10.5.1.</p><p>The landing attempts of guillemots and razorbills were observed over 26 days (28.4.2016–4.5.2017) at five breeding colonies, selected for being readily accessible and situated at different locations around the Island (SI, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Birds were assumed to be making landing attempts when they approached a cliff, usually ascending to it from below, steadily reducing the distance to the cliff until their ventral surface was orthogonally aligned with the cliff face. A landing was scored as successful if the bird touched down and stopped flying. An aborted attempt would begin in the same way, but birds would falter at the last moment and slip or fly away from the cliff. It was only possible to track the path of an individual over multiple landing attempts at one colony (High Cliff), as the return flight paths were partly obscured at all other observation points. The main dataset of landing attempts therefore refers to the success of focal individuals that were picked at random from all birds flying towards a breeding cliff. As such, our approach assumes that the overall dataset is not biased by a few individuals undertaking a large number of repeated attempts. We consider this reasonable given that landing attempts are short-lived events and that colonies are composed of hundreds of breeding pairs (SI <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). A smaller sample of birds was followed at High Cliff to count the number of repeat attempts under a given wind condition.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43842.002</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The output of the best performing model.</title><p>High frequency wind speed measurements were obtained for 6140 observations and all models of landing success were run using this dataset.

Each breeding cliff was also visually divided into four height bands of roughly 10 m, using landmarks to allow easy categorisation of the landing height.</p><p>Wind speed was recorded using a Kestrel anemometer positioned near the breeding cliff and the observer (SI, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) at a height of 1.5 m AGL. This near-ground height was selected in order to assess conditions that birds might experience during the final phase of landing. The anemometer was positioned in the same location for all data collection sessions at a given colony and set to record once per minute.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Modelling airflows</title><p>A modelling approach was used to (i) assess the extent to which wind speeds measured near observers varied from those on the breeding cliffs (it is logistically exceedingly difficult to measure wind speeds at the cliffs directly), (ii) relate near-ground values to the upwind/at sea condition, and (iii) estimate turbulence levels in relation to breeding colony and wind direction. Islands are particularly well suited to such modelling given that the upstream flow conditions are essentially uninterrupted. Airflows were modelled over Skomer using the open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software OpenFOAM (openfoam.org). OpenFOAM has previously been validated and used for other atmospheric boundary flow problems, including the well-known Bolund test case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bechmann et al., 2011</xref>) which involves modelling air flow over a small, steep island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cavar et al., 2016</xref>). Our model domain was 5100×4950×1000 m, with a basic horizontal grid spacing of 25 m and a vertical spacing of 10 m. The height data for the lower boundary were taken from a DEM of the island at 5 m resolution (OS Terrain five dataset sourced from Digimap). The model mesh was fitted over the terrain and refined (2:1 refinement) up to twice near the lower surface using the OpenFOAM SnappyHexMesh tool. This gave the finest resolution near the surface as approximately 6.25 m in the horizontal and 2.5 m in the vertical plane. At the upwind boundary, a logarithmic wind profile was imposed, while outflow boundary conditions were applied at the downwind boundaries. The roughness length was set to 0.1 m. The model uses a k-ε turbulence closure scheme to find a steady state solution, which therefore provides both mean wind speed, U (m s<sup>−1</sup>), and the turbulent kinetic energy, k (J m<sup>−3</sup>). This is the kinetic energy associated with the turbulence rather than the mean wind, and is defined as:<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">k</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">w</mml:mi><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where u', v' and w' are the fluctuations about the mean in the three components of wind velocity (in the x, y and z directions) and ρ is the density (kg m<sup>−3</sup>).

Binomial generalised linear mixed effects models were applied to the landing success data using the R package LME4 and fitted with the bobyqa optimizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2014</xref>). Given that hypotheses could be developed for interactions between wind speed (as measured near the cliffs), turbulence levels, ledge type and species, an initial model was run with a 4-way interaction between these predictors, in order to identify which interactions featured regularly in the best fitting models. These interactions were included in the global model and model simplification was then performed using AIC values. The global model included two-way interactions between wind speed and ledge, and turbulence and ledge. Wind speed and turbulence values were centred to remove collinearity between the individual and interaction terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schielzeth, 2010</xref>). A variable combining day and colony was created and fitted as a random intercept in order to account for temporal and spatial autocorrelation in landing success that could occur due to wind direction (which would be altered from the mean condition in a particular way by the topography surrounding each colony). Tests for collinearity (using the CAR package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fox and Weisberg, 2011</xref>]) and over-dispersion were run on the global model. Residual interpretation and goodness of fit tests were performed using the DHARMa package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hartig, 2017</xref>) simulating residuals from 500 runs of the fitted model. Marginal and conditional R<sup>2</sup> values were estimated using the MuMIn package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barton and Barton, 2018</xref>). All analyses were conducted in R Studio Version 1.1.456 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">R Development Core Team, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Probabilistic modelling of landing failure</title><p>The statistical modelling related landing success to the wind speed recorded in that minute, as measured close to ground level. However, when wind speeds are considered over time, for example through the breeding season, or between years, it is the mean wind speed that is considered, and these records are made from anemometers stationed on weather buoys or at a greater altitude above ground level. We therefore developed a probabilistic model to (i) predict how landing success varies with mean wind speed, as measured further from the cliff (using the coefficients from the statistical model, as well as the airflow modelling), and (ii) derive the probability of landing in <italic>n</italic> attempts, which was later used to estimate the metabolic cost of landing.</p><p>In both cases, a bird coming into land at a cliff effectively samples a distribution of wind speeds around a specified mean. We assumed that the instantaneous cliff wind speeds could be modelled as a Log Normal random variable. The probability distribution for the number of attempts taken to land successfully can then be derived from these parameters and the log odds of landing, with the latter taken from the best-fitting statistical model.

The fact that auks manage to land (and breed) on ledges so narrow that their tails hang over the edge (mean density = 20 per m<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harris and Birkhead, 1985</xref>]), is testament to their flight capacity. However, we show that even moderate winds can upset this delicate balancing act. In our study, the ability to land was significantly impacted by wind speeds on the approach to the breeding cliffs. When translated into the probability of landing in a mean wind condition, birds only landed reliably (p(landing)&gt;0.9) in calm to light air, equivalent to at-sea winds of ≤2 m s<sup>−1</sup>. The probability of landing successfully fell to 0.4 in a strong breeze and to 0.2 in near gale conditions (11 and 15 m s<sup>−1</sup> over open water respectively). Thus, even in conditions that are not sufficiently severe to be categorised as either gales or storms, wind can act as an invisible barrier, affecting the ability of cliff-nesting birds to access their chicks. The outcome is that the need to avoid terrestrial predators (as inferred from their cliff-nesting habit) has driven birds to select places they themselves are unable to access in some conditions. This occurs despite the fact that wind speeds close to the cliffs are lower than those over open water and that birds in our study appear to select breeding cliffs that are oriented away from the prevailing wind direction.</p><p>During migratory and commuting flights, diverse animals vary when and where they fly in relation to wind conditions, selecting airflows that are beneficial for flight costs or flight control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kranstauber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shaffer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shepard et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sapir et al., 2014</xref>). In stark contrast, decisions about where to breed cannot be changed after the initial investment at the start of a breeding season. Cliff-nesting auks therefore have no choice but to attempt to return to this fixed place, even in difficult conditions, in order to provision their young and relieve their partner. Animals including bees have been shown to vary their landing trajectory in relation to the wind vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). However, we show that the extent that cliff-nesting birds can vary their approach trajectory with wind direction may be limited by the topography of the surrounding area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For instance, in prevailing SW winds, our airflow modelling shows that birds landing at the largest guillemot colony on our study site (the Wick, Skomer Island <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), are forced to fly parallel to the cliff, with a substantial tailwind component, before making their final approach in a crosswind. Consequently, the ability of cliff-nesting auks to land in these conditions at all is remarkable.</p><p>In high winds, adults can choose to delay foraging, and indeed, there is evidence that a range of auk species do reduce feeding rates in windy conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Konarzewski and Taylor, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birkhead, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elliott et al., 2014</xref>). However, delaying foraging for long periods is a poor option, particularly when provisioning small chicks. The alternative is to perform multiple landing attempts. The energetic cost of an additional landing can be estimated using the median time taken for completion of one landing circuit, as measured at one of our study colonies (34 s, range 11–58 s, n = 30), and the costs of level flight as measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elliott et al. (2013)</xref>. This gives 4.9 kJ per landing loop. To put this into context, the gross calorific value of one lesser sandeel (<italic>Ammodytes marinus</italic>) of a size consumed by guillemots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hislop et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pearson, 1968</xref>) would be equivalent to the cost of ~6 attempts. How often are guillemots likely to have to pay this price? Given that wind speed varies through time, the number of attempts required for a successful landing will vary with both the mean wind speed and the variance around this mean. Our probabilistic model shows that the probability of a guillemot landing in six attempts decreases from one in a gentle to moderate breeze, to 0.4 in near gale conditions (representing the median and routine maximal wind speeds during the breeding season respectively). As guillemots typically perform 3–4 provisioning trips per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thaxter et al., 2009</xref>), the cumulative daily cost of multiple landing attempts per trip could be substantial.</p><p>Despite this, adults are still likely to perform multiple attempts rather than risk landing without proper flight control, as the territory size is so small that any error during the parental changeover almost invariably results in the loss of the egg or chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kokko et al., 2004</xref>). In Brünnich's guillemot colonies (<italic>Uria lomvia</italic>), adult changeovers have also been identified as periods when eggs and young are vulnerable to gull predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilchrist et al., 1998</xref>, cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashbrook et al., 2008</xref>). The negative effects of high winds could be two-fold for these auks; impeding their own flight capacities, whilst simultaneously promoting the capacity of gulls to fly and manoeuver close to the narrow breeding ledges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilchrist and Gaston, 1997</xref>).</p><p>In our study, the size of the landing platform was the most important parameter to influence landing success after wind strength. Paradoxically, this is unlikely to be due to the physical area of the platform itself, as large platforms are typically crowded (which can produce further complications as neighbouring birds can reach up to peck incoming individuals, E Shepard, <italic>pers. obs</italic>). Consequently, the area of rock available for landing may not vary substantially across platform sizes. Larger platforms do, however, have greater available airspace above them, which could be important in allowing birds to manoeuvre in the final phase of landing and therefore achieve greater flight control in stronger winds.</p><p>The ability to land more readily in some locations than others represents an aspect of site quality that has not previously been considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kokko et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birkhead et al., 1985</xref>), beyond a study in 1964 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cone, 1964</xref>), suggesting that albatrosses choose to nest on the windward side of islands in order to facilitate landing and take-off. Our data show that within a given colony, guillemots nesting on large ledges will experience benefits beyond the extra protection from aerial predators that is afforded by having a greater number of neighbours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birkhead, 1977</xref>). Quality will also vary between different cliff sites, with those providing greatest protection from the wind presumably offering more reliable conditions to land in. In support of this, our preliminary data suggest that colonies are orientated in most directions bar those that face into the prevailing wind direction. However, more substantial analyses are needed to ascertain which components of the wind field are most important when it comes to site selection. Even then, it may be difficult to disentangle the ultimate drivers of site selection, as shelter from strong winds could also be important in reducing exposure to low temperatures, or the possibility of young being swept off ledges by strong winds or associated wave action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Høyvik Hilde et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, shelter is likely to improve the ability of fledglings to jump and reach the sea at the end of the season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilchrist and Gaston, 1997</xref>). Notwithstanding this, the relevance for the present study is that we see surprisingly high rates of landing failure despite the fact that birds appear not to be breeding in the most exposed sites.</p><p>Habitat suitability and quality are therefore likely to vary according to the prevailing conditions, how these interact with local topography (which will determine exposure levels and the ability of individuals to adjust the direction of their final approach), and fine-scale ledge characteristics that affect the extent that birds can manoeuvre above the landing spot. Nonetheless, the importance of these factors will also vary with species, with a given area being simultaneously accessible to some species and inaccessible to others. In our study, guillemots were much more susceptible to the effects of wind than razorbills. In fact, in the strongest winds we recorded, the probability of guillemots landing on small ledges in 10 attempts was just 0.55, compared to 0.85 in razorbills. The morphology of guillemots and razorbills is extremely similar, but guillemots are larger and out-compete razorbills for access to the bigger platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Linnebjerg et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, in this study, razorbills landed on the smallest ledges more often than expected, with the reverse being true for guillemots. If ledge type were the sole determinant of landing ability, we would therefore expect razorbills to have inferior landing success. The increased manoeuvrability of razorbills (due to their lower wing loading and hence flight speed) is likely to be the reason why the opposite is true, as razorbills should be able to turn more tightly, and hence respond appropriately to wind in the last phase of landing. The chances of wind having a substantial impact on the energetic costs of landing are therefore far greater in guillemots, which could, in turn, influence their motivation to compete for the larger ledges.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Decisions such as when and where to fly are fundamentally linked to wind conditions, because flight speed and flight costs vary with the wind vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hedenstrom and Alerstam, 1995</xref>). This affects population processes in a number of ways, influencing the most cost-effective migration routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kranstauber et al., 2015</xref>), species distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davies et al., 2010</xref>) and shift durations in breeding birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weimerskirch et al., 2012</xref>). Our study provides evidence of an additional mechanism by which wind can affect birds, effectively preventing cliff-nesting auks from landing in high winds. The issue of how to land safely in windy conditions is pertinent for a wide range of species, as the diversity of several seabird groups increases with latitude and wind speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davies et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cairns et al., 2008</xref>). Low manoeuvrability may represent a constraint in this regard for auks – and one that is likely to be most critical in Brünnich's guillemots, which have a wing loading some 20% higher than common guillemots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elliott et al., 2013</xref>). However, other aspects of flight control, such as stability, could be limiting for species with lower wing loading. This opens up a great many questions on how birds of different morphologies and flight capacities respond to strong and potentially variable airflows during landing, and the extent to which this modulates patterns of space use in the breeding season. Indeed, we expect that inter-specific variation in flight capacities may help explain why there is such clear distinction between the areas that different seabird taxa occupy on offshore islands. In general, we predict that cliff-nesting species with low manoeuvrability should select sheltered sites for breeding. The preference for low wind speeds may also affect the timing of breeding, with birds postponing their return to the breeding cliffs, or their lay date, if these periods coincide with persistent strong winds (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wanless et al., 2009</xref>). This highlights the importance of monitoring the timing of strong winds during the breeding season, as well as the frequency. Overall, this is pertinent as wind regimes are changing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Young et al., 2011</xref>) and there is a need to establish a comprehensive framework to understand, and ultimately predict, which species are likely to be affected, and how (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales and Skomer wardens Bee Büche and Eddie Stubbings for supporting data collection.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Wind prevents cliff-breeding birds from accessing nests through loss of flight control&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Christian Rutz as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kyle Elliot (Reviewer #2); Yuuki Watanabe (Reviewer #3); Gil Bohrer (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study is one of the first to examine the dynamic component of flight in wild birds, and as such represents a notable advance. It brings an exciting topic into focus, through effective combination of field observations and airflow modelling, and will likely inspire future work on a wide range of taxa.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Presentation: While the reviewers enjoyed the lucid writing style, there was broad agreement that the presentation of the material could be improved. Please use separate Materials and methods, Results and Discussion sections (in that order) to structure the narrative better, and: (a) include sample sizes for all datasets and analyses (number of colonies, birds/landing attempts observed etc.); (b) provide more comprehensive summaries of the underlying data (including landing success/failure data for each species); (c) report results separately throughout for the two study species (guillemots and razorbills); and (d) clarify which analyses, and inferences, are based on observational data and which ones refer to your modelling work.</p><p>2) Sampling: Your work is based on two samples of colonies from a single island (Skomer): a set of 19 colonies for assessing orientation patterns, and a subsample of five colonies for observing birds' landing attempts. Please provide more information on how these samples were selected. You say that the 19 colonies were the &quot;main&quot; (subsection “Data collection”) or &quot;largest&quot; colonies (Figure 3 legend). How were these terms defined here (spatial extend or number of nests), what was your size criterion, and why did you not sample across the full range of colony sizes (from small to large), or include all local colonies? This is important, as you use this sample to conduct formal statistical analyses (Figure 3). In fact, given the good availability of suitable data for auks, the reviewers felt it would be important to replicate distribution analyses across different islands, to rule out the possibility that patterns are driven by factors other than wind conditions (such as access to preferred foraging sites). Finally, does your subsample of five colonies (subsection “Data collection”, first paragraph; Supplementary file 1) adequately capture the full variation of environmental conditions experienced by birds on Skomer? It would also be useful to know sample sizes – in terms of sites rather than individuals – for each wind speed measurement (e.g., did all the data on the windiest day come from a single site?). Finally, if different colonies are at different locations with different ledge sizes, statistical analyses would need to account for this.</p><p>3) Modelling: For your wind speed distribution, you use a normally distributed variable. Wind speed is only positive. Wind velocity at each of the 3 spatial components can be negative, but the bird does not care if the wind goes left or right – that makes it just as hard to land. You assume, correctly, that the birds are affected by the speed of the wind vector, and the speed [sqrt(sum(ui^2)) |i=1:3] is a positive property. Please use log normal distribution for W, which presumably will affect Equation 5.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43842.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Presentation: While the reviewers enjoyed the lucid writing style, there was broad agreement that the presentation of the material could be improved.

The five colonies where observations were made were selected as they are distributed fairly evenly around the island, which we felt was important as they might experience different wind conditions on a given day. Colonies also had to be readily accessible to obtain observations from multiple locations within a day for fieldworkers travelling on foot. The study colonies did include a range of sizes and we have reworded the Materials and methods where colony selection is discussed (subsection “Study site and landing observations”, second paragraph) and where it implied that we selected the 5 largest colonies. The number of birds in these colonies is given in Supplementary file 1.</p><p>We also revisited the section where colonies in general are defined and have reworked this to provide a much more rigorous definition of colonised areas (subsection “Study site and landing observations”, first paragraph). This has also resulted in a new version of Figure 4, which now includes the spatial extent of all colonies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In fact, given the good availability of suitable data for auks, the reviewers felt it would be important to replicate distribution analyses across different islands, to rule out the possibility that patterns are driven by factors other than wind conditions (such as access to preferred foraging sites).</p></disp-quote><p>We feel it is unlikely that the landing performance of birds could be influenced by possible differences in foraging sites, given the importance of wind in the statistical model, and that wind seems to be most critical in the last phases of the landing. Our main aim here is to introduce the idea that exposure to wind could have implications for breeding distributions and our approach is preliminary, as it does not account for factors such as colony size. We appreciate that distribution data are available for other islands, however, a thorough investigation of the factors driving the distribution of colonies, even within Skomer, is beyond the scope of this study as it would require detailed testing of different hypotheses. We have therefore adjusted the wording in the Results and Discussion to reflect this (subsection “Probabilistic models of landing failure”, Discussion, first and sixth paragraphs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, does your subsample of five colonies (subsection “Data collection”, first paragraph; Supplementary file 1) adequately capture the full variation of environmental conditions experienced by birds on Skomer?

Finally, if different colonies are at different locations with different ledge sizes, statistical analyses would need to account for this.</p></disp-quote><p>The precise wind conditions that birds experience as they land will be determined by fairly complex interactions between the wind direction, its variation in time, and its variation in space. The latter will be determined by how the wind interacts with the local topography. We tried to capture this variation in a statistical sense by creating the random variable Day|Site, to cover the interaction between wind conditions on a given day, and the topography.</p><p>In terms of experimental design, our study colonies reflect much of the range of bearings across which all colonies are orientated (apart from SE), which is now clarified in the Materials and methods (subsection “Study site and landing observations”). However, we appreciate that this is a simplistic measure of the conditions that will be experienced within a colony as a whole.</p><p>Finally, a good range of wind speeds was measured at all colonies and birds landed on the different ledge sizes in similar proportions across the colonies. The summary statistics for this are now reported in the first and fourth paragraphs of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Modelling: For your wind speed distribution, you use a normally distributed variable.

As a result, we have also changed the text in the Materials and methods section “Probabilistic modelling of landing failure” and redone Figures 2 and 4. The change in distribution had little impact on the nature of the relationships in the figures (as very few wind speeds were negative when the normally distributed variable was used), and consequently no substantial changes were required to the text elsewhere.</p></body></sub-article></article>
