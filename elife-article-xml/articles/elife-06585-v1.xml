One important Ena/VASP regulator is the mig-10/Lamellipodin/RIAM family of adaptors that promote lamellipod formation in fibroblasts and drive neurite outgrowth and axon guidance in neurons. To better understand how MRL proteins promote actin network formation we studied the interactions between Lamellipodin (Lpd), actin, and VASP, both in vivo and in vitro. We find that Lpd binds directly to actin filaments and that this interaction regulates its subcellular localization and enhances its effect on VASP polymerase activity. We propose that Lpd delivers Ena/VASP proteins to growing barbed ends and increases their polymerase activity by tethering them to filaments. This interaction represents one more pathway by which growing actin filaments produce positive feedback to control localization and activity of proteins that regulate their assembly.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06585.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06585.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06585.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Actin—the most abundant protein in most eukaryotic cells—assembles into a network of filaments that spans the length and breadth of the cell. Like the skeleton of an animal, this ‘actin cytoskeleton’ gives the cell its shape and strength, and enables the cell to actively move through its environment. To start moving, many cells begin assembling actin filaments next to the cell membrane. The growth of these filaments pushes the membrane forward and creates a two-dimensional structure called a ‘lamellipod’, which explores the space around the cell and steers its movement.</p><p>The actin filaments in a lamellipod are dynamic and undergo repeated cycles of assembly and disassembly. These processes are tightly regulated by a variety of other proteins. Members of the Ena/VASP protein family, for example, collect the building blocks of an actin filament and rapidly stack them in place on the fast-growing end of a filament. The activities of Ena/VASP proteins play an especially important role in creating lamellipodial actin networks and in driving cell movement.</p><p>Previous work showed that a protein called Lamellipodin binds to Ena/VASP proteins and helps recruit them to the cell membrane. However, it was unclear whether Lamellipodin could affect the activity of Ena/VASP proteins or their interaction with the actin filaments. Hansen and Mullins have now analyzed the interactions between Ena/VASP, Lamellipodin and actin. The experiments demonstrate that Lamellipodin does not simply tether Ena/VASP proteins to the membrane but also binds directly to actin filaments, via a binding site that is distinct from the site that contacts Ena/VASP. Further experiments with purified proteins revealed that Lamellipodin could interact with both actin filaments and Ena/VASP proteins at the same time. Hansen and Mullins also found that purified Lamellipodin interacted with VASP proteins to form clustered protein complexes, and that together with the tethering of actin filaments to the membrane, this clustering greatly increased VASP's ability to lengthen actin filaments.</p><p>By visualizing Lamellipodin tagged with a green fluorescent protein in living cells, Hansen and Mullins then showed that its interaction with actin filaments was sufficient to localize Lamellipodin to the cell membrane. Finally, since Lamellipodin interacts with a multitude of signaling molecules in addition to Ena/VASP proteins, the next big challenge is to understand how Lamellipodin itself is regulated. Future studies could also explore how cells harness the power of the actin cytoskeleton to carry out these essential activities.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06585.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06585.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>membrane</kwd><kwd>single molecule</kwd><kwd>TIRF microscropy</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01, GM061010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mullins</surname><given-names>R Dyche</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>Scott D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mullins</surname><given-names>R Dyche</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lamellipodin, an important regulator of cytoskeletal and assembly cell migration, enhances the activity of Ena/VASP family actin polymerases by clustering them on leading-edge membranes and tethering them to actin filaments.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic cells assemble networks of actin filaments adjacent to the plasma membrane to carry out many fundamental processes, including: maintenance of cell morphology; amoeboid locomotion; and cell–cell interaction.

For example, new filaments are created by nucleation factors recruited to the plasma membrane by Rho-family G-proteins, while fast-growing barbed ends of actin filaments near the membrane interact with regulatory factors that alter the rate and duration of filament elongation. Some factors, including formin-family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Romero et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kovar et al., 2006</xref>) and Enabled/Vasodilator (Ena/VASP stimulated phosphoprotein) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barzik et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Breitsprecher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Breitsprecher et al., 2011</xref>), accelerate filament elongation, while others, such as capping protein, terminate filament elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dinubile et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuhn and Pollard, 2007</xref>).

Recruitment of Ena/VASP proteins to the plasma membrane often promotes outgrowth of thin, finger-like filopodia and sometimes promotes rapid advance of broad lamellipodial sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lanier et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rottner et al., 1999</xref>). Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that determine localization and activity of Ena/VASP proteins in vivo, but previous work suggests that a combination of membrane-associated binding partners and free barbed ends work together to recruit and maintain Ena/VASP proteins at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krause et al., 2004</xref>). Stable localization of Ena/VASP to the plasma membrane requires both the Enabled/VASP homology 1 and 2 domains (EVH1 and EVH2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loureiro et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Applewhite et al., 2007</xref>). The EVH1 domain is a protein–protein interaction motif that binds proline-rich target sequences (e.g., FPPPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prehoda et al., 1999</xref>), and removal of the EVH1 sequence abolishes localization of Ena/VASP to focal adhesions and the plasma membrane of fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loureiro et al., 2002</xref>). Interaction with actin filaments is mediated by the EVH2 sequence, which contains an actin binding domain (BD) and a tetramerization motif required for polymerase activity. When expressed by itself in cells, the EVH2 domain concentrates in lamellipodial actin networks, but fails to achieve the same tight, membrane-proximal localization pattern as the intact protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bear et al., 2002</xref>).

Similarly, in mammals the protein Lamellipodin (Lpd) helps determine morphology of neurons and promotes growth of lamellipodial protrusions in a variety of non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Michael et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pinheiro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoshinaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Law et al., 2013</xref>). Several MRL proteins, including Lpd, contain a tandem Ras-Association and Pleckstrin Homology (RA-PH) domain which, together with an adjacent coiled-coil region, causes the proteins to form weak homo-dimers in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2012</xref>). The RA-PH domain is structurally homologous to growth factor receptor-binding proteins Grb7, Grb10, and Grb14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Depetris et al., 2009</xref>) but, unlike the Grb proteins, no <italic>direct</italic> interaction between small GTPases (e.g., Ras or Rho family) and MRL proteins has been reported. In vitro, the MRL pleckstrin homology (PH) domain binds phosphatidylinositol lipids: PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and in vivo the PH domain is thought to target these proteins to the plasma membrane in response to extracellular ligands such as PDGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krause et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2012</xref>). Although the MRL proteins have been shown to help recruit Ena/VASP proteins to the plasma membrane, their effect on Ena/VASP activity has never been characterized. In addition, results from several studies indicate that the MRL proteins likely have additional, Ena/VASP-independent roles in actin network regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krause et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lyulcheva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Michael et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular control of actin assembly we characterized the interactions between human VASP, Lpd, and filamentous actin in vitro and in live cells. To our surprise, Lpd binds directly to filamentous actin, both in the absence and presence of VASP, an interaction mediated by a cloud of positively charged basic residues scattered through the C-terminal region of the protein (the Lpd Actin Binding Region (ABR), residues 850–1250). In cells, Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup>, lacking the RA-PH domain localizes to leading edge membranes and undergoes retrograde flow with the actin cytoskeleton. Surprisingly, the interaction between Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup> and the actin cytoskeleton does not require interactions with Ena/VASP proteins or SH3 containing proteins, such as Abi1 and endophilin. In vitro, Lpd increases processivity of barbed end-associated VASP tetramers by tethering them to actin filaments. Together these results provide mechanistic insight into how growing actin filaments feed back on the polymerases and nucleation promoting factors that regulate their assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lpd binds directly to single actin filaments in vitro</title><p>Lpd takes its name from the dynamic lamellipodial actin networks to which it localizes in vivo, even in the absence of Ena/VASP proteins or free actin filament barbed ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krause et al., 2004</xref>). This tenacious localization to leading edge actin networks suggested that Lpd might interact directly with actin filaments, so we tested this idea by simultaneously visualizing monomeric GFP-Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup> and individual actin filaments in vitro by Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

To look for such a polarized lipid distribution we expressed a phosphatidylinositol lipid sensor, based on the pleckstrin-homology domain of phospholipase Cδ (GFP-PLCδ PH). We found that GFP-PLCδ PH distributes uniformly across the plasma membrane of XTC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This result supports our interpretation that failure of Lyn-GFP-Lpd (35A) to localize to leading edge membranes in XTC cells reflects the fact that Lpd coupling to the actin cytoskeleton is required for establishing interactions with Ena/VASP or Abi1/endophilin at actin based membrane protrusions.</p><p>To test whether leading edge membrane localization of GFP-Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup> requires interaction with free actin filament barbed ends or with the sides of actin filaments, we used pharmacological perturbations to examine how GFP-Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup> leading edge localization responds to changes in actin cytoskeletal dynamics. First, we simply froze actin assembly and disassembly by adding a mixture of Jasplakinolide and Latrunculin B to cells, without inhibiting myosin activity.

The dynamics of GFP-Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup> translocation suggests that, in the absence of net actin assembly, myosin can pull GFP-Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup> off the leading edge via a tight linkage to the actin cytoskeleton. In these experiments, a fraction of membrane-localized GFP-Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup> remained at the leading edge, presumably due to the maintenance of interaction with Ena/VASP and/or Abi1/endophilin.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06585.019</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Dynamic actin filament assembly and free barbed ends are required for leading localization of GFP-Lpd (850–1250aa).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dynamic actin assembly is required for maintenance of GFP-Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup> leading edge localization.

We speculate that the comet-like barbed end localization of GFP-LZ-Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) may reflect dimers simultaneously binding to the barbed end and near the barbed end, creating a fluorescent speckle.</p><p>Because GFP-Lpd and GFP-LZ-Lpd reduce the rate of actin filament elongation and transiently associate with barbed ends, we tested whether VASP could alleviate the inhibitory effect of Lpd. We measured barbed end elongation rates in the presence of 2 µM actin and 2 µM profilin-actin, as well as buffers of various ionic strengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>). Because Lpd and VASP synergistically and potently bundle actin filaments in 50 mM KCl, we tried increasing the ionic strength (75–100 mM KCl) to minimize side binding, while favoring barbed end association of the Lpd-VASP complex. However, for all conditions tested, we found that the rate of barbed end elongation in the presence of both Lpd and VASP was intermediate between the rates measured in the presence of either Lpd or VASP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>). Interpreting these results remains challenging because multiple competing activities contribute to single filament elongation rates.</p><p>Because multiple, competing interactions determine the average barbed end elongation rate in the presence of Lpd and VASP, we returned to imaging single Cy3-VASP tetramers to determine whether Lpd modulates VASP's barbed-end processivity. Fluorescently labeled VASP tetramers accumulate on growing actin filament barbed ends decorated with GFP-LZ-Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup> where they form a stable population (τ<sub>1</sub> = 0.58 ± 0.05 s (73%), τ<sub>2</sub> = 2.3 ± 0.4 s (27%); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–G</xref>) that dissociates much more slowly than VASP tetramers observed in the absence of GFP-LZ-Lpd (τ<sub>1</sub> = 0.49 ± 0.03 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–G</xref>).</p><p>One challenge we faced in visualizing the colocalization of Lpd and VASP on single actin filament barbed ends was that the high solution protein concentrations required to observe complex formation.

To circumvent this problem, we used lower concentrations of his<sub>10</sub>GFP-Lpd (850–1250aa) oligomers purified by size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and characterized their effect on VASP barbed end processivity in the single actin filament TIRF assay.

The cloud of positively-charged amino acid residues is conserved between Lpd homologs of different organisms. These residues, however, are absent from other Ena/VASP binding proteins, such as RIAM, ActA, and Zyxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that this basic region is important for cellular functions specific to Lpd. The filament-BD does not overlap motifs that bind the EVH1 domains of VASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), enabling Lpd to simultaneously interact with both Ena/VASP proteins and filamentous actin. Similar to VASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</xref>), monomeric Lpd molecules bind actin filaments only weakly in physiological ionic strength (∼150 mM KCl), but bind much more strongly when oligomerized or densely clustered on membranes. Because of this effect, local enrichment of Lpd at the plasma membrane can exert a non-linear, cooperative effect on Ena/VASP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06585.027</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model.</title><p>Based on the canonical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krause et al., 2004</xref>), Lpd is recruited to actin based membrane protrusions through interactions with phosphatidylinositol lipids (i.e., PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>) and possibly small GTPases (i.e., Ras or Rho family). Similar to the Grb protein family, Lpd is predicted to form homo-dimers mediated by interactions between the coiled-coil and tandem RA-PH domain. We find that the C-terminus of Lpd (residues 850–1250) is sufficient for recruiting Lpd to leading edge membrane where it directly interacts with free barbed ends and/or the sides of the actin filaments. Importantly, this interaction between Lamelliopodin and filamentous actin can occur independently to those mediated by Ena/VASP proteins or SH3 domains (i.e., Abi1/endophilin). However, Ena/VASP proteins recruited to actin based membrane protrusion can simultaneously associate with free actin filament barbed ends and Lpd. By this mechanism, we speculate that the lifetime of membrane targeted and barbed end associated Ena/VASP proteins are extended at the plasma membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06585.027">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06585.027</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06585-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed to modulate the activity of Ena/VASP proteins, including: post-translational modifications of the EVH2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barzik et al., 2005</xref>); alternative splicing of Ena/VASP transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Philippar et al., 2008</xref>); and specificity for distinct profilin-actin isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dugina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mouneimne et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, we establish that Ena/VASP proteins are directly controlled by their membrane-targeting factors. Specifically we show that Lpd-VASP complexes are more persistently localized to polymerizing ends, because the Lpd-actin interaction tethers VASP to the barbed end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Filament tethering in combination with VASP clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Breitsprecher et al., 2008</xref>) greatly increases the processivity of Ena/VASP proteins. In addition, Lpd-VASP complexes also enhance barbed-end polymerization more effectively compared to individual VASP tetramers, an ability likely based on Lpd's interaction with actin monomers. By increasing the number of monomer binding sites near the barbed end, Lpd may directly contribute to the polymerase activity of VASP tetramers.</p><p>In cells both FL Lpd and its C-terminal actin BD (Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup>) localize to actin-based membrane protrusions independently of other binding proteins such as Ena/VASP or Abi1/endophilin. In contrast to FL Lpd, however, we find that acute treatment of cells with cytochalasin D rapidly displaces GFP-Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup> from the leading edge and causes it to translocate toward the cell body with the disassembling lamellipodial actin network. We observed a similar phenotype for Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup> mutants that cannot interact with Ena/VASP proteins or SH3 domains. Taken together these results demonstrate that the C-terminal region of Lpd harbors autonomous filament binding sites that strongly influence its localization to actin rich protrusions. The ability of Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup> to directly interact with polymeric actin extends the canonical model of Lpd membrane localization, which suggests that Lpd targets the plasma membrane by binding to PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and/or small GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krause et al., 2004</xref>).

This effect is more pronounced in the presence of profilin-actin, as compared to actin alone, indicating that profilin can shunt Lpd towards the filament barbed end. Interestingly, Lpd contains a poly-proline domain situated upstream of the ABR characterized in this study. We speculate that this poly-proline domain, similar to its function in other actin regulatory proteins such as formins and nucleation promoting factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Paul et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campellone and Welch, 2010</xref>), could bind profilin-actin and promote its interaction with the actin-binding region, influencing the partitioning of Lpd between monomeric and filamentous actin.

Lysate was clarified by centrifugation in a Beckman JA-17 rotor for 60 min, 16,000 rpm (35,000 rcf). High speed supernatant was recirculated over a 5 ml HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare, Cat# 17-0409-03) that was charged with 100 mM CoCl<sub>2</sub> (Sigma, Cat# 255599), washed with water, and then equilibrated with lysis buffer lacking protease inhibitors and DNase.

This allowed us to separate soluble aggregates from the monomeric protein. Peak fractions were then combined with 10 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 1 mM TCEP (1:1 vol) to effectively reduce the salt concentration to 100 mM NaCl. This sample was then loaded on a MonoS column equilibrated with 10 mM HEPES [pH 7.0], 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP and gradient eluted as described above. Peak fractions of his<sub>10</sub>-EGFP-Lpd eluted from the MonoS column containing a small fraction of spontaneously formed oligomers.

Continuous scans of 488 nm absorbance were acquired every 2 hr in replicates of 10, to monitor the sedimentation of GFP-Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup> in the absence and presence of VASP<sup>1−114aa</sup>. An extinction coefficient of 55,000 M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup> was used to calculate the GFP-Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup> protein concentration from the absorbance measured at 488 nm for each radial position. Global fitting of three equilibrium traces from all speeds (i.e., 7, 10, 14K rpm) for each condition was performed using open source NIH Sedphit and Sedphat software (Peter Schuck, NIH). Equilibrium traces were globally fit using a monomer-dimer self-association model. Using Sednterp, we calculated a partial specific volume of 0.7354 ml/g and a buffer density of 1.00499 g/ml. Our method for fitting the equilibrium traces involved fixing the meniscus position, floating the bottom position, and varying local concentrations in the experimental parameters. Using Sedphat, the apparent molecular weight of GFP-Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup> was calculated by fixing the dimer concentration at zero and floating the molecular weight.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Pegylation of glass coverslips</title><p>Glass was functionalized as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bieling et al.

In brief, coverglass (Corning No. 1.5, 18 × 18 mm sq.) was cleaned by sonication in 3 M NaOH, followed by Pirahna etching (40% hydrogen peroxide, 60% sulfuric acid). Coverslip sandwich were then incubated with undiluted 3-glycidyloxypropyl-trimetoxysilane (GOPTS, Sigma 440167) for 30 min at 75°C. Glass was then washed with anhydrous acetone (Electron Microscopy Sciences; RT 10016) to remove excess silane and rapidly dried with an in house manufactured coverslip spin drier.

Synthesis of PLL-PEG was performed as previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al. (2001)</xref>. PEG/biotin-PEG functionalized coverslips were then attached to PLL-PEG coated counterglass with double sided tape (Tesa). To reduce nonspecific binding to the PEG functionalized surface the imaging chamber was washed with a 1× PBS solution pH 7.2 containing 1% Pluronic F-127 and 100 µg/ml beta casein. Glass was then washed with buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7, 1 mM DTT, 200 mM KCl, 100 µg/ml beta-casein (wash buffer). Glass was subsequently incubated for 2 min with 50 nM streptavidin, followed by 50 nM biotin-PEG<sub>11</sub> heavy meromyosin diluted in wash buffer.

If this is not possible, kappa casein can be left out of the 1% Pluronic F-127 or replaced with beta casein. Ultimately, the assay quality will depend on your ability to block defects on the biotin-PEG functionalized glass surfaces. Because Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup> and human VASP are highly basic proteins, poor coverslip functionalization will result in a tremendous amount of non-specific protein absorption to the glass substrates used for TIRF microscopy.</p><p>The single actin filament TIRF assay was performed as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hansen and Mullins (2010)</xref>. When using phalloidin stabilized actin filaments, 2 µM actin (20% Cy3 or Cy5 labeled) was copolymerized with 1 µM dark phalloidin at room temperature for 2–3 hr in buffer containing 10 mM imidazole [pH 7], 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

Actin was then incubated at 23°C for 45–60 min to completely polymerize. In parallel, GFP-Lpd or GFP-LZ-Lpd were diluted in buffer containing a final concentration of 20 mM HEPES [pH 7.0], 50–150 mM KCl (depending on the desired final salt concentration), and 1 mM TCEP. Diluted Lpd (10–20 µM) was then subjected to high-speed ultracentrifugation for 30 min in a TLA100 rotor at 60,000 rpm (156,424×<italic>g</italic>) to remove potentially aggregated protein or particulate matter. Using a spectrophotometer, the Lpd protein concentration was recalculate from the measured absorbance at 280 nm (ε<sub>280</sub> = 41,370 M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup> and 44,350 M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup> for GFP-Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup> and GFP-LZ-Lpd<sup>850−1250aa</sup>, respectively). Pre-centrifugation typically results in a loss of 1–2% total protein, which is comparable to the error of most spectrophotometer readings. GFP-Lpd is diluted further to a desired 2× working concentration, which is then mixed 1:1 with 2× pre-polymerized filamentous actin (final reaction volume equals 50 µl). Lpd and filamentous actin are then allowed to equilibrate at 23°C for 60 min. Actin filaments with Lpd bound are then pelleted by ultracentrifugation in a TLA100 rotor at 48,000 rpm (100,111×<italic>g</italic>) for 30 min. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatant is removed and pellets are resuspended in 50 µl of 1× SDS-PAGE protein sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 100 mM DTT, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue). We then load 10 µl of resuspended pellets and load samples that were not centrifuges in a pre-casted NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gel (Invitrogen, Cat# NP0323BOX), which are then resolved using a Tris/MES/SDS running buffer [pH 7.3]. SDS-PAGE gels were subsequently fixed for 30 min in a solution containing methanol:water:acetic acid (50:43:1), before being stained with Sypro Ruby (Invitrogen, Cat# S12000). Gels are then scanned using a Typhoon imaging system (488 nm/610 nm; EX/EM). The concentration of Lpd and actin in the load and pellet were quantifies by measuring the integrated intensity of individual protein bands in gel after applying a local average background subtraction using ImageQuant. When we process samples containing GFP-Lpd or GFP-LZ-Lpd alone that were included during the co-sedimentation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), we observe the equivalent of 50–100 nM (5–10% of a 1 µM load) Lpd removed from the supernatant in the absence of actin.

Imaging chamber for the bead motility assay were assembled with glass silanized with a 2% solution of diethyldichlorosilane (Gelest, Cat# SID 3402.0) in isopropanol (pH 4.5 with acetic acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akin and Mullins, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Tissue culture and live cell imaging</title><p><italic>Xenopus</italic> fibroblasts (XTC cells) were maintained at 23°C (without CO<sub>2</sub>) in 70% diluted Leibovitz L-15 media (Invitrogen/Gibco, Cat# 21083-027 no phenol red) containing 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and penicillin/streptomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Watanabe and Mitchison, 2002</xref>).

After 5 hr of transfection, media was exchanged. Prior to live cell imaging, XTC cells were trypsinized and plated in 70% L-15 media lacking phenol red and FBS. XTC cells were plated onto a glass bottom 96-well plate (Matrical Bioscience, MGB096-1-2-LG) cleaned with 3 M NaOH for 1 hr and subsequently coated with 0.01% (wt/vol) PLL (Sigma, P-8920) for 20–30 min at 23–25°C.

For transfection of pCMV-EGFP-Lpd (850–1250aa), cells were plated in 24-well dish to a confluency of 50–60%. We added 0.5–1.0 µg DNA in complex with 2.5–5.0 µl Superfect (Qiagen, Cat# 1006699) to each well containing complete media.

B16F1 cells were imaged with Nikon Plan Apo 60× TIRF (NA 1.45) using wide-field epifluorescence illumination at 37°C in the presence of CO<sub>2</sub>. We employed the Nikon Perfect Focus instrument to maintain the focal plan throughout image acquisition. GFP/Alexa488, Cy3, and Cy5 fluorophores were excited with 491 nm, 561 nm, and 638 nm Coherent lasers respectively. Laser power was modulated with neutral density filters, an AOTF, and exposure settings such that 1–2 mW of laser power was delivered through the objective as measured with a power meter. We used a single filter cube containing a multipass excitation and dichroic filter (Chroma). A rapid switching Sutter Instruments emission filter wheel was positioned before our camera. Images of XTC cells, B16F1 cells, and single actin filament TIRF assay were collected on a cooled Andor Xion EM-CCD camera. The microscope, camera, and lasers were controlled using Micromanager 1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Edelstein et al., 2010</xref>). Image processing and data analysis was performed using ImageJ. Kymographs were generated using the ImageJ plugin, MultipleKymographs. Data was graphed using Kaleidagraph and Prism.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Pekka Lappalainen, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Pekka Lappalainen (Reviewing Editor), Alphee Michelot, and Matthias Krause (peer reviewers).</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before they reached this decision. They all found your study interesting and the results of significant importance. However, they also stated that in its current form this work is somewhat too preliminary for publication, and thus additional experiments are needed to confirm the main conclusions and to further strengthen the manuscript. The Reviewing Editor has therefore assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) To more reliably and quantitatively examine interaction between Lpd and F-actin, it is best to perform actin filament co-sedimentation assays at physiological ionic conditions for monomeric, dimeric and tri/tetrameric Lpd<sup>850-1250</sup>. These procedures will reveal K<sub>d</sub> values and stoichiometry of F-actin interactions with Lpd. Ideally, this type of analysis could be also combined with VASP mutants for a more quantitative analysis, in support of the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>2) Interactions of Lpd with filament barbed ends should be analysed further. Does Lpd enhance the ability of VASP to protect barbed ends from capping protein? Furthermore, it would be useful to elucidate whether Lpd interacts with filament barbed ends or binds to the side of actin filament close to the barbed end.</p><p>3) Data concerning F-actin dependent localization of Lpd to the leading edge are not particularly convincing, and therefore require additional experiments and revision of the text. It is important to test whether GFP- Lpd<sup>850-1250</sup> without the palmitoylation signal localizes to the very edge of the cell. Furthermore, from the current data it is not possible to conclude whether Lpd<sup>850-1250</sup> concentrates to the cell edge by direct interactions with F-actin. This is because Lys/Arg-Ala mutations introduced in this study are also expected to disrupt interactions of Lpd<sup>850-1250</sup> with SH3 domains (e.g. the ones of endophilin and Abi). Thus, one should either generate additional Lpd mutants, which are not defective in SH3 domain binding, or extensively revise the text to state that the C-terminal region contributes to Lpd localization either through interactions with F-actin or through interactions with other (e.g. SH3 domain containing) proteins.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 minor comments:</italic></p><p>1) VASP also binds palladin, which contributes to stress fiber localization of VASP (Gateva et al., JCS, 2014). This should be mentioned in the Introduction.</p><p>2) Because Lpd binds phosphoinositides through its PH domain and is expected to function at the plasma membrane, it is important to test whether the C-terminal region of Lpd can bind actin also in the vicinity of a negatively charged membrane that resembles plasma membrane (because due to its positive charge Lpd C-terminal region itself may associate with negatively charged membranes, which may potentially inhibit F-actin binding). This could be tested e.g. by repeating the assays presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref> using beads coated with a more plasma membrane-like lipid composition (e.g. by including 20-40% PE, 10-20% PS and 1-5% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>). At a minimum, it should be stated clearly that experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> were performed in the absence of negatively charged lipids, and do not necessarily resemble the situation at the plasma membrane.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 minor comments:</italic></p><p>1) “In addition, results from several studies indicate that the MRL proteins likely have additional, Ena/VASP-independent roles in actin network regulation.” This sentence needs references.</p><p>2) I would swap <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. To me, it makes more sense to bring up the simplest system before a more complex one.</p><p>3) How do the authors explain the presence of stable His-GFP-Lpd oligomers? The simultaneous presence of monomers and oligomers is generally due to a chemical equilibrium between the monomeric and every oligomeric species. Therefore, I would expect that even after size-exclusion chromatography, the ratio between monomers and oligomers would remain the same. Have the authors checked that point?</p><p>4) I did not find the rate of the processive runs in the presence of both VASP and Lpd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 minor comments</italic>:</p><p>1)The subheading that membrane tethered Lpd binds actin filaments is an over statement since the data just shows that it slows down actin network assembly mediated by Scar VCA and Arp2/3. It cannot be excluded that it is a direct effect on Scar-VCA-Arp2/3 mediated nucleation.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: The authors state that membrane tethered Lpd “significantly” slowed the rate of actin network assembly. For this statement they need to provide the statistics and explain what the +/- means: SD or SEM. Looking at the numbers, it is most likely significant.</p><p>3) <italic>Xenopus</italic> XTC cells have no real leading edge since they are stuck on poly-L lysine. Live movies in another cell type, such as B16F1 should be performed to confirm the findings for leading edge localization. No need for single molecule imaging here.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>: Was the barbed end polymerization rate measured with GFP-LZ-Lpd and VASP or just VASP on its own in the figure? Comparing GFP-LZ-Lpd and VASP with VASP on its own would give important insights whether GFP-LZ-Lpd blocks barbed ends or works together with VASP to speed up elongation.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: What are the barbed end dwell times of GFP-LZ-Lpd C-terminal?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Lamellipodin promotes actin assembly by clustering Ena/VASP proteins and tethering them to actin filaments” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and one of the original reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining, relatively minor, issues concerning actin filament binding assays that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Actin filament co-sedimentation assays were performed with a constant concentration of actin and varying the Lpd concentration. However, this is not an optimal way to perform an actin filament co-sedimentation assay, because it does not provide information about how much Lpd sediments in the absence (vs. presence) of actin. Thus, as an additional control experiment, the authors should repeat the assay with a constant, small concentration (e.g. 1 μM) of monomeric and Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup> in the absence and presence of an excess (e.g. 5 μM) of actin.</p><p>2) Why do monomeric Lpd and dimeric LZ-Lpd reach the same plateau at saturation of the curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Does that mean that the two actin binding domains of the LZ-Lpd construct cannot bind simultaneously to F-actin? This should be discussed.</p><p>3) Based on the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>, the co-sedimentation assays were carried out in the presence of phalloidin. Does Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup> only bind phalloidin stabilized actin filaments (or filaments in the complete absence of actin monomers)? To clearly demonstrate interactions of Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup> with ‘native’ and phalloidin stabilized actin filaments, the co-sedimentation assay described above should be also performed in the presence and absence of phalloidin.</p><p>4) The co-sedimentation assay should be described in the Materials and methods section. Furthermore, the authors should clearly explain in the figure legends whether the specific assays in each panel were performed with ‘native’ or phalloidin stabilized actin filaments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06585.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) To more reliably and quantitatively examine interaction between Lpd and F-actin, it is best to perform actin filament co-sedimentation assays at physiological ionic conditions for monomeric, dimeric and tri/tetrameric Lpd</italic><sup><italic>850-1250</italic></sup><italic>.

Consistent with our single-actin filament TIRF measurements, the interaction between actin and Lpd is stronger in low ionic strength buffers. For technical reasons we were unable to achieve sufficiently high concentrations of Lpd to saturate the binding interaction with filamentous actin in 150 mM KCl. Instead, we generated complete binding curves for GFP-Lpd and GFP-LZ-Lpd binding actin in 100 mM KCl. Fitting these curves we obtained dissociation equilibrium constants (K<sub>d</sub>) of 1.49 µM and 3.92 µM for GFP-LZ-Lpd and GFP-Lpd, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H-1I</xref>). Based on ratio of Lpd:Actin sedimented under saturating conditions, we estimate a maximum stoichiometry of one GFP-Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup> to two actin protomers.</p><p>We also performed actin co-sedimentation assays in the presence of Lpd and VASP (wild-type and mutants), but these experiments were inconclusive because Lpd and VASP form multi-molecular clusters that pellet independently of their interaction with actin filaments. In place of co-sedimentation, therefore, we used the synergistic bundling of actin filaments by Lpd-VASP to compliment our single-filament Lpd-VASP binding data. We find that individual actin filaments elongating in buffers containing 100 mM KCl and either 50 nM tetrameric VASP or 250 nM dimeric GFP-LZ-Lpd alone do not bundle actin filaments. However, the presence of both VASP and GFP-LZ-Lpd results in a large amount of actin filament bundling. This means that the Lpd-VASP can compensate for the weak actin filament binding observed for the individual proteins in buffer containing 100 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Interactions of Lpd with filament barbed ends should be analysed further</italic>. <italic>Does Lpd enhance the ability of VASP to protect barbed ends from capping protein?</italic></p><p>We previously showed that the barbed end association rate constant for capping protein is reduced 6-fold in the presence of 2 µM actin-profilin and 50 nM tetrameric VASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, Brietsprecher et al., (2008) showed that clustering enhances VASP anti-capping activity. It is, however, technically challenging to perform an anti-capping experiment in the presence of Lpd because of the prodigious amount of actin bundling that occurs in the presence of both VASP and Lpd. This interaction effectively depletes VASP and Lpd from solution over time and reduces the anti-capping activity of VASP. We, nevertheless, established conditions for measuring capping protein barbed end association in the presence of either Lpd, VASP, or Lpd-VASP in high ionic strength buffer (100 mM KCl). This buffer composition was used to minimize the actin bundling activity of VASP and Lpd, while favoring barbed end association. We find that both Lpd and VASP individually reduce the rate of capping protein barbed end association in the presence of 2 µM actin-profilin. The combined presence of both Lpd and VASP further enhances the anti-capping to a level that is approximately the sum of the individual protein activities. These experiments are difficult to interpret because we cannot quantify how much of the net anti-capping is contributed by VASP alone, Lpd alone, and Lpd-VASP complexes that associate with free barbed ends. Although these results are promising, we think it's premature to include this data in our revised manuscript. If the reviewers have a strong objection, we can try to integrate the anti-capping data into the manuscript.</p><p>Ultimately, addressing the physiological anti-capping activity of the Lpd-VASP complex will require characterizing the interaction of these proteins on membranes, in vivo and in vitro. We worked hard to reconstitute Lpd-VASP anti-capping activity using actin networks grown from lipid-coated microspheres. Unfortunately, we have been unable to generate coherent actin networks in the presence of all the proteins necessary to address this question (actin, profilin, his<sub>10</sub>-Cherry-SCAR, his<sub>10</sub>-GFP-Lpd, capping protein, Arp2/3 complex, and VASP).</p><p><italic>Furthermore, it would be useful to elucidate whether Lpd interacts with filament barbed ends or binds to the side of actin filament close to the barbed end</italic>.</p><p>To address this comment, it is useful to compare the actin binding activity of GFP-Lpd with that of tropomyosin, as described in our recent study (Hsiao et al., 2015, Current Biology). We found that non-muscle tropomyosin binds the sides of growing actin filaments preferentially <italic>near</italic> the pointed end. In single-filament binding assays we observed many obvious tropomyosin binding events biased toward the pointed end but separated from it by a measurable gap. In contrast, kymograph analysis of GFP-Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup> binding to elongating actin filaments reveals two distinct classes of event: 1) uniform side-binding along the entire filament with no obvious end-bias, and 2) barbed end-binding with no obvious gap between the filament end and GFP-Lpd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We attempted to measure the dwell time of GFP-Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup> on barbed ends with single molecule resolution, but the dissociation and diffusion kinetics are too fast.</p><p>In live cells we find that GFP-Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup> rapidly dissociates from the leading edge membrane when barbed ends are blocked by addition of Cytochalasin D. We observe the same effect for both GFP-Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup> wild-type and AAPPP<sub>x6</sub>, indicating that dissociation from the leading edge membrane occurs independently of interactions with Ena/VASP proteins. This result argues that free barbed ends are required for localization of Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup> to the leading edge.</p><p>Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup> is unstructured and highly basic, so we propose that a cloud of freely accessible basic residues mediates side-binding to actin filaments. We speculate that, in solution, Lpd is delivered to barbed ends via interaction with monomeric actin or profilin-actin complexes.</p><p>Without a high-resolution structure of the Lpd-actin complex we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that Lpd binds preferentially to the sides of filaments near the barbed end. Based on observations described above, however, we are confident Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup> interacts with barbed ends. We have included the above points in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) Data concerning F-actin dependent localization of Lpd to the leading edge are not particularly convincing, and therefore require additional experiments and revision of the text. It is important to test whether GFP-Lpd</italic><sup><italic>850-1250</italic></sup> <italic>without the palmitoylation signal localizes to the very edge of the cell</italic>.</p><p>In response to this comment, we tested whether GFP-Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup>, lacking the Src palmitoylation sequence, localizes to the leading edge in XTC cells spread on poly-L-lysine. To our surprise, GFP-Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup> localizes to the leading edge even more robustly than Lyn-GFP-Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup>. Furthermore, we observed GFP-Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup> undergo retrograde flow (Movie 2) with the same velocity as mCherry-actin speckles in the lamellipodial actin network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E-4F</xref>). Consistent with constitutively dimeric Lpd having a higher affinity for actin, GFP-LZ-Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup> displayed slightly more robust leading edge membrane localization and the intensity of presumptive endocytic particles were brighter compared to those observed in cells expressing GFP-Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1 fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 1 and 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>Furthermore, from the current data it is not possible to conclude whether Lpd</italic><sup><italic>850-1250</italic></sup> <italic>concentrates to the cell edge by direct interactions with F-actin. This is because Lys/Arg-Ala mutations introduced in this study are also expected to disrupt interactions of Lpd</italic><sup><italic>850-1250</italic></sup> <italic>with SH3 domains (e.g. the ones of endophilin and Abi). Thus, one should either generate additional Lpd mutants, which are not defective in SH3 domain binding, or extensively revise the text to state that the C-terminal region contributes to Lpd localization either through interactions with F-actin or through interactions with other (e.g. SH3 domain containing) proteins</italic>.</p><p>To address this comment we constructed a new set of Lpd mutants, designed to more specifically discriminate between different binding partners: Ena/VASP proteins, SH3-binding domains (i.e. Abi1/Endophilin), and actin.</p><p>Full-length human Lpd<sup>1-1250aa</sup> contains 10 potential SH3 domain binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Law et al., 2013</xref>), while our minimal construct, Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup>, contains only four.

We have now included rates for actin filaments elongating in the presence of both GFP-LZ-Lpd and VASP, which we find to be intermediate to the rates measured in the presence of either VASP or Lpd alone.

However, the dissociation kinetics and diffusivity along filamentous actin is too fast for us to accurately make these measurements. We speculate that the comet-like barbed end localization of GFP-LZ- Lpd<sup>850-1250aa</sup> is possibly due to dimers simultaneously binding to the barbed end and near the barbed end, which effectively creates a fluorescent speckle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Please refer to Movie 8 to see how fast GFP-LZ-Lpd binds and dissociates from growing actin filaments.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>1) Actin filament co-sedimentation assays were performed with a constant concentration of actin and varying the Lpd concentration. However, this is not an optimal way to perform an actin filament co-sedimentation assay, because it does not provide information about how much Lpd sediments in the absence (vs. presence) of actin. Thus, as an additional control experiment, the authors should repeat the assay with a constant, small concentration (e.g. 1 μM) of monomeric and dimeric Lpd</italic><sup><italic>850-1250aa</italic></sup> <italic>in the absence and presence of an excess (e.g. 5 μM) of actin</italic>.</p><p>In response to this comment we performed additional control experiments suggested by the reviewer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1D</xref>). The results of these experiments agree with all of our previous observations and further confirm that Lpd does, in fact, bind to actin filaments. Furthermore, this binding does not depend on whether the filaments are stabilized by phalloidin or whether the Lpd is substoichiometric to the actin.</p><p>We also carefully investigated the question of how much Lpd aggregates and/or pellets at high speed in the absence of actin. Firstly, frozen GFP-Lpd and GFP-LZ-Lpd remain monomeric and, as judged by analytical gel filtration, does not aggregate after thawing. Secondly, to remove large aggregates that might be present in small numbers we always spin GFP-Lpd and GFP-LZ-Lpd at high-speed prior to combining each protein with filamentous actin (see Methods). Following ultracentrifugation, the protein concentration is then re-measured using a spectrophotometer. This high-speed pre-spin removes less than 1-2% of the total Lpd protein (10-20 µM load), comparable to the error in the spectrophotometer absorbance reading. When we process samples containing GFP-Lpd alone that were included during the co-sedimentation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1D</xref>), we observe the equivalent of 50-100 nM (5-10% of a 1 µM load) Lpd removed from the supernatant in the absence of actin. Because the amount of protein lost during the pre-spin and the co-sedimentation assay are roughly the same, we conclude that protein loss likely reflects non-specific absorption to the walls of the centrifuge tubes. The small amount of Lpd lost to the walls of centrifuge tubes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> does not change our overall conclusions. The only significant effect is that the saturating values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref> would shift down (but not left or right). This does not affect our estimate of the affinity but does alter the apparent binding stoichiometry, which remains difficult to estimate using actin co-sedimentation. To highlight this minor caveat in the revised manuscript, we noted a possible 5-10% over-estimate in the stoichiometry of Lpd bound to actin. We also added a complete description of our co-sedimentation assay to the revised manuscript.</p><p>Although we performed the suggested experiment we actually take exception to this comment for several reasons. Firstly, we were asked to perform co-sedimentation experiments to verify the binding data that we measured directly using TIRF microscopy. This appears to be based on the assumption that co-sedimentation is a sort of gold standard for actin filament binding. As I am sure the reviewer is aware, co-sedimentation is an inherently flawed binding assay. It is not an equilibrium method and, therefore, not nearly as accurate as fluorescence-based assays such as polarization anisotropy or direct TIRF imaging as presented in our original manuscript. Co-sedimentation systematically underestimates the affinities of actin binding proteins and fails to detect even physiologically relevant interactions when the dissociation equilibrium constant is too high. This problem is exacerbated when the experiment is performed, as the reviewer suggests, in low (substoichiometric) concentrations of the actin-binding protein. Therefore, while a positive result by co-sedimentation can confirm actin filament binding, a negative result does not provide good evidence against binding.</p><p>In addition, it is not fair to say that varying Lpd concentration is “not an optimal way to perform an actin filament co-sedimentation assay.” In fact, this turns out to be a common way of performing the experiment, in part because it is the only way to use co-sedimentation to assess the stoichiometry or cooperativity of actin filament binding.</p><p>The only significant virtue of co-sedimentation assays is that they are very easy to perform. Over-reliance on such assays has likely resulted in failure to identify many physiologically significant binding partners of filamentous actin (including Lpd). The concentration of actin filaments in the cortex and leading lamella is extremely high (∼mM) and so to maintain a dynamic cytoskeleton most filament-binding proteins must have fast dissociation rate constants.</p><p><italic>2) Why do monomeric Lpd and dimeric LZ-Lpd reach the same plateau at saturation of the curves (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1I</italic></xref><italic>). Does that mean that the two actin binding domains of the LZ-Lpd construct cannot bind simultaneously to F-actin? This should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer’s comment suggests that we did not describe this plot well enough in the previous version of our manuscript. For both the x- and y-axes of this plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) we used the concentrations of monomeric GFP-Lpd and GFP-LZ-Lpd, rather than the concentration of dimeric GFP-LZ-Lpd. The concentration of GFP-LZ-Lpd dimer would actually be half the values on the x-axis. The fact that both monomeric and dimeric constructs reach the same plateau at saturation argues strongly that the two binding domains of GFP-LZ-Lpd can simultaneously bind filaments. In contrast, if only one Lpd in the LZ-Lpd construct could interact with actin filaments, we would expect to see a higher concentration of LZ-Lpd in the pellet at the saturation point, as compared to monomeric Lpd under the same conditions. We have rewritten the text and figure caption associated with this experiment to make our results and analysis clearer.</p><p><italic>3) Based on the legend to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>, the co-sedimentation assays were carried out in the presence of phalloidin. Does Lpd</italic><sup><italic>850-1250aa</italic></sup> <italic>only bind phalloidin stabilized actin filaments (or filaments in the complete absence of actin monomers)? To clearly demonstrate interactions of Lpd</italic><sup><italic>850-1250aa</italic></sup> <italic>with ‘native’ and phalloidin stabilized actin filaments, the co-sedimentation assay described above should be also performed in the presence and absence of phalloidin</italic>.</p><p>As noted in the response to the first comment, we performed actin co-sedimentation assays both in the presence and absence of phalloidin (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1<italic>–</italic>figure supplement 1D</xref>). The results of these experiments agree with our previous observations that Lpd binds actin filaments regardless of whether they are stabilized by phalloidin. To reinforce this point we have now included TIRF assay data showing that Lpd bundles polymerizing actin filaments in the presence of 2 µM monomeric actin and 1 µM Lpd (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8<italic>–</italic>figure supplement 1</xref>). These results also highlight the fact that Lpd binds ‘native’ actin.</p><p>We previously showed that both GFP-Lpd and GFP-LZ-Lpd weakly associate with single actin filaments in the presence of monomeric actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Based on the reviewer’s comments, this appears to have been interpreted to mean that Lpd does not bind to actin filaments at all in the presence of actin monomers. We made an effort to clarify this point in our newly revised manuscript. We conclude that Lpd weakly associates with single actin filaments in the presence of monomeric actin, but binds well enough to promote filament bundling when present at a near stoichiometric concentration relative to monomeric actin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) The co-sedimentation assay should be described in the Materials and methods section. Furthermore, the authors should clearly explain in the figure legends whether the specific assays in each panel were performed with ‘native’ or phalloidin stabilized actin filaments</italic>.</p><p>This point is well taken. We have added a description of the actin co-sedimentation assay to the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript. We have also revised the figure legends to specify whether ‘native’ or phalloidin-stabilized actin filament were used for each experiment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
