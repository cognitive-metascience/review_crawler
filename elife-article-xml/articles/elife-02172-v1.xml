Yet, this death process is silent, and it does not cause inflammation. The molecular mechanisms underlying anti-inflammatory nature of the apoptotic process remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that the culture supernatant of apoptotic cells activated the macrophages to express anti-inflammatory genes such as <italic>Nr4a</italic> and <italic>Thbs1</italic>. A high level of AMP accumulated in the apoptotic cell supernatant in a Pannexin1-dependent manner. A nucleotidase inhibitor and A2a adenosine receptor antagonist inhibited the apoptotic supernatant-induced gene expression, suggesting AMP was metabolized to adenosine by an ecto-5’-nucleotidase expressed on macrophages, to activate the macrophage A2a adenosine receptor. Intraperitoneal injection of zymosan into <italic>Adora2a-</italic> or <italic>Panx1-</italic>deficient mice produced high, sustained levels of inflammatory mediators in the peritoneal lavage. These results indicated that AMP from apoptotic cells suppresses inflammation as a ‘calm down’ signal.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02172.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02172.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02172.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Infections, toxins, and trauma can all injure tissue and cause the cells inside the tissue to die. When a cell dies, the membrane that surrounds it ruptures and its contents spill out, triggering inflammation of the surrounding tissues. This inflammation is part of the body’s efforts to begin the healing process but, if left uncontrolled, inflammation itself can cause further tissue damage.</p><p>Diseased or damaged cells can also ‘choose’ to kill themselves to protect other healthy cells. This process, which is called apoptosis, also eliminates about 100,000 cells that are too old, or just no longer needed, from the human body every second. A cell undergoing apoptosis essentially dismantles itself, and the remains of the cell are packaged up, and cleared away by the white blood cells. Interestingly, this programed cell death releases many of the same molecules as other dying cells, but does so without triggering inflammation. The reason behind this lack of inflammation has not been clear.</p><p>Now, Yamaguchi et al. have addressed this issue, and shown that cells undergoing apoptosis also release a chemical called adenosine monophosphate (AMP) that acts as a ‘calm down’ signal. The AMP is processed by white blood cells to a simpler chemical, which ‘switches on’ various genes in the white blood cells. This leads to the production of proteins that suppress the inflammation that would otherwise be triggered by other molecules released from the cells undergoing apoptosis. The findings of Yamaguchi et al. show how the community of cells in our body is kept in a healthy balance, and in the future, could improve our understanding and the treatment of inflammatory diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02172.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02172.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>adenosine receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Ministry of Education, Sports, and Culture in Japan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagata</surname><given-names>Shigekazu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Japan Science Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagata</surname><given-names>Shigekazu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Apoptotic cells release molecules to recruit macrophages, but do not cause inflammation because they also secrete AMP that functions as a ‘calm down’ signal.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Approximately, 100,000 cells undergo apoptosis every second in our bodies, and are engulfed by macrophages and immature dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fuchs and Steller, 2011</xref>). Inefficient clearance of apoptotic cells causes systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-type autoimmune disease in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Botto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanayama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Munoz et al., 2010</xref>). Apoptotic cells characteristically expose ‘eat me’ signal(s) to macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nagata et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ravichandran, 2011</xref>), and one of the primary ‘eat me’ signals is phosphatidylserine (PtdSer). PtdSer is a phospholipid that localizes to the inner leaflet of plasma membranes in healthy cells; however, when cells undergo apoptosis, it is exposed on the outer cell surface in a caspase-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fadok et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leventis and Grinstein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>). Macrophages express membrane proteins that function as receptors for PtdSer (e.g., Tim-4, stabllin 2, and BAI1), or opsonins that bind to PtdSer (e.g. MFG-E8, Protein S, and Gas6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nagata et al., 2010</xref>). Masking the PtdSer on apoptotic cells prevents their engulfment by macrophages, supporting the idea that PtdSer is an important ‘eat me’ signal.</p><p>Apoptotic cells also produce ‘find me’ signals to attract macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ravichandran, 2011</xref>). Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lauber et al., 2003</xref>), ATP/UTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elliott et al., 2009</xref>), fractalkine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Truman et al., 2008</xref>), and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gude et al., 2008</xref>) are released from apoptotic cells in a caspase-dependent manner. Macrophages express specific receptors for these signals (P2Y<sub>2</sub> for ATP and UTP, CX3CR1 for fractalkine, and S1PR1 for S1P), which may mediate migration to the dying cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ravichandran, 2011</xref>). The ‘find me’ signals are thought to prime macrophages for engulfment, for example by enhancing the expression of MFG-E8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miksa et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, LPC, ATP/UTP, and S1P are known to cause inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trautmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maceyka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meyer zu Heringdorf and Jakobs, 2007</xref>), which may contradict the anti-inflammatory nature of the apoptotic process. In addition, several groups showed that apoptotic cells produce growth-stimulating molecules such as Wnt3 or prostaglandin E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chera et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mollereau et al., 2013</xref>), which is also against the silent nature of the process. Thus, how the anti-inflammatory character of the apoptosis is maintained during the process has been unclear.</p><p>In this study, we found that soluble factors derived from the apoptotic cells activated macrophages to express immediate early response genes including anti-inflammatory genes such as <italic>Nuclear receptor 4A</italic> (<italic>Nr4a)</italic> and <italic>Thrombospondin</italic> (<italic>Thbs</italic>)<italic>1</italic>. Using <italic>Thbs1</italic> gene expression as a marker, the molecule responsible for the gene expression was identified as AMP. The overexpression of Pannexin 1 in apoptotic cells accelerated the accumulation of AMP in the culture supernatant of apoptotic cells, while a caspase-resistant form of Pannexin 1 inhibited the AMP accumulation. An inhibitor of ecto-5′-nucleotidase blocked the AMP-induced activation of the <italic>Thbs1</italic> gene in macrophages, while macrophages from A2a adenosine receptor (<italic>Adora2a</italic>)-deficient mice did not respond to AMP. These results indicated that AMP from apoptotic cells was converted to adenosine by an ecto-5′-nucleotidase on macrophages, and that the adenosine activated a set of genes in macrophages via the A2a adenosine receptor. Mice deficient in <italic>Adora2a</italic> or <italic>Panx1</italic> exhibited prolonged peritonitis following intraperitoneal zymosan injection, suggesting that the AMP released from apoptotic peritoneal cells exerted an anti-inflammatory effect by activating the A2a adenosine receptor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gene expression in macrophages by a factor released from apoptotic cells</title><p>If apoptotic cells produce ‘danger’ or ‘anti-danger’ signal(s), we rationalized that such signals would activate gene expression in macrophages. To investigate this possibility, we examined the effect of the culture supernatant from apoptotic cells on macrophage gene expression. Mouse WR19L transformants expressing Fas (W3 cells) were treated with Fas ligand (FasL) for 30 min, washed, and then further incubated for 60 min. Following FasL treatment, more than 90% of the W3 cells were Annexin V positive, and only small percentage were positive for both Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the majority of cells had undergone apoptosis but not necrosis. Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were then incubated for 1 hr with the supernatant of FasL-treated W3 cells, and subjected to microarray analysis.

The results indicated that AMP, but none of other nucleosides or nucleotides, activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Apyrase, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP, had no effect on the apoptotic cell supernatant activity, indicating that the factor was not ATP or ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, adenosine-5’-O-(α, β- methylenediphosphate) (AOPCP), a non-hydrolyzable ADP analog that inhibits the ecto-5′-nucleotidase, blocked the <italic>Thbs1</italic> gene expression induced by the apoptotic cell supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that adenosine, but not AMP, is responsible for activation of the <italic>Thbs1</italic> gene in macrophages.

At 2 hr after the addition of FasL, the AMP level had increased to more than 4 μM in a culture of 1.0 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml. The concentration of ADP also increased, but was less pronounced compared with that of AMP. In contrast, at 2 hr the concentration of ATP was substantially lower, 40 nM or 40 pmoles per 10<sup>7</sup> cells. In various apoptosis systems, the intracellular ATP level is reported to remain high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eguchi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bossy-Wetzel et al., 1998</xref>).

When mouse thymocytes in a culture of 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml were treated with FasL for 90 min to induce apoptosis in approximately 70% of the cells (8% were PI positive), the culture supernatant was found to contain 3.5 μM AMP, whereas the supernatant of healthy cells cultured for 1 hr contained approximately 0.2 μM AMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Consistent with our finding using W3 cells, the levels of ATP and ADP in the FasL-treated thymocyte were 40 and 100 times lower than that of AMP, respectively.

For instance, extracellular ATP regulates the microglial response to brain injury via P1 or P2 purinergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davalos et al., 2005</xref>), and adenosine modulates sleep–wake cycles via A2a adenosine receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Urade et al., 2003</xref>). Although the release of adenine nucleotides mainly occurs by exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pascual et al., 2005</xref>), it is also mediated by transport via channel proteins. Connexins, which form gap junctions, can serve as hemichannels, and allow ATP to exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cotrina et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spray et al., 2006</xref>). Pannexins, which carry 4 transmembrane regions with intracellular N- and C-terminal tails, are structurally similar to connexins and also form hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yen and Saier, 2007</xref>). Various physiological and pathological stimuli such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx, shear stress, and apoptotic cell death, can cause Pannexin 1 channels to open, allowing the passage of molecules smaller than 1.0 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D’Hondt et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chekeni et al. (2010)</xref> recently showed that in the early stages of apoptosis, caspases cleave Pannexin 1 resulting in the release of ATP, which can serve as a ‘find me’ signal to attract macrophages.</p><p>In this study, we found that AMP was present at 30- to 100-fold higher concentrations than ATP in the culture supernatants of apoptotic thymocytes and a T cell line. The ATP concentration in healthy cells is approximately 10–50 times higher than that of AMP. However, when cells undergo apoptosis, ATP is quickly hydrolyzed to AMP, while its generating system is inactivated by caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ricci et al., 2004</xref>). The caspase-cleaved Pannexin channel also contributes to the cellular loss of ATP by allowing ATP to exit cells through the plasma membrane. Thus, the AMP found in apoptotic cell supernatants could have been extracellularly converted from ATP by E-NTPDase. However, the ability of apoptotic or healthy W3 cell supernatants to hydrolyze ATP was very low, suggesting that E-NTPDase was not responsible for the accumulation of AMP in the apoptotic cell supernatants. Thus, it is possible that AMP generated intracellularly in apoptotic cells was released from through these channels.</p><p>The engulfment of apoptotic cells is a silent process that does not activate inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nagata et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ravichandran, 2011</xref>). Since macrophages ingesting apoptotic cells produce TGFβ or IL-10 that inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Voll et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fadok et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lucas et al., 2006</xref>), this interaction and/or engulfment was thought to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Köröskényi et al. (2011)</xref> recently reported that macrophages engulfing apoptotic cells released adenosine to suppress inflammation. In contrast, we show here that apoptotic cells secrete AMP, which is converted to adenosine, resulting in macrophage activation via adenosine receptors, followed by the upregulation of <italic>Thbs</italic>1 and <italic>Nr4a</italic> gene expression. When the apoptotic cells could not release AMP due to the expression of caspase-resistant form of pannexin 1, the <italic>Thbs1</italic> gene expression was not up-regulated. Furthermore, the AMP released from the resident peritoneal macrophages engulfing apoptotic cells was significantly smaller than that released from apoptotic cells (HY, and SN, data not shown). These results suggest that the contribution of the interaction of apoptotic cells with macrophages to anti-inflammatory effect may not be great. Thbs1 is the major activator of TGFβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crawford et al., 1998</xref>), whereas Nr4a family members inhibit the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-8, and IL-6 in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonta et al., 2006</xref>), by recruiting a repressor complex to their promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saijo et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, this may be one mechanism that suppresses inflammation during the apoptosis process.</p><p>The conversion of AMP to adenosine is catalyzed by CD73, an ecto-5’-nucleotidase, expressed on the surface of endothelial and immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deaglio and Robson, 2011</xref>).

They are also susceptible to polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture, and exhibit increased mortality and systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hasko et al., 2011</xref>). Our results suggest that the substrate for CD73 in these models may be AMP released from apoptotic cells. If AMP cannot be converted to adenosine in the absence CD73, then activation of the immune system in response to the ‘danger signal(s)’ released from apoptotic cells would not be opposed.</p><p>We conclude that apoptotic cells themselves contribute to the ‘anti-inflammatory’ nature of the engulfment process by secreting AMP as an immunosuppressive ‘calm-down’ signal.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David Wallach (Reviewing editor) and Martin Herrmann (peer reviewer).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Both reviewers found your findings to be novel and important, and recommended publication. However, to place your new findings in perspective with regard to prior studies you are requested to address the following two questions in your manuscript, either by new data or just by discussing them:</p><p>1) Does the effect of extracellular adenosine fully account for the anti-inflammatory effect of apoptotic cells on macrophages that take them up, or only to a fraction of it? This can be answered by determining the actual concentrations of AMP and adenosine in the co-culture of apoptotic cells and macrophages and then comparing the extent of anti-inflammatory effect of the apoptotic cells (as assessed for example by quantifying the upregulation of one of the anti-inflammatory genes in the macrophages) to the anti-inflammatory effect of AMP and adenosine, when applied to the macrophages at those same concentrations, yet in the absence of apoptotic cells.</p><p>2) Is the extracellular adenosine in co-cultures of apoptotic cells and macrophages indeed fully derived from the apoptotic cells or, as was suggested previously by Köröskényi et al., in part also derived from the mononuclear phagocytes that take them up. An answer to the latter question can be obtained by comparing the concentrations of AMP+ Adenosine in cultures at which the mononuclear phagocytes are allowed to take up apoptotic cells to those in cultures of the same cells in which such uptake is prevented, for example by a semipermeable barrier.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02172.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Does the effect of extracellular adenosine fully account for the anti-inflammatory effect of apoptotic cells on macrophages that take them up, or only to a fraction of it?

To address the above question, we treated the parental W3 and the W3 cell transformants expressing the caspase-resistant pannexin1, and co-cultured for 1 h with Bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDM). The Thbs1 gene expression in BMDM was then quantified by real-time PCR, and was found that BMDM co-cultured with the FasL-treated wild-type W3 cells strongly express Thbs1. But, this was not observed when BMDM was co-cultured with FasL-treated W3 cells expressing the caspase-resistant form of Pannexin 1. The result was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> of the revised manuscript and explained.</p><p><italic>2) Is the extracellular adenosine in co-cultures of apoptotic cells and macrophages indeed fully derived from the apoptotic cells or, as was suggested previously by Köröskényi et al., in part also derived from the mononuclear phagocytes that take them up.

The macrophages were thoroughly washed with medium to remove apoptotic cells, and cultured for 5 h. The AMP level increased in the supernatant was about 30 nM, corresponding to 30 pmoles per 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells. This value is significantly lower than that produced by apoptotic cells (7 nmols per 10<sup>7</sup> cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This point was briefly mentioned in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
