xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> we published a Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lesnik et al., 2016</xref>) that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper ‘Melanoma exosomes educate bone marrow progenitor cells toward a pro-metastatic phenotype through MET’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peinado et al., 2012</xref>). Here we report the results. We regenerated tumor cells stably expressing a short hairpin to reduce Met expression (shMet) using the same highly metastatic mouse melanoma cell line (B16-F10) as the original study, which efficiently downregulated Met in B16F10 cells similar to the original study (Supplementary Figure 5A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peinado et al., 2012</xref>). Exosomes from control cells expressed Met, which was reduced in exosomes from shMet cells; however, we were unable to reliably detect phosphorylated Met in exosomes. We tested the effect of exosome-dependent Met signaling on primary tumor growth and metastasis. Similar to the results in the original study, we did not find a statistically significant change in primary tumor growth. Measuring lung and femur metastases, we found a small increase in metastatic burden with exosomes from control cells that was diminished when Met expression was reduced; however, while the effects were in the same direction as the original study (Figure 4E; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peinado et al., 2012</xref>), they were not statistically significant. Differences between the original study and this replication attempt, such as level of knockdown efficiency, cell line genetic drift, sample sizes, study endpoints, and variability of observed metastatic burden, are factors that might have influenced the outcomes. Finally, we report meta-analyses for each result.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>metascience</kwd><kwd>reproducibility</kwd><kwd>exosomes</kwd><kwd>Met</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009827</institution-id><institution>Laura and John Arnold Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><institution>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</institution></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Editors' Summary: This Replication Study has reproduced some parts of the original paper but other parts could not be interpreted.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> (RP:CB) is a collaboration between the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cos.io/">Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/">Science Exchange</ext-link> that seeks to address concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Errington et al., 2014</xref>). For each of these papers a Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for the replications was peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The present paper is a Replication Study that reports the results of the replication experiments detailed in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lesnik et al., 2016</xref>) for a paper by Peinado et al., and uses a number of approaches to compare the outcomes of the original experiments and the replications.</p><p>In 2012, Peinado et al. reported that exosomes isolated from highly metastatic murine melanoma cells (B16-F10) increased the metastatic burden of the primary tumors compared to exosomes from poorly metastatic melanomas (B16-F1) or control liposomes. Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (Met) was identified as a highly expressed protein in B16-F10 exosomes. Reduction of Met, and phosphorylated Met (pMet) by shRNA in B16-F10 exosomes resulted in a statistically significant decrease in lung and bone metastatic burden compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peinado et al., 2012</xref>). Exosomes derived from melanoma cells were proposed to promote metastasis by education of bone marrow-derived cells through horizontal transfer of exosomal Met in order to prime the pre-metastatic niche and increase vascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peinado et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The Registered Report for the paper by Peinado et al. described the experiments to be replicated (Figure 4E and Supplementary Figures 1C and 5A), and summarized the current evidence for these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lesnik et al., 2016</xref>). Since that publication, additional studies have reported in different models that tumor derived exosomes administered to mice prior to tumor cell injection increased metastatic burden by inducing pre-metastatic niche formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costa-Silva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoshino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Plebanek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, using the same tumor model as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peinado et al., 2012</xref>, Met expression was found to be heterogeneous in B16-F10 cells, with higher lung metastatic burden, and lower primary tumor burden, in cells expressing high levels of Met compared to cells expressing low levels of Met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2016</xref>). Injection of exosomes from high Met expressing cells increased the metastatic burden of low Met expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2016</xref>). The molecules present on tumor-derived exosomes, such as the specific repertoire of integrins, are important in dictating metastatic organotropism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoshino et al., 2015</xref>). There have been numerous studies that have aimed to identify exosomal cargo (e.g. proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keerthikumar et al., 2016</xref>). Similar to the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peinado et al., 2012</xref>, other studies, using various techniques (e.g. proteomic profiling, reverse phase protein array), have identified MET in exosomes from melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lazar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Steenbeek et al., 2018</xref>) as well as in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2015</xref>), neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keerthikumar et al., 2015</xref>), ovarian cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liang et al., 2013</xref>), sera from healthy donors and prostate cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cannistraci et al., 2017</xref>), 293 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2016</xref>), and as a fusion protein (PTPRZ1-MET) in glioblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zeng et al., 2017</xref>), while other studies did not identify MET in exosomes from breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) nor in some melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lazar et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The outcome measures reported in this Replication Study will be aggregated with those from the other Replication Studies to create a dataset that will be examined to provide evidence about reproducibility of cancer biology research, and to identify factors that influence reproducibility more generally.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and characterization of shMet B16-F10 cells and exosomes</title><p>To test the effect exosome-dependent Met signaling has on primary tumor growth and metastasis, we used the same highly metastatic mouse melanoma cell line (B16-F10) and the same lentiviral system as the original study to make B16-F10 cells stably expressing an shRNA targeting <italic>Met</italic> (shMet) or a control shRNA (shScr) using the same targeting sequences as the original study.

We confirmed the presence of the known exosome markers Hsc70, Tsg101, and Cd63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and found exosome number and size distribution quantified by NanoSight analyses to be similar between the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To test if Met and pMet were expressed in B16-F10 exosomes we performed Western blots and found that compared to shScr exosomes the amount of Met expressed in shMet exosomes was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); however, we were unable to reliably detect pMet expression in exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, this was not due to the inability of the antibody to detect pMet by Western blot, since pMet was detected in cell lysates run on the same gel. Additionally, as a preventative measure to block any residual phosphatase activity, we added inhibitors when preparing the isolated exosomes for electrophoresis. However, if there were carryover phosphatases present during isolation of exosomes by ultracentrifugation the pMet levels could have been diminished before the inhibitors were added. Furthermore, the exosomes were prepared for electrophoresis after first being stored at −20˚C, instead of immediately after isolation, which might be critical for the detection of phospho-protein detection in exosomes. Inclusion of untransduced B16-F10 controls could have also indicated if unintended changes occurred in the stable cell lines utilized, especially given the potential impact puromycin selection can have on transcriptome profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2017</xref>), and should be considered in the experimental design of future studies. The original study reported Met and pMet expression by Western blot in B16-F10 exosomes; however, the level of knockdown achieved in shMet exosomes was not reported. To summarize, we observed reduced Met and pMet expression in shMet cells compared to shScr cells, consistent with the stable cells reported in the original study; however, while we detected Met in exosomes from shScr cells, that was reduced in exosomes from shMet cells, we were unable to reliably detect pMet expression in isolated exosomes.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39944.004</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Nanosight analysis of exosomes.</title><p>Summary of exosome number and size distribution, with or without the finite track length adjustment (FTLA) algorithm, quantified by NanoSight analysis.

Synthetic unilamellar 100 nm liposomes were used as a control to test if tumor exosomes enhance metastasis. This experiment is similar to what was reported in Figure 4E of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peinado et al., 2012</xref> and described in Protocol 3 in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lesnik et al., 2016</xref>). Freshly isolated exosomes from shScr or shMet cells, or synthetic liposomes, were injected into C57BL/6 female mice three times a week for a total of four weeks, thereafter we implanted B16-F10 tumor cells engineered to express luciferase (B16-F10-luc). The planned study design involved waiting 21 days after B16-F10-luc tumor cell implantation before sacrificing the mice for analysis; however, two animals were found dead before this time point was reached (17 days after implantation), and of the surviving mice, the largest tumors reached &gt;1 cm<sup>3</sup> prompting us to stop the experiment early (18 days after implantation). We measured primary tumor growth during the length of the study and observed increased growth among all the conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Interestingly, the primary tumors in mice injected with shScr exosomes were on average smaller than the primary tumors in mice injected with shMet or synthetic liposomes. This was also observed when measuring the weight of the dissected primary tumors at the end of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). There are a number of factors that can affect tumor growth, such as availability of nutrients, oxygen, and space that influence initial and continued growth of the tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cornelis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Talkington and Durrett, 2015</xref>).

Additionally, we conducted two planned comparisons (shScr vs shMet; shScr vs synthetic liposomes), which were not statistically significant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> figure legend). This is consistent with the original study that stated no differences in primary tumor growth between the three groups; however, those data were not shown, preventing direct comparison of the original study results and the results from this replication attempt.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39944.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Primary tumor growth and metastatic burden of mice injected with exosomes.</title><p>Female C57BL/6 mice were subcutaneously injected with B16-F10-luciferase cells after 4 weeks of intravenous injections (3 times a week) of shScr exosomes, shMet exosomes, or synthetic liposomes.

Mice injected with the shScr exosomes achieved an average of 1.0×10<sup>5</sup> photons/sec in the lungs, which was reduced to 4.2×10<sup>4</sup> photons/sec in mice injected with shMet exosomes and 5.3×10<sup>4</sup> photons/sec in mice injected with synthetic liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Thus, the group means of the natural log transformed lung metastatic burden data were 10.8, 10.4, and 10.5 log units, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). On average, there was a 36.9% natural log based percentage difference in lung metastatic burden between mice injected with shScr exosomes and shMet exosomes, and a 33.6% difference between mice injected with shScr and synthetic liposomes. To test if shMet exosomes or synthetic liposomes had decreased metastatic burden compared to shScr exosomes, we performed a one-way ANOVA on the luciferin photon flux values (natural log-transformed), which was not statistically significant (<italic>F</italic>(2,16) = 0.226, uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.800, Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.99). Additionally, we conducted two planned comparisons (shScr vs synthetic liposomes; shScr vs shMet), which were not statistically significant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> figure legend). The original study reported metastatic burden in the lungs of mice injected with shScr exosomes [M = 5.1×10<sup>4</sup> photons/sec; 10.8 log units] were reduced by 165.3% [M = 1.3×10<sup>4</sup> photons/sec; 9.1 log units] and 80.0% [M = 2.3×10<sup>4</sup> photons/sec; 10.0 log units] with shMet exosomes and synthetic liposomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peinado et al., 2012</xref>). The range of metastatic lung values reported in the original study had a relative standard deviation (RSD) that were smaller (shScr = 2.9%; shMet = 9.9%; synthetic liposome = 3.8%) than the RSD observed in this replication attempt (shScr = 13%; shMet = 7.1%; synthetic liposome = 9.7%), particularly among the shScr and synthetic liposome groups.</p><p>For femurs, the average metastatic burden of mice injected with the shScr exosomes achieved an average of 7.4×10<sup>5</sup> photons/sec (12.2 log units), which was reduced to 3.3×10<sup>5</sup> photons/sec (12.1 log units) in mice injected with shMet exosomes and 1.9×10<sup>5</sup> photons/sec (11.7 log units) in mice injected with synthetic liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). So, on average, there was a 7.8% natural log based percentage difference in femur metastatic burden between mice injected with shScr exosomes and shMet exosomes, and a 44.3% difference between mice injected with shScr and synthetic liposomes, which was not statistically significant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> figure legend). While the original study reported metastatic burden in the femurs of mice injected with shScr exosomes [M = 4.5×10<sup>4</sup> photons/sec; 10.4 log units], there was no reported metastatic burden in the femurs of mice injected with shMet exosomes or synthetic liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peinado et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, similar to the lung values, the RSD for the metastatic femur values were smaller in the original study (shScr = 8.4%; shMet = 0%; synthetic liposome = 0%) than this replication attempt (shScr = 14%; shMet = 10%; synthetic liposome = 8.4%).</p><p>The higher RSD observed in this study is one of the factors that could influence if statistical significance is reached, particularly since the sample size of this replication attempt was determined <italic>a priori</italic> to detect the effect based on the originally reported data. Importantly, these results should take into consideration the experimental endpoint of this replication attempt, which was shorter than the original study and what was indicated in the Registered Report (18 days instead of 21 days), which could account for less macro-metastasis. Also, as mentioned above, inclusion of untransduced B16-F10 controls could have indicated if unintended changes to the cargo of exosomes from the stable cell lines utilized occurred and should be considered in the experimental design of future studies. To summarize, for this experiment we found results that were in the same direction as the original study and not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Meta-analysis of original and replication effects</title><p>We performed a meta-analysis using a random-effects model, where possible, to combine each of the effects described above as pre-specified in the confirmatory analysis plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lesnik et al., 2016</xref>). To provide a standardized measure of the effect, a common effect size was calculated for each effect from the original and replication studies. Cliff’s delta (<italic>d</italic>) is a non-parametric estimate of effect size that measures how often a value in one group is larger than the values from another group. It is used in this case because of violations to the assumptions of normality and equal variance in the original and replication studies. Importantly, the confidence interval around Cliff’s <italic>d</italic> is asymmetric, while the <italic>p</italic> value is calculated using the normal distribution and is thus not well defined; however, there is no agreement on how to compute <italic>p</italic> values from an asymmetric distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunne et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rohatgi and Saleh, 2000</xref>).

Any known differences, including reagents and protocol differences, were identified prior to conducting the experimental work and described in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lesnik et al., 2016</xref>). However, this is limited to what was obtainable from the original paper and through communication with the original authors, which means there might be particular features of the original experimental protocol that could be critical, but unidentified. So while some aspects, such as cell line, mouse strain, and technique for exosome isolation were maintained, others were changed during the execution of the replication that could affect results, such as the time from cell injection after exosome education until euthanasia, which was shorter in this replication attempt than what was conducted in the original study (18 days instead of 21 days). Additionally, others were unknown or not easily controlled for. These include variables such as cell-intrinsic changes in Met expression and the associated gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2016</xref>), cell line genetic drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-David et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hughes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kleensang et al., 2016</xref>), non-random genetic/transcriptional drift in the heterogeneous stable cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shearer and Saunders, 2015</xref>), genetic heterogeneity of mouse inbred strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Casellas, 2011</xref>), the microbiome of recipient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Macpherson and McCoy, 2015</xref>), housing temperature in mouse facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kokolus et al., 2013</xref>), and lot variability and quality of key reagents, such as the lentiviral particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leek et al., 2010</xref>). Environmental differences such as husbandry staff, bedding type and source, light levels, and other intangibles, all of which, by necessity, differed between the studies also affect experimental outcomes with mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Howard, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jensen and Ritskes-Hoitinga, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nevalainen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sorge et al., 2014</xref>). The difference in sample sizes between the studies is also a factor that could limit the opportunity to detect a statistically significant difference, especially considering the higher variability observed in this replication attempt, as described above. The difference in achieved knockdown of Met in exosomes between the original study and this replication attempt is another important factor to consider. A higher level of knockdown might be required to yield a given phenotype with this experimental design. Importantly, observing and reporting all outcomes are informative to establish the range of conditions under which a given phenotype can be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailoo et al., 2014</xref>). Whether these or other factors influence the outcomes of this study is open to hypothesizing and further investigation, which is facilitated by direct replications and transparent reporting.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <break/>C57BL/6, female)</td><td>C57BL/6</td><td>Charles River</td><td>Strain code: <break/>027;

Both antibodies gave similar results (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10983015">AB_10983015</ext-link>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/96tcs/">https://osf.io/96tcs/</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_331361">AB_331361</ext-link>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For the <italic>in vivo</italic> experimentation, the planned study design involved waiting 21 days after B16-F10-luciferase tumor cell implantation before sacrificing the mice for analysis; however, two animals were found dead (one injected with B16-F19 shScr exosomes and one injected with synthetic liposomes) before this time point was reached, which in addition the largest tumors of the surviving mice having reached &gt;1000 mm<sup>3</sup>, prompted us to stop the experiment early (18 days after implantation). Additional materials and instrumentation not listed in the Registered Report, but needed during experimentation are also listed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology would like to thank Dr. David Lyden (Weill Medical College of Cornell University) and Hector Peinado (Spanish National Cancer Research Centre) for sharing critical reagents, data, and protocol information during preparation of the Registered Report, specifically the B16-F10 and B16-F10-luciferase cells.

Your article has been evaluated by Charles Sawyers as the Senior Editor, Michael Green as the Reviewing Editor, and two expert reviewers.</p><p>There are a number of issues that need to be seriously addressed as outlined below in the separate reviews. We realise that additional work that was not outlined in the Registered Report is outside the scope of the project, but we would ask you to respond to each point, revising the text accordingly, and stating the necessary caveats in response (rather than performing additional experiments).</p><p>We would like to emphasize that in addition to changes in the main text, the Abstract must be modified to accurately reflect the data generated and their issues. Reviewer 1 had this to add about the Abstract:</p><p>&quot;Most importantly, the abstract needs to be revised to specifically state the issues with animal death, failure of tumors to grow and off target effects of the control encountered in this report but not the original study. Moreover, the Abstract should clearly state that any lack of reproducibility is due to the aforementioned issues. Specifically, it should state that the failure to reproduce the results of the original study is because the author's own controls and experiments failed technically. Thus, no conclusions can be drawn.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>We would like to thank the authors for transparency in reporting results and analyses. However, upon reviewing the report, we identified several concerns that make it impossible to draw definitive conclusions from the presented data. Therefore, the study should not be published as is, and suggest that the authors perform additional work to address the major problems they have encountered that are not otherwise reported in other studies in the field, including the original study. Moreover, the authors need to include additional controls that would allow direct comparison with previous studies.</p><p>First and foremost, the Abstract, as written, is misleading and should be re-written before publication is considered. In the current version, the Abstract states that the authors 1) could not &quot;reliably detect phospho-Met (pMet) in exosomes&quot; and that 2) and that &quot;while the effects [on metastasis] were in the same direction as the original study (Figure 4E; Peinado et al., 2012), they were not statistically significant&quot;. These conclusions cannot be drawn based on the data presented in the report due to experimental design and technical issues detailed below. Therefore, the statements in the Abstract need to be amended to reflect the measurement variability, lack of tumor growth in some animals, animal death and off target effects evident in this report.</p><p>The most significant issue encountered in this report is the fact that the authors' data on both Met expression and primary tumor growth indicates there are off-target effect(s) with their &quot;non-targeting&quot; scrambled shRNA. A more appropriate control, at least done in parallel, would have been to use the shEmpty vector that does not contain a scrambled sequence. An even better and more relevant control would have been to use the unmodified/untransduced, parental B16F10 cell line-derived exosomes for education and ensure that a level of primary tumor growth and metastasis equivalent to the original study is obtained under these conditions.</p><p>Specifically, in Figure 1A, the shScr control cells should express Met, while the shMet cells should not express Met. The data presented by the authors shows the contrary – is this a labeling mistake? Moreover, it is unclear from the data presented in Figure 1A and B if the replicates are technical or biological replicates (if so, are they independent exosome collections from the same batch of shScr or shMet lentivirus-infected cells, or are they independent infections?).</p><p>Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine if the authors' inability to detect pMet in shScr and scMet exosomes is a technical issue or a problem with the cell models, because the essential control B16F10 cells and exosomes that should have robust expression of Met and pMet was not used. The authors need to revise their experimental design and repeat their experiments including this control, which was present in the original Peinado et al. paper as well as in numerous other publications before any conclusions can be drawn. Importantly, the authors should highlight that, consistent with original report by Peinado et al., the shMet construct efficiently downregulated Met in B16F10 cells and their exosomes.</p><p>There could be several explanations that need to be explored that could account for the lack of pMet detection in exosomes in this report. First of all, it is unclear if fresh exosomes had been used in these Western Blot experiments (authors only indicate the use of freshly-isolated exosomes in in vivo studies) but it would also be critical that fresh exosomes be used for phospho-protein detection in exosomes. The authors actually state that exosomes were &quot;stored at -20°C until analysis” therefore, the analysis of phosphoproteins should be repeated immediately following isolation, resuspension in PBS, measurement of protein and resuspension in Laemmli buffer. This should all be performed using fresh exosomes.</p><p>Importantly, many published studies, in additional to the original report from Peinado et al., 2012, have since validated and were able to detect Met as well as pMet in B16F10 exosomes and other exosomes. These studies are listed below, they should be included in the reference list of this report and discussed in the context of the authors' results.</p><p>• Steenbeek et al., 2018 – Figure 4 shows Met expression in B16F10 exosomes</p><p>• Barrow-McGee R et al., Nature Communications, PMID: 27336951 – shows cMet and pMet in endosomes throughout the paper</p><p>• Tripolitsioti D et al., Oncotarget, PMID: 29796184 – throughout the paper and Supplementary Figure 5D (Met), 6B (pMet)</p><p>• Adachi et al., 2016 – shows both Met and pMet in Figure 1C</p><p>• Cannistraci et al., 2017 – shows both Met and pMet in Figure 2D</p><p>• Plebanek MP et al., 2017</p><p>• Zeng et al., 2017 – shows both Met and pMet</p><p>• He et al., 2015 – shows both Met and pMet in Figure 4E.</p><p>Another cause for concern with this report is the off target effect present in the only control used in this study, the shScr control. As shown in Figure 2A of the report and pointed out by the authors in their results, using a lower multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10, the same used in the original Peinado et al. paper, the authors of this report find there is a significant on target effect of the control shScr, as Met levels are downregulated. Strangely, the authors are able to reduce the on target effect of the control shScr by increasing the MOI to 20 or 50. Most likely, this is due to the oligomers binding to other targets, and thus an increase in off target effects. Since these are commercial lentiviral particles, and the time passed since the initial report, it would be critical for the authors to verify with the company that they still use the same sequence as control as reported in the original paper. In this manuscript the authors do not define the targeting sequence as in the original report (Peinado et al., specified that sense sequence used, obtained from Thermo was: 5′-ATCTCGCTTGGGCGAGAGTAAG-3′) but the authors in the current report do not describe the sequence and use pGIPZ non-silencing shRNA lentiviral control particles from Dharmacon/GE Life 281 Sciences, cat# RHS4348, lot# 150529606. Moreover, the difference in results could be due to lot variability or quality of commercial virus (this should be discussed by the authors in the report). Minor concerns regarding Figure 2 are the inconsistency of GAPDH loading control levels as well as the presentation of MOIs out of order (10, then 50, then 20). The authors need to provide empty vector and non-transduced cell controls for these experiments. Moreover, to investigate the off target effects of the shScr they should perform transcriptomics analyses of the non-transduced, empty vector, shScr and shMet B16-F10 cells. They can also perform unbiased proteomics analysis of shScr versus shMet versus B16F10 exosomes to determine if/how the cargo of shScr exosomes is affected by off target effects. The authors should test proliferation and apoptosis of shScr cells, to account for any consequences of off target effects of the shScr construct on the health of these cells. This is critical because of the issues evident in Figure 3.</p><p>The other major cause of concern, that precludes the data from this report being interpretable and the drawing of any conclusions, is, as evident from Figure 3A, B), the fact that the primary tumors growing in animals educated with shScr exosomes are smaller than those in the liposome-treated controls, could this be because of their issues with the control particles? Additionally, whereas the size of primary tumors growing in the liposome or shMET treated groups is reproducible and similar, there is variability in the growth of the tumors in the shScr treated mice, with some of the tumors as small as 0.025 g, which is 32-fold smaller than the mean of the other groups, which is 0.8 g. Consistent with the original report by Peinado et al., the authors do not find differences in tumor growth between liposome treated mice and shMet mice. Given the dramatic reduction in tumor growth in the shScr control treated mice, and the large variability in the growth of these tumors, it is not surprising that the authors of this report fail to find statistically significant differences in lung and bone metastasis between the shScr control and shMet exosome educated mice. Therefore, before any conclusions can be drawn, and to account for the large variability and off target effect of the shScr control and in this experiment overall, the authors need to repeat the experiment increasing animal numbers and including animals educated with un-transduced, parental B16F10 exosomes to demonstrate that, in their hands, they can obtain consistent primary tumor growth and metastasis levels without the confounding contribution of the off-target effects in the shScr. Moreover, to reiterate, the differences between the shScr and shMet cannot be deemed non-significant since the lack of significance stems from the high variance and lower than expected primary tumor size in the shScr control group.</p><p>Importantly, there is lack of tumor growth in some animals and death of animals injected with exosomes. B16F10 are aggressive tumors with robust growth that do not fail to implant or grow, therefore the fact that the authors of this study encounter challenges in having tumors grow in all animals injected with control cells reflect either 1) technical issues with cell viability, injection, etc. and/or 2) the fact that the off target effects of the shScr exosomes used for education are effectively inhibiting tumor growth. These issues need to be resolved before this report can be published.</p><p>Additionally, it is concerning that education of animals with 5 μg of shScr B16F10 exosomes leads to the death of some animals. This was not reported in publications with either 5 μg or 10 μg of B16F10 exosomes (for example in the original publication or in Dr. Olga Volpert's Nature Communications, 2018 report injected 10 μg of B16F10 exosomes repeatedly with no death). The deaths observed by the authors of the present study upon exosome injection are worrisome. Have the authors verified that they are measuring exosomal protein accurately after isolation? The authors should define the buffer used for exosome resuspension (in the original report was PBS as stated &quot;The floating exosome fraction was collected again by ultracentrifugation as above, and the final pellet was resuspended in PBS&quot;). Mouse lethality could reflect inaccurate exosome protein quantification. Alternatively, the presence of exosome aggregates in the preparation would lead to animal death, to avoid this exosomes should be vigorously resuspended before injection (10 times at least). Last but not least, the health of the cells from which the exosomes are collected can significantly influence the quality of the exosomes and could affect animal health (especially in the context of the shScr off target effects).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Overall this replication study was carried out appropriately. I have some concerns about the quality of the data presented (in point 1) and some other comments, as follows:</p><p>1) In Figure 1, The Western blots give a variety of concerns. First, they are all very dark and overblown. I would also like to see the full blots – they should probably be included in the published paper. Second, for Figure 1A, the blot comparing the shScr and shMet in the cells shows much higher Met in the shMet cells then in the controls. I presume that is a mistake? Third, is GAPDH a relevant loading control or does it change in exosomes with Met?</p><p>2) For Figure 1—figure supplement 1, I also don't see how a shMet can be compared to shSc when they are on different blots and it seems strange to compare the MOI to just each other and not untreated cells. This is a relatively minor concern – the assessment of Met KD in Figure 1 is the most important.</p><p>3) For the analysis of tumor metastasis, are the data normal or not normal? It seems like statistical analyses were used that are appropriate for data with a non-Gaussian distribution. Therefore, I'm not sure why mean and SEM are used to represent the data, which are only appropriate for data with a Gaussian distribution.</p><p>4) For differences between this study and Peinado that are listed in the last paragraph of the Results/Discussion section of the paper, I think differences in Met signaling and in the effectiveness of knockdown (which I also doubt based on the quality of the Western blots here) should be mentioned. In addition, the study was not carried out as long as the Peinado study (18 days instead of 21 days) after exosome education, so this should be mentioned in the last paragraph too. There were also fewer mice, which could definitely affect detection of statistical significance, which should be mentioned.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39944.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are a number of issues that need to be seriously addressed as outlined below in the separate reviews. We realise that additional work that was not outlined in the Registered Report is outside the scope of the project, but we would ask you to respond to each point, revising the text accordingly, and stating the necessary caveats in response (rather than performing additional experiments).</p><p>We would like to emphasize that in addition to changes in the main text, the Abstract must be modified to accurately reflect the data generated and their issues. Reviewer 1 had this to add about the Abstract:</p><p>&quot;Most importantly, the abstract needs to be revised to specifically state the issues with animal death, failure of tumors to grow and off target effects of the control encountered in this report but not the original study. Moreover, the Abstract should clearly state that any lack of reproducibility is due to the aforementioned issues. Specifically, it should state that the failure to reproduce the results of the original study is because the author's own controls and experiments failed technically. Thus, no conclusions can be drawn.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with the statement that ‘failure to reproduce the results of the original study is because the author’s own controls and experiments failed technically’. The replication was performed with the same controls, cells, shRNA sequences, etc. as reported in the original study for these experiments with input from the original authors and peer review of the Registered Report. The specific concerns raised have been addressed below and as appropriately the text has been revised. Additionally, while technical concerns and hidden moderators might be factors that influence both the original and replication results, as Reviewer #1 suggests, another likely factor is biological variation. We agree that the results we reported could be attributed to observable, or hypothetical, differences between the original study and this replication and we have revised the Abstract to highlight this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>We would like to thank the authors for transparency in reporting results and analyses. However, upon reviewing the report, we identified several concerns that make it impossible to draw definitive conclusions from the presented data. Therefore, the study should not be published as is, and suggest that the authors perform additional work to address the major problems they have encountered that are not otherwise reported in other studies in the field, including the original study. Moreover, the authors need to include additional controls that would allow direct comparison with previous studies.</p><p>First and foremost, the Abstract, as written, is misleading and should be re-written before publication is considered. In the current version, the Abstract states that the authors 1) could not &quot;reliably detect phospho-Met (pMet) in exosomes&quot; and that 2) and that &quot;while the effects [on metastasis] were in the same direction as the original study (Figure 4E; Peinado et al., 2012), they were not statistically significant&quot;. These conclusions cannot be drawn based on the data presented in the report due to experimental design and technical issues detailed below. Therefore, the statements in the Abstract need to be amended to reflect the measurement variability, lack of tumor growth in some animals, animal death and off target effects evident in this report.</p><p>The most significant issue encountered in this report is the fact that the authors' data on both Met expression and primary tumor growth indicates there are off-target effect(s) with their &quot;non-targeting&quot; scrambled shRNA. A more appropriate control, at least done in parallel, would have been to use the shEmpty vector that does not contain a scrambled sequence. An even better and more relevant control would have been to use the unmodified/untransduced, parental B16F10 cell line-derived exosomes for education and ensure that a level of primary tumor growth and metastasis equivalent to the original study is obtained under these conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>The ‘non-targeting’ scrambled shRNA used in this replication was the same control used in the original study per the original paper methods and our communication with the original authors. The same sequence was confirmed from the commercial supplier before the replication was conducted and we included additional details of the sequence in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We agree that inclusion of untransduced B16-F10 cell line-derived exosomes would provide insight about possible effects that might have occurred during infection, such as genome instability. We have revised the manuscript to highlight the addition of untransduced B16-F10 cells as a control to consider for future experiments. For the experiments replicated, however, this additional control was not reported in the original study to allow for a comparison between untransduced B16-F10 and shScr cells (Figure 4A of the original study is between B16-F10 and B16-F1 cells and exosomes, Supplementary Figure 5A is between B16-F10, B16-F1, and B16-F10 shMet cells and exosomes, and Figure 4E of the metastasis results is between B16-F10, B16-F10 shMet, and liposome control). It was unclear from the original paper if the B16-F10 cells and exosomes used for the education experiment that was replicated were from untransduced cells or were shScramble; however, during peer review of the Registered Report it was suggested that the B16-F10 cells reported were shScramble transduced. Thus, we conducted this experiment similar to the original experimental design, which was reviewed by the original authors and peer reviewed prior to beginning the experimental work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specifically, in Figure 1A, the shScr control cells should express Met, while the shMet cells should not express Met. The data presented by the authors shows the contrary – is this a labeling mistake? Moreover, it is unclear from the data presented in Figure 1A and B if the replicates are technical or biological replicates (if so, are they independent exosome collections from the same batch of shScr or shMet lentivirus-infected cells, or are they independent infections?).</p><p>Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine if the authors' inability to detect pMet in shScr and scMet exosomes is a technical issue or a problem with the cell models, because the essential control B16F10 cells and exosomes that should have robust expression of Met and pMet was not used. The authors need to revise their experimental design and repeat their experiments including this control, which was present in the original Peinado et al. paper as well as in numerous other publications before any conclusions can be drawn. Importantly, the authors should highlight that, consistent with original report by Peinado et al., the shMet construct efficiently downregulated Met in B16F10 cells and their exosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1A in the original submission was a labeling mistake that has been fixed in the revised manuscript. Regarding the data presented in Figure 1A and B, these are repeats from ‘independently isolated exosome preparations’ as stated in the figure legend. However, these are from the same batch of shScr or shMet lentivirus-infected cells and assessed after 28 days of puromycin selection as suggested during peer review of the Registered Report. We have added additional details to the revised manuscript to further clarify this point.</p><p>As stated above, the suggested additional control (untransduced B16-F10 cells) was not included in the Registered Report, but we have revised the manuscript to suggest the inclusion of this control in future experiments. Importantly, the parental B16-F10 cells (as well the B16-F10-luciferase cells) were shared by the original authors. We have also highlighted that the shMet construct reduced Met expression in B16-F10 cells and exosomes, similar to the original study in the Abstract and at the end of the “Generation and characterization of shMet B16-F10 cells and exosomes” section of the Results. However, the level of knockdown achieved in shMet exosomes was not reported in the original study.</p><p><italic>There could be several explanations that need to be explored that could account for the lack of pMet detection in exosomes in this report. First of all, it is unclear if fresh exosomes had been used in these Western Blot experiments (authors only indicate the use of freshly-isolated exosomes in</italic> in vivo <italic>studies) but it would also be critical that fresh exosomes be used for phospho-protein detection in exosomes. The authors actually state that exosomes were &quot;stored at -20°C until analysis” therefore, the analysis of phosphoproteins should be repeated immediately following isolation, resuspension in PBS, measurement of protein and resuspension in Laemmli buffer. This should all be performed using fresh exosomes.</italic></p><p>We agree there are many possible explanations that could account for the lack of pMet detection in exosomes. As the reviewer highlighted, we did not use fresh exosomes for Western blot analysis (as stated in the Registered Report as well), but did for the education experiment. This is because in our correspondence with the original author for the experiment in question (Protocol 2 of the Registered Report we were told ‘Exosomes for WB can be stored at -20 for 2-3 weeks’.). We agree this is a reasonable explanation, which we have included in the Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Importantly, many published studies, in additional to the original report from Peinado et al., 2012, have since validated and were able to detect Met as well as pMet in B16F10 exosomes and other exosomes. These studies are listed below, they should be included in the reference list of this report and discussed in the context of the authors' results.</p><p>• Steenbeek et al., 2018 – Figure 4 shows Met expression in B16F10 exosomes</p><p>• Barrow-McGee R et al., Nature Communications, PMID: 27336951 – shows cMet and pMet in endosomes throughout the paper</p><p>• Tripolitsioti D et al., Oncotarget, PMID: 29796184 – throughout the paper and Supplementary Figure 5D (Met), 6B (pMet)</p><p>• Adachi et al., 2016 – shows both Met and pMet in Figure 1C</p><p>• Cannistraci et al., 2017 – shows both Met and pMet in Figure 2D</p><p>• Plebanek MP et al., 2017</p><p>• Zeng et al., 2017 – shows both Met and pMet</p><p>• He et al., 2015 – shows both Met and pMet in Figure 4E.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included additional references in the revised manuscript in addition to the references that were already included on the identification of Met and pMet in exosomes. Some of these references reported the presence of Met in other vesicles and were not included (e.g. Barrow-McGee et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another cause for concern with this report is the off target effect present in the only control used in this study, the shScr control. As shown in Figure 2A of the report and pointed out by the authors in their results, using a lower multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10, the same used in the original Peinado et al. paper, the authors of this report find there is a significant on target effect of the control shScr, as Met levels are downregulated. Strangely, the authors are able to reduce the on target effect of the control shScr by increasing the MOI to 20 or 50. Most likely, this is due to the oligomers binding to other targets, and thus an increase in off target effects. Since these are commercial lentiviral particles, and the time passed since the initial report, it would be critical for the authors to verify with the company that they still use the same sequence as control as reported in the original paper. In this manuscript the authors do not define the targeting sequence as in the original report (Peinado et al., specified that sense sequence used, obtained from Thermo was: 5′-ATCTCGCTTGGGCGAGAGTAAG-3′) but the authors in the current report do not describe the sequence and use pGIPZ non-silencing shRNA lentiviral control particles from Dharmacon/GE Life 281 Sciences, cat# RHS4348, lot# 150529606. Moreover, the difference in results could be due to lot variability or quality of commercial virus (this should be discussed by the authors in the report). Minor concerns regarding Figure 2 are the inconsistency of GAPDH loading control levels as well as the presentation of MOIs out of order (10, then 50, then 20). The authors need to provide empty vector and non-transduced cell controls for these experiments. Moreover, to investigate the off target effects of the shScr they should perform transcriptomics analyses of the non-transduced, empty vector, shScr and shMet B16-F10 cells. They can also perform unbiased proteomics analysis of shScr versus shMet versus B16F10 exosomes to determine if/how the cargo of shScr exosomes is affected by off target effects. The authors should test proliferation and apoptosis of shScr cells, to account for any consequences of off target effects of the shScr construct on the health of these cells. This is critical because of the issues evident in Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with the reviewer that an effect on Met expression could be due to the oligomers preferentially targeting Met in the shScr condition. For this to occur it would suggest overexpression of a random sequence would divert the transcriptional/translational machinery away from making Met mRNA/protein or random integration into Met or a gene that regulates Met. Of note, these concerns also exist for the original study since the same oligo sequence was used. It is more likely that non-random genetic/transcriptional drift, which could have been caused by selective pressure from puromycin, affected gene expression of Met (as well as other genes). This has been highlighted as a possible explanation of the results in the revised manuscript.</p><p>As mentioned above, the ‘non-targeting’ scrambled shRNA used in this replication was the same control used in the original study per the original paper methods and our communication with the original authors. The same sequence as the original study was confirmed from the commercial supplier before the replication was conducted and we have included additional details on the sequence in the revised manuscript. Additionally, this was shared from the commercial supplier, “this sequence does not match any known mammalian genes and had at least 3 or more mismatches against any gene as determined via nucleotide alignment/BLAST of the 22mer sense sequence”. While the supplier is different, because of company acquisitions that have occurred between the original study and this replication, the vectors used to generate the lentiviral particles were the same as the original study. We agree lot variability is another source that is different between the two studies, although we do not know the lot used in the original study, and we have included this in the revised manuscript.</p><p>As mentioned above, the suggested additional control (untransduced B16-F10 cells) was not included in the Registered Report, but we have revised the manuscript to suggest the inclusion of this control in future experiments. Regarding the comment about Gapdh loading, we loaded equal amounts of protein (30 µg) for each sample analyzed by Western blot, opposed to adjusting amounts based on Gapdh levels.</p><p>We agree that if there were differences in cell growth, or apoptosis rates could confound the results. This is also true for the original study, which does not report what the growth, or apoptosis rates were for the experiments reported. While we did not perform an experiment to quantify growth or apoptosis rates, we did monitor the health of the cultures and qualitatively kept track of the cell growth rates among the conditions. Growth rates were similar among all stable cell populations generated based on qualitative observations documented during passaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The other major cause of concern, that precludes the data from this report being interpretable and the drawing of any conclusions, is, as evident from Figure 3A, B), the fact that the primary tumors growing in animals educated with shScr exosomes are smaller than those in the liposome-treated controls, could this be because of their issues with the control particles? Additionally, whereas the size of primary tumors growing in the liposome or shMET treated groups is reproducible and similar, there is variability in the growth of the tumors in the shScr treated mice, with some of the tumors as small as 0.025 g, which is 32-fold smaller than the mean of the other groups, which is 0.8 g. Consistent with the original report by Peinado et al., the authors do not find differences in tumor growth between liposome treated mice and shMet mice. Given the dramatic reduction in tumor growth in the shScr control treated mice, and the large variability in the growth of these tumors, it is not surprising that the authors of this report fail to find statistically significant differences in lung and bone metastasis between the shScr control and shMet exosome educated mice. Therefore, before any conclusions can be drawn, and to account for the large variability and off target effect of the shScr control and in this experiment overall, the authors need to repeat the experiment increasing animal numbers and including animals educated with un-transduced, parental B16F10 exosomes to demonstrate that, in their hands, they can obtain consistent primary tumor growth and metastasis levels without the confounding contribution of the off-target effects in the shScr. Moreover, to reiterate, the differences between the shScr and shMet cannot be deemed non-significant since the lack of significance stems from the high variance and lower than expected primary tumor size in the shScr control group.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there was a higher relative standard deviation (RSD) among the results reported in the original study and this replication attempt for the metastatic burden. We included the RSD for both the original and replication results to provide a direct comparison. Importantly, though we cannot compare the primary tumor growth variability as this was not reported in the original study. Furthermore, the variability should also be viewed in the context that cell growth is exponential under an ideal scenario, thus the RSD is reported in natural log units (Cole and Altman, 2017). There are factors that influence and alter the growth of the tumor initially compared to the continued growth of the tumor in vivo, such as availability of nutrients, oxygen, and space. These points have been included in the discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><p>This replication attempt, like all of the replication attempts in the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, are designed to perform independent replications with a calculated sample size to detect the originally reported effect size with at least 80% power based on the originally reported data, which was followed in this replication study. We agree the higher variance in the replication is a factor influencing if statistical significance is reached and include this as a consideration when discussing the effect sizes. While technical concerns and hidden moderators might be factors that influence both the original and replication results, as the reviewer suggests, another likely factor is biological variation. That is, one would not expect tumors in individual animals to grow at the exact same rate as there are many influencing factors that cannot be controlled or explained.</p><p>We also agree performing another attempt of this experiment with modifications would begin to explore if these, or other, factors influence the outcome of this study. While, it’s not within the scope of this project, or as part of this publishing model, to also conduct these experiments, the results of this replication bring variables not previously thought to influence the experiment into question (size of the control tumors at the end of the study, length of treatment, etc.). Importantly though, it is because of the results that these and other aspects now become targets for hypothesizing and investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Importantly, there is lack of tumor growth in some animals and death of animals injected with exosomes. B16F10 are aggressive tumors with robust growth that do not fail to implant or grow, therefore the fact that the authors of this study encounter challenges in having tumors grow in all animals injected with control cells reflect either 1) technical issues with cell viability, injection, etc. and/or 2) the fact that the off target effects of the shScr exosomes used for education are effectively inhibiting tumor growth.

Additionally, the death observed was likely due to the aggressive growth of the B16-F10-luciferase cells. The mice that died (17 days after implantation) had tumors &gt;1000 mm<sup>3</sup> at their last measurement, which along with other surviving mice that had tumors that reached &gt;1000 mm<sup>3</sup>, prompted us to stop the experiment early (18 days after implantation). As suggested by reviewer #2 we have included the shorter experimental time difference between the original study and this replication attempt in the Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, it is concerning that education of animals with 5 μg of shScr B16F10 exosomes leads to the death of some animals. This was not reported in publications with either 5 μg or 10 μg of B16F10 exosomes (for example in the original publication or in Dr. Olga Volpert's Nature Communications, 2018 report injected 10 μg of B16F10 exosomes repeatedly with no death).

It is a possibility that exosome, or synthetic liposome, injection might have influenced this, but this does not seem likely. The more likely possibility is the aggressive growth of the B16-F10-luciferase cells, which was more severe in some animals than others.</p><p>Regarding the technical questions raised as possibly factors. Yes, we used a BCA assay, with standard curves, to quantify the amount of exosome protein after isolation using, similar to the original study. Furthermore, we characterized exosomes using Nanosight analysis. The methods defined the buffer the exosomes were resuspended in “100 µl filtered PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# MT21040CM)”, the same buffer as the original study. While no information was included in the original paper, or during communication with the original authors regarding a specific way the exosome should be resuspended prior to injection (i.e. 10 times at least), the exosomes were resuspended right before each individual injection by pipetting 3-4 times, tapping the tube, inverted 3-4 times, and then tapping the syringe right before each injection. We have added these additional details to the Materials and methods in the revised manuscript. Also, as mentioned above, we monitored the health and qualitatively kept track of the cell growth rates of the cultures. There were also no complications during exosome injections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Overall this replication study was carried out appropriately.
