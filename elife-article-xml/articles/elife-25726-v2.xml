ability may provide insights into human regenerative therapies. The complex structure of the limb poses challenges to the investigation of the cellular and molecular basis of its regeneration. Using CRISPR/Cas, we genetically labelled unique cell lineages within the developing axolotl embryo and tracked the frequency of each lineage within amputated and fully regenerated limbs. This allowed us, for the first time, to assess the contributions of multiple low frequency cell lineages to the regenerating limb at once. Our comparisons reveal that regenerated limbs are high fidelity replicas of the originals even after repeated amputations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Ambystoma mexicanum</kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>lineage tracing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004829</institution-id><institution>Connecticut Innovations</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Seed Grant 15RMA-YALE-09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flowers</surname><given-names>Grant Parker</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship F32HD086942</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flowers</surname><given-names>Grant Parker</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004829</institution-id><institution>Connecticut Innovations</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Established Investigator Award 15-RMB-YALE-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crews</surname><given-names>Craig M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Training Fellowship T32GM007499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanor</surname><given-names>Lucas D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CRISPR-based lineage tracing in the axolotl shows that regenerated limbs are composed of the same cell lineages in the same frequencies as those that gave rise to the original limb.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The origin of the cells of the blastema, the mass of proliferating cells that gives rise to regenerated structures, has long been the subject of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Tanaka and Reddien, 2011</xref>). In salamanders, such as the axolotl, this debate has centered on whether the limb blastema arises from dedifferentiated cells or proliferating stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tanaka, 2016</xref>). Earlier studies using tissue grafts suggested that restricted tissue types, such as dermis or cartilage, can give rise to some or all of the other tissues in regenerated limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Namenwirth, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Muneoka et al., 1986</xref>). More recent work using GFP-labelled grafts found little evidence of lineage switching during limb regeneration, though dermis may contribute to cartilage and tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kragl et al., 2009</xref>). A study using tissue grafting and in vivo imaging of single cells during digit tip regeneration further suggests that dedifferentiated or proliferative chondrocytes contribute very little to regeneration, and these cells are most likely replenished by dermal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Currie et al., 2016</xref>). Comparisons of muscle regeneration between species of salamanders have shown that axolotls and larval newts regenerate muscle by recruiting satellite cells to the blastema; however, fragmentation and cell cycle reentry of myofibers provides the cellular source of regenerated muscle in adult newts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sandoval-Guzmán et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tanaka et al., 2016</xref>). This long history of grafting studies of salamander limb regeneration demonstrates that this process is governed by numerous tissue- and life-cycle-dependent mechanisms.</p><p>Here, we used a novel approach to simultaneously assess the contributions of many cell lineages to the entire regenerated limb. By quantifying embryonically-produced CRISPR/Cas-generated lesions in individual axolotl limbs before and after full regeneration, we determined the extent to which regenerated limbs are reconstituted by the same cell lineages that comprised the original limb. We find that a regenerated axolotl limb is a high fidelity replicate of the original limb comprised of the same cell lineages, with lineages that contribute to as little as one ten-thousandth of the original limb found in the regenerated limb at the same relative frequencies. This level of fidelity is maintained after multiple rounds of amputation and full limb regeneration.</p><p>These observations, and our quantification of this fidelity, may be of great importance to future studies as the salamander is now genetically tractable, in particular by using CRISPR/Cas-mediated mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Flowers et al., 2014</xref>). Numerous studies using high-throughput gene expression analysis identified an expanding set of genes specifically upregulated in the axolotl limb blastema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bryant et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Knapp et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Voss et al., 2015</xref>). The abundance of uncharacterized targets of interest has created a demand for higher throughput methods to characterize the consequences of genetic manipulation on limb regeneration in mosaic F0 animals. This work establishes the baseline fidelity with which a regenerated axolotl limb is reconstructed with respect to embryonic lineages in such mosaic animals. In the future, a similar approach may be used to identify genes that when altered affect the ability of embryonic cell lineages to contribute to the regenerated limb.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Here, we used the CRISPR/Cas system to produce unique insertions and deletions at targeted genomic sites to independently genetically label numerous cell lineages in the developing axolotl embryo.

We extracted DNA from amputated original and fully regenerated limbs from the same individuals and performed Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to identify all indels generated at the targeted sites for each gRNA. NGS of PCR products of targeted genomic loci reveals that DNA extracted from the entire amputated limbs of mutagenized axolotls is mosaic and exhibits allelic heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; mean = 27.3 alleles, s.d. = ±10.2, n = 19 original limbs). A simple linear regression indicates that the log score of the normalized read numbers for each allele in the primary limb predicts the log score of the normalized read number of each allele in the secondary limb (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.37, p&lt;1 × 10<sup>−15</sup>). Thus, specific-allele-labelled cell populations contribute to both the original and regenerated limbs at similar frequencies. The majority of the alleles detected in the limbs of animals in this study are low frequency (i.e., represent less than 1.6% of all reads in the limb; 367/492 alleles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), with a median of 2332 reads per million (RPM). When we examined the behavior of these alleles, we found that low frequency alleles are more likely to increase in frequency or exhibit less than a one fold decrease (197/367 alleles) than to disappear (97/367 alleles; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Taken together, our work indicates that low frequency cell lineages are highly preserved in the limb after regeneration.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25726.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The sizes and fold changes of all alleles found in original and regenerated limbs in this study.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pie chart depicting numbers of all alleles identified in original limbs binned by RPM.

The relative contribution of each allele to the limb remains remarkably constant after full regeneration. In this representative case, the net difference in the RPM for all alleles before and after complete limb regeneration represents 10.1% of the total reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). We found that among the 19 animals in this study, the mean difference in allelic identities of original and secondary limbs was only 24.2% (s.d. = ±16.1%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).

This suggests that the change in allelic identity reflects the morphological fidelity of regeneration. Removing this case reduces the mean difference in allelic identity between original and secondary limbs to 22.0% (s.d. = ±13.6%). There is no significant correlation between overall mutation rate or number of alleles and the change in allelic identity of regenerated limbs (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.14, p=0.11 for mutation rate and identity; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.01, p=0.76 for mutation rate and total number of alleles).

Previous studies have indicated that CRISPR-induced indels are not truly random, as particular indels arise more frequently than others after mutagenesis with a single gRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gagnon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burger et al., 2016</xref>). However, comparing the identity of alleles across individuals shows that the majority of allele sequences appeared in only one animal out of the as many as four animals mutagenized with a single gRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). For gRNAs assessed in four animals, the individual alleles that received fewer than 1.6% of all sequence reads in an individual (which we will refer to as low frequency alleles) appeared in only one or two animals, while all alleles that received more reads per individual were found in multiple animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). To further explore the allelic diversity produced at one site, we injected embryos with reduced quantities of pooled gRNAs and <italic>cas9</italic> and carried out NGS in mutant animals. At concentrations of <italic>cas9</italic> that produced no or single-digit numbers of alleles at each target in each embryo (mean = 1.4 alleles, s.d. =±1.6, n = 50, 5 targets tested in 10 animals each), the majority of alleles were unique (26/39 alleles; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Together, these results suggest that, though some alleles are favorably produced from targeted mutagenesis, most alleles are formed with sufficiently low probabilities as to represent unique cell lineages even in highly mosaic mutant animals.</p><p>To address whether unique cell lineages are tissue-restricted, we carried out subsequent amputations from regenerated forelimbs of four mutagenized animals. After these amputations, from each animal we extracted blood samples, collected the hand from the amputated forelimb, and dissected nerve, blood vessel, bone/cartilage, skin, and muscle from the remaining amputated forelimb. We then extracted DNA from the hand and the tissue-enriched samples and carried out NGS of PCR products of the targeted genomic loci in each tissue. NGS revealed that the high frequency alleles (i.e., those representing greater than 6.5% of all reads) of the whole hand could be detected in all or almost all of the six individual tissue-enriched DNA samples from the same limb (mean = 5.4 of 6 tissues, s.d. = ±1.1, n = 15/171 alleles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Conversely, alleles that appear at a low frequency within the hand (i.e., those that represent less than 1.6% of all reads) are found in fewer tissues (mean = 2.8 of 6 tissues, s.d. =±1.6, n = 135 alleles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We find that each tissue-enriched sample contains alleles exhibiting more than a 16-fold enrichment in normalized reads relative to all other tissues (29/171 alleles), and 29 additional alleles were found to be similarly enriched in only two tissues. From all tissue samples, we found that the blood was the source of the most tissue-enriched alleles (17/58 alleles) likely arising from the distant origins of hematopoietic cells and the ease with which blood may be isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lopez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>)</p><p>We conducted Fisher’s exact tests to determine whether such enriched alleles found in particular tissues were disproportionately represented among alleles that either increased or decreased in frequency after limb regeneration. We found that the only source of tissue-enriched alleles that underwent any significant change was skin, as skin-enriched alleles were disproportionally represented both among alleles that decreased in frequency from primary to secondary limbs and among those that increased in frequency from secondary to tertiary limbs (skin-enriched alleles = 14/58 tissue-enriched alleles, 8/14 tissue-enriched alleles decreasing from primary to secondary, 9/17 alleles increasing from secondary to tertiary; two-tailed Fisher’s exact test, p<italic>=</italic>0.02; p<italic>=</italic>0.05, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We found that skin-enriched alleles were dramatically overrepresented in skin compared to cartilage/bone (14,103-fold greater RPM, s.d.= ±15,680 RPM, n = 14 alleles); thus, these changes in the levels of skin-enriched alleles in the limb likely reflect the migration of epidermal cells from outside of the wound site to contribute to the regenerating skin rather than dermal cells that contribute to cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Currie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Seifert et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Within the whole hand, such tissue-enriched alleles are almost exclusively found among low frequency alleles (57/58 alleles), and together they represent a minor proportion of the total sequence reads within the hand (mean = 7.8%, s.d. = ±8.6%, n = 4 hands, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of 58 alleles found to be tissue-enriched, 27 were not detected in sequence reads from the whole hand, and such alleles were exclusively low frequency within the tissues in which they were enriched. Together, all such tissue-enriched alleles that could not be detected within the hand represent 0.43% (s.d. = ±0.63%, n = 24 tissue-enriched samples) of all reads within the tissues in which they are enriched, and thus, were likely under-sampled rather than absent in the hand. These comparisons among alleles from different tissue samples indicate that high-frequency alleles account for most of the sequence reads obtained in single limbs and are broadly distributed throughout tissues. Such alleles either form in the early blastula stages of embryogenesis, or independently in multiple cell lineages, or both. While low-frequency alleles that form at later developmental stages are more likely to exhibit tissue-specific enrichment, such tissue-enriched alleles often occur at such low frequencies as to not be detectable within entire limb samples using NGS.</p><p>Despite the relatively minor contribution of alleles identified as tissue-enriched to the entire composition of the hand and limb, we observe that the allelic compositions of different tissue samples vary. We find that the allele identities and frequencies found in nerve, blood vessel, and blood-enriched samples exhibit very low correlations with each other and with those from other tissue-enriched samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Alleles in the muscle and skin exhibit both higher correlations with each other and with those found within the entire hand than to those of other tissue-enriched samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). These similarities are likely partially due to the overrepresentation of these tissues within the hand, as well as the fact that such dissected samples from the muscle and skin of the limb contain significant contributions from multiple tissues. Nonetheless, as these tissue-enriched samples were derived from fully regenerated limbs, the variation in the allelic compositions of the regenerated tissue-enriched samples indicate that they are differently reconstituted with respect to their embryonic origins.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25726.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Allelic compositions of tissue-enriched samples vary relative to each other.</title><p>The heat map of the r<sup>2</sup> log scores of normalized RPM +1 values for alleles of all tissue-enriched samples from four quaternary limbs and hands.

This is reflected in the apparent bimodality of the distribution in changes in allele frequencies between primary and secondary limbs depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>. To further investigate whether such alleles are truly lost, we examined whether such alleles were subsequently detectable in limbs from the same animal after additional rounds of regeneration. In the limbs of 4 animals that were examined for three rounds of regeneration, of 54 alleles lost between primary and secondary limbs, 35 were found to be present in subsequent limbs or tissues. While novel alleles appeared in subsequent limbs, 5/5 such alleles detected in the secondary limbs but not in the original limbs were found in subsequent regenerated limbs or tissues from the same animal (4/6 alleles detected in the tertiary, but not primary limb, were detected in other iterations of the limb; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The disproportionate number of unrecovered alleles from the primary to secondary limb compared to those from the secondary or tertiary to primary limbs indicates that some cell lineages are truly lost upon limb regeneration while others were not detected, most likely due to under-sampling at the initial DNA amplification step. The average allele present in the original limb that is subsequently undetectable after regeneration is a rare component of the limb (mean = 748 RPM, s.d. =±1656, median = 20 RPM, n = 19/154 alleles detected in the original limb). The sum of such lost cell lineages in each limb investigated represents a minor portion of the cell lineages comprising the limb (0.34%, ±0.56%, n = 4 limbs), indicating that either a subset of embryonically-labeled cell lineages are unable to participate in limb regeneration or that some cell lineages become isolated in distal regions of the limb that are consequently lost after amputation.</p><p>In recent years, studies using transgenic tissue grafts in the axolotl have provided a powerful means to track the behaviors of cells and tissues of differing origins during limb regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kragl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Maden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">McCusker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nacu et al., 2013</xref>). Such studies have created a growing consensus that the role of transdifferentiation of tissues in limb regeneration is minimal in salamanders, with cells of regenerating tissues largely arising from cells of the same embryonic origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kragl et al., 2009</xref>); yet, the scope of such grafting work has been limited as only the fates of tissues derived from single large tissue grafts could be assessed in one limb at a time. More recent efforts have coupled this approach with tissue-specific transgenic lines and in vivo imaging of cell behaviors during appendage regeneration to elucidate this process with spatial and temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Currie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sandoval-Guzmán et al., 2014</xref>). Such works continue to demonstrate that regenerated tissues arise from tissues of a similar origin, though some ambiguity remains. For instance, two recent studies demonstrate that cartilage and bone make little, if any, contribution to skeletal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Currie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">McCusker et al., 2016</xref>), with dermal fibroblasts appearing to give rise to most regenerative connective tissues during digit tip regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Currie et al., 2016</xref>). With the genetic labeling approach applied in our study, we can quantify the relative contributions of numerous, often very low frequency cell lineages to limb regeneration at once. We can infer from our data that low frequency populations of cells do not largely repopulate the regenerated limb at the expense of others. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the same embryonic lineages that produce the limb faithfully regenerate the limb in the same proportions. These conclusions do not challenge the recent observations that bone and cartilage give rise to little or no skeletal tissues after regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Currie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">McCusker et al., 2016</xref>), but indicate that the cells that replace amputated bone and cartilage are most likely derived from the same embryonic cell lineages that initially formed the lost bone and cartilage.</p><p>Here, we report the development of a novel means to characterize the fidelity with which the embryonic cell lineages that give rise to the limb are recapitulated in the regenerated limb, and we have identified several caveats that should be considered in future applications of this approach. Zygotic injection of <italic>cas9</italic> and individual gRNAs achieves a high rate of mutagenesis, but the majority of cells are labeled with mutations that occur in either the earliest cell divisions or multiple times throughout development. Such labeling redundancy could be reduced by the application of multiple gRNAs within a single amplifiable region. Alternately, while the comparatively long generation time of the axolotl makes the generation of stable, single-copy transgenic lines a time consuming task, synthetic transgenic arrays of CRISPR targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">McKenna et al., 2016</xref>) may be eventually employed to create higher density allelic maps. While the method described here detects numerous, low-frequency, tissue-enriched alleles, such alleles often occur at frequencies at or beyond the threshold of detection when DNA is sampled from the entire limb. Input DNA quantity and read coverage should be optimized, particularly as the approach is used to characterize the behavior of increasingly low frequency cell lineages.</p><p>This study marks the first example by which regeneration has been characterized using a CRISPR-derived lineage tracing approach, and we find that the regenerated limb is repopulated by embryonic cell lineages in a manner that recapitulates the development of the original limb. As the ability of cell lineages to contribute to a regenerated limb is a quantifiable phenotype that may be associated with mutant genotypes on a large scale within an individual limb using NGS, this approach may be coupled with targeted-mutagenesis of uncharacterized candidate genes to identify novel regulators of limb regeneration. Furthermore, as CRISPR/Cas is widely applicable across species, similar approaches may be used to characterize many regenerative processes across a wide variety of organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were carried out on <italic>Ambystoma mexicanum</italic> (axolotls) in facilities at Yale University.

All sequences containing perfect sequence matches to each unique sample-identifying primer were assembled into sequence lists. All sequences containing perfect matches to the respective gRNA plus protospacer motif (PAM) sequence were removed from each sequence list, counted, and labelled as non-mutant sequence. Subsequently, the remaining sequences in each sequence list for each limb were aligned to the non-mutant amplicon, permitting gaps of up to 100 bases, to form contigs. Within each contig, sequences were then identified that contained a deletion, insertion, or combination of both that affected at least one base within the PAM sequence or within the target sequence within three bases from the PAM sequence, including large deletions that encompassed both the PAM sequence and entire target sequence. Approximately, 13 to 20 bases on each side of the indel site were incorporated to generate a sequence defined as an allele. All sequences containing this newly defined allele were then removed from the respective contig. This process was repeated for many iterations until the only remaining sequences in each contig were those containing mismatches near to but not immediately flanking the putative gRNA cut site and could thus be regarded as products of PCR and/or sequencing errors. For each respective target, a sequence list was made containing all putative alleles corresponding to all those identified in all animals injected with a given gRNA. Each allele was then aligned to the reference, non-mutant amplicon. A unique name was given to each allele, corresponding to the start and end sites of any deletion with respect to the reference amplicon, followed by the identity of any insertion. All redundant alleles were eliminated, and all alleles for a respective target were trimmed to encompass the same number of bases (from 27 to 36). This allele list was then aligned so that each allele formed a contig with all sequences from each individual limb that perfectly matched, so that each sequence read could only match with one allele.</p><p>Using this protocol, 25,000 to 1,400,000 reads were assigned to each respective limb or tissue-enriched sample. To exclude falsely detected alleles, prior to normalizing the data, all alleles from individual animals were excluded if the raw number of reads for that allele was not at least two-fold greater than the raw number of reads for the same allele detected in the corresponding non-mutant control. Additionally, all alleles detected in individual limbs in which fewer than four reads were detected were excluded. The total number of assigned reads for each limb were then added to obtain the total number of reads for the limb. The total read number was divided by 1,000,000 to get the normalization coefficient, and the raw number of reads for each allele was multiplied by the normalization coefficient to produce Reads per Million (RPM).

The authors have established a powerful approach to address this question. This study used CRISPR/Cas9 to create mutations in genes and then next generation sequencing to characterize the frequency distribution of alleles distributed among limb cells before and after amputation. This study is interesting because CRISPR/Cas9 creates highly mosaic animals that contain many unique, moderate–to–low frequency alleles. This allows temporal resolution of many different allelic types during the regeneration process. The authors find that allele frequencies did not overtly change and thus the results suggest that regenerated limbs are similar in cellular composition to the pre–amputated, intact limb. However, no unambiguous answers are provided in the current manuscript. Cell lineages contributing to the regenerated limbs could be from differentiated cells, or progenitor cells. Hence, the central question remains largely unaddressed. Nevertheless, the work is an important piece of information that supports traditional grafting techniques that had suggested similar conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the fidelity of allele frequencies maintained during regeneration is very exciting, the implications of this finding need further discussion or experimentation. There is little reason to expect that cellular identities and proportions will not be faithfully reproduced after regeneration, assuming, of course, that the effects of metamorphosis or aging were not to play a central role in setting cellular identity. Thus, it's not surprising to see the allele frequencies reproduced, with the results verifying that multiple early embryonic lineages contribute to the development of the limb, and that such lineages contribute in similar frequencies to regenerated limbs. As the limb is a complex system with multiple tissues and cell types, how these lineages translate to tissue or cell types is unclear. It is likely that these alleles mark all necessary progenitors of the cell types in a limb. The fidelity reflects the cell type reconstitution in the new limb. As the number of lesions is not exhaustive, other possibilities remain equally likely. For instance, the alleles may mark some differentiated cell types which will dedifferentiate, or only several types of stem/differentiated cells that matter for the regeneration of that particular group of cells. Hence, this manuscript would be strengthened if experimental data or at least discussions are provided for the following questions.</p><p>1) Establish a link between the cells and alleles. Experimentally, the authors can examine the allele frequencies in the blastema and proximal tissues post amputation. The proximal tissues can be dissected into multiple tissue types (e.g., dermis, cartilage, tendons, nerves, and blood vessels). Allele identities and frequencies can be examined in these different tissue types to establish if some alleles can specifically mark tissue types. More rigorously, such analyses can be performed in isolated differentiated cells and proliferating cells of different tissue types. This should be able to address the central question of whether dedifferentiation, transdifferentiation or proliferation of stem cells are involved in the regeneration of the limbs. Furthermore, allele frequencies in the proximal tissues can be compared to old and new limbs at the tissue or cell type level to investigate this question.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>: Discuss the reasons for the emergence of new alleles and loss of previous alleles in regenerated limbs (e.g., cell behaviors).</p><p>3) What the approach doesn't provide is spatial resolution of alleles, which would be interesting to know so as to answer some of the questions posed in the introduction, for example do cells switch identities during regeneration. What the results suggest is that CRISPR/Cas9 creates the same allele frequency distribution within tissue–specific, progenitor cell populations, whether these populations derive from fated or stem–like cells. However, more is actually known about the relative contribution of differentiated and stem–like cells to limb regeneration and the introduction needs a bit more balance.</p><p>4) The article could benefit from a bit more consistency in stating what can be learned using the approach, what was learned, and maybe also mention caveats in the final paragraph along with prospects for future studies. For example, the following sentences are qualitatively different:</p><p>&quot;8) We found that regenerated limbs are often nearly identical to the originals even after repeated amputations.&quot;</p><p>&quot;38) We find that a regenerated axolotl limb is a high fidelity replicate of the original limb&quot;.</p><p>5) There seems to be a lack of discussion in the findings of this study in the context of what is known about axolotl limb regeneration from previous literature. A key discussion point that needs to be included is to address Currie et al., 2016. This is a critical point of comparison that needs to be discussed before publication.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: Why are there so many alleles that completely lost in the regenerated limb and vice versa? This suggests that certain cell types may be behaving differently. There is evidence for old muscle not generating muscle in regenerated limbs, instead by satellite cells (Sandoval–Guzman et al., 2014). Are the alleles lost in the regenerating limbs representing the muscle fibers that do not contribute to the regenerated limb? Also, do alleles that are found only in the regenerating limb arise from distant cells such as blood cells or Schwann cells? All of these problems cannot be determined by the current approach, but should be discussed.</p><p>7) Results and Discussion: There seems to be a bimodal distribution in alleles gained or lost in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. This would again suggest that certain populations of cells are lost from the regenerate and others are provided from a distant source or from a small population of cells in the uninjured limb. So yes, the conclusions that there are a significant number of cells that do not change in frequency is true, it is unclear what types of cells these are.</p><p>8) Results and Discussion: I partially agree with this statement. The results of McKenna et al., 2016 suggest that adult tissues in zebrafish are derived from few embryonic progenitors. It is possible that high similarity may be partially due to alleles represented in all the cells of a particular cell type, like muscle (or other cell type) that came from the same few progenitors. Having a general indication for what cell types are carrying specific alleles would be very helpful in interpreting the data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25726.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Establish a link between the cells and alleles.

We have multiple animals with well–characterized mutant allele populations. In these animals, we carried out amputations and dissections from the quaternary limbs. There were several challenges to connecting cell types to alleles that we had to take into account while designing our approach. First, if a particular allele were found in an isolated population of cells, all other cell types would have to be parsed before determining that the allele is cell specific. Second, as full limb regeneration takes several months, we set out to collect data from animals for which an allelic data set already existed. Thus, we carried out dissections from the large, fully regenerated limbs of animals used in the experiments described previously in the paper. This allowed us to include almost all the tissue comprising the regenerated limbs in our tissue samples. As described in the methods, we were able to dissect the radial and ulnar arteries, as well as the brachial and ulnar nerves in the forearm proximal to the carpus. From the same animals, we collected full thickness skin and removed the muscle surrounding the radius and ulna. We collected the entire radius and ulna, all the remaining distal tissue (the “hand”) for comparison, and blood from the gills of the animal.</p><p>We expected to see considerable overlap in alleles between these tissue–enriched samples due to the heterogeneity of cell types and the shared embryonic origins. Thus, we defined alleles as tissue–enriched if one or two tissues were found to exhibit 16–fold more normalized reads compared to all others. While these criteria led us to identify numerous alleles that were tissue–enriched, we found that many of their frequencies were below the threshold of detection within the limb and hand samples. This finding suggests that, while tissue–specific alleles likely exist that uniquely identify various types of differentiated cells, they are often undetectable when sampling from the entire limb. This data is visually represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Nonetheless, we find that tissue samples differ in their allelic compositions. Tissues tend to be more similar to the hand than they are to one another and samples that are more heterogeneous are more similar to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This approach allowed us to retrospectively analyze data from our previous limb experiments and make insights into the tissues where specific alleles were found.</p><p>A NGS approach of CRISPR–induced alleles could be a powerful tool for analyzing the origins and relative contribution of transdifferentiation, dedifferentiation, and stem cells to specific tissue types in regenerating limbs; however, this requires surmounting a number of technical limitations, which we discuss. We are currently pursuing approaches that allowed for more detailed analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>: Discuss the reasons for the emergence of new alleles and loss of previous alleles in regenerated limbs (e.g., cell behaviors).</p></disp-quote><p>Analyzing a fourth limb, for our tissue analysis, allowed us to better characterize alleles from our previous experiments. We found that many alleles in the original limb are not detected in the secondary limb. However, most of these alleles reappear in tertiary limbs or in the tissues from the quaternary limb, indicating that they are not truly lost. In some cases new alleles appeared in the secondary limb. These were located in dissected tissue samples and were found to be enriched in the muscle and blood; however, these findings were not statistically significant. Our data indicate that many alleles that appear to be lost in the first limb or are gained in the secondary, are actually an artifact of under–sampling. Since the primary limb is the smallest, it contains the fewest cells of all limbs analyzed. Therefore, a large selection of alleles will be represented within the sampled DNA. As the limb grows, there will be larger populations of cells with similar mutations that dilute the diversity of the cells and alleles sampled. Though true loss of alleles likely also contributes, undersampling of DNA as the animals increase in size contributes to the disproportionate loss of alleles from the first limb to the second. We found that unrecovered alleles represent less than 1% of the original amputated tissue, and speculate that these may have been cell lineages restricted to distal amputated portions of the limb.</p><p>Our data on tissue–enriched alleles allowed us to assess whether cells of a particular lineage were more likely to change than others. We found no significant differences between tissues in the number of alleles that increased or decreased in frequency from one limb to the next, with the exception of skin–enriched alleles, which disproportionately decreased from the primary to secondary and disproportionately increased from the secondary to tertiary. The sample sizes are comparatively small, allowing for the chance occurrence of such a low P value seen after 36 comparisons. We speculate that these changes may arise from the migration of highly motile epidermal cells after amputation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What the approach doesn't provide is spatial resolution of alleles, which would be interesting to know so as to answer some of the questions posed in the introduction, for example do cells switch identities during regeneration.

We have eliminated the statement that “regenerated limbs are often nearly identical.” Instead we emphasize that our study provides an important information about the baseline level at which alleles are retained in regenerating limbs. This provides an important framework for the future studies using mosaic gene–editing with NGS to determine the fidelity of regeneration. Instead, we have expanded our discussion of caveats, particularly with regard to the timing of mutagenesis and sampling of DNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There seems to be a lack of discussion in the findings of this study in the context of what is known about axolotl limb regeneration from previous literature.

We believe that our findings are consistent with Currie et al., as the dermal fibroblasts and the chondrocytes they replace likely share the same embryonic lineage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: Why are there so many alleles that completely lost in the regenerated limb and vice versa?

Are the alleles lost in the regenerating limbs representing the muscle fibers that do not contribute to the regenerated limb?

All of these problems cannot be determined by the current approach, but should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the identity of lost alleles is of great interest, but we cannot devise any way to address to retroactively identify lost alleles. Our investigation of several regenerated limbs and tissue–enriched samples suggest that many lost alleles have not been truly lost, but only appeared lost due to under–sampling. A portion of alleles in the first limb, that make a minor contribution to the total limb, do appear to be permanently lost, and this is now discussed in the text.</p><p>According to Sandoval–Guzman et al., muscle fibers in regenerated limbs arise from satellite cells. This suggests that, in regenerated limbs, satellite cells and muscle fibers will be labeled with the same alleles. Since our tissue–enriched allele studies were performed on regenerated muscle, we were therefore unable to pursue the possibility that the lost alleles are present in muscle fibers..</p><p>Curiously, our nerve–derived tissue samples (which most likely consisted of DNA derived from Schwann cells and connective tissue) contained only one allele that could be characterized as nerve–enriched. The frequency of this allele remained constant throughout earlier iterations of the limb, indicating that we are unable to detect the migration of new Schwann cells.</p><p>As discussed above, we found that new alleles that arose in regenerated limbs were enriched in muscle and blood, but this was not statistically significant. We have added extensive discussion regarding the loss and gain of alleles in the regenerated limb.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Results and Discussion: There seems to be a bimodal distribution in alleles gained or lost in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.

This apparent bimodality, particularly for the low frequency alleles, partially arises from an under–sampling of cells. We can say this because many of these alleles were detected again in subsequent limbs or specific tissues. Sampling errors likely account for a portion of the alleles present at very low frequencies in the original limbs and exhibit several fold frequency increases in subsequent limbs. A subset of alleles that increased in frequency and were retained after regeneration can, however, be assigned to individual tissues. These alleles were distributed among bone, blood, and muscle, though these overrepresentations are not statistically significant.</p><p>We agree that the identity of the cell lineages that expand is fascinating; however, such individual lineages represent less than one–thousandth of the limbs, making it very challenging to identify their cellular identity. We are actively exploring new methods that may allow us to identify these types of cell lineages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Results and Discussion: I partially agree with this statement.

To conclusively assign an allele to a unique cell type requires sampling from the entire limb rather than from isolated cells. Our data indicates that while many alleles are shared between several tissue types, a subset of alleles (representing slightly less than one third of those detected) were enriched more than 16–fold in one or two tissue samples. These alleles were almost exclusively very low frequency, and approximately half were not detected within the adjoining hand. Thus, while cell–type–specific alleles exist, they are both difficult to isolate, and occur at such low frequencies that it is difficult to reliably trace them in the tissue of entire limbs, especially in larger animals. Nonetheless, we find that tissues, especially those that are easier to isolate, have distinct allelic composition patterns, reflecting different relative contributions of embryonic lineages.</p></body></sub-article></article>
