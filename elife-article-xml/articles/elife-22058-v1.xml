However, we report the first finding and description of SCP1 as a plasma membrane-localized protein in various cancer cells using EGFP- or other epitope-fused SCP1. Membrane-located SCP1 dephosphorylates AKT at serine 473, leading to the abolishment of serine 473 phosphorylation that results in suppressed angiogenesis and a decreased risk of tumorigenesis. Consistently, we observed increased AKT phosphorylation and angiogenesis followed by enhanced tumorigenesis in <italic>Ctdsp1</italic> (which encodes SCP1) gene - knockout mice. Importantly, we discovered that the membrane localization of SCP1 is crucial for impeding angiogenesis and tumor growth, and this localization depends on palmitoylation of a conserved cysteine motif within its NH2 terminus. Thus, our study discovers a novel mechanism underlying SCP1 shuttling between the plasma membrane and nucleus, which constitutes a unique pathway in transducing AKT signaling that is closely linked to angiogenesis and tumorigenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22058.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22058.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22058.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancerous tumors are the leading cause of death worldwide. Tumors cannot grow beyond a couple of millimeters in diameter unless they are supplied with nutrients and oxygen. To receive these, tumors connect to the body’s blood supply by stimulating the growth of new blood vessels. Drugs that reduce the ability of new blood vessels to form have therefore been investigated as possible anti-cancer treatments.</p><p>New blood vessels emerge from pre-existing ones in a process called angiogenesis. The first stage of angiogenesis involves the endothelial cells that line the inner wall of the blood vessels moving outwards to form new ‘sprouts’. Within the endothelial cells, a signaling protein called AKT drives angiogenesis by moving to the cell membrane, where it is activated and triggers further signaling events. The activation of AKT occurs via a phosphate group being attached to a particular site on the protein.</p><p>Enzymes called phosphatases remove phosphate groups from proteins and so can inactivate AKT, hence preventing angiogenesis. Although some phosphatases are known to inactivate AKT, they cannot easily be counted or analyzed. This means that they cannot be used to develop new cancer treatments. In addition, for the phosphatase to best prevent tumor growth, it should inactivate AKT at the cell membrane.</p><p>Liao, Wang, Li, Wang, Jin et al. now show that a phosphatase called SCP1 can localize to the cell membrane and inactivate AKT there. SCP1 was not previously known to anchor to the cell membrane. Liao et al. found that this anchoring occurs via a modification that attaches a fatty acid molecule to SCP1.</p><p>Further experiments showed that mice that lacked SCP1 had increased levels of AKT phosphorylation in their endothelial cells, more new blood vessel growth and, consequently, had tumors that grew faster.</p><p>Further research is now needed to investigate exactly how SCP1 moves to the cell membrane from elsewhere in the cell. Ultimately, this knowledge could play an important role in identifying potential drugs that prevent or reduce the growth of tumors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumor angiogenesis is required for tumor growth and metastasis since tumors cannot grow without nutrients and oxygen when their diameters are beyond 1–2 mm, which is considered a distinct characteristic of cancer progression from early to terminal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Folkman, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicholson and Theodorescu, 2004</xref>). Angiogenesis inhibition approaches have emerged as attractive and promising strategies in anti-cancer treatment. AKT is a central protein kinase in various cell activities, especially for angiogenesis, tumor growth, and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Manning and Cantley, 2007</xref>). Therefore, therapeutic strategies targeting the inhibition of AKT activity in cancer treatments have drawn great public attention during recent decades.</p><p>AKT is activated by different extracellular signals such as GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptor), growth factors, and integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hemmings and Restuccia, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2012</xref>). The activation of AKT is initiated by its recruitment to the cell membrane through the interaction of its PH (Pleckstrin homology) domain with PIP3 on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franke et al., 1997</xref>). A large body of evidence shows that AKT activation is closely correlated with its phosphorylation at amino acid serine 473 (S473), while full activation of AKT requires its phosphorylation at S473 and threonine 308 (T308) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ramaswamy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawase et al., 2009</xref>). Activated AKT consequently regulates various downstream targets such as GSK3 and the transcription factor Foxos by direct phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hemmings and Restuccia, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen and Frame, 2001</xref>). Interestingly, accumulating data have shown that AKT can be activated through its S473 phosphorylation by a large variety of molecules and relay a stimulus to downstream oncogenic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ju et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morrison Joly et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meric-Bernstam et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, recent discoveries implicate that phosphorylated AKT on S473 may function as an important parameter of oncogenesis and cancer therapy. Likewise, AKT was found to relocate to the nucleus of resistant cells, where it was phosphorylated at S473 by DNA-dependent protein kinase, and this activation inhibited cisplatin-mediated apoptosis in cervical cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stronach et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, cholesterol increased AKT S473 phosphorylation, leading to enhanced tumor growth and a greater number of spontaneous metastases to the lungs in <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice, whereas cholesterol depletion in the cell membrane abrogated AKT S473 phosphorylation, suggesting AKT S473 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation may take place at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alikhani et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Protein phosphorylation is a reversible process that is mediated by kinases and phosphatases. Compartmentalized phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is a key switch for controlling protein activation and inactivation and complex signal transduction in various biological processes. It has been reported that AKT activity is negatively regulated by protein phosphatases. For example, ubiquitously expressed protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and PP2A can suppress AKT activity by direct dephosphorylation of AKT at T308 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ivaska et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Resjö et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yellaturu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2003</xref>). PH domain-containing proteins such as the phosphatases PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 are able to dephosphorylate AKT at both S473 and T308 (the other site required for full AKT activation) in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brognard et al., 2007</xref>). Unfortunately, so far, the known phosphatases involved in AKT inhibition are ubiquitously expressed in cells, which make those phosphatases difficult to be quantified and analyzed under living conditions. Therefore, these phosphatases are not applicable as observational tools for screening potential drugs and novel therapeutic targets in cancer treatments. Moreover, intracellular AKT activity is actually the cause of compromised signals that are orchestrated by various signaling pathways and imbalanced with the direct input signals of drug loading. In pursuit of optimal outcomes of cancer therapies, it is important to identify a unique membrane-localized phosphatase for AKT S473 inactivation, which is the upstream target relaying AKT signals directly from outside the drug stimulus and is the prerequisite of blocking AKT oncogenic signaling from the initial step.</p><p>Small CTD phosphatases (SCPs) belong to a family of metal-dependent serine/threonine phosphatases containing a Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding DXDX (T/V) motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamenski et al., 2004</xref>). SCPs were originally identified as small CTD containing Pol II phosphatases that shared a similar phosphatase domain with the Pol II CTD phosphatase FCP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yeo et al., 2003</xref>). SCPs are evolutionarily conserved transcriptional co-repressors for silencing neuronal gene expression via their interaction with the REST/NRSF (RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor or Neural Restrictive Silencing Factor) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yeo et al., 2005</xref>). SCPs, identified as SCP1 (protein-encoding gene <italic>Ctdsp1</italic>), SCP2, and SCP3, are involved in the TGF-β pathway and dephosphorylate distinct oncoproteins such as Snail, promyelocytic leukemia, and c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knockaert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wrighton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). SCP1 and SCP2 are found to be localized in the nucleus, whereas SCP3 is found in both the cytosol and intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yeo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Siniossoglou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Visvanathan et al., 2007</xref>). Despite a large body of evidence indicating that the proper subcellular location of signal molecules is crucial for the accurate signal transduction that accounts for normal biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hung and Link, 2011</xref>), the mechanisms underlying the trafficking diversion of SCPs are still unknown.</p><p>Protein palmitoylation through the thioester linkage of 16-carbon fatty acids to cysteine residues is unique in that it is the only reversible lipid modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bijlmakers and Marsh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smotrys and Linder, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aicart-Ramos et al., 2011</xref>). Palmitoylation governs protein function in many ways: palmitoylation can promote membrane translocation of protein and it can facilitate vesicle trafficking and thus contribute to cellular signaling transduction. In neurons and cardiomyocytes, palmitoylation plays an important role in organ development, synaptic plasticity, and the establishment of membrane excitation platforms by clustering various ion channels and transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukata and Fukata, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujiwara et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, palmitoylation is intimately involved in signaling networks by interacting with various protein molecules such as insulin in the control of phenotypic and functional changes of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang et al., 2014</xref>). A previous study has shown that SCP1 is a palmitoylation substrate by mass spectrometry, whereas direct evidence to prove SCP1 palmitoylation is missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin and Cravatt, 2009</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we find that SCP1, a known nuclear phosphatase, can dephosphorylate AKT by screening a phosphatase library to search for a potential phosphatase that is capable of inactivating AKT. To our surprise, SCP1 is found to be largely located at the plasma membrane by tracing its cellular localization using EGFP-fused SCP1 and SCP1 proteins with different epitope tags. Such membrane-bound SCP1 specifically dephosphorylates AKT at S473 and suppresses angiogenesis, thereby decreasing tumorigenic risk and subsequent tumor growth of lung carcinoma cell-inoculated nude mice. In parallel, increased AKT phosphorylation and promoted angiogenesis, together with a notable risk of tumorigenesis, were observed in SCP1-knockout mice. Moreover, the membrane localization of SCP1 is majorly dependent on the palmitoylation of a conserved cysteine motif within its NH<sub>2</sub> terminus, which has a prominent role in SCP1 shuttling between the plasma membrane and nucleus, and thus halting angiogenesis and tumor growth. Collectively, our findings reveal the distinct role of SCP1 as a palmitoylation-dependent phosphatase that negative regulates AKT-mediated angiogenesis and tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SCP1 is localized to the plasma membrane</title><p>To explore the functional role of SCP1 in the inhibition of AKT activity, we surprisingly found that both GFP-SCP1 and Flag-SCP1 were mainly localized at the plasma membrane in HeLa cells, where they were well co-localized with the plasma membrane marker GFP-PLCδ-PH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To rule out the artificial intervention from the fused GFP protein, we compared the subcellular localizations of untagged and GFP-fused SCP1 at the N terminus or C terminus, respectively. Our data demonstrated that both untagged and GFP-fused SCP1 showed similar membrane localizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that SCP1 is a membrane-localized protein. SCP2 and SCP3, which are structurally similar to SCP1, appeared to possess an identical distribution pattern at the plasma membrane when they were transiently expressed in 293 T cells, whereas CTDSPL2 (SCP4) was mainly localized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Because we could not find any transmembrane region within SCP1, we examined whether its membrane localization is mediated by lipid modifications. To this end, we examined the effects of various lipid modification inhibitors, including the farnesyltransferase inhibitor FTI-227, the prenyl transferase inhibitor GGTI, and the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate (2BP) on SCP1 membrane localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rowinsky et al., 1999</xref>). We did not detect any effect of FTI-227 and GGTI on SCP1 membrane localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, FTI-227 and GGTI treatments dramatically blocked the membrane localization of H-Ras in control experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In sharp contrast, treatment with 2BP for 4 h resulted in a remarkable reduction of membrane-localized SCP1 and significantly increased cytosolic and nuclear SCP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This result was confirmed by cell fractionation assay, which showed that the membrane-associated SCP1 level was markedly reduced upon 2BP treatment.

Therefore, we tested whether the nucleus- or Golgi-localized SCP1 was newly synthesized and recycled to the nucleus or Golgi from the plasma membrane. SCP1 localization was monitored in transfected HeLa cells treated with cycloheximide (CHX) for 8 h to block new protein synthesis in the presence or absence of 2BP, which demonstrated that CHX had little effect on the membrane localization of SCP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, in the presence of 2BP, CHX treatment significantly reduced the distribution of SCP1 on the Golgi membrane, but minimally affected its nuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These data indicate that the newly synthesized SCP1 protein is translocated to the Golgi without being palmitoylated and then targeted to the plasma membrane by palmitoylation. The pool of SCP1 at the plasma membrane was constitutively depalmitoylated and the 2BP treatment prevented its re-palmitoylation, leading to the redistribution of depalmitoylated SCP1 in cytosolic and nuclear compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These data suggest that palmitoylation is required for SCP1 localization at the plasma membrane, while depalmitoylation allows SCP1 to be recycled from the cell surface to the nucleus.</p><p>As mentioned above, this is a reversible modification as palmitoylation involves the attachment of a thioester chain to cysteine residues, and this controls the transient membrane targeting of peripheral membrane proteins (so-called S-palmitoylation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">el-Husseini et al., 2002</xref>). We found that SCP1 contains an evolutionarily conserved di-cysteine motif at its membrane-associated region, which constitutes a potential palmitoylation site predicted by ExPASy or CSS-Palm software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The membrane-localized N-terminal fragment of SCP1 containing putative S-palmitoylation sites is sensitive to 2BP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Therefore, we examined the functional role of these conserved cysteines for targeting SCP1 to the membrane by mutating these cysteines into serines. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, the individual mutations of Cys44 (C44), Cys45 (C45), or Cys47 (C47) to Ser had minimal effects on the membrane distribution of SCP1. However, the simultaneous mutation of both Cys44 and Cys45 into serines (2S) resulted in a dramatic reduction of membrane-associated SCP1 by 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The C45S and C44/45S mutations also significantly increased the levels of SCP1 in the cytosol and nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These data indicate that SCP1 binds to the plasma membrane through the conserved cysteines of Cys44 and Cys45.</p><p>To test whether SCP1 was palmitoylated in vivo, a cysteine accessibility assay (also named the acyl–biotin exchange [ABE] assay) was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Noritake et al., 2009</xref>). We found that both overexpressed and endogenous SCP1 were palmitoylated in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). It is well established that a distinguishing feature of S-palmitoylation is its reversibility. Since both the forward and reverse reactions take place in a reversible fashion, we also validated the dynamic palmitoylation of SCP1 using both the palmitoylation inhibitor (2BP) and the depalmitoylation inhibitor (palmostatin B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dekker et al., 2010</xref>). As expected, the palmitoylation of SCP1 can be regulated by both 2BP and palmostatin B in an opposing fashion, as shown by the decreased palmitoylation of SCP1 by 2BP versus the increased palmitoylation of SCP1 by palmostatin B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), suggesting a dynamic balance of SCP1 inside and outside of the plasma membrane. The residues required for palmitoylation were also examined. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, all of the C44S, C45S, and C47S mutations led to a reduction of palmitoylation to different extents, while the SCP1 C44/45S double mutant almost completely abolished palmitoylation. The palmitoylation level of the C45S mutant was much less than that of the C44S or C47S mutants, which matched these mutants to their role in SCP1 membrane association. The palmitoylation of wild-type (WT) SCP1 was also confirmed by a [<sup>3</sup>H] palmitic acid incorporation assay. The 2S mutant showed a remarkably reduced level of [<sup>3</sup>H] palmitic acid incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), suggesting that such cysteines are the major palmitoylation sites of SCP1. Taken together, these results indicate that SCP1 is palmitoylated at its N-terminus, which accounts for the targeting SCP1 of to the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>SCP1 is a negative regulator of angiogenesis</title><p>To further clarify the function of SCP1, we generated SCP1-knockout (KO) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

The SCP1-KO mice gave birth at a typical median ratio and developed normally (data not shown). Because palmitoylation plays different roles in neurogenesis and is tightly controlled by angiogenesis in that growth factors such as VEGF perform multiple functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2007</xref>), we examined whether SCP1 is involved in embryonic vasculogenesis using SCP1-KO mice. To this end, we analyzed in vivo retinal vasculogenesis at postnatal day 5 (P5) using whole-mount and imaging techniques. We found that the vascular areas were larger in the SCP1-KO mice than those of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

We found that the aortic rings from SCP1-KO mice showed an increased capability of angiogenesis, evidenced by enlarged areas of capillary sprouting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). MK2206 was reported as an allosteric AKT inhibitor that enhanced the antitumor efficacy of standard chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirai et al., 2010</xref>). Treatment with MK2206 reversed the above-mentioned effects in SCP1-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These results indicate that SCP1 negatively regulates angiogenesis in an AKT-dependent manner.</p><p>Because the endothelial cell is the major cell type involved in angiogenesis, we investigated whether SCP1 deficiency impairs the function of endothelial cells by examining the functional role of SCP1 in HUVECs (a human endothelial cell line from umbilical veins). To this end, we first examined whether SCP1 regulates AKT phosphorylation in HUVECs. Our data showed that SCP1 depletion significantly promoted VEGF-induced AKT activation in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, we found that SCP1 overexpression markedly inhibited tubule formation and cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, the inhibitory effect of SCP1 was rescued by the coexpression of the AKT-S473D mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In parallel, SCP1 depletion markedly increased angiogenesis and endothelial cell migration, which could be reversed by AKT inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). These data indicate that SCP1 suppresses angiogenesis in an AKT phosphorylation-dependent fashion.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22058.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>SCP1 inhibited AKT-mediated angiogenesis</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SCP1 deletion promoted VEGF-induced AKT activation in HUVECs.

We found that overexpression of SCP1 significantly diminished the phosphorylation of endogenous AKT at Ser473 without affecting total AKT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In addition, SCP1 knockdown by shRNA markedly increased AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). AKT can be activated by various upstream signals, such as growth factors, hormones, and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rodon et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether SCP1 could block AKT activation under such conditions. We found that EGF treatment markedly induced the membrane distribution of AKT and AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 in HeLa cells. In addition, SCP1 expression suppressed EGF-induced AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 without affecting AKT distribution at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Meanwhile, both EGF- and insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 in H1299 cells can be significantly elevated by SCP1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The knockdown efficiency of SCP1 was measured at the mRNA and protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We also found that SCP1 depletion significantly enhanced the expression levels of AKT-phosphate substrates as examined by anti-AKT-phosphate substrate antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Similar results were obtained using MEF cells derived from SCP1-WT and -KO littermates under the insulin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Phosphatase PHLPP has been implicated in cleaving pS473 from AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cailliau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qiao et al., 2007</xref>). We found that SCP1 or PHLPP depletion could promote AKT phosphorylation at Ser473. Furthermore, double knockdown of SCP1 and PHLPP could exaggerate this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). We also overexpressed PHLPP1 when SCP1 was disabled and found that PHLPP1 can still decrease AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Based on these data, we conclude that the phosphatase function of SCP1 that dephosphorylates AKT is independent of PHLPP activity. Taken together, our results indicate that SCP1 is a phosphatase that dephosphorylates AKT at Ser473.</p><p>The phosphorylation of Ser473 is critical for AKT activation. Therefore, we examined whether SCP1 could regulate AKT kinase activity using an in vitro kinase assay. We found that SCP1 overexpression markedly reduced AKT activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Thus, our data indicate that dephosphorylation of AKT by SCP1 significantly inhibits AKT kinase activity.</p><p>Next, we investigated whether SCP1 could interact with AKT in vivo. To this end, SCP1 was immunoprecipitated from HEK293T cells and the association of endogenous AKT and SCP1 was detected by immunoblotting. We found that endogenous AKT could be co-immunoprecipitated by both overexpressed and endogenous SCP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>), indicating that SCP1 associates with AKT in cells. In addition, we found that membrane-localized Myr-AKT had a stronger affinity to SCP1 than WT AKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). The interaction between SCP1 and AKT was independent of SCP1 phosphatase activity, since dominant-negative SCP1 still showed an association with AKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Consistently, AKT could directly bind to the purified SCP1 in vitro, while mutations of AKT at Thr308, Thr450, or Ser473 had little effect on their interaction, suggesting that the direct interaction between SCP1 and AKT is independent of AKT phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Palmitoylation of SCP1 is required for AKT inhibition</title><p>Then, we examined whether SCP1 palmitoylation is involved in its inhibitory effect on AKT signaling.

In summary, these data indicate that palmitoylation is essential for SCP1 to dephosphorylate AKT via their interactions, which plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and tumor growth.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>SCP1 was initially identified as a nuclear phosphatase that dephosphorylates RNA pol ll (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yeo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, we unexpectedly found that SCP1, SCP2, and SCP3 are mainly localized at the plasma membrane in different cell types in a steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Such a novel phenotype observed from SCP1 raises much interest because only a few serine/threonine phosphatases are localized at the plasma membranes, although approximately 30 serine/threonine and 107 tyrosine protein phosphatases have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alonso et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, all of these membrane-located phosphatases have been demonstrated to play crucial roles in various biological processes. For instance, PTEN can function as a protein phosphatase that localizes at the plasma membrane to dephosphorylate membrane proteins and is intimately involved in tumor progression by inhibiting oncogenic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2000</xref>). PH domain-containing family members such as PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 can mediate AKT signaling by recruiting proteins to the plasma membrane through its interaction with PIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brognard et al., 2007</xref>). Another study indicated that PHLPP1 interacts with scribble via its PDZ (Post synaptic density protein (PSD95), Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor (Dlg1), and Zonula occludens-1 protein (zo-1)) domain and thereby mediates its localization at the plasma membrane, which negatively regulates AKT-mediated tumorigenic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hung and Link, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In order to explore the mechanisms underlying the membrane distribution of SCP1, we used both in vitro and in vivo animal models and consequently found that SCPs were palmitoylated at a conserved cysteine motif within its N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). S-palmitoylation is a lipid post-translational modification involving the covalent attachment of fatty acid palmitate to cysteine residues via a thioester bond. So far, it is the only reversible lipid modification that has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mumby, 1997</xref>). Importantly, palmitoylated proteins were found to play very important roles in multiple biological processes, such as synaptic plasticity during neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukata and Fukata, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">El-Husseini et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kutzleb et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arstikaitis et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, various membrane-localized proteins that are crucial in the maintenance of protein structure and function are palmitoylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rocks et al., 2010</xref>). Unlike other lipid modifications, protein palmitoylation is highly dynamic, and cycles of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation can regulate protein function and subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukata and Fukata, 2010</xref>). Due to its special nature, palmitoylation may be particularly important for modulating protein function during cycles of activation and deactivation through its effect on a protein's affinity for membranes, subcellular localization, and interactions with other proteins. Moreover, reversible palmitoylation of signaling proteins allows proteins to rapidly shuttle between intracellular membrane compartments, since this palmitate cycling can be regulated by different physiological stimuli, which contributes to cellular homeostasis. Thus, the identification of a novel palmitoylated protein like SCP1 could be critical for clarifying special points of cross-talk between molecular signals that are implicated in diverse cellular functions. Based upon our findings, it would be reasonable to assume that the distribution of SCP1 at the plasma membrane via its N-terminal palmitoylation might intensively deal with some uncovered functions of SCP1. We first looked for direct evidence of SCP1 palmitoylation. From a variety of pharmacological inhibitor tests, substantial evidence confirmed the existence of SCP1 palmitoylation and further clarified a distinct role of palmitoylation, but not of farnesylation nor prenylatin, in the control of the membrane recruitment of SCP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our results bridge the gap between the SCP1 post-translational modification and biological function observed in a previous study by Martin and Cravatt, who identified SCP1 as a palmitoylation substrate in their search for palmitoylated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin and Cravatt, 2009</xref>). Thus, we conclude that SCP1 is a palmitoylated phosphatase.</p><p>From our data, SCP1 palmitoylation is indeed a reversible process that is dynamically regulated by palmitoylation/depalmitoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Palmitoylation of SCP1 stabilizes the association of SCP1 with membranes, thereby facilitating its vesicular trafficking to the plasma membrane and the subsequent dephosphorylation of AKT by their direct interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H and J</xref>). Meanwhile, depalmitoylation releases depalmitoylated SCP1 into the cytoplasm, allowing its return to the Golgi for another round of palmitoylation or its direct nuclear entry, where it activates different downstream signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Thus, such regulation of the subcellular localization of SCP1 by reversible palmitoylation/depalmitoylation may intimately link it to multiple intracellular signaling pathways. Accordingly, our data prove that the blockade of palmitoylation significantly induces the nuclear localization of SCP1, indicating that SCP1 can shuttle between the plasma membrane and nucleus, which is consistent with previous reports that SCP1 can dephosphorylate nuclear oncoproteins such as Snail, c-Myc, and Smad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knockaert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that such a novel phenotype of SCP1 shuttling observed in our study may be closely correlated with oncogenesis and tumor progression. In addition, palmitoylation has been shown to be regulated by different signaling molecules such as nitric oxide or Src kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aicart-Ramos et al., 2011</xref>). It will be instructive to investigate whether the SCP1 subcellular localization is regulated under certain physiological or pathological conditions and whether such conditions could also regulate SCP1 palmitoylation-mediated signaling.</p><p>In order to explore the role of SCP1 palmitoylation in the regulation of biological processes, we conducted a variety of experiments including both in vitro and in vivo studies. Our data indicate that the palmitoylation of SCP1 is essential for AKT dephosphorylation at the plasma membrane, whereas such palmitoylation is not required for its phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Meanwhile, AKT dephosphorylation by SCP1 requires a direct interaction between them at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is consistent with several lines of evidence showing a tight correlation between AKT activity and its interaction with some specific phosphatases. For example, AKT binds to APPL1 in the endosome, where it regulates the specificity for its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schenck et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saito et al., 2007</xref>). Another AKT phosphatase, PHLPP1, is also membrane associated via binding to scribble, which is necessary for its dephosphorylation of AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hung and Link, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, we discovered that C44/C45 cysteines are indispensable for SCP1 palmitoylation and subsequent direct interaction with AKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Such an intimate link between membrane-localized SCP1 by palmitoylation on C44/C45 cysteines and the dephosphorylation of AKT is highlighted by embryonic vasculogenesis tests and hind limb ischemia models in SCP1-KO mice with markedly enhanced angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, SCP1 deficiency-promoted angiogenesis is also intimately involved in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Using EGF/insulin-induced MEF cells derived from WT and SCP1-KO littermates, our data illustrate a direct interaction and consequent dephosphorylation of AKT by SCP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since it is relatively easy and straight-forward to examine or quantify membrane-localized SCP1 together with its interaction with AKT, which is the prerequisite for screening potential inhibitors of AKT activity and consequently fine-tuning AKT signaling during tumorigenesis, our study may open up a brand-new avenue for the exquisite regulation of AKT activity that is anticipated to play a critical role in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis.</p><p>To further clarify the underlying mechanisms of SCP1-mediated AKT inhibition and the resultant suppression of angiogenesis and tumor growth, we point out that AKT Ser473 is the key site for SCP1-mediated dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). AKT signaling is regulated through its dephosphorylation on serine/threonine residues in both the cytosol and nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stronach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Testa and Bellacosa, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Among these phosphorylation/dephosphorylation sites, Ser473 has drawn much attention recently, as it is assumed to participate in oncogenesis, drug resistance and the anti-apoptosis competence of various types of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stronach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wendel et al., 2004</xref>). The unique phenotype of AKT Ser473 dephosphorylation endowed by its direct interaction with SCP1 at the plasma membrane sheds light on novel therapy strategies for the modulation of aberrant AKT signaling and consequent tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In this context, we propose a de novo signaling mechanism such that SCP1 is recruited to the membrane by its palmitoylation at the N-terminus, where SCP1 negatively regulates AKT kinase activity, followed by impaired angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. Considering the importance of AKT signaling in angiogenesis and oncogenic development, we present substantial evidence for the identification of SCP1 as a new membrane-localized phosphatase for AKT that carries obvious elements of novelty and interest to the cancer community.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and cell culture</title><p>The expression plasmids SCP1, SCP2, SCP3, and SCP4 were the gift from Professor Xinhua Feng (Zhejiang University).

We checked the bodyweight of the mice every day, and observed their drinking and eating condition as well as their activity to monitor their health. We checked the bodyweight of the mice every day and observed their drinking and eating condition as well as their activity to monitor their health before they were sacrificed. No mice was observed to be ill or dead during the experimental term. No early euthanasia/humane endpoints for animals was performed since none of animals became severely ill/moribund during the experiment(s). Mice were sacrificed by Carbon Dioxide Euthanasia to minimize suffering of mice. All treatments were administered according to the &quot;Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals&quot; (Eighth Edition). All of the animals were handled according to approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocols (AR20130902) of the East China Normal

The manuscript makes several key observations that appear to be novel and significant. First, SCP1 is largely membrane localized and this is dependent on palmitoylation of two Cys residues in the N-terminus. Second, SCP1 appears to dephosphorylate the C-terminal phosphate of Akt (Ser473) when SCP1 is membrane localized. Third, the dephosphorylation of Akt inhibits cell growth (vascular, tumor), consistent with an expected effect of inhibition of Akt activity. These three points add significantly to our understanding of SCP1 and Akt function and regulation, and could inform new therapeutic studies. They also run counter to the prevailing view that SCP1 is predominantly an RNA Pol II CTD phosphatase. The work appears rigorously performed. Though the writing is a bit rough and will need copy-editing, the main points are clear. We support publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after attention is given to the points below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The model presented by the authors is interesting, but needs to be further elaborated experimentally. The authors suggest some fraction of SCP1 is cytoplasmic/nuclear. Is there a function for non-membrane associated SCP1? Do known and now readily available depalmitoylation inhibitors affect the levels of SCPI S-palmitoylation and function? Is SCPI S-palmitoylation actually dynamic? This could be addressed by pulse-chase experiments. In any event, more discussion on the potential nuclear/cytoplasmic functions of SCP1 is needed.</p><p>2) One of the major findings of this study is the membrane localization of SCP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To reach this conclusion, the authors did multiple experiments, in a variety of cell lines, by using ectopic SCP1 expression. To complement these overexpression experiments, they did examine endogenous SCP1 in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). While the endogenous SCP1 appeared to show a strong membrane distribution, the quality of this particular blot is not as good as other results in the study. To validate that they are indeed looking at endogenous SCP1, it is suggested that the authors conduct an SCP1 RNAi experiment; if the signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> is indeed SCP1, then the signal should disappear/greatly reduce upon SCP1 RNAi.</p><p>3) The authors note that a previous phosphatase PHLPP has been implicated in cleaving pS473 from Akt. Is it possible that SCP1 could be regulating PHLPP in some fashion and this is in turn is influencing Akt C-tail phosphorylation? This could be investigated by knocking down PHLPP1/2 in the setting of SCP1 overexpression or overexpressing PHLPP when SCP1 is disabled. Experiments of this type would provide information about the relative importance and potential pathway connections of these two phosphatases.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22058.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The model presented by the authors is interesting, but needs to be further elaborated experimentally. The authors suggest some fraction of SCP1 is cytoplasmic/nuclear. Is there a function for non-membrane associated SCP1?</italic> </p><p>In our previous report, SCP1 dephosphates c-Myc protein at Ser62 and non-membrane SCP1-CC still dephosphates c-Myc. Functionally, SCP1 negatively regulated the cancer cell proliferation (Wang et al., 2016). So, we agree that non-membrane associated SCP1 has a functional role in regulation of c-Myc stability and in suppression of c-Myc transcriptional activity at nucleus, and thus affects cancer cell proliferation.</p><p><italic>Do known and now readily available depalmitoylation inhibitors affect the levels of SCPI S-palmitoylation and function?</italic> </p><p>Acyl protein thioesterase 1 (APT1) is a primary depalmitoylating enzyme shown to mediate palmitate removal. Palmostatin B, as an inhibitor of APT1 that suppresses S-palmitoylation was reported (Dekker and Hedberg, 2011). It has been established that there are a variety of proteins such as Ras, PSD-95 can be modified by S-palmitoylation (Kang et al., 2008; Linder and Deschenes, 2007). Also, Cravatt et al. suggested that SCP1 could be a palmitoylation substrate too. In our paper, we have shown the direct evidence about the intimate correlation between SCP1 palmitoylation and its newly identified membrane localization, which plays a central role in suppression of AKT-mediated angiogenesis and tumor growth. To address the reviewer’s question, we treated HEK293T cells expressing Flag-SCP1 with palmostatin B or 2-BP (a general inhibitor of palmitate synthesis and palmitoylation), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Based on our data, we confirmed that palmostatin B directly inhibits depalmitoylation of SCP1, leading to a conclusion that depalmitoylation inhibitor palmostatin B affects SCP1 S-palmitoylation, which may influence SCP1 membrane localization and thus affect AKT-mediated angiogenesis and tumor growth.</p><p><italic>Is SCPI S-palmitoylation actually dynamic? This could be addressed by pulse-chase experiments. In any event, more discussion on the potential nuclear/cytoplasmic functions of SCP1 is needed.</italic> </p><p>In order to confirm the SCP1 is actually dynamic, we have performed FRAP assay and time-lapse microscopy with or without palmostatin B (depalmitoylation inhibitor) treatment. We found that the inhibition of depalmitoylation promoted the recovery of SCP1 membrane localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>). We also showed that 2-BP decreased the level of SCP1 S-palmitoylation (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> in our paper). In addition, we confirmed that the S-palmitoylation is related to the membrane localization of SCP1 (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> in our paper). Furthermore, membrane localization of SCP1 is restored after photobleaching (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> in our paper). Therefore, we conclude that the membrane distribution of SCP1 is reversible, which is determined by the dynamic state of SCP1 S-palmitoylation. We have made more discussion on the potential nuclear / cyto-plasmic functions in our revised manuscript (Discussion, third paragraph).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22058.017</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22058.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22058.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22058-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>2) One of the major findings of this study is the membrane localization of SCP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Figure 1—figure supplement 1).

We found that SCP1 or PHLPP depletion can promote AKT phosphorylation at Ser473. Furthermore, double knockdown SCP1 and PHLPP can exaggerate this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D and 1E</xref>). According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we overexpressed PHLPP1 when SCP1 is disabled, we found that PHLPP1 still can decrease the expression of AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus, the phosphatase function of SCP1 that dephosphorylates AKT is independent of PHLPP activity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
