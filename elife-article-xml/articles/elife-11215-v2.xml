regulate chromatin states and processing of nascent RNA. Extensive phosphorylation of serine residues at the largest RNAPII subunit occurs at its structurally-disordered C-terminal domain (CTD), which is composed of multiple heptapeptide repeats with consensus sequence Y<sub>1</sub>-S<sub>2</sub>-P<sub>3</sub>-T<sub>4</sub>-S<sub>5</sub>-P<sub>6</sub>-S<sub>7</sub>. Serine-5 and Serine-7 phosphorylation mark transcription initiation, whereas Serine-2 phosphorylation coincides with productive elongation. In vertebrates, the CTD has eight non-canonical substitutions of Serine-7 into Lysine-7, which can be acetylated (K7ac). Here, we describe mono- and di-methylation of CTD Lysine-7 residues (K7me1 and K7me2). K7me1 and K7me2 are observed during the earliest transcription stages and precede or accompany Serine-5 and Serine-7 phosphorylation. In contrast, K7ac is associated with RNAPII elongation, Serine-2 phosphorylation and mRNA expression. We identify an unexpected balance between RNAPII K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters, which fine-tunes gene expression levels.</p> <p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11215.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11215.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11215.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes are sections of DNA that encode the instructions to make proteins. When a gene is switched on, the section of DNA is copied to make molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) in a process called transcription. These messenger RNAs are then used as templates for protein production. In animals, plants and other eukaryotic organisms, an enzyme called RNA polymerase II is responsible for making messenger RNA molecules during transcription. This enzyme is made up of several proteins, the largest of which contains a long tail, called the carboxy-terminal domain. This domain is crucial for transcription because it serves as a landing platform for other enzymes that help to make the RNA molecules.</p> <p>The carboxy-terminal domain contains multiple repeats of a string of seven amino acids (the building blocks of proteins). Normally, each repeat contains three amino acids called serines. However, in humans and other mammals, one of these serines is often substituted with another amino acid called lysine instead. This lysine (referred to as Lysine-7) was known to be modified by the addition of a chemical group called an 'acetyl' tag, but it was not clear how this tag affected transcription.</p> <p>Dias, Rito, Torlai Triglia et al. carried out an in-depth study into how Lysine-7 is modified in mouse cells, and what effects these modifications have on transcription. The experiments show that Lysine-7 can also be modified by the addition of a different chemical group, called a 'methyl' tag. This new modification is also found in flies, worms and human cells, which suggests that it is generally important for transcription.</p> <p>Next, Dias, Rito, Torlai Triglia et al. found that in mouse stem cells, methyl tags are added to Lysine-7 during the earliest steps of transcription, before the acetyl tags are added. Further experiments show that a balance between the addition of methyl tags and acetyl tags to Lysine-7 fine-tunes the activity of RNA polymerase II. These findings add to our understanding of how cells control the activity of RNA polymerase II at different genes. Future challenges are to find out which enzymes are responsible for adding and removing these chemical tags, and how the balance between the methyl and acetyl modifications is controlled.</p> <p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11215.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11215.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>transcription cycle</kwd><kwd>post-transcriptional modification</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase II</kwd><kwd>C-terminal domain</kwd><kwd>methylation</kwd><kwd>non-histone protein lysine methylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dias</surname><given-names>João D</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferrai</surname><given-names>Carmelo</given-names></name><name><surname>Chotalia</surname><given-names>Mita</given-names></name><name><surname>Brookes</surname><given-names>Emily</given-names></name><name><surname>Pombo</surname><given-names>Ana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dias</surname><given-names>João D</given-names></name><name><surname>Rito</surname><given-names>Tiago</given-names></name><name><surname>Torlai Triglia</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name><name><surname>Kukalev</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferrai</surname><given-names>Carmelo</given-names></name><name><surname>Pombo</surname><given-names>Ana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25116005; 26291071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kimura</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kimura</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/51005/2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dias</surname><given-names>João D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lysine mono- and di-methylation are two novel post-translational modifications of RNA polymerase II, which are enriched at promoters of active genes, precede lysine acetylation and mark early stages of transcription.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription of protein-coding genes is a complex process involving a sequence of RNA processing events that occur at different stages of the transcription cycle. Co-transcriptional recruitment of chromatin modifiers and RNA processing machinery is modulated through a complex array of post-translational modifications at the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RPB1, the largest subunit of RNAPII. This unique domain constitutes a docking platform for protein complexes that cap, splice and polyadenylate newly-made RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentley, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buratowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Egloff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eick and Geyer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hsin and Manley, 2012</xref>). The CTD also integrates signaling cascades that, for example, coordinate the DNA damage response and chromatin remodeling with gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Munoz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Winsor et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The CTD is a large, structurally disordered domain composed of a tandem heptapeptide repeat structure with the canonical sequence Y<sub>1</sub>-S<sub>2</sub>-P<sub>3</sub>-T<sub>4</sub>-S<sub>5</sub>-P<sub>6</sub>-S<sub>7</sub>. Extensive remodeling of the CTD occurs during distinct steps of the transcription cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buratowski, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2009</xref>). RNAPII binds to promoter regions in a hypophosphorylated state, before the CTD becomes phosphorylated at Serine-5 (S5p) and Serine-7 (S7p), marking the earliest stages of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chapman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tietjen et al., 2010</xref>). Productive elongation is characterized by an increase in phosphorylation of Serine-2 (S2p) throughout gene bodies, with the highest levels found around transcription end sites (TES). S5p is important for recruitment of the capping machinery, while S2p is involved in the recruitment of splicing and polyadenylation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corden, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lunde et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Although the tandem repeat structure of the CTD was acquired very early in eukaryotic evolution, and general features of serine phosphorylation are fairly conserved from yeast to mammals, the number of repeats is highly variable among different taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chapman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang and Stiller, 2014</xref>). The most complex multicellular organisms, such as vertebrates, generally have longer CTDs (e.g. 52 heptad repeats in mammals), whereas <italic>Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and unicellular yeast have 44, 42 and 26–29 copies, respectively. The mammalian CTD retains a core of 21 consensus repeats, but has accumulated a diversity of non-consensus repeats, particularly at its most C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In vertebrates, non-canonical amino-acid residues occur most frequently at the seventh position of the heptapeptide repeat, and the most frequent substitution replaces the canonical S7 residue with a lysine (K7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The number of non-canonical K7-containing repeats increases from zero in yeast to one, three and eight repeats in <italic>C. elegans, D. melanogaster</italic> and vertebrates, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Previous work has shown that non-canonical CTD-K7 residues can be acetylated, and that CTD-K7ac is associated with transcriptional pausing at epidermal growth factor (EGF)-inducible genes in mouse fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schroeder et al., 2013</xref>). Evolutionary analyses also suggest that CTD-K7ac played a role in the origin of complex Metazoan lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Simonti et al., 2015</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11215.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure and evolutionary conservation of the C-terminal domain of RPB1.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Mouse RPB1 CTD is composed of 52 heptapeptide repeats with consensus amino-acid sequence YSPTSPS, which is represented 21 times at the most proximal CTD region.

We identify mono- and di-methylation of CTD-K7 residues in both vertebrates and invertebrates. We produce new antibodies specific to CTD-K7me1 and CTD-K7me2 and show that these novel modifications precede or accompany phosphorylation of S5 and S7, upstream of S2 phosphorylation. Using biochemical and genome-wide approaches, we show that CTD-K7 methylation is present at the promoters of genes that are productively transcribed into mature RNA, but defines the earliest stages of the transcription cycle. Through detailed analysis of abundance and distribution of different CTD modifications at gene promoters in embryonic stem (ES) cells, we show that gene expression levels depend on the balance between CTD-K7 methylation and acetylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mutation of CTD-K7 residues is compatible with cell viability</title><p>To study the importance of non-consensus CTD-K7 residues on cell viability and their potential for post-translational methylation, we generated stable mouse NIH-3T3 cell lines expressing α-amanitin-resistant RPB1 bearing CTD-K7 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

Lysine acetylation has been extensively studied in the context of histone proteins, where it is often counter-balanced by methylation, with clear roles in regulation of gene expression and repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bannister and Kouzarides, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wozniak and Strahl, 2014</xref>). To investigate whether K7 methylation could counteract K7 acetylation of RNAPII, we developed specific monoclonal antibodies using CTD peptides methylated on K7. With the aim of raising antibodies that could potentially detect methylation in several or all of the K7-containing CTD repeats, we chose the peptide sequence centered on the K7 residue in repeat 35 of the CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). This heptad has the most represented K7-repeat sequence (YSPTSPK), and is the K7 residue with most conserved distance to the C-terminal end of RPB1 in vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Peptides modified by mono-, di- and tri-methylation of K7 residues were used for immunization. The supernatants of hybridoma clones were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to test for specificity to CTD-K7 methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). We identified several antibody clones specific for CTD-K7 mono- or di-methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).

These results confirm the specificity of the K7me1 and K7me2 antibodies to CTD-K7 modifications. The single band in NIH-3T3 and in 8K cell lines shows lack of cross-reactivity to other NIH-3T3 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

Interestingly, we found that both the K7me1 and K7me2 antibodies detect the hypophosphorylated RPB1 and YFP-RPB1 bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).

Mono- and di-methylation were identified in total cell extracts from the 1K cell line. The intensities of mono- and di-methylation increase in the 3K line, indicating that several lysine residues are mono- and di-methylated in the same CTD. The level of mono-methylation increases further in the 8K-cell line, showing abundant mono-methylation of the CTD in vivo. In contrast, the di-methylation levels remain similar between the 8K and 3K lines, suggesting that not all eight CTD lysine-7 residues are simultaneously di-methylated, and reflecting a possible preference for di-methylation of the K residues conserved between mammals and invertebrates, which are present in the 3K construct.

K7me1 also occurs in human cells and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but is not easily detected in extracts from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos, suggesting that di-methylation may be a more prevalent methylation mark. Detection of mono- and di-methylation at the single <italic>C. elegans</italic> K7 residue, with antibodies produced using peptides based on the mammalian repeats 34-–35, also suggests that the recognition of K7 methylation is in general robust to small differences in the amino-acid sequences that flank the modified K7 residues (compare <italic>C. elegans</italic> sequence, <italic>-<underline>S<sub>4</sub></underline>-S<sub>5</sub>-P<sub>6</sub>-<bold>K<sub>7</sub></bold>-Y<sub>1</sub>-S<sub>2</sub>-P<sub>3</sub>-</italic>, with immunizing mammalian peptide sequence, <italic>-T<sub>4</sub>-S<sub>5</sub>-P<sub>6</sub>-<bold>K<sub>7</sub></bold>-Y<sub>1</sub>-<underline>T<sub>2</sub></underline>-P<sub>3</sub>-</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a, b</xref>).

However, it could also result from steric hindrance of K7me1 and K7me2 antibody binding by CTD phosphorylation. To test whether CTD phosphorylation interferes with immunodetection of K7 methylation, we performed western blots from total protein extracts obtained from mouse ES cells, and pre-treated the blots with alkaline phosphatase to remove phosphoepitopes prior to immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We find that the detection of K7 methylation remains specific to the hypophosphorylated RPB1 after treatment of immunoblots with alkaline phosphatase, showing only a minor increase in the detection of K7me1 and K7me2 at intermediately phosphorylated forms, in conditions that fully abrogate detection of phosphorylated epitopes (e.g. S5p; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stock et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, immunodetection of K7me1 and K7me2 is only minimally affected by CTD phosphorylation, suggesting that K7me1 and K7me2 modifications are depleted from elongation-competent hyperphosphorylated RPB1 complexes.

K7ac is also found at gene promoters but is often present downstream of K7 methylation occupancy, within gene bodies. K7 methylation and acetylation, and other RNAPII modifications, are not detected at inactive genes (e.g. <italic>Myf5</italic> gene). K7me1 and K7me2 occupancy at active genes, and absence at inactive, were confirmed by single gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). In summary, we find that K7me1 and K7me2 are more tightly localized to gene promoters than K7ac, suggesting association with the earliest stages of transcription.</p><p>Given that K7me1, K7me2 and K7ac exhibit different occupancy patterns at active genes, we assessed the genome-wide promoter distribution and abundance of each mark. We first identified all genomic regions positive for CTD-K7 marks, using a peak finder suited for both sharp and broader occupancy patterns (Bayesian change-point, BCP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xing et al., 2012</xref>). We then used these positive regions to classify gene promoters according to the presence of each modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). A total of 6962, 8265 and 8312 gene promoters were classified as positive for K7me1, K7me2 and K7ac, respectively. The vast majority of these genes are (i) positive for all three marks (n = 6398; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), (ii) also marked by S5p, S7p, S2p and 8WG16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), and (iii) transcriptionally active at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). As a further test of the specificity of K7me1 and K7me2 presence at productive RNAPII complexes, we evaluated their presence at polycomb repressed (PRCr) genes. This group of genes is associated with poised RNAPII complexes in mouse ES cells, which are characterized by an unusual CTD state phosphorylated at S5 but not at S7 or S2, and that does not lead to mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brookes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stock et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tee et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with the specificity of K7me1 and K7me2 to expressed genes, we found that K7me1 and K7me2 do not mark poised RNAPII at PRCr genes marked by H3K27me3 and H2Aub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a and 2b</xref>) and that they are associated with promoters marked by H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2c</xref>).</p><p>To ascertain the distribution of the different CTD modifications at active genes, we plotted average occupancy profiles around transcription start sites (TSS) and transcription end sites (TES) of the 15% most and least expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). The novel CTD modifications K7me1 and K7me2 are sharply enriched at the TSS. These profiles are very similar to that of S7p while, in contrast, K7ac is more broadly localized up- and downstream of the TSS. Together with the observations that K7me1 and K7me2 mark hypophosphorylated RPB1 and that their abundance is insensitive to inhibition of RNAPII elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>), their specific enrichment at the promoters of active genes suggests that they mark the earliest stages of the transcription cycle at protein coding genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>K7me1 and K7me2 at gene promoters have negative contributions to mRNA levels</title><p>To explore the temporal sequence of CTD modifications during the transcription cycle and how they predict gene expression levels, we performed extensive correlation analyses between different RNAPII modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We focused on active genes using a refined group of genes which are (i) positive for S5p, S7p and S2p, (ii) expressed at the mRNA level, and (iii) negative for the repressive histone modifications H3K27me3 and H2Aub1. We also excluded overlapping genes and genes where the maximum peak of RNAPII (marked by unphosphorylated RNAPII using 8WG16 antibody) is not within 50 bp of the annotated TSS, yielding a group of 1564 active genes. We find that mRNA levels are most strongly correlated with S2p levels at TES of active genes (Spearman’s correlation coefficient 0.62), followed by promoter K7ac (0.55) and S7p (0.49; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). In contrast, the enrichment levels of K7me1 and K7me2 at gene promoters (which are highly self-correlated, 0.93) poorly correlate with S2p or mRNA (0.31–0.45), but highly correlate with modifications associated with initiation and early elongation (unphosphorylated RNAPII, S5p and S7p; 0.72–0.86). These correlations suggest that CTD-K7 methylation is related to RNAPII occupancy at gene promoters, and not directly to elongating complexes. Similar results are obtained with a more inclusive correlation analysis using the full list of non-overlapping active genes irrespective of 8WG16 peak distance to TSS (n = 4271), and including histone modifications and CpG content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11215.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Exploring the relationship between different CTD modifications using correlation and linear regression analyses.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Matrix of Spearman’s correlation coefficients between the levels of K7me1, K7me2, K7ac, 8WG16, S5p, S7p, S2p (2 kb window after TES), mRNA and mock ChIP control ordered according to increasing correlation with mRNA.

Surprisingly, we found that the partial correlation between K7me2 and S2p becomes zero after removing individual contributions of S5p or K7ac; similar results were obtained for K7me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Moreover, removing the contribution of S7p alone, or the combined contributions of S7p, S5p and K7ac, results in small negative correlations of K7me2 (and K7me1) with S2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>). These results suggest that K7me1 and K7me2 are anti-correlated with S2p, which in turn is highly correlated with K7ac. We also performed partial correlation analyses to test the individual contributions of S7p and K7ac to productive elongation after adjusting for the effects of their correlation with each other. Both marks maintain positive partial correlations with S2p levels (0.29 and 0.25 respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), suggesting that both S7p and K7ac have direct links to the extent of elongation.</p><p>In these pairwise correlation analyses, we began to dissect unexpected dependencies between different CTD modifications and how they relate to productive elongation. However, the most likely scenario is that several CTD modifications jointly contribute to expression levels. To further explore whether CTD modifications work together to promote productive transcription, we employed stepwise regression models to determine the CTD modifications that best predict elongation marked by S2p levels, for a given number of predictors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). These analyses confirm that S7p and K7ac are (i) the best predictors of S2p in single-variable models, (ii) the top combination of modifications in two-variable models, and (iii) always present in the top models when considering three, four and five modifications. Surprisingly, we also find that the promoter levels of K7me1 and K7me2 have significant negative contributions to the S2p elongation mark and mRNA expression, when considered together with the positively correlated variables S5p, S7p and/or K7ac. The dependencies identified were further tested using LASSO regression, which is more robust to artifacts (due to co-linearity in the predictors and over-fitting), in combination with a common cross-validation approach (minimum error plus one standard error criterion) to select the most parsimonious linear model in the LASSO path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We confirmed major positive contributions of S7p and K7ac to the levels of S2p (and mRNA), together with smaller (non-redundant) positive contribution of S5p, and negative contribution of K7me1. LASSO regression also shows that the levels of K7me1 and K7me2 are redundant, as K7me2 has a similar negative contribution to the minimal linear model found by LASSO analysis, when K7me1 is excluded from the variable set (not shown). Taken together, these results reinforce the observation that K7me1 and K7me2 are early transcription marks that are present at actively transcribed genes, but have negative contribution to mRNA levels, and raise the possibility that a balance between K7 methylation and K7 acetylation might define the extent of productive elongation at active genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>The balance between CTD-K7 methylation and acetylation correlates with gene expression</title><p>To investigate whether the balance between CTD-K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters could be predictive of gene expression, we calculated the ratio between K7me2 and K7ac and investigated how it relates to mature and nascent RNA levels.

We observe that unmodified S2, marked by 8WG16, shows a major peak centered on the TSS, as well as a secondary peak 140 bp downstream, and is independent of the K7me2/K7ac ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2a</xref> for the full list of non-overlapping active genes). K7me1 and K7me2 are enriched at the TSS-centered peak, but not at the secondary 8WG16 peak +140 bp downstream of the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>), which has previously been associated with promoter-proximal pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Quinodoz et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, K7ac expands downstream of the TSS up to +500 bp, especially at genes with low K7me2/K7ac ratios, but without specific enrichment at the secondary 8WG16 peak. S2p, which is a broad elongation mark enriched mostly at the TES, does not peak at the TSS. Interestingly, genes with the highest K7me2/K7ac ratios exhibit the lowest mRNA or nascent transcript expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c and 7d</xref>), and lowest S2p in the beginning of gene bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>) and after TES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). Inspection of single gene profiles confirms these general observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2b</xref>).</p><p>To explore the functionality of genes associated with higher or lower K7me/K7ac ratios, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). Interestingly, we found that genes with high K7me2/K7ac ratios are associated with GO terms that relate with <italic>negative regulation of translation</italic>, and kinase cascades, such as <italic>positive regulation of peptidyl-serine phosphorylation</italic>, of <italic>Rab GTPase activity</italic> and of <italic>JUN kinase activity</italic>. In contrast, genes with low K7me2/K7ac ratios are associated with GO terms that relate with housekeeping functions in mouse ES cells such as <italic>translation, DNA-dependent transcription, carbohydrate utilization</italic> and <italic>regulation of developmental process.</italic> These results suggest that the balance between K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters is important to define the extent of productive transcription at groups of genes with different biological functions, namely in the transition between initiation and elongation, which can contribute to fine-tuning gene expression levels.</p><p>Previous work reported transcriptional up-regulation of gene expression upon treatment of ES cells with histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karantzali et al., 2008</xref>), which has also been shown to induce global increase in CTD-K7acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schroeder et al., 2013</xref>). To test whether the genes with highest K7me2/K7ac ratios are more sensitive to up-regulation upon TSA treatment, we mined published microarray data from mouse ES cells treated with TSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karantzali et al., 2008</xref>). We find that TSA has different effects on the three groups of genes according to their K7me2/K7ac ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>). The genes with high K7me2/K7ac ratio are more likely to be upregulated (107/141 genes) upon TSA treatment, than downregulated (34/141 genes). Genes in the medium ratio group are equally likely to be upregulated (51/91 genes) or downregulated (40/91 genes). Finally, genes with the lowest ratio are most often downregulated (142/180 genes) than upregulated (38/180 genes). The effect of TSA on three groups of genes is significantly different (Fisher’s exact test; high versus low ratio: p &lt; 2.2x10<sup>–16</sup>). We observed a similar trend when we treated our ES cell line with TSA; genes with higher ratios tend to be upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To test the converse effect of K7ac depletion on the levels of K7me, we treated cells with P300 inhibitor C646, which was previously shown to deplete K7ac levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schroeder et al., 2013</xref>). We find that inhibition of P300 induces an average 1.7-fold increase in the global levels of K7me2 (ranging from 1.2 to 2.5-fold across replicates), whereas the levels of total RPB1 remain constant or are slightly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>). Levels of S7p also remain constant after P300 inhibition with C646 suggesting that K7ac and S7p contribute independently to productive elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>), an observation which is consistent with the non-redundant contributions of K7ac and S7p to S2p and mRNA levels found by partial correlation and stepwise regression analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest that the extent of productive transcription at active genes with similar RNAPII recruitment to their promoters, is modulated at the level of CTD-K7 modifications, with methylation being associated with less productive transcription, and K7 acetylation being most enriched at the highest expressed genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The expansion of the RPB1 CTD in repeat number and amino acid diversity has been associated with increased complexity in specific groups of organisms, including vertebrates and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corden, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang and Stiller, 2014</xref>). Larger CTDs are thought to accommodate larger protein complexes. Non-canonical CTD repeats have the potential to expand the diversity of post-translational modifications, resulting in more complex signaling through the CTD. Although there is increasing recognition that complex CTDs may have specific roles in the regulation of more complex developmental programs, gene structures or gene organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Litingtung et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Simonti et al., 2015</xref>), our understanding of CTD signaling remains extremely limited, particularly as we have not yet identified all CTD modifications.</p><p>A small number of modifications to non-canonical residues have been identified, and their importance for the expression of specific subgroups of genes revealed. In mammalian cells, methylation of a single CTD-R7 is involved in expression of snRNAs and snoRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sims et al., 2011</xref>). Acetylation of CTD-K7 residues, the most common non-canonical substitution, has been associated with inducible gene expression of EGF-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schroeder et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we show that CTD-K7 residues are mono- and di-methylated in mouse and human cells, and in the invertebrates <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Using murine cell lines with K7-to-S7 substitutions, we show that several CTD-K7 residues are simultaneously mono- and di-methylated, including a single K7 residue at repeat 35 of the murine CTD. Conservation of CTD-K7 methylation, and expansion of the number of methylated CTD-K7 residues from invertebrates to mammals, suggests functional relevance of this modification across taxa. Model systems characterized by K7 expansion (e.g. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kishore et al., 2009</xref>) further support the need for studying the extent of K7 modifications at RNAPII CTD.</p><p>We demonstrate that CTD-K7 mono- and di-methylation are associated with the earliest stages of transcription, are refractory to CDK9 inhibition using flavopiridol, and are distributed in discrete foci in the nucleoplasm of single cells. We mapped the genome-wide occupancy of K7me1 and K7me2 in mouse ES cells and find that they are highly enriched at the promoters of active genes. CTD-K7 methylation levels are highly correlated with promoter levels of unmodified S2, S7p, and S5p, but are uncoupled from mRNA expression and S2p abundance. In contrast, we find that CTD-K7 acetylation expands downstream of promoter regions into gene bodies, and highly correlates with S2p and mRNA levels.</p><p>One interesting aspect that emerges from studying CTD-K7 methylation and acetylation is that the two marks may compete for the eight available K7 residues at the CTD and thereby regulate gene expression levels. We observed that the ratio between K7me2 and K7ac at active promoters is inversely related to gene expression. Genes with similar promoter occupancy of RNAPII but which have higher levels of K7me2 relative to K7ac are significantly less expressed than genes that have higher levels of K7ac relative to K7me2. This suggests that a balance between K7 modifications fine-tunes gene expression levels.</p><p>Further studies are required to explore the enzymatic activities that methylate and demethylate CTD-K7 residues, as well as the readers of methylated CTD-K7. We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments of proteins associated with YFP-tagged RPB1 containing the wild-type CTD or the CTD bearing all K7-to-S7 mutations, followed by mass spectrometry, but this strategy failed to identify specific modifiers and readers (data not shown), suggesting that the interactions of RNAPII with CTD-K7 modifiers and/or readers may be transient and not easily captured by in vitro biochemical approaches.</p><p>The identification of modified CTD-K7 residues (K7me1, K7me2, K7me3 and K7ac) expands the repertoire of CTD interactors to proteins containing domains that recognize these marks, such as PHD finger, bromo-, chromo-, tudor- and MBT-domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biggar and Li, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamamoto et al., 2015</xref>). Cross-talk between K7 modification and other CTD modifications, such as phosphorylation, may also regulate the extent of factor recruitment. Future investigations of the CTD code should consider the contribution of K7 modifications to co-transcriptional gene regulation in development and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Mouse ES cell line OS25 (generated in the laboratory of Austin G.

The Spearman’s correlation coefficients were plotted as a matrix using the &quot;corrplot&quot; package in R and partial correlations calculated using the &quot;pcor&quot; function of &quot;ggm&quot; package. Traditional regression modeling using correlated predictor variables is difficult to interpret and hence we used a stepwise regression approach to better untangle the contributions of different CTD modifications. Typically, for a given number of predictor variables, we report the top five best models. Since CTD-S2p measured at 2 kb window after TES is the best predictor of mRNA amongst all CTD modifications and gene regions, we decided to study models that predict the levels of the S2p (instead of mRNA-seq) to avoid inclusion of another highly correlated variable. Model fitting was performed in R using the packages &quot;lm&quot; and &quot;leaps&quot;. Model ranking was based on both adjusted R<sup>2</sup> and Mallow’s C<sub>p</sub>.</p><p>To investigate whether the contribution of CTD modifications to S2p levels at 2 kb window after the TES, which were obtained through correlation and stepwise regression analyses, are due to co-linearity artifacts or over-fitting, we also employed the LASSO regression method implemented in the &quot;lars&quot; R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Efron, 2013</xref>). We used as predictor variables the promoter levels of 8WG16, S5p, S7p, K7me1, K7me2, K7ac, mock and CpG. A typical LASSO path is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>. We used cross-validation [minimum cross-validated mean standard error + 1 standard error] to select the optimal position along the path; typical models discard the mock and 8WG16 predictors.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen, and independently reviewed, by a Reviewing Editor and Jim Kadonaga as the Senior Editor.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>This study describes the characterisation of non-consensus CTD heptad repeat K7 residues on the C terminal portion of the RPB1 CTD. These lysine residues were previously shown to be subject to acetylation correlating with TSS associated pausing of EGF inducible genes. This study now shows that these same lysines can also be mono- or dimethylated based on the development of specific antibodies to these CTD modifications as well as the construction of variant CTDs with the 8 K7 reverted to consensus S7. Notably this S7 reverted mutant CTD still gives full cell viability using the α-amanitin resistant replacement construct in NIH-3T3 cells. This argues against a dominant function for the K7 heptads in these cells. Even so K7me1/2 clearly are present on promoters of active genes in ES cells based on ChIP-seq and this association is mainly unaffected by flavopiridol treatment arguing for their role in transcription initiation of many genes. Interestingly the K7acetyl CTD appears to also be involved in transcription elongation while K7me1/2 may be associated with the down-regulation of some genes. They also show that the K7me1/2 antibody isn't blocked by adjacent CTD serine phosphorylation, critical to allow the use of this antibody reagent.</p> <p>Overall, it is the opinion of the editors and reviewers that this study is interesting and appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, provided that additional experiments can be conducted to better establish the biological function of the K7 me1/2 marks and especially their interplay with K7 acetyl marks. In particular, we suggest the following experiments to improve your study.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>1) To further study the interplay between K7 acetyl and me1/2 marks, a careful analysis of the potential switch in these marks following gene induction should be revealing.</p> <p>2) Inhibition of HATs (i.e. K<sub>d</sub> of P300 or use of chemical HAT inhibitors) to deplete K7Acetyl marks may increase K7 me1/2 and thereby cause gene repression. This should be tested.</p> <p>3) Correlating K7me1/2 with low activity genes needs to be tested by looking at nascent RNA as well as steady state RNA. Looking at GR0-seq or chromatin-seq RNA to focus on transcription rather than mRNA levels would be informative.</p> <p>4) Some understanding of which factors recognise these CTD K7me1/2 marks is needed. For example IP followed by mass spectrometry could be informative. It could also be tested whether SET1, which is recruited by CTD S5P to methylate histone H3K4 at promoters, also methylates CTD K7me1/2.</p> <p>We recommend that you extend your analysis as indicated above. You should also be careful not to oversell the importance of K7me1/2 versus the dominant S2P and S5P marks. Use of &quot;correlate&quot; rather than &quot;depend&quot; might be better unless more definitive data is obtained.</p></body> </sub-article> <sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11215.061</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub> <body> <p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) To further study the interplay between K7 acetyl and me1/2 marks, a careful analysis of the potential switch in these marks following gene induction should be revealing.</italic></p> <p>We thank the reviewers for encouraging us to further investigate the interplay between K7me and K7ac in the context of gene expression changes. Without knowledge of the enzymatic activities that modulate K7me directly, we consulted published data about inhibitors that could modulate K7me/K7ac ratio, specifically Trichostatin A (TSA), previously shown to up-regulate global levels of K7ac (described in Schroeder et al., 2013).</p> <p>We took advantage of published microarray data for mouse ES cells treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA (Karantzali et al., 2008). In light of our suggestion that the K7me2/K7ac relates with the potential for gene expression, we hypothesized that genes with the highest K7me2/K7ac ratios would be most sensitive to the TSA-induced global increase in K7ac, and therefore more likely to be up-regulated upon TSA treatment.</p> <p>Integrating data from Karantzali et al. (2008) with our ChIP-seq data defining K7me-bound genes, we find that TSA has different effects on genes in the three K7me2/K7ac groups, with genes with a High K7me2/K7ac ratio being more likely to be up-regulated after TSA, in keeping with our hypothesis. This result is consistent with the observed relationship between K7me2/K7ac ratio and the extent of productive transcription at active genes, independently of the amount of RNAPII at gene promoters. We have included these results into the main text and added a new plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>. The same observation was confirmed by RT-PCR for a small group of genes in our stem cell line using a shorter time of inhibition (3h) to minimize indirect effects (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p> <p> <italic>2) Inhibition of HATs (i.e. K<sub>d</sub> of P300 or use of chemical HAT inhibitors) to deplete K7Acetyl marks may increase K7 me1/2 and thereby cause gene repression. This should be tested.</italic></p> <p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to interfere with P300, an acetyltransferase of CTDK7 residues, to further explore the interplay between CTD-K7 methylation and acetylation. The P300 inhibitor C646 reduces global CTD-K7 acetylation levels (Schroeder et al., 2013).</p> <p>To examine the effects of the reduction of K7ac, we treated mouse ES cells with C646 (3h, 30 μM). We first confirmed the efficiency of P300 inhibition by analyzing H3K9ac levels, and found that it decreases, as expected (Bowers E.M. et al., 2010 Chem. Biol. 17, 471-482). We then analyzed global levels of CTD-K7 methylation by western blotting, and found a reproducible increase in CTD-K7me2 after inhibition of P300 (ranging between 1.2-2.5 fold across 2 biological and 6 technical replicates). This result combined with the observation that K7ac decreases (Schroeder et al., 2013) points to a dynamic balance between methylation and acetylation at CTD-K7 residues, which supports our interpretation of the genome-wide analyses of CTD marks.</p> <p>The results of P300 inhibition on total RPB1, K7me2 and S7p were integrated in the manuscript, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref> and associated text. We have also tested the effect of C646 on K7me1 in a single biological replicate, and find that K7me1 levels are also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11215.025</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>P300 inhibition promotes a small increase in global levels of CTD-K7me2.</title><p>Mouse ES cells were treated with P300 inhibitor C646 (30 μM, 3h), before western blotting with antibodies specific for total RPB1, K7me1, K7me2 and S7p.

Interestingly, irrespectively of ratio, we observe a decrease in gene expression upon P300 inhibition in 4/6 genes tested. This suggests that irrespective of the K7ac level, its loss often results in gene downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2B</xref>). Alternatively, P300 inhibition may have other confounding effects, such as preventing histone acetylation and thereby repressing gene expression irrespectively of the K7me/ac ratio.

This experiment was inspired by the observations from the partial correlation analyses and stepwise regression that these marks have independent contributions to productive elongation. Interestingly, we observe that S7p levels do not change upon P300 inhibition, reinforcing the view that S7 phosphorylation is independent of K7 acetylation or methylation. This observation is consistent with our suggestion that both K7ac and S7 phosphorylation contribute independently to drive S2p levels, and points to a complex regulatory cascade that integrates K7 modifications with phosphorylation of serine residues. We agree with the reviewers that further studies will be necessary to fully understand the functional roles of K7me2 and K7me1 in gene regulation, and feel that the revised manuscript provides the starting point for in-depth dissection of such mechanisms.</p> <p><italic>3) Correlating K7me1/2 with low activity genes needs to be tested by looking at nascent RNA as well as steady state RNA. Looking at GR0-seq or chromatin-seq RNA to focus on transcription rather than mRNA levels would be informative.</italic></p> <p>We thank the reviewers for prompting us to investigate how the ratio between K7 methylation/acetylation relates with nascent RNA. We have analyzed nascent transcript data obtained from mouse ES cells, using published Global Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq) data from Jonkers et al. (2014). In agreement with the results obtained for mRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), we find that the K7me2/K7ac ratio is also anti-correlated with the amount of nascent transcription (Spearman’s correlation coefficient = – 0.31, p-value &lt; 2.2x10-16). These results reinforce the finding that K7 methylation is an early transcription mark and that the balance between K7 modifications helps fine-tune transcription. The GRO-seq levels across K7me/K7ac ratios have been included in an extra panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. Additionally, a boxplot summarizing GRO-seq values for the different K7 ratio quantiles and heatmaps of GRO-seq signal have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p> <p> <italic>4) Some understanding of which factors recognise these CTD K7me1/2 marks is needed. For example IP followed by mass spectrometry could be informative.</italic></p> <p>We agree with the reviewers that identifying readers of CTD K7me1/2 marks is a most pressing task, which we have tried in various ways. As alluded in the Discussion of the first version of the manuscript, we attempted to identify potential readers of K7 methylation, by performing mass spectrometry after immunoprecipitation of YFP-tagged wild-type (8K) RPB1 versus 0K mutant. However, this approach did not yield reproducible protein identifications in biological replicates, probably due to the fact that K7 methylation might be associated with a very small pool of RNAPII complexes found at the earliest stages of transcription. The staining of only small and discrete dots by IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) supports the notion that only a fraction of RNAPII complexes might be heavily marked by K7 methylation. Moreover, in such a global RNAPII pull-down, any differences in protein recruitment due to a specific CTD modification may be extensively diluted by all the proteins that bind to RNAPII abundant Serine modifications, irrespective of K7 modification.</p> <p>In response to the reviewers’ requests we attempted a peptide pull-down approach, where we designed a two-step peptide pull-down strategy to identify possible factors that recognise CTDK7me2, but not unmodified K7 peptides. Total protein extracts from mouse ES cells were first incubated with bead-immobilized peptides comprising unmodified non-canonical CTD sequence (3 heptapeptide repeats Y<sub>1</sub>-S<sub>2</sub>-P<sub>3</sub>-T<sub>4</sub>-S<sub>5</sub>-P<sub>6</sub>-K<sub>7</sub>). We hypothesized that this step should clear up mouse ES cell extracts from proteins that bind to non-canonical CTD sequence in the absence of K7 modifications. After this pre-clearing step, we performed pull-downs using beads carrying dimethylated K7 peptides (3 heptapeptide repeats Y<sub>1</sub>-S<sub>2</sub>-P<sub>3</sub>-T<sub>4</sub>-S<sub>5</sub>-P<sub>6</sub>-K7me2). Proteins obtained after the first and second pull-downs (two biological replicates each) were analyzed by LS-MS/MS.</p> <p>Among proteins that were specifically enriched on beads carrying unmodified K7 peptide, we found many proteins involved in early stages of transcription initiation (e.g., transcription factors Sox2 and Utf1, transcription initiation factor TFIID) or RNA processing (e. g., Serine/arginine-rich splicing factors Srsf1, Srsf5, Srsf7, Srsf 9; heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A/B, subunits of H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex, etc.). The second pull-down step with dimethylated K7 peptide did not reveal specific protein enrichment over mock background in two biological replicates. These results raise the possibility that CTDK7 methylation may act to prevent protein-protein interactions that occur in the earliest stages of transcription initiation (between transcription factors and RNAPII), which have to be disabled to allow CTD modifications that are compatible with productive elongation. Alternatively, it is possible that K7me1 and K7me2 act in concert with other CTD modifications, e.g. with S5p. In this light, more complex peptide pull-downs will be necessary where K7me2 presence/absence is combined with presence of S5p, S7p or other CTD modifications, to help understand what is the contribution of K7me2 to the ability of adjacent modifications to regulate co-transcriptional recruitment of machinery.</p> <p>We believe that more complex and unbiased screens for CTDK7 binders will be necessary to identify factors that can recognize CTDK7me marks.</p> <p><italic>It could also be tested whether SET1, which is recruited by CTD S5P to methylate histone H3K4 at promoters, also methylates CTD K7me1/2.</italic></p> <p>To test the potential role of SET1 complexes as CTD-K7 methylases, we performed western blots for K7me1 and total RPB1 on protein extracts from control mouse ES cells and conditional knockout ES cells for Setd1a and Setd1b (extracts kindly provided by Francis Stewart; Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitaet Dresden; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 3A</xref>). We do not observe consistent reduction in the levels of CTD- K7me1 in Setd1a-knockout cells and we observe only a minor depletion (15% max) in Setd1b-knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 3B</xref>). Normalization of CTD-K7me1 levels relative to total RPB1 was performed to correct for minor global changes in total RPB1 following SET knock out. Taken together, our results show that it is unlikely that SETD1A or SETD1B, individually, have major roles in K7 methylation.</p> <p>We also tested conditional knockout cells for H3K4 methyltransferases Mll1 and Mll2 (extracts kindly provided by Francis Stewart; data not shown). We find that Mll1 or Mll2 knockout is accompanied by a large global increase in total RPB1 levels, making it difficult to assess the effect on CTD methylation. These results argue for an intricate interplay between histone and RNAPII modifications.</p> <p>Mammalian cells have twelve H3K4 methyltransferases with redundant activity, and so it is possible that knockout of multiple enzymes may be needed to detect significant global changes in CTD-K7 methylation. Depletion of H3K4me3 levels may also have global effects on transcription that could influence the levels of CTD-K7 methylation independently of the direct effect of the methyltransferases. Alternative biochemical approaches such as CTD-K7 peptide pull down screens for methylases and/or isolation of CTD-K7 methylation activity from nuclear extracts might be needed for the identification of CTD-K7 methyltransferases. As these analyses are not conclusive at identifying K7me writers or readers we have not included these additional results in the manuscript.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11215.027</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Screen of CTD-K7 methylase activity in conditional KO mouse ES cells for H3K4 methyltransferases.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blotting was performed using protein extracts from mouse ES cells with conditional knockout for H3K4 methylase Setd1a or Setd1b for total RPB1 and K7me1 in 2 biological replicates.
