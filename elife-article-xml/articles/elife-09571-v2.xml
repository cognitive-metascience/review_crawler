(H3K9me2), which is essential for embryonic development. Here we show that genome-wide accumulation of H3K9me2 is crucial for postimplantation development, and coincides with redistribution of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)-dependent histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Loss of G9a or EZH2 results in upregulation of distinct gene sets involved in cell cycle regulation, germline development and embryogenesis. Notably, the H3K9me2 modification extends to active enhancer elements where it promotes developmentally-linked gene silencing and directly marks promoters and gene bodies. This epigenetic mechanism is important for priming gene regulatory networks for critical cell fate decisions in rapidly proliferating postimplantation epiblast cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09571.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09571.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09571.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genome contains full instructions for the development of the whole organism. The genes within the genome encode for all the proteins, but specific genes are selected to be active at the appropriate time. For this reason, there are mechanisms that can turn the genes on and off as and when required. One such mechanism is called methylation, in which a chemical group called a methyl tag is added to either the DNA or to histone proteins. DNA wraps around histone proteins to form a structure called chromatin. When histones are tagged with a methyl group, they become closely packed, and the resulting compaction of the chromatin around a gene inactivates that gene. For gene activation, the methyl tag is replaced by another tag called acetyl, which allows the chromatin to de-compact and become more accessible.</p><p>Soon after fertilisation, most of the methyl tags an embryo inherits from its parents are removed and a group of stem cells is established. An opposite process takes place once the embryo “nests” in the uterus. Two enzymes called G9a and EZH2 add methyl tags to specific residues on specific histones to regulate the expression of genes at the time when cells begin to decide what tissue to become. Zylicz et al. have now investigated how these enzymes contribute to the changes in chromatin packing that occur during early mouse development that is essential for the progression of normal development.</p><p>In mouse embryos that lacked the G9a enzyme, Zylicz et al. found that specific genes were inappropriately and prematurely activated early in development, including those generally involved in regulating ‘reproduction’ and 'cell death'. Similarly, embryos that lacked the EZH2 enzyme experienced the early and inappropriate activation of a different set of developmentally important genes. In addition, switches called enhancers control gene expression, and Zylicz et al. found that these regulators are also turned off by histone modifications made by the G9a enzyme. Thus, these findings provide important insights on how genes are regulated during a critical period of mouse development, when cells prepare to acquire their specific identities. This should lead to further work on the role of G9a in the hours after fertilisation; that is before the ‘programming’ events described here.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09571.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09571.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>epiblast</kwd><kwd>post-implantation</kwd><kwd>primed pluripotency</kwd><kwd>histone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT096738</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zylicz</surname><given-names>Jan J</given-names></name><name><surname>Günesdogan</surname><given-names>Ufuk</given-names></name><name><surname>Hackett</surname><given-names>Jamie A</given-names></name><name><surname>Cougot</surname><given-names>Delphine</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name><name><surname>Surani</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Günesdogan</surname><given-names>Ufuk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG44593</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zylicz</surname><given-names>Jan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Silencing of gene regulatory elements by modifications of DNA-bound proteins promotes the progression of early mouse development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Early mammalian development progresses through a series of landmark events that are regulated by transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms. Accordingly, establishment of the pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM) in E3.5 blastocysts is linked with global DNA hypomethylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hackett et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Subsequent development of the ICM leads to the formation of primed postimplantation epiblast cells by E5.5–6.25, which are poised to initiate lineage-specification. This developmental transition is accompanied by epigenetic programming, including genome-wide de novo DNA methylation, and potentially accumulation of histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) and redistribution of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borgel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marks et al., 2012</xref>). Methyltransferase enzymes, G9a (encoded by <italic>Ehmt2</italic>) and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), respectively, are responsible for the establishment of these chromatin modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Carroll et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tachibana et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2005</xref>).

Genome-wide DNA demethylation after fertilisation leads to an epigenetic basal state with low 5meC in ICM of blastocysts. Shortly after implantation, the epiblast cells undergo epigenetic programming, which includes de novo DNA methylation. By E6.25, the epiblast is primed for somatic development, while being competent for germline specification. Gastrulation follows at E6.75. Naïve ESCs, primed EpiLCs and EpiSCs represent different stages of in vivo development. ESCs grown in 2i/LIF medium resemble the ICM, while EpiLCs, induced from ESCs after 48 h in response to FGF2 and Activin A, are equivalent to epiblast. Their prolonged culture results in EpiSCs, which are reminiscent of the anterior primitive streak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kojima et al., 2014</xref>).

Similarly, the transition from naïve embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) is accompanied by rapid changes in enhancer usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buecker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Factor et al., 2014</xref>). These in vitro states are equivalent to the ICM, E6.25 epiblast and the primitive streak, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boroviak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kojima et al., 2014</xref>). Similar events likely occur in postimplantation epiblast in vivo when cell cycle shortening is linked with extensive transcriptional and epigenetic alterations, in preparation for key cell fate decisions, including specification of somatic and germline fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borgel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Snow and Bennett, 1978</xref>). The modifications of enhancers in this context may be of crucial importance for ensuring appropriate response to the ongoing developmental cues.</p><p>In this study, we have focused on the contribution of G9a-mediated H3K9me2 and EZH2-dependent H3K27me3 to early mouse development. We found that during the formation of postimplantation epiblast, there is a dramatic increase in H3K9me2 levels and a concomitant H3K27me3 redistribution. These events are necessary for repression of a distinct set of genes, including regulators of the germline, cell cycle, apoptosis, and development. The rapid acquisition of H3K9me2 extends to key enhancer elements, thereby reinforcing their repression. We propose that such epigenetic programming of epiblast primes a specific gene regulatory network, which is a necessary prerequisite for embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Epigenetic programming regulates growth and development of the embryo</title><p>First, we investigated the dynamics of epigenetic programming of repressive H3K9me2 during early mouse development. Immunofluorescence (IF) analysis of E3.5 and E5.5 embryos revealed significant enrichment of H3K9me2 in the epiblast of postimplantation embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,E</xref>). Accumulation of this modification, which is dependent on G9a and its binding partner G9a-like protein (GLP), coincides with increased levels of the enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D,F,G</xref>).

This revealed misregulation of 180 genes, of which 147 (~82%) are upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) (Log2[fold change[FC]]&gt;1.4, p-value&lt;0.05). Among the upregulated genes, ~27% of them were located on the X chromosome (p-value=1.6 × 10<sup>-15</sup>), notably in clusters of <italic>Xlr, Rhox</italic> and <italic>Mage-a</italic> genes. Consistent with the known functions of these clusters, we found significant enrichment of gene ontology (GO) terms linked to hematopoiesis, sexual reproduction, and regulation cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). To validate these findings, we analysed individual E6.25 epiblast cells by single cell real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). A significant proportion of <italic>Ehmt2<sup>−/−</sup></italic>cells showed upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor <italic>Cdnkn1a</italic>, and late germline markers <italic>Asz1</italic> and <italic>Rhox5</italic> but not <italic>Pou5f1</italic> (coding for OCT4) or <italic>Nanog</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). This indicates that, contrary to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamamizu et al., 2012</xref>), the phenotypic effects cannot be attributed to a delayed exit from naïve pluripotency. Furthermore, loss of G9a did not abrogate the establishment of a population of primordial germ cells (PGCs), as judged by the expression of AP2γ and OCT4, key germline regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). These observations show that G9a promotes growth of the embryo by repressing apoptotic and late germline genes, but it does not affect the exit from naïve pluripotency and establishment of the PGC lineage.</p><p>Next, we examined the consequences of loss of <italic>Ezh2</italic> and thus of the H3K27me3 modification, which likely undergoes significant redistribution during epiblast development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marks et al., 2012</xref>). For this reason, we performed RNA-seq on individual E6.25 epiblasts lacking EZH2 (<italic>Ezh2<sup>−/−</sup></italic>). We found upregulation of 165, and downregulation of 24 transcripts (Log2(FC)&gt;1.4, p-value&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>), among which were homeobox and gastrulation-related genes, including <italic>Hoxd13</italic> and <italic>Lefty2</italic>, but pluripotency regulators such as <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Pou5f1</italic> were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>). Importantly, we only found five significantly upregulated genes that were shared between <italic>Ehmt2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Ezh2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> embryos. Thus, G9a and EZH2 appear to stabilise silencing of distinct sets of germline, proliferation and developmental regulators, but neither of them has an effect on the pluripotency transcription programme in postimplantation embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 are associated with distinct repressive chromatin states in vivo</title><p>To understand the roles of H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 modifications during the transition from naïve pluripotency in the ICM of blastocysts to a primed pluripotent state in postimplantation embryos, we investigated the genome-wide distribution of these modifications. For this purpose, we optimised a low cell number chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (lcChIP-seq) protocol to analyse ~25,000 pregastrulation E6.25 epiblast cells in two biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ng, et al., 2013</xref>). We intersected this information with our RNA-seq data and with the published whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBSeq) datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seisenberger et al., 2012</xref>). This enabled us to generate a comprehensive overview of the epigenetic and transcriptional state of primed pluripotent epiblast cells in vivo.</p><p>The enrichment of H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 modifications in E6.25 epiblast is associated with low and high CpG content, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This is also the case in ESCs cultured in conventional media with serum (sESC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lienert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wen et al., 2009</xref>). By contrast, naïve ESCs grown in 2i/LIF (2i/LIF ESCs) show spreading of H3K27me3 outside the CpG dense loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marks et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, there is redistribution of H3K27me3 in E6.25 epiblast, relative to both naïve ESCs and possibly ICM in vivo. The association of H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 modifications on promoters is mutually exclusive, since only 0.3% of them are enriched for both marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, anticorrelation with Chi<sup>2</sup> p-value=0.0024). These differences are in line with H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 being linked to high and low 5-methylcytosine (5meC) levels, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Nonetheless, despite marking distinct chromatin regions, both H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 are linked to transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Notably, this gene repression is correlated with histone modification enrichment at promoters as well as in gene bodies. The H3K9me2 modification in gene bodies could impede transcriptional elongation, splicing, or activity of regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allo et al., 2009</xref>). Our evidence suggests that H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 modifications in vivo are linked to distinct repressive chromatin states. We confirmed this by means of self-organizing maps, which cluster promoters and gene bodies based on similarity of their cumulative epigenetic signature with respect to transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wehrens and Buydens, 2007</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09571.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>In vivo lcChip-seq from E6.25 epiblast reveals distinct epigenetic state of primed pluripotent cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Density contour plot showing the relationship between H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 enrichment.

First, we identified genes that become robustly activated or repressed in E6.25 epiblasts relative to ICM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) (Log2(RPKM)&lt;4, p-value&lt;0.05, Log2(FC)&gt;1). These genes generally corresponded to the expected developmental progression. For example, the transcripts that become silenced by the postimplantation stage (E6.25) are enriched for GO terms such as ‘blastocyst formation’ and ‘STAT (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription) signalling regulation’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These repressed genes are generally enriched for H3K9me2 or H3K27me3, especially when they have high or intermediate CpG density, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Moreover, consistent with global DNA hypomethylation of the ICM, there is transient expression of 5meC-sensitive germline genes at E3.5 that are subsequently repressed by E6.25. On the other hand, genes activated in E6.25 epiblast include ‘neural tube’ and ‘polarized epithelium’ genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Finally, both activated and repressed genes are enriched for regulators of transcription, embryonic development and metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This analysis reveals that the transcriptional changes between the naïve state associated with the ICM, and the primed state of postimplantation epiblast in vivo reflect the dramatic alterations in signalling, morphology, and metabolism occurring during development.</p><p>Next, we focused on genes that are repressed upon implantation and accumulate H3K9me2 or H3K27me3. GO term analysis revealed preferential acquisition of H3K27me3 on genes associated with transcriptional regulation, embryonic organ development, blastocyst formation, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). On the other hand, meiotic genes and those involved in immune responses were more likely targeted by H3K9me2. This analysis reveals that different functional pathways are inactivated via establishment of distinct epigenetic states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>EpiSCs show aberrant epigenetic state of germline genes</title><p>Despite being derived from postimplantation embryos, EpiSCs have reduced competence for the germline fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayashi and Surani, 2009</xref>). To investigate this, we directly compared the epigenetic states of E6.25 epiblast and EpiSCs. Global and metagene analysis revealed little differences in the distribution of H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 between E6.25 epiblast and EpiSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We reasoned that this might be associated with DNA hypermethylation of such elements since H3K27me3 mark is anti-correlated with 5meC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Indeed, our whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBSeq) of EpiSCs revealed a ~10% increase in global DNA methylation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). More specifically, promoters that had lost H3K27me3 acquired significantly more 5meC in EpiSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This observation indicates that EpiSC derivation leads to an aberrant epigenetic state, especially at germline promoters. Such stable silencing of these genes might contribute to a reduced competence of EpiSC for PGC fate.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09571.016</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>EpiSC show aberrant H3K27me3 distribution and DNA hypermethylation at germline genes.</title><p>(<bold>A,D</bold>) Distribution of H3K9me2 (<bold>A</bold>) and H3K27me3 (<bold>D</bold>) by metagene analysis in epiblast and EpiSCs.

To this end, we combined our lcChIP-seq and RNA-seq from E6.25 epiblast and mapped only unique reads to all mouse repeat loci with sufficient coverage. We found that ~15% (4.8 × 10<sup>5</sup>/3.3 × 10<sup>6</sup>) and ~18% (4.8 × 10<sup>5</sup>/2.6 × 10<sup>6</sup>) of repeats show significant H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 enrichment, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

However, 13/15 subfamilies repressed by G9a are notable as they correspond to endogenous retroviral elements (ERV), especially ERV-L and ERV-LMaLR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

Enhancers in these pluripotent cells have recently been identified based on enrichment of p300, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac (<italic>GSE56138, GSE57409</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buecker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Factor et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with programming of epiblast in vivo by H3K9me2 modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we found genome-wide accumulation of H3K9me2 in primed pluripotent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As H3K9me2 ChIP-seq measures only the relative enrichment, we have scaled it to indicate absolute quantities of histone modification. Our analysis revealed increased enrichment of H3K9me2 at genes upon exit from naïve pluripotency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This effect extends to many enhancers but significant H3K9me2 enrichment is observed at elements, which show DNA hypermethylation and cluster separately from poised H3K27me3-enriched elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). As with H3K27me3 modification, H3K9me2 is not a distinct enhancer mark, but rather is associated with larger domains within which regulatory elements reside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Interestingly, of all the enhancers that are active in 2i/LIF ESCs (p300, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac enrichment), ~12% (3884) gain H3K9me2 after 2 days of induction towards EpiLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), while only 3% (1117) become enriched for H3K27me3. Such elements are also enriched for H3K9me2 in E6.25 epiblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To validate these findings, we performed lcChIP-qPCR from ethanol or TAM treated <italic>Ehmt2<sup>F/−</sup></italic> EpiLCs expressing CreER. We confirmed that previously identified enhancer elements gain H3K9me2 in a G9a-dependent manner but active or H3K27me3 poised elements do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, acquisition of H3K9me2 occurs at distal regulatory elements, perhaps to direct or reinforce their inactivation.</p><p>Notably, H3K9me2-marked enhancers retain partial enrichment of active H3K27ac mark in EpiLCs, but exhibit near-complete H3K27ac loss in EpiSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistently, enhancer classification based on their epigenetic state has shown that ~57% (2212) of H3K9me2-enriched enhancers in EpiLCs still retain significant H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), which we further confirmed using lcChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). To exclude possible effects of cell population heterogeneity, we performed sequential ChIP-qPCR, which showed dual H3K9me2 and H3K27ac enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Such transient dual marking might indicate their continued responsiveness to signalling cues. In addition, H3K9me2-enriched elements showed no change in the active H3K27ac modification in EpiLCs lacking G9a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Taken together, our findings show that the repressive H3K9me2 and activating H3K27ac modifications transiently co-occur at enhancers during epiblast priming.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09571.026</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>H3K9me2 spreading to enhancers results in transient coenrichment with H3K27ac.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Density contour plots showing correlation between H3K27ac enrichments at enhancers in 2i/LIF ESCs versus EpiLC (left panels) or 2i/LIF ESCs versus EpiSC (right panels).

Therefore, we determined the correlation between H3K9me2 enrichment and enhancer activity by analysing the expression levels of enhancer RNAs (eRNA), which is a hallmark of active enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). We performed RT-qPCR for candidate robustly expressed eRNAs originating from regions enriched for H3K9me2 or H3K27me3. Upon EpiLC induction, such elements underwent robust transcriptional inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>). This is not a global effect because enhancers for genes, such as <italic>Otx2</italic> that are linked with primed pluripotency, show increased eRNA expression in EpiLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Thus, upon blastocyst implantation, H3K9me2 domains extend to active enhancers targeted for initiation of silencing, which accounts for the co-enrichment with H3K27ac.</p><p>To determine the functional relevance of H3K9me2 on enhancers, we used two <italic>Ehmt2<sup>F/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> ESC lines expressing CreER. Following TAM treatment, day 2 EpiLCs showed increased eRNA expression at 4 of 8 previously identified H3K9me2-marked enhancers, confirming that, in principle, this histone modification promotes repression of enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). This was specific to H3K9me2, since the H3K27me3-enriched and active regulatory elements were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Finally, we sought to validate our findings in vivo since multiple enhancer elements showed increased levels of H3K9me2 in the post-implantation epiblast. To this end, we isolated RNA from individual <italic>Ehmt2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ehmt2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> E6.25 epiblasts. After complementary DNA (cDNA) preamplification, we measured eRNA expression in these samples. We were able to detect 7/8 eRNAs associated with H3K9me2 marked enhancers, and 4 of these showed significant increase in expression in <italic>Ehmt2<sup>−/−</sup> </italic>embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Of all four control eRNAs detected in vivo, none showed altered expression. Taken together, these results reveal that G9a contributes to transcriptional and epigenetic repression of a subset of enhancers. These elements are typically active in naïve pluripotent cells but become repressed during priming of the epiblast.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We present here evidence that global H3K9me2 is established by a wave of G9a activity during early postimplantation development and contributes to establishing a crucial chromatin signature at promoters and gene bodies. Once acquired, H3K9me2 represses a specific subset of genes, including key regulators of proliferation and germline development. The enrichment of H3K9me2 additionally extends into domains that contain multiple enhancer elements, leading to their developmentally-linked inactivation. This uncovers an important role for G9a in setting the regulatory circuitry in the epiblast that enables the subsequent developmental programme to unfold.</p><p>A wave of heterochromatization occurs during early postimplantation development that contributes to the establishment of a specific ‘primed’ epigenetic state in epiblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borgel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gilbert et al., 2010</xref>). While both G9a and PRC2 are involved in this epigenetic programming process, we found limited overlap between H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 targets or, indeed, between genes that were upregulated in <italic>Ezh2<sup>−/−</sup></italic>and <italic>Ehmt2<sup>−/−</sup> </italic>mutant embryos. This indicates that they likely have independent functions, as observed in sESC, which is unrelated to the previously reported G9a-dependent recruitment of PRC2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lienert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mozzetta et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, prior to gastrulation, H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 generate distinct repressive chromatin states, linked to DNA hyper- and hypomethylation, respectively. These modifications therefore act as complementary systems to target specific regulatory pathways, ensuring that they become repressed during the exit from naïve pluripotency. Following PGC specification, however, there is germline-specific resetting of the epigenome, including the erasure of H3K9me2 and DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hajkova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2007</xref>), which allows for the expression of germline-specific genes that have been silenced by these epigenetic modifications.</p><p>We have characterised the epigenetic landscape of the in vivo primed pluripotent cells relative to its in vitro model represented by EpiSCs. It is noteworthy that the two cell types show highly similar distribution of H3K9me2, but EpiSCs globally gain DNA methylation and lose H3K27me3 from germline-related genes, which might contribute to the reduced competence of EpiSCs towards PGCs. Indeed, stable promoter DNA methylation has been previously reported for two germline genes, <italic>Stella</italic> and <italic>Rex1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayashi and Surani, 2009</xref>). Thus we show that in vitro derivation and self-renewal promotes aberrant accumulation of epigenetic modifications, as is the case with sESC and hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ludwig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weidner et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our study on a transient and highly dynamic state of the pregastrulation epiblast reveals an unexpected level of epigenetic regulation. It is established that enhancer elements acquire H3K4me1 and H3K27ac coincident with their developmental activation at this point, while others become poised and enriched for H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buecker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Factor et al., 2014</xref>). We additionally reveal that G9a is involved in the rapid switching of epigenetic states at regulatory elements by depositing H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The accumulation of H3K9me2 at enhancers is mostly linked with transcriptional repression, although they transiently retain significant levels of H3K27ac. Thus, we show uncoupling of histone acetylation from the transcriptional state, which indicates that loss of an active epigenetic signature is often secondary to enhancer inactivation. Such contrasting epigenetic marks at enhancers might confer responsiveness and plasticity of cells to signalling cues. This coincides with the rapidly unfolding developmental programme in postimplantation epiblast, resulting in potential for diverse cell fate decisions. In line with this role, the loss of H3K9me2, as seen at an oestrogen-induced enhancer in breast cancer cells, promotes reactivation of the apoptosis regulator <italic>bcl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perillo et al., 2008</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09571.030</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for G9a-mediated enhancer inactivation.</title><p>Distal regulatory elements active in ICM are typically associated with H3K4me1 and H3K27ac enrichment (green) as well as eRNA expression.

Read counts per ENSEMBL transcript were obtained by HTseq-count (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anders et al., 2014</xref>). Transcript annotations were based on ENSEMBL Release 74. Replicates were evaluated, read counts per transcript were normalised, and analysis of differential expression was performed by using the R Bioconductor DESeq package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>). Normalised read counts were further divided by transcript length (per kB). To account for expression heterogeneity between embryos, the expression in each KO embryo was compared with all control samples. The p-values for each of the three or four comparisons were combined by a Fisher’s combined probability test and set at p&lt;0.05 (Fisher, 1925). To identify biologically relevant results, we set a minimal expression in each replicate of the upregulated sample at Log2(RPKM)&gt;1.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The three reviewers found your manuscript very interesting. However, there was consensus that currently the manuscript lacks coherence and would greatly benefit from removing parts of the data and strengthening other aspects.</p><p>Below, I summarize the main discussion points raised during the review process that we would like you to address upon revision.</p><p>In particular, we suggest that you could consider removing parts from the early embryo due to lack of functional relevance.</p><p>The reviewers were excited by the ChIP-seq data from epiblast, but felt that additional validations (see comments from Reviewer 2) and analyses (point 4 of Reviewer 3) would maximize the impact of the study.</p><p>There was also a suggestion to remove the p53 where indirect effects cannot be ruled out. However, it was also discussed that one value of the p53 ChIP result from G9a KO is demonstration that G9a loss enhances p53 binding at select enhancers, without appreciably affecting H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The reviewers suspect that this may be an indirect consequence of either increased accessibility at enhancers associated with loss of H3K9me2 (which would be an interesting phenotype supporting role of G9a in enhancer repression) or simply of an increased cellular stress resulting in increase in p53 stability (perhaps less interesting). If combined with some accessibility data and eRNA expression analysis at matching enhancers (none of the enhancers at which eRNAs were analysed corresponds to the p53-bound enhancers from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), the p53 ChIP result could be used to strengthen the conclusions on the role of G9a in regulating enhancer function – which currently needs further work.</p><p>We also highly encourage you to further strengthen the computational analysis and specificities required. This should help in addressing a number of points raised by the three reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In the current study, Zylicz and colleagues explore the role of G9a and EZH2 during early embryonic development encompassing the 2-cell stage and early blastocysts. The quantity and technical aspects of this study are very impressive. Each of the experiments provides important insights into the function of G9a and EZH2 in priming gene regulatory networks in epiblast cells. However, the experiments are disjointed and do not flow together well to make one coherent story. There is sufficient data here to produce two or more coherent stories exploring individual early findings reported by the authors. For instance, data from the 2-cell study and the transposons experiments can be removed to improve the flow of the paper as they detract from the main message of the study.</p><p>1) The H3K9me2 expression levels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, compared to GLP and G9a expression levels in Figure 1–figure supplement 1 are standardized to different time points. In addition, different time points are presented (i.e. E3.5 versus E4.5; E5.5 versus E6.5). Is this the reason that expression of H3K9me2 and G9a/GLP does not directly correlate? The authors should standardize the expression to the same stage if they wish to draw comparisons.</p><p>2) It is not clear why the samples from the G9a M/Z and M/+ are pooled in the analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and Figure 1-figure supplement 2E? In other panels the data is separated. Transcription of some genes from the zygotic genome has been reported as early as the 2 cell stage and hence, these data should be separated. This may also reduce the large variation seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and Figure 1–figure supplement 2E.</p><p>3) During the RNA seq. analysis, why was a fold change cut-off of log2(1.6) used? Furthermore, was a false discovery rate, which is more commonly used, applied to the data? How can the authors rule out that all direct targets of G9a are changed by at least log2(1.6)?</p><p>4) In the <italic>G9a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> versus control RNA seq., G9a mRNA does not appear to be reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2–source data 1</xref>). Is there a reason for this discrepancy?</p><p>5) What was the cut-off for significance in the <italic>Ezh2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> RNA Seq. dataset? It is not clear in the paper. Is it the same as the <italic>G9a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> RNA Seq? The authors need to make this information clear.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> shows only a small number of transcriptional changes despite H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 being wide spread. Does the correlation change if the arbitrary log2 cut-off of 1.6 is changed? Deletion of chromatin modifying proteins does not always result in very large changes in the expression of target genes.</p><p>7) The authors need to further address the discrepancy in OCT4 level between their study and Yamamizu et al., 2012. It seems odd that there is such a large incongruity between the two studies. Only one line is provided in the Discussion on this topic and it does not sufficiently propose any reasons for such discrepancy. Given that lack of changes in pluripotency is central to the conclusions of this paper, the authors should undertake staining for OCT4 in <italic>G9a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>embryos and controls.</p><p>8) The authors show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> that p21 is upregulated in a subset of <italic>G9a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>samples, which is consistent with increased H3K9me2 at the p21 locus during ESC differentiation. The authors claim that these observations support their view that the delayed development of <italic>G9a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos is related to increased apoptosis and/or reduced proliferation, and not retainment of pluripotency. The authors have provided little evidence for this. The authors should validate their proposal in vivo by undertaking BrdU incorporation studies and phospho-H3 staining for proliferation, as well as TUNEL or active caspase-3 staining to analyse cell death.</p><p>9) In addition, can the authors exclude that the expressions of important developmental genes are normal at E6.5? For instance, a very high level of Bmp4 is observed in <italic>G9a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> E6.25 epiblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which could be one explanation for developmental defects. In situ hybridizations for developmentally important genes including Bmp4 need be carried out.</p><p>10) In the E6.25 RNA Seq. data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2–source data 1</xref>), p21 mRNA is not reduced in <italic>G9a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> epiblasts. Can the authors explain its absence?</p><p>11) Since the authors state that a significant proportion of genes affected by G9a deletion are involved in germ line specification, the authors need to show whether germ cells are affected. Are PRDM14 and Blimp1 expression patterns normal in <italic>G9a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos? If pluripotency is indeed unaffected, while germ line specification is presumably impaired, can the authors show normal alkaline phosphatase staining in <italic>G9a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos and not in germ cells?</p><p>12) The authors claim that 2i ESCs as primitive ectoderm (PrE). In contrast, the works from Austin Smith's lab and others (Van Oosten et al., 2012 for example) have shown that the ESC state in 2i resembles the naïve state of the epiblast. Why do the authors consider the 2i state to be similar to the PrE? Rather, ESCs in standard ESC medium (with serum) are considered to be more like E4.5 PrE.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Please note that I cannot judge the stringency of the bioinformatics pipelines used in depth, and therefore my comments are focused mostly on the biology of the questions addressed and the conclusions drawn, rather than in the stringency of the computational side. I do find, in general, that the computational data is not always presented in a manner for a broad readership, and some points below suggest improvements towards this direction.</p><p>Although a few of the observations documented are not particularly new, the manuscript by Zylics and colleagues builds on former data on Ezh2 and G9a in regulating development around implantation. The strongest point in, my view, is the analysis of epiblast cells in vivo at the transcriptional level and at the chromatin level (K9me2 and K27me3) genome wide. The experiments are carefully executed and in most instances the conclusions drawn are supported by the data presented.</p><p>I have, however, mixed feelings about the presentation and the flow of the manuscript. It does not come out as a single, solid message, and is diluted with many pieces of data, some of which I find irrelevant for the main conclusions and I would therefore suggest to remove these parts, which encompass all the pre-implantation data (which is not strong enough), as well as the p53 data at the end, which in the end are not very strong. This would allow the authors to concentrate in a less dense manner, on the main messages of the paper based on the transitions between naïve/primed and epics states.</p><p>I have some comments on the ChIP protocol validation that require in my view, additional experimental work, and some comments to draw to the phrasing and statistics throughout the manuscript, as well as clarification or additional computational analysis.</p><p>The 'pregastrulation conclusion’ (paragraph four of the Discussion) is reasonable, but the preimplantation work is confusing, and poorly documented in comparison with the peri-implantation and in vitro data (e.g. statement of 2C specific gene regulation by G9a is based on only 3 genes) and does not add much to the manuscript and instead deviates the focus of attention from the pre-gastrulation cell fate transitions.</p><p>All figures lack description of quantification of fluorescence intensities, as well as the N numbers for IF and quantifications. The only description is 'fluorescence intensity was normalised to DAPI', but the authors state that they used 'quantitative immunofluroescence' to analyse levels. Please add a better description and/or controls for this.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>: Why is ChIP enrichment mostly negative – it suggests rather a depletion of mark? Is there any enrichment at all e.g. for K9me2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>? The same applies for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref> C, in which H3k9me2 'enrichment' is again below 0.</p><p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and 3D</xref>, the authors conclude that K9me2 and K27me3 are on different regions. However, the data presented do not fully support these conclusions, both from analysis in 3B and from the self-organising maps: while there are some regions that are not overlapping, there are clearly other regions that do show overlap. The shape of the line in the fitting in 3B also suggests this interpretation. Since this analysis was not presented with statistics, nor with a comparison of e.g. active promoters or full genome data for 3B, I believe that the authors are not in the position to conclude what they conclude, so this part needs reinterpretation.</p><p>Regarding my validation point above, the only validation presented for the lcChip-seq is a comparison of Pearson figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>) based on clustering of independent replicates – what if replicates are all poor showing similar background enrichment? The protocol would need validation to assess a comparison in magnitude of enrichment to standard protocol. I assume the authors have some material left to run a couple of PCR reactions, can they estimate by ChIP-PCR the differences in order of magnitude with the lcChIP in EpiSC versus the 'normal' EpiSC ChIP protocol?</p><p>I do not see much significance/added value on the p53 data (in the subsection “G9a Mediates Efficient Enhancer Inactivation”), and it only adds more 'density' in the manuscript, which is quite dense. Specially, how relevant (biologically and statistically) is the &quot;15%&quot; of H3K9me2 and H3K27ac enhancers being bound by p53?</p><p>The analysis of 'proximity' of eRNA is not presented adequately, nor it is known what 'proximity' is? In kb? This cannot be inferred from the graphs presented. Can the authors do an enrichment analysis of eRNA expression (on the y axis) relative to specific distances of genes (on the x axis, in kb). The conclusion on page 15 on H3K9me2 domains 'extend to active enhancers targeted for silencing, which accounts for coenrichment with H3K27ac' implies a causal relationship for which there is no data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this study Zylicz et al. set out to explore the deposition and function of repressive histone marks such as H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 during early embryonic development. The authors generated embryos deficient for G9a or Ezh2 methyltransferases and examined their gene expression profile using single epiblast RNA-seq at day E6.25, prior to the overt phenotypic manifestations. To determine which genomic loci are marked by repressive histone methylation marks in vivo, the authors performed low cell number ChIP-seq assays for H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 in E6.25 epiblasts. Strikingly, for either mark, an exceedingly small subset of marked genes is perturbed upon loss of respective enzyme, suggesting either existence of multiple redundant silencing mechanisms or these methylation events being a secondary consequence of repression. Furthermore, the set of genes that are aberrantly upregulated are non-overlapping between the two different knock outs and show therefore that in the epiblast H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 are involved in repression of different set of genes. The authors note that many intergenic enhancer regions are marked by H3K9me2 in the epiblast, and they follow up upon these observations using the in vitro cellular models. They conclude that G9a mediates efficient inactivation of a subset of enhancers, particularly those bound by p53.</p><p>This study contains many interesting observations, tackles an important biological question and is generally well-executed. However, it also suffers from weaknesses that dampen my overall enthusiasm, but which could be fairly easily addressed.</p><p>1) The authors claim that a subset of enhancers gains H3K9me2 in epiblast, and that this is associated with their inactivation during transition to primed pluripotency. Several issues need to be clarified here:</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, heatmaps of H3K9me2 from ESC (to show that these loci indeed gain H3K9me2 during differentiation) and 6.5 epiblasts (to show that similar findings can be observed in vivo) should be included. Furthermore, how would these heatmaps look if authors chose as their analysed regions enhancers that are active in EpiLC/EpiSC, but not in ESC? What would be the corresponding profiles (if any) of H3k9me2 status at these regions?</p><p>2) A substantial weakness of the study is that despite the authors having all the necessary reagents in hand, the data pertaining to the functional impact of G9a on enhancer activity is limited to just a few examples, and not coherent ones either (e.g. enhancers shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> don't overlap those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G-F</xref>). Given that the role of G9a in enhancer inactivation is one of the central novel claims of the paper, at the very least the eRNA expression analysis from the <italic>G9a<sup>F/–</sup></italic>CreER EpiLCs treated with EtOH or TAM should be done systematically, across all H3K9me2 marked enhancers, and in comparison to enhancers unmarked by H3K9me2, but containing similar enrichment levels of H3K27ac. The relationship between enhancers with G9a-dependent eRNA expression and transcriptional changes at neighboring genes should be determined. To what extent transcriptional changes observed in G9a KO cells can be explained by H3K9me2/eRNA changes at nearby enhancers?</p><p>3) Increased p53 binding upon loss of G9a may be an indirect consequence of the defect in enhancer repression, perhaps resulting in the increased enhancer accessibility- did the authors consider looking at chromatin accessibility measurements such as ATAC, DNase or FAIRE? Such data could in fact strengthen the conclusions on the functional impact of G9a on enhancer activity, regardless of the specific impact on p53.</p><p>4) The authors generate valuable H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq datasets from epiblast cells of E6.25 embryos, but I feel they missed the opportunity to provide a deeper comparison of their results with the H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 patterns reported from the in vitro cellular models such as EpiLC or EpiSC. What are the major similarities and differences in patterns? A systematic (and to whatever extent possible, quantitative) comparison of H3K9me2 patterns across the genome in different cellular states would not only be broadly interesting for the community, but also relevant for the authors' own conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09571.048</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The three reviewers found your manuscript very interesting.

In this context we reveal that H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 target specific pathways independently. Finally, accumulation of H3K9me2 in EpiLCs enhancers is also seen in the in vivo epiblast.</p><p><italic>There was also a suggestion to remove the p53 where indirect effects cannot be ruled out. However, it was also discussed that one value of the p53 ChIP result from G9a KO is demonstration that G9a loss enhances p53 binding at select enhancers, without appreciably affecting H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The reviewers suspect that this may be an indirect consequence of either increased accessibility at enhancers associated with loss of H3K9me2 (which would be an interesting phenotype supporting role of G9a in enhancer repression) or simply of an increased cellular stress resulting in increase in p53 stability (perhaps less interesting). If combined with some accessibility data and eRNA expression analysis at matching enhancers (none of the enhancers at which eRNAs were analysed corresponds to the p53-bound enhancers from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), the p53 ChIP result could be used to strengthen the conclusions on the role of G9a in regulating enhancer function – which currently needs further work.</italic> </p><p>We show that loss of G9a in EpiLCs leads to increased activation of p53 globally as judged by western blot for phopho-p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>), resulting in increased p53 stability upon loss of G9a. For this reason, we have removed the data on the recruitment of p53 to G9a bound enhancers as it is most likely an indirect effect. The enhancer experimental part now shows a consistent panel of 13 enhancers that were analysed with respect to eRNA expression dynamics. We show H3K9me2 accumulation, H3K27ac enrichment, sequential ChIPqPCR and eRNA misexpression in G9a mutant cells in vitro and in vivo. The strength of this comprehensive analysis is that it looks directly at the epigenetic and transcriptional state of enhancers rather than relying on a possible erroneous assumption that enhancers regulate the nearest genes. Nevertheless, we extracted the expression of nearby genes from E6.25 epiblasts and can confirm that 3/8 genes in proximity of H3K9me2 marked enhancers are indeed upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 2</xref>).

The quantity and technical aspects of this study are very impressive. Each of the experiments provides important insights into the function of G9a and EZH2 in priming gene regulatory networks in epiblast cells. However, the experiments are disjointed and do not flow together well to make one coherent story. There is sufficient data here to produce two or more coherent stories exploring individual early findings reported by the authors. For instance, data from the 2-cell study and the transposons experiments can be removed to improve the flow of the paper as they detract from the main message of the study.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the supportive comments. We have now removed both preimplantation experiments as well as p53 ChIP. Instead we concentrate on in-depth analysis of H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 during the transition from naïve to primed pluripotent cells.</p><p><italic>1) The H3K9me2 expression levels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, compared to GLP and G9a expression levels in Figure 1–figure supplement 1 are standardized to different time points. In addition, different time points are presented (i.e. E3.5 versus E4.5; E5.5 versus E6.5). Is this the reason that expression of H3K9me2 and G9a/GLP does not directly correlate? The authors should standardize the expression to the same stage if they wish to draw comparisons.</italic> </p><p>We have now removed most of the data on preimplantation IF staining and instead concentrated on two crucial stages (E3.5 and E5.5), which is now part of updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Original inconsistencies occurred because different antibodies showed excessive background staining in the visceral endoderm. To circumvent this problem, we had to remove visceral endoderm at E5.5 for staining with anit-G9a antibodies.</p><p><italic>2) It is not clear why the samples from the G9a M/Z and M/+ are pooled in the analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and Figure 1–figure supplement 2E? In other panels the data is separated. Transcription of some genes from the zygotic genome has been reported as early as the 2 cell stage and hence, these data should be separated.

There is some biological variability between the control embryos as well as between KO embryos. We take that into account by using pairwise comparison between individual epiblasts to make sure that a minimum threshold is met in all control vs KO comparisons. Indeed, setting thresholds is to some extent arbitrary but is commonly used in transcriptional analysis. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> of the Response document, we show estimated rate of false positives in relation to the threshold used. This rate has been estimated based on the biological and technical variability observed between control samples. At a Log2(1.4) the ratio of identified genes versus false positives reaches 0.01.

It seems odd that there is such a large incongruity between the two studies. Only one line is provided in the Discussion on this topic and it does not sufficiently propose any reasons for such discrepancy. Given that lack of changes in pluripotency is central to the conclusions of this paper, the authors should undertake staining for OCT4 in</italic> G9a<sup>-/-</sup> <italic>embryos and controls.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that IF would be relevant. We now show that GFP signal from Oct4-GFP does not show any significant differences between <italic>G9ac<sup>ntr</sup></italic> and KO epiblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2B</xref>). More importantly we focused on NANOG, which at E6.5 is already substantially down-regulated in the anterior epiblast (Osorno et al., 2012). Our whole-mount staining revealed comparable levels of NANOG in G9aKO and <italic>G9ac<sup>ntr</sup></italic> epiblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> A).</p><p><italic>8) The authors show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> that p21 is upregulated in a subset of</italic> G9a<sup>-/-</sup><italic>samples, which is consistent with increased H3K9me2 at the p21 locus during ESC differentiation. The authors claim that these observations support their view that the delayed development of</italic> G9a<sup>-/-</sup> <italic>embryos is related to increased apoptosis and/or reduced proliferation, and not retainment of pluripotency. The authors have provided little evidence for this. The authors should validate their proposal in vivo by undertaking BrdU incorporation studies and phospho-H3 staining for proliferation, as well as TUNEL or active caspase-3 staining to analyse cell death.</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> (C, D) we now show whole-mount IF staining against cleaved caspase 3 and Ki67. By carefully quantifying IF signal from 5 <italic>G9a<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and 5 <italic>G9a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos we confirm increased rate of apoptosis in E6.5 mutant embryos. Indeed we also observed increased numbers of non-proliferative Ki67+ve cells. This indicates that loss of G9a results in increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation.</p><p><italic>9) In addition, can the authors exclude that the expressions of important developmental genes are normal at E6.5? For instance, a very high level of Bmp4 is observed in</italic> G9a<sup>-/-</sup> <italic>E6.25 epiblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which could be one explanation for developmental defects. In situ hybridizations for developmentally important genes including Bmp4 need be carried out.</italic> </p><p>In this study we show that loss of G9a leads to developmental delay, reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis. We report that there is no delay in the exit from pluripotency but there is upregulation of multiple developmentally relevant genes as well as some repeat elements. We have added observations on Nanog and Oct4-GFP, which remain unchanged in mutant embryos. Unfortunately while it is not possible to validate all RNAseq findings, we have however undertaken the task of doing so for some germline and proliferation genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 E, F</xref>). A potential increase in Bmp4 could contribute to the phenotype, but it is perhaps equally or more likely that epigenetic changes associated with the enhancers and promoters have important consequences for changes in gene expression. In our opinion, in situ hybridizations would not provide further insights on the relative contributions of signalling and cell autonomous changes to the phenotype. This aspect however is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p><italic>10) In the E6.25 RNA Seq. data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), p21 mRNA is not reduced in</italic> G9a<sup>-/-</sup> <italic>epiblasts. Can the authors explain its absence?</italic> </p><p>p21 is also called <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> it is under this name in the source data file and is indeed significantly up-regulated. We have updated the name for <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> in the whole manuscript.</p><p><italic>11) Since the authors state that a significant proportion of genes affected by G9a deletion are involved in germ line specification, the authors need to show whether germ cells are affected. Are PRDM14 and Blimp1 expression patterns normal in</italic> G9a<sup>-/-</sup> <italic>embryos? If pluripotency is indeed unaffected, while germ line specification is presumably impaired, can the authors show normal alkaline phosphatase staining in</italic> G9a<sup>-/-</sup> <italic>embryos and not in germ cells?</italic> </p><p>Here we show that loss of G9a results in upregulation of multiple late germline cell fate regulators. However RNAseq experiments showed no difference with respect to <italic>Prdm14</italic> or <italic>Blimp1</italic>. Based on this observation, we posit that germline specification will remain unaffected. To address this issue, we collected severely delayed <italic>G9a<sup>-/-</sup> ΔPE-Oct4-GFP+ve E8.5</italic> embryos. Whole-mount staining clearly showed a small population of <italic>GFP<sup>+ve</sup></italic> and <italic>AP2g<sup>+ve</sup></italic> putative PGCs at the base of allantois (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> A). The numbers of PGCs were however reduced in the mutants, probably because of their severe developmental delay. Thus, loss of G9a is compatible with germline specification despite premature expression of late germline markers.</p><p><italic>12) The authors claim that 2i ESCs as primitive ectoderm (PrE). In contrast, the works from Austin Smith's lab and others (Van Oosten et al., 2012 for example) have shown that the ESC state in 2i resembles the naïve state of the epiblast. Why do the authors consider the 2i state to be similar to the PrE? Rather, ESCs in standard ESC medium (with serum) are considered to be more like E4.5 PrE.</italic> </p><p>A recent study from Austin Smith’s lab shows that 2i/LIF ESC might be more similar to primitive ectoderm of E4.5 embryos (Boroviak, 2014). However there is no direct genome-wide comparison between 2i/LIF ESCs, and different in vivo stages. Since there is also a lack of rigorous terminology in the field, we have decided to consistently use the most frequently used term: ICM (inner cell mass).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>[…] I have, however, mixed feelings about the presentation and the flow of the manuscript, which does not come out as a single, solid message, and is diluted with many pieces of data, some of which I find irrelevant for the main conclusions and I would therefore suggest to remove these parts, which encompass all the pre-implantation data (which is not strong enough), as well as the p53 data at the end, which in the end are not very strong. This would allow the authors to concentrate in a less dense manner, on the main messages of the paper based on the transitions between naïve/primed and epics states.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for a positive feedback about the quality of work presented and its interest for a broad readership. We have addressed a number of issues to make the manuscript more coherent. In particular, we have removed the work on preimplantation G9a mutant embryos as well as the p53-related work, and concentrated our attention on the transition between naïve and primed pluripotency in vivo. In this respect we have included an analysis of E3.5 ICM RNAseq. This allowed us to identify specific pathways repressed upon implantation and the epigenetic mechanisms involved in this process. We now show that regulators of metabolism and transcription are preferentially targeted for H3K27me3 accumulation. On the other hand H3K9me2 is linked to regulators of meiosis. We also provide comparison between in vivo epiblast and EpiSCs on the epigenetic level. This revealed substantial accumulation of DNA methylation in EpiSCs especially at germline related promoters, concomitantly with the loss of H3K27me3. This observation is consistent with the diminished competence of EpiSCs for PGC fate.</p><p><italic>The 'pregastrulation conclusion’ (paragraph four of the Discussion) is reasonable, but the preimplantation work is confusing, and poorly documented in comparison with the peri-implantation and in vitro data (e.g. statement of 2C specific gene regulation by G9a is based on only 3 genes) and does not add much to the manuscript and instead deviates the focus of attention from the pre-gastrulation cell fate transitions.</italic> </p><p>We have decided to remove all work on preimplantation G9a mutants from this manuscript.</p><p><italic>All figures lack description of quantification of fluorescence intensities, as well as the N numbers for IF and quantifications. The only description is 'fluorescence intensity was normalised to DAPI', but the authors state that they used 'quantitative immunofluroescence' to analyse levels. Please add a better description and/or controls for this.</italic> </p><p>This is now addressed in the revised manuscript. Every IF experiment was performed in at least 3 biological replicates, which is clearly stated in figure legends, including the numbers of embryos analysed, and how the signal was measured. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 E-G</xref>, signal from individual ICM/Epiblast nuclei was measured and normalised to the intensity of DAPI signal. Such measurements were done on individual z-stacks in at least 3 embryos and 20 cells per developmental stage.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>: Why is ChIP enrichment mostly negative – it suggests rather a depletion of mark? Is there any enrichment at all e.g. for K9me2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>? The same applies for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref> C, in which H3k9me2 'enrichment' is again below 0.</italic> </p><p>(This data is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 A and B</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>.)</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this scale might be misleading. However, H3K9me2 does not form peaks but rather occupies large domains of enrichment where gene bodies and promoters are generally depleted of the mark compared to intragenic regions. Thus all elements reaching log2(ChIP/input)&gt;0 are actually significantly enriched when compared to all genic regions as they reach levels typical for silent intergenic regions.</p><p><italic>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and 3D</xref>, the authors conclude that K9me2 and K27me3 are on different regions. However, the data presented do not fully support these conclusions, both from analysis in 3B and from the self-organising maps: while there are some regions that are not overlapping, there are clearly other regions that do show overlap. The shape of the line in the fitting in 3B also suggests this interpretation. Since this analysis was not presented with statistics, nor with a comparison of e.g. active promoters or full genome data for 3B, I believe that the authors are not in the position to conclude what they conclude, so this part needs reinterpretation.</italic> </p><p>(This data is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>).</p><p>We have strengthened this result further by providing additional statistical analysis, and described this in the text (in the subsection “H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 are Associated with Distinct Repressive Chromatin States in vivo”). Classification of all promoters reveals that only ~0.3% show dual H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 marking. This result is consistent with a high level of anti-correlation that is statistically significant with p-value of 0.0024 (Chi<sup>2</sup> test). We have also performed an analysis of H3K9me2 vs H3K27me3 at all promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 4</xref>). However we do not include it in the manuscript as addition of active genes provides a population of H3K9me2-negative and H3K27me3-negative regions, it is thus impossible to plot a correlation curve.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09571.035</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Density contour plots showing correlation between H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 enrichments at all promoters in E6.25 epiblast.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09571.035">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09571.035</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09571-resp-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>Regarding my validation point above, the only validation presented for the lcChip-seq is a comparison of Pearson figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>) based on clustering of independent replicates – what if replicates are all poor showing similar background enrichment? The protocol would need validation to assess a comparison in magnitude of enrichment to standard protocol.

Several issues need to be clarified here:</italic> </p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, heatmaps of H3K9me2 from ESC (to show that these loci indeed gain H3K9me2 during differentiation) and 6.5 epiblasts (to show that similar findings can be observed in vivo) should be included.</italic> </p><p>(This data is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 B</xref>).</p><p>To address this question, we performed a more in-depth analysis of enhancer dynamics between different cell types. We have classified all active ESC enhancers based on the H3K27ac/H3K9me2 status in ESC/EpiLC/EpiSC and clustered similar elements together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 B</xref>). This heatmap now includes ESC samples and shows striking gain of H3K9me2 in primed cells. Moreover H3K9me2-marked enhancers show loss of H3K27ac in EpiSC. Finally we have included E6.25 epiblast sample to show that the same enhancers gain H3K9me2 in vivo.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, how would these heatmaps look if authors chose as their analysed regions enhancers that are active in EpiLC/EpiSC, but not in ESC? What would be the corresponding profiles (if any) of H3k9me2 status at these regions?</italic> </p><p>This point is directly addressed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref> C. Again we have clustered enhancers but as suggested by the reviewer we have included regions active in EpiLC and EpiSC. Next we sorted the clusters based on the H3K27ac level in EpiSC. This showed that highly active enhancers in EpiSC are devoid of H3K9me2. This result confirms that H3K9me2 is excluded from active enhancer in self-renewing cells.</p><p><italic>2) A substantial weakness of the study is that despite the authors having all the necessary reagents in hand, the data pertaining to the functional impact of G9a on enhancer activity is limited to just a few examples, and not coherent ones either (e.g. enhancers shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> don't overlap those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G-F</xref>). Given that the role of G9a in enhancer inactivation is one of the central novel claims of the paper, at the very least the eRNA expression analysis from the</italic> G9a<sup>F/<italic>–</italic></sup><italic>CreER EpiLCs treated with EtOH or TAM should be done systematically, across all H3K9me2 marked enhancers, and in comparison to enhancers unmarked by H3K9me2, but containing similar enrichment levels of H3K27ac. The relationship between enhancers with G9a-dependent eRNA expression and transcriptional changes at neighboring genes should be determined. To what extent transcriptional changes observed in G9a KO cells can be explained by H3K9me2/eRNA changes at nearby enhancers?</italic> </p><p>We have now removed all p53 bound enhancers from the analysis as their increased activation might be linked to indirect p53 stabilisation. Therefore, measuring eRNA expression at these loci would not be informative for this. The enhancer analysis now shows a consistent panel of 13 regions that were analysed with respect to eRNA expression dynamics, H3K9me2 accumulation, H3K27ac enrichment, sequential ChIPqPCR and eRNA misexpression in G9a mutant cells in vitro and in vivo. The strength of this comprehensive analysis is that it looks directly at the epigenetic and transcriptional state of enhancers rather than relying on a potentially erroneous assumption that enhancers regulate the nearest genes. Nevertheless, we have extracted the expression of nearby genes from RNAseq on E6.25 epiblasts and can confirm that 3/8 genes in proximity of H3K9me2 marked enhancers are indeed upregulated in <italic>G9a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 2</xref>). However, we have not included this analysis in the paper as we are not able to reliably link enhancers with specific genes. Finally, assessing the expression of nearby genes is further confounded by the fact that they themselves might be targets of H3K9me2 at promoters or gene bodies.</p><p><italic>3) Increased p53 binding upon loss of G9a may be an indirect consequence of the defect in enhancer repression, perhaps resulting in the increased enhancer accessibility- did the authors consider looking at chromatin accessibility measurements such as ATAC, DNase or FAIRE? Such data could in fact strengthen the conclusions on the functional impact of G9a on enhancer activity, regardless of the specific impact on p53.</italic> </p><p>We have now found that increased recruitment of p53 to enhancers is most likely due to activation of this pathway upon loss of G9a. Nevertheless we performed DNAseI-qPCR hypersensitivity assay to address potential increased accessibility of the loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Author response image 5</xref>). However we did not observe changes at enhancers with increased eRNA expression in G9aKO EpiLCs. This result is in line with a lack of change to the H3K27ac at these loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7 D</xref>). This further indicates that there is some level of uncoupling between enhancer activity and its accessibility during the dynamic process of inactivation.<fig id="fig14" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09571.036</object-id><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Bar plot showing DNAseI hypersensitivity of selected enhancers in d2 <italic>G9a<sup>F/-</sup> CreER<sup>+ve</sup></italic> EpiLCs treated with ethanol and tamoxifen.</title><p>Shown is average from two independent biological repeats (+/- StDev).</p><p>Procedure was performed as previously described (John et al., 2013)</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09571.036">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09571.036</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09571-resp-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>4) The authors generate valuable H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq datasets from epiblast cells of E6.25 embryos, but I feel they missed the opportunity to provide a deeper comparison of their results with the H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 patterns reported from the in vitro cellular models such as EpiLC or EpiSC. What are the major similarities and differences in patterns? A systematic (and to whatever extent possible, quantitative) comparison of H3K9me2 patterns across the genome in different cellular states would not only be broadly interesting for the community, but also relevant for the authors' own conclusions.</italic></p><p>We have now included an in-depth comparison between the epiblast in vivo and EpiSC in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This includes the results from lcChIPseq for H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 modifications as well as WGBSeq dataset. Both cell types have strikingly similar distribution of H3K9me2 showing that accumulation of this modification occurs rapidly and efficiently both in vivo an in vitro. On the other hand, there is substantial redistribution of H3K27me3 during EpiSC derivation including loss of this modification from multiple promoters of germline regulators. We also show that self-renewing EpiSCs accumulate substantial levels of DNA methylation especially at regions where the polycomb mark is lost. This explains, at least in part, reduced developmental potential of EpiSCs for the germline fate due to stable epigenetic silencing of PGC genes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
