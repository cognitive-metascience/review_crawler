A subsequent screen for bypass suppressors of <italic>fcho-1</italic> nulls identified 71 compensatory mutations in all four AP2 subunits. Using a protease-sensitivity assay we show that these mutations restore the open conformation in vivo. The domain of FCHo that induces this rearrangement is not the F-BAR domain or the µ-homology domain, but rather is an uncharacterized 90 amino acid motif, found in both FCHo and SGIP proteins, that directly binds AP2. Thus, these proteins stabilize nascent endocytic pits by exposing membrane and cargo binding sites on AP2.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03648.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03648.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03648.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All cells are enveloped by a plasma membrane. To interact with the outside world, cells constantly recycle the molecules found in, or on, this barrier. This is accomplished by drawing in small patches of the membrane containing these ‘cargo’ molecules via a process called endocytosis. The predominant method of endocytosis involves coating the tiny membrane pouches with a scaffold-like structure made of clathrin molecules. However, clathrin requires a set of four proteins (known as the adaptor protein-2 complex) to connect the membrane and cargo to the clathrin cage.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that the adaptor protein-2 complex may exist in at least two forms: one in which the binding sites for membrane and cargo are hidden, and another where these sites are exposed. These structures were proposed to represent inactive (closed) and active (open) forms of the complex, respectively. It has been unclear whether reorganization of the adaptor complex is a necessary step in endocytosis or how it might be stimulated.</p><p>Now Hollopeter et al. show that worms that lack a membrane-associated protein called FCHo are unable to cluster the adaptor protein-2 complex on their cell membranes, and their cells have difficulties taking up cargo. When the FCHo protein was missing, the adaptor protein-2 complex remained in its closed shape, suggesting that the FCHo protein is needed to switch the complex from its closed to its open structure.</p><p>When Hollopeter et al. looked for worms with genetic changes that can overcome the defects caused by a lack of FCHo, they identified worms with various mutations in the genes for the adaptor protein-2 complex. These mutations altered the proteins in the complex at positions that are predicted to rearrange dramatically when the complex is activated; Hollopeter et al. confirmed that such rearrangements do occur in living worms.</p><p>Furthermore, Hollopeter et al. found that giving mutant worms, which lacked the <italic>fcho</italic> gene, a small fragment of the FCHo protein causes the adaptor protein-2 complex to adopt its open structure. Similar fragments from other related membrane-associated proteins had the same effect, and these fragments all ‘cured’ the worms' endocytosis problems. The FCHo fragment directly binds the adaptor complex and Hollopeter et al. propose that FCHo proteins function to activate this complex at the sites where endocytosis occurs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03648.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03648.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>clathrin adaptor complex</kwd><kwd>AP2</kwd><kwd>protein conformation</kwd><kwd>FCHo protein</kwd><kwd>SGIP1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hollopeter</surname><given-names>Gunther</given-names></name><name><surname>Vu</surname><given-names>Thien N</given-names></name><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Mingyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Ailion</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Jorgensen</surname><given-names>Erik M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stowers Institute for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hollopeter</surname><given-names>Gunther</given-names></name><name><surname>Lange</surname><given-names>Jeffrey J</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name><name><surname>Slaughter</surname><given-names>Brian D</given-names></name><name><surname>Unruh</surname><given-names>Jay R</given-names></name><name><surname>Florens</surname><given-names>Laurence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS034307</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jorgensen</surname><given-names>Erik M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000154</institution-id><institution>Division of Integrative Organismal Systems</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-0920069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jorgensen</surname><given-names>Erik M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Endocytosis is triggered by membrane-associated proteins that transform the clathrin adaptor into an active complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a conserved and ubiquitous process for internalizing material from the cell surface. The Adaptor Protein-2 (AP2) complex serves as a bridge between cargo at the plasma membrane and clathrin. The AP2 core complex contains binding sites for membrane phospholipids and endocytic cargo while the appendages bind clathrin and accessory proteins that coordinate endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Traub and Bonifacino, 2013</xref>). AP2 thereby binds target proteins on the surface of the cell and assembles the machinery necessary for internalization of cargo.</p><p>AP2 can adopt functionally different conformations. The first crystal structure of the core complex revealed that the binding pockets for cargo and membrane were partially occluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Collins et al., 2002</xref>). This structure was proposed to represent a closed, inactive conformation of AP2. Cocrystallization with cargo peptides led to partially open or fully open conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). The open conformation places the cargo- and membrane-binding pockets in coplanar face of the complex and is therefore thought to be the active form of AP2. It has been difficult to determine whether AP2 reorganization is an obligatory process in vivo.</p><p>What regulates the switch from closed to open conformation? One model proposes that AP2 can open by simply binding the peptide motifs of cargo proteins and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Honing et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kelly et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, AP2 might require association with clathrin and phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate to bind cargo at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rapoport et al., 1997</xref>). Another model suggests that the open form of AP2 is induced by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fingerhut et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Olusanya et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Conner and Schmid, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ricotta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Honing et al., 2005</xref>). Alternatively it is possible that the complex is activated by one of the many other clathrin-associated proteins.</p><p>The most likely of these proteins would be one that precedes AP2 at sites of endocytosis. Examples include Epidermal growth factor receptor substrate 15 (Eps15), intersectin, and most recently, Fer/CIP4 Homology domain only (FCHo) proteins (Syp1p in yeast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stimpson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>). The role of FCHo at endocytic sites is poorly defined. In <italic>syp1</italic> mutants, which encodes the yeast homolog of FCHo, endocytic patches are less frequent, but still progress to coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reider et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stimpson et al., 2009</xref>). When FCHo proteins were knocked down in tissue culture cells, AP2 failed to bind membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henne et al., 2010</xref>). However, others found that knockdown of FCHo did not prevent AP2 association with the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Umasankar et al., 2012</xref>) but that there is an increased tendency for endocytic events to abort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cocucci et al., 2012</xref>) with flat clathrin plaques forming rather than clathrin-coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mulkearns and Cooper, 2012</xref>). These studies suggest that FCHo might regulate AP2 during the formation of a clathrin-coated pit. On the other hand, there is evidence that FCHo may be acting in a parallel endocytic pathway with ESCRT0 in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> <italic>elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mayers et al., 2013</xref>). In fish, FCHo appears to act in BMP signaling during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Umasankar et al., 2012</xref>). Thus it is unclear whether FCHo proteins function via AP2 or in parallel to AP2 in clathrin coat assembly, or in an entirely unrelated pathway.</p><p>Here, we report that FCHo directly activates AP2 by promoting the open conformation. In FCHo mutants in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, AP2 is functionally inactive and endocytosis of surface cargo is reduced. However, the requirement for FCHo can be bypassed by mutations in AP2 that specifically destabilize the closed conformation of AP2. FCHo is comprised of an F-BAR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henne et al., 2007</xref>), a linker region, and a C-terminal μ-homology domain related to the medium subunit of AP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reider et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stimpson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>). The region of FCHo that is required for activation of AP2 is not the F-BAR or the μ-homology domain but rather a conserved region found in the linker called the AP2 activator domain (APA). This small domain from all metazoan orthologs of FCHo proteins, including SH3-containing GRB2-like protein 3-interacting protein 1 (SGIP1), binds AP2 and is sufficient to activate the AP2 complex in vivo in the absence of the endogenous FCHo protein. We propose that the FCHo/SGIP class of proteins evolved to promote endocytosis by binding to, and stabilizing the open conformation of AP2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FCHo is required for AP2-dependent endocytosis</title><p>Mutations in the AP2 complex alpha and mu subunits in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (encoded by the <italic>apa-2</italic> and <italic>apm-2</italic> genes) result in animals with pleiotropic phenotypes including reduced body length (Dpy), egg-laying defects (Egl) and uncoordinated locomotion (Unc).

In addition, we designed a multigenerational screen to select for subtle improvements in fitness. Wild-type animals grow rapidly and starve a culture plate in 5 days, whereas <italic>fcho-1</italic> mutants exhibit reduced fecundity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and require twice as long to consume the same amount of food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We selected for suppressors that rapidly starved plates, and identified 71 dominant mutations that confer increased fitness to <italic>fcho-1</italic> mutants and suppressed the jowls phenotype.

It is likely that these mutations destabilize the closed conformation of AP2, suggesting that the open conformation of AP2 may bypass the requirement for FCHo.

We found that FCHo acts upstream of AP2: the function of FCHo can be bypassed by constitutively open mutations in the AP2 complex. Moreover the effect of FCHo on AP2 is direct: a 90 amino acid fragment of the linker domain in the FCHo family proteins binds AP2. This activator fragment is necessary and sufficient for rescue when overexpressed in <italic>fcho-1</italic> mutants.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>FCHo acts on AP2</title><p>There is broad agreement that FCHo acts early and it acts to stabilize nascent clathrin-coated pits via AP2. The AP2 complex associates with the plasma membrane with different lifetimes; some AP2 clusters are aborted rapidly (between 5–16 s) whereas others develop into fully committed pits (90 s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Loerke et al., 2009</xref>). In the absence of FCHo, the lifetime of AP2 at the membrane in cultured cells is quite brief (&lt;10 s), whereas overexpression of FCHo stabilizes AP2 and promotes the growth of clathrin-coated pits with long lifespans (&gt;25 s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cocucci et al., 2012</xref>). We observe a similar phenotype in <italic>fcho-1</italic> mutants: although AP2 still associates with the plasma membrane, it does not form clusters. Moreover, the dwell time of AP2 on the membrane is shorter; in <italic>fcho-1</italic> mutants worms, the lifespan of AP2 on the membrane is reduced from 35 to 10 s. These results are strikingly similar to the observations of Cocucci et al (2012).</p><p>Previously it was thought that FCHo stabilizes AP2 on the membrane indirectly by binding Eps15 and intersectin, and these proteins in turn bind AP2 and stabilize the formation of a clathrin-coated pit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henne et al., 2010</xref>). Our data suggest that FCHo acts directly on AP2: a 90 amino acid segment of the linker domain binds the AP2 complex in pulldowns from HEK293 cells. The linker region of human FCHo1 was previously shown to interact with AP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Umasankar et al., 2012</xref>). This interaction was thought to be via the appendage domain of the alpha subunit of AP2, however we find that the interior of the linker binds the core complex. This AP2 activator domain (APA) is conserved and this fragment from the nematode FCHO-1 protein or from the mammalian FCHo1, FCHo2 and SGIP1 proteins can rescue <italic>fcho-1</italic> mutant worms. It is curious to note that while the APA domain is conserved in metazoan orthologs of FCHO-1, it is absent in the yeast ortholog Syp1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reider et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>What is the function of the μ-homology and F-BAR domains in <italic>C. elegans</italic>? Although the APA domain rescues <italic>fcho-1</italic> mutants to grossly wild-type morphology and behavior, it does not fully rescue at a cellular level: endocytosis of cargo is not restored to wild-type levels by expression of the APA fragment. Full rescue is only observed when the rescuing constructs include both the APA domain and the μ-homology domain. We have confirmed that the μ-homology domains of FCHo proteins bind Eps15 and Eps15-like proteins in pulldowns from HEK293 cells by extending the bait proteins to include this domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is therefore likely that binding of FCHo to Eps15 is required for endocytosis of cargo. It has been demonstrated that FCHo forms an independent complex with Eps15 and Intersectin and that this complex functions in the recruitment of cargo to clathrin-coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mayers et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The F-BAR domain binds membrane and is required to recruit FCHo to the cell surface in both yeast and tissue culture cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reider et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stimpson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henne et al., 2010</xref>). By contrast, neither the F-BAR domain of FCHO-1 or the membrane association domain of SGIP are required for rescue of <italic>fcho-1</italic> mutants. The dispensable nature of the F-BAR domain conflicts with models in which this domain must bend the membrane for clathrin-coated pit formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henne et al., 2010</xref>), and instead suggests that the most important feature of the F-BAR domain is its ability to localize the APA domain to the membrane. Apparently in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the APA domain of FCHo can be recruited to the membrane via interactions with other proteins independent of the F-BAR domain. Nevertheless, the presence of a membrane-binding motif in all FCHo and SGIP proteins demonstrate that membrane interactions are important and conserved.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Open AP2 bypasses the requirement for FCHo</title><p>Different crystal structures of AP2 suggest that the complex can adopt multiple conformations. AP2 can assume a closed and inert conformation in which membrane- and cargo-binding domains are inaccessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Collins et al., 2002</xref>), in the unlatched or open conformations AP2 can bind the plasma membrane and the recognition motifs of cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The gain-of-function mutations in AP2 that bypass the requirement for <italic>fcho-1</italic> provide in vivo support for these conformational changes. These mutations can be sorted into three classes based on the regions affected: the latch, the bowl and the hinge. In the unlatched state, the N-terminus of the beta subunit disconnects from the alpha and sigma2 subunits and exposes the dileucine-motif binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>). Among the bypass suppressors of <italic>fcho-1</italic> were seven residues at the contact interface of the latched state. In the open structure, the mu domain is expelled from the bowl formed by the other subunits, and about half of the suppressors (34/71) were found in contact residues between mu2 and the bowl. The alpha hinge domain flexes as the bowl collapses in the open state, and 19 mutations in the alpha hinge were identified. We isolated 7 other mutations in residues that reside near inter-subunit contacts in the closed conformation. These mutations are all consistent with a destabilization of the closed state, and are in fact in an open state as determined by the exposure of a TEV protease site in vivo.</p><p>The activated AP2 mutations that result in the most open (protease sensitive) and phosphorylated AP2 complex fully rescue the morphological and growth defects of the <italic>fcho-1</italic> deletion. Nevertheless, these mutations do not fully restore clearance of an artificial cargo from the surface of the intestine. It is likely that the activated AP2 mutations cannot recapitulate all of the normal functions of the AP2 complex, since it is known that FCHo has other functions beyond its actions on AP2, for example via interactions with Eps15 or Disabled-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reider et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Uezu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mulkearns and Cooper, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Umasankar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mayers et al., 2013</xref>).

A z-stack of half of the coelomocyte was acquired at maximum speed (200 ms exposure per slice) with 0.2 µm spacing. Fluorescence was excited with a 488 nm laser and was filtered through a 500–550 nm bandpass filter to an EMCCD (C9100-23B, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). The images were then analyzed using a set of custom written plugins (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://research.stowers.org/imagejplugins">http://research.stowers.org/imagejplugins</ext-link>) in ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>).

The mean intensity and standard deviation of the ROI was then measured for each time point. The coefficient of variance (%CV) was then calculated and averaged for all time points and all worms per sample. Additionally, histograms of pixel intensities inside the coelomocytes were taken from the exact same ROI as the %CV measurements. The mode of a logarithmic histogram with a bin size of 1000 was used as the background intensity. The mode was then subtracted from the histogram. A value of 15,000 was then added back to the image and a new logarithmic histogram with bin size of 1000 was measured. This was necessary to avoid zero or negative values in the histogram. The bin width of the histogram was set to 1000 for all images, while the number of bins was allowed to vary. For each sample, all of the histograms were aligned to the mode and summed.

On both microscopes, fluorescence was excited with a 488 nm laser and emission was collected in the 500–550 nm range. On the LSM 780, emission was collected in photon counting mode range with a temporal resolution of 2 s and a pinhole close to 1 airy unit. Four images were acquired prior to bleaching of a manually selected ROI with maximum 488 nm laser power. On the spinning disk, emission was collected with an EMCCD camera (Hamamatsu C9100-23B). Five images were acquired at maximum speed (exposure 100–200ms) to determine the average fluorescence intensity of the coelomocyte membrane. Bleaching was then achieved over a user specified ROI, using a 488 nm laser (the duration of bleaching was less than five seconds). Recovery images were then captured for 3 min with a rate of 1 image per second.

Under these criteria the averaged FDRs at the protein and peptide levels were 0.24% ± 0.2 and 0.44% ± 0.3, respectively. Peptide hits from multiple runs were compared using CONTRAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tabb et al., 2002</xref>). To estimate relative protein levels, distributed Normalized Spectral Abundance Factors (dNSAFs) were calculated for each detected protein/protein group, as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). The open source BioConductor package plgem in R was used to statistically compare the proteins detected in the FCHo and SGIP1 samples to negative controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pavelka et al., 2008</xref>). Proteins were considered significantly enriched compared to the control datasets if their p-values for power law global error model signal-to-noise (PLGEM-STN) ratios were lower than 0.001, and they were detected in at least 2 out of 3 replicate analyses of the FCHo and SGIP1 purifications. The top 10 proteins (in addition to bait) were ranked based on decreasing PLGEM-STN values for FCHo2 APA, decreasing STN and dNSAF values for SGIP1 APA and full length (FL) SGIP1, and decreasing dNSAF values for FCHo2 FL and FCHo2 without the F-BAR domain (ΔBAR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Recombinant protein purification and pulldown</title><p>The His-tagged beta-mu hemicomplex expression vector is pGH424: Sequence corresponding to trunk domain of mouse AP2 beta 1 (amino acids 1–591, NM_001035854) was amplified from mouse brain cDNA (Elena Gracheva, University of California, San Francisco, CA) with primers oGH368 and oGH676; the fragment was inserted into the pETduet-1 vector amplified using oGH332 and oGH336 using the Gibson assembly reaction. This places the coding sequence downstream of the first T7 promoter. The C-terminus is tagged with a three amino acid linker (GSS) followed by a hexa histidine-tag (His-tag). The coding sequence of mouse AP2 mu1 (amino acids 1–435, NM_009679) was amplified (oGH370 + oGH371) and inserted downstream of the second T7 promoter (oGH338 + oGH339) using the Gibson reaction. The His-tagged mu domain of AP2 mu1 expression construct is pGH441: This construct was generated by amplifying a portion of pGH424 (oGH571 + oGH921) starting with the linker and mu domain of the mu2 protein, continuing around the plasmid backbone, and ending with the first T7 promoter. This PCR product removed the beta trunk along with the sigma-homology domain of mu while appending a His-tag to the N-terminus of the linker, and was circularized using the Gibson assembly reaction. The His-tagged beta appendage domain expression construct is pGH491: Sequence encoding the C-terminus of mouse AP2 beta 1 (amino acids 592–951) was amplified using oGH1161-2 and recombined with the His-tag, T7 promoter and vector backbone portion of the His-tagged mu domain construct (pGH441 amplified with pGH571 and oGH339) using Gibson assembly. The His-tagged alpha appendage expression construct is pGH492: cDNA corresponding to the linker + appendage domain (amino acids 622–938) of mouse AP2 alpha 2 (NM_007459) was amplified (oGH1163-4) and cloned using the same strategy as the beta appendage expression construct (pGH491, above). The His-tagged HaloTag-APA expression vector is pGH493: The His-tag, T7 promoter and backbone regions of the mu domain construct (pGH441 amplified with pGH853 and oGH1165) was recombined with PCR products corresponding to HaloTag (amplified using oGH1166-7) and the APA domain of mouse SGIP1 (oGH1169 + oGH861) using the Gibson reaction. The control construct to express the His-tagged HaloTag alone in bacteria is pGH494: The HaloTag coding sequence was amplified (oGH1166 + oGH1171) and recombined with the His-tag, T7 promoter and backbone regions of the AP2 mu domain construct (pGH441 amplified with oGH1170 + oGH1165). The vector expressing the trunk domain of mouse AP2 alpha 2 with a C-terminal GST tag along with mouse AP2 sigma 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Collins et al., 2002</xref>) was a gift from Volker Haucke (FMP, Berlin, Germany). Plasmids and oligonucleotides are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary files 1B,C</xref>, respectively.</p><p>Each AP2 hemicomplex was expressed independently. Expression vectors were transformed into Rosetta (DE3)pLysS cells (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) and grown overnight at 20°C in LB containing 200 μM IPTG, chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml), and ampicillin (100 μg/ml) for the His-tagged proteins and kanamycin (25 μg/ml) for the alpha/sigma hemicomplex. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with distilled water and re-pelleted prior to rapid freezing. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.5) and incubated with 1 mg/ml lysozyme at 4°C prior to sonication and centrifugal clarification. To purify His-tagged proteins, lysates were incubated with Talon cobalt resin (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), washed with lysis buffer containing 20 mM imidazole and eluted with lysis buffer containing 200 mM imidazole. To purify the alpha/sigma hemicomplex, lysate was incubated with glutathione agarose (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) and then washed with lysis buffer prior to eluting with lysis buffer containing 10 mM reduced glutathione. Purified proteins were dialyzed in 25 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.5 and stored as frozen aliquots at −80°C. For the pulldown assay, 80 pmoles of purified HaloTag ± APA bait were diluted along with 40 pmoles of recombinant AP2 prey and 10 μl of magnetic HaloLink beads (20% slurry) in 1x TBS containing 0.05% IGEPAL CA-630 (1 ml total volume for each pulldown) and nutated overnight at 4°C. Beads were washed with 1× TBS +0.05% IGEPAL CA-630 and bound proteins were cleaved from the HaloTag by incubation with AcTEV protease (30 µl at 50 units/ml for 60 min at 22°C). 50% of this elution was separated by SDS-PAGE and silver-stained along with 25% of the prey input for comparison. AP2 hemicomplexes are soluble under these conditions. To purify AP2 for crystallographic studies it was found that hemicomplexes were insoluble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Collins et al., 2002</xref>). Note that the protein concentrations used in our pulldown assay (∼10 μg/ml) are roughly 1000-fold lower than those indicated for the crystallization (∼10 mg/ml).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado and the Stowers Institute for Medical Research for support.

Taking advantage of <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetics, the authors identify an enormous set of mutations within subunits of the AP-2 complex during an <italic>fcho</italic> mutant suppressor screen. The mutations cluster in a manner that suggests they stabilize an open conformation for the AP-2 complex. Indeed, using an elegant in vivo protease sensitivity assay, several bypass mutants show enhanced cleavage, suggesting that they exist in a more open state. Additional experiments, including a clever second site suppressor analysis, further support this conclusion. The authors also identify a short, conserved sequence in FCHo (the APA domain), which is sufficient to promote AP-2 activity and rescue a subset of phenotypes exhibited by <italic>fcho</italic> mutant animals. In general, the work is rigorous and convincing, finally highlighting the relevance of different conformational states to AP-2 function in vivo. Nonetheless, the following issues should be addressed before publication can be recommended.</p><p>1) The significance of the paper would be enhanced if the authors would map the interaction between the proteins more precisely and provide an estimate of the affinity of the interaction; they should also provide specific information in terms of how the fragment affects AP2 behavior on the membrane.</p><p>2) A predicted AP-2 cargo is shown to accumulate on the surface of intestinal cells when FCHo is absent. However, there a pool of the cargo that continues to accumulate intracellularly in this mutant background. How does the <italic>fcho</italic> mutant phenotype compare to that of a strain that lacks the alpha subunit of AP-2? And in the double mutant lacking both the alpha subunit and <italic>fcho</italic>? The issue here is really trying to distinguish whether FCHo has functions outside of its role as an AP-2 activator. Since none of the bypass mutants could fully suppress the <italic>fcho</italic> deletion, it would suggest that FCHo functions independently of AP-2 as well. Can the authors clarify (either with this intestinal endocytosis assay or otherwise)?</p><p>3) Is there a consequence (with regard to endocytosis) to animals expressing a constitutively active form of AP-2 (e.g., the bypass mutants)? Is endocytosis enhanced in animals that harbor bypass mutations in an otherwise wild type background? If not, can the authors comment on why a transition from a closed to an open state might be beneficial?</p><p>4) In a similar vein, is the mobility/clustering of the alpha subunit altered in animals expressing one of the bypass mutants, as measured by FRAP? One might expect that the constitutively open state may translate into enhanced stabilization at the cell surface. Such a finding would be highly informative and enhance the impact of this study.</p><p>5) Continuing on this line of reasoning, what is the effect of expressing the APA domain on the mobility/clustering of the alpha subunit in coelomocytes?</p><p>6) The rescue of <italic>fcho</italic> mutants by the APA domain alone is somewhat surprising, as it is unclear how this fragment would be appropriately targeted. Perhaps its interaction with AP-2 is sufficiently strong to enable its localization? Unfortunately, there is no evidence to support this possibility at present. Can the authors express the domain (perhaps as a fluorescently tagged protein) and determine whether it accumulates at the cell surface, as one would anticipate? In this way, the authors could also determine which subunit (or at least hemicomplex) of AP-2 is necessary for targeting, as localization studies could be conducted in both alpha and mu deletion backgrounds.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03648.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The significance of the paper would be enhanced if the authors would map the interaction between the proteins more precisely and provide an estimate of the affinity of the interaction; they should also provide specific information in terms of how the fragment affects AP2 behavior on the membrane</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers suggested that the interaction of the APA domains of FCHo and SGIP with AP2 be further characterized: We determined that the APA domain binds specifically and directly to both hemicomplexes of the AP2 core. We expressed His-tagged or GST-tagged AP2 subunits (or domains) in bacteria, and separately expressed a Halo-tagged SGIP1 APA fragment and purified the recombinant proteins. The Halo-tagged APA fragment was conjugated to beads; the AP2 constructs were affinity-purified on these beads and identified on silver-stained gels. These data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>.</p><p>Results section: “We demonstrated that the interaction between the APA domain and the AP2 core is direct using purified recombinant proteins in pulldown assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The APA domain does not appear to bind the appendages of the large adaptins, nor to the mu domain alone. Rather, it bridges the complex since the APA bait binds both the alpha/sigma and beta/mu hemicomplexes.”</p><p>Discussion section: “… we find that the interior of the linker binds the core complex.”</p><p>We attempted to determine the affinity of the APA domain for the AP2 core using Fluorescent Correlation Spectroscopy. We labeled the purified HaloTag proteins with the fluorescent ligand TMR and incubated with increasing concentrations of the purified AP2 core complex. We repeated these experiments three times but the results were not significant. This is partly due to the fact that when the fluorescent Halo-tagged APA binds to the AP2 core, the shift in diffusion rate is not large enough to consistently rise above the baseline nor the diffusion rate of our negative control (purified HaloTag lacking the APA). We do see a deflection in the diffusion rate of the fluorescent APA domain when the concentration of AP2 core approaches 1 μM, however we are not convinced and do not feel comfortable publishing these data.</p><p>When overexpressed in <italic>fcho-1</italic> mutants, the APA domain alone is sufficient to increase AP2 association with the membrane as assayed by FRAP. Moreover, the APA fragment can organize the complex into puncta on the coelomocyte membrane and is thus likely assembling into presumptive endocytic pits.

Can the authors clarify (either with this intestinal endocytosis assay or otherwise)?</italic></p><p>The reviewers are asking whether FCHo has functions beyond activation of AP2. We have now tested this by assays in double knockouts in the pathway, in <italic>fcho-1</italic> mutants expressing just the APA fragment, and in <italic>fcho-1</italic> null mutants with suppressors (as described below). Although we lack data demonstrating other roles for FCHo, we think that it is quite likely given the conservation of the mu homology domain and its known interactions. We describe these new data in the Results and now acknowledge that FCHo is likely to have other roles in the Discussion.</p><p>The first and best method of testing for other roles is to assay for enhanced phenotypes in mutants lacking both FCHo and AP2. We found that surface retention of the artificial cargo was not enhanced in the double mutants lacking <italic>fcho-1</italic> and each of the AP2 subunits alpha, sigma, or mu.</p><p>In the text: “However, this cargo accumulates on the cell surface in both AP2 and <italic>fcho-1</italic> mutants, suggesting that AP2-dependent endocytosis is defective in <italic>fcho-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1D</xref>).

The activated AP2 mutations that result in the most open (protease sensitive) and phosphorylated AP2 complex fully rescue the morphological and growth defects of the <italic>fcho-1</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, these mutations do not fully restore clearance of an artificial cargo from the surface of the intestine. There are two possible reasons: either the activated AP2 mutations cannot recapitulate all of the normal functions of the AP2 complex, or there are other functions of FCHo beyond its actions on AP2.</p><p>In the text: “However, none of these mutations fully restored cargo endocytosis, even though all of the suppressors rescued growth and morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and not shown). Only the mutation that resulted in a profoundly protease-hypersensitive complex (μE306K) increased cargo internalization with high significance in <italic>fcho-1</italic> mutants. These findings indicate that subtle conformational changes favoring active AP2 satisfied an organismal requirement for FCHO-1 without fully compensating for the endocytic defect of <italic>fcho-1</italic> mutants.”</p><p>Discussion section: “The activated AP2 mutations that result in the most open (protease sensitive) and phosphorylated AP2 complex fully rescue the morphological and growth defects of the <italic>fcho-1</italic> deletion. Nevertheless, these mutations do not fully suppress clearance of an artificial cargo from the surface of the intestine. It is likely that the activated AP2 mutations cannot recapitulate all of the normal functions of the AP2 complex, and that FCHo has other functions beyond its actions on AP2, for example via interactions with Eps15 or Disabled-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mayers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mulkearns and Cooper, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reider et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Uezu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Umasankar et al., 2012</xref>).”</p><p><italic>3) Is there a consequence (with regard to endocytosis) to animals expressing a constitutively active form of AP-2 (e.g., the bypass mutants)? Is endocytosis enhanced in animals that harbor bypass mutations in an otherwise wild type background? If not, can the authors comment on why a transition from a closed to an open state might be beneficial?</italic></p><p>The reviewers are asking whether open AP2 mutants exhibit enhanced endocytosis in the intestine. We performed the cargo assay in five strains bearing activated mu2 mutations in an otherwise wild-type background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). None of these mutants internalize more of the artificial cargo than the wild type. We have not observed an overt phenotype associated with constitutively open AP2 other than their ability to bypass the requirement for FCHo/SGIP proteins.</p><p>In the text: “Nor do these mutants exhibit enhanced endocytosis or membrane association in an otherwise wild-type background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). It is possible that compensatory mechanisms counteract the open state of these AP2 mutants.”</p><p>Why is a transition from a closed to open state likely to be beneficial? The existence of a closed, soluble form of AP2 is probably important for trafficking the complex from recently formed vesicles back to the plasma membrane to initiate new sites of endocytosis. The open form is configured to bind membrane and cargo simultaneously, and the change in conformation in the superstructure probably signals the recruitment of clathrin.</p><p>If the constitutively activated forms cannot adopt the closed state, why don’t they affect endocytic trafficking? A complex that is in the open state could both enhance and slow cycling of the complex and may therefore superficially resemble the wild type, or the opening of AP2 may not be rate-limiting, or additional mechanisms may prevent AP2 hyperactivity.</p><p>In the text: “How then does FCHo promote the AP2 cycle? The formation of a closed form of AP2 is probably required to unbind membranes from newly endocytosed vesicles and to scan the membrane for new sites of endocytosis. The coincidental presence of FCHo, cargo, and PIP2 can then stabilize the open state, and the conformational changes in the complex then nucleate recruitment of clathrin and other pit components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackson, et al., 2010</xref>).”</p><p><italic>4) In a similar vein, is the mobility/clustering of the alpha subunit altered in animals expressing one of the bypass mutants, as measured by FRAP?

We analyzed the same five bypass mutants evaluated in the cargo assay above using FRAP to monitor the mobility of AP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) and variance analysis to quantify the clustering of AP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). None were significantly better than the wild-type AP2 complex. Again, it is possible that constitutively open AP2 elicits compensatory mechanisms or that the mutations are not so severe as to lead to a constitutively adherent complex.</p><p>Same quote as for point 3: “Nor do these mutants exhibit enhanced endocytosis or membrane association in an otherwise wild-type background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

The RFP-APA accumulates on the cell surface and overlaps with the GFP-tagged AP2 alpha subunit. In the absence of the mu subunit, the APA fragment is no longer enriched on the cell surface, even though the AP2 alpha-GFP retains the ability to localize to the plasma membrane (although not in a productive manner).
