the atypical mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the physiological significance of its short half-life remains unclear. By employing gastrointestinal 3D organoids, we detect that ERK3 protein levels steadily decrease during epithelial differentiation. ERK3 is not required for 3D growth of human gastric epithelium. However, ERK3 is stabilized and activated in tumorigenic cells, but deteriorates over time in primary cells in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ERK3 is necessary for production of several cellular factors including interleukin-8 (IL-8), in both, normal and tumorigenic cells. Particularly, ERK3 is critical for AP-1 signaling through its interaction and regulation of c-Jun protein. The secretome of ERK3-deficient cells is defective in chemotaxis of neutrophils and monocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Further, knockdown of ERK3 reduces metastatic potential of invasive breast cancer cells. We unveil an ERK3-mediated regulation of IL-8 and epithelial secretome for chemotaxis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MAPK</kwd><kwd>ERK3</kwd><kwd>secretome</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>chemotaxis</kwd><kwd>IL-8</kwd><kwd>gastrointestinal organoids</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RA1739/4-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rajalingam</surname><given-names>Krishnaraj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RA1739/4-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rajalingam</surname><given-names>Krishnaraj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC1292</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bogucka</surname><given-names>Katarzyna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009945</institution-id><institution>Merck KGaA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERK-KR</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rajalingam</surname><given-names>Krishnaraj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003042</institution-id><institution>Else Kröner-Fresenius-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SUNMAPK</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pompaiah</surname><given-names>Malvika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German Federal Ministry of Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marini</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University Medical Center Mainz</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marini</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003042</institution-id><institution>Else Kröner-Fresenius-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SUNMAPK</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bogucka</surname><given-names>Katarzyna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Understudied atypical MAPK, ERK3 controls epithelial secretome and chemotaxis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kinases constitute the major component of the druggable genome and deregulation in kinase signaling is associated with nearly 400 diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hopkins and Groom, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Melnikova and Golden, 2004</xref>). The FDA has thus far approved 28 kinase inhibitors for targeted therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Their clinical success in treating a subset of cancers led to enormous interest in understanding the ‘underexplored kinome’. Mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are a class of serine threonine protein kinases that control fundamental processes like proliferation, migration, differentiation and cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Raman et al., 2007</xref>). MAPKs are usually activated in a three-tier signaling cascade and the RAS-RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 is the first characterized MAPK cascade that is activated in response to growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wellbrock et al., 2004</xref>). As a paradigm, this cascade is triggered by the activation of the RhoGTPase RAS, which in turn activates the proximal MAPKKK (RAF kinase) of the cascade. MAPKKK kinases then phosphorylate and activate a MAPKK (like MEKs), which ultimately transfer phosphate groups to the threonine or tyrosine residues in the activation segment of the kinase domain of the MAPKs. Classical MAPKs are primarily recognized by the presence of the classical (Thr-X-Tyr) motif, which is phosphorylated by dual specific MAPKKs like MEK1 and MEK2. The activated MAPKs phosphorylate serine and threonine residues in hundreds of substrates, including transcription factors that define a specific response. Among the 14 MAPKs, ERK1, ERK2, p38 α/β/γ/δ and JNK1/2/3 are well characterized.</p><p>MAPK6/ERK3 belongs to the unconventional MAPKs that lack the typical Thr-X-Tyr motif in the activation loop of the kinase domain of classical MAPKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cargnello and Roux, 2011</xref>). Despite being ubiquitously expressed, physiological stimuli that trigger ERK3 phosphorylation and activation, as well as its authentic substrates are not well characterized. <italic>ERK3</italic> mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues with highest expression levels detected in brain, muscles and gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coulombe and Meloche, 2007</xref>). It was reported that genetic deletion of ERK3 led to a respiratory failure, disturbed growth and neonatal lethality in mice within the first days of life; however, these observations were recently challenged by two publications that confirmed that the observed phenotype was probably attributed to off target effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klinger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ronkina et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Soulez et al., 2019</xref>). Unlike conventional MAPKs, ERK3 possesses a single phospho-acceptor site at serine 189 within its N-terminus domain, which is constitutively phosphorylated in resting cells. ERK3 is a highly unstable protein with a half-life of 30 to 45 min that undergoes N-terminal ubiquitination. The E3 ubiquitin ligases responsible for this process are currently unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coulombe and Meloche, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coulombe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coulombe et al., 2003</xref>). However, Usp20 was recently identified as the first deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) for ERK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mathien et al., 2017</xref>). The physiological stimuli that activate ERK3 remain unclear and the role of this atypical MAPK in the regulation of physiological processes such as innate immunity has not been studied.</p><p>Establishment of stratified epithelium is a fundamental process during development contributing to tissue architecture and it further serves as a first line of defense against pathogen entry in the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dotti and Salas, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Niessen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Otte et al., 2004</xref>). As a constantly differentiating system, gut epithelium is an ideal model to identify genes involved in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aliaga et al., 1999</xref>). ERK3 has been shown to be required for the maintenance of epithelial architecture; however, genetic deletion studies in mice unveiled a non-essential role for this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ronkina et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi et al., 2018</xref>). To gain further insights into the potential role of ERK3 in epithelial morphogenesis and differentiation, we studied ERK3 expression levels by employing three-dimensional (3D) gastrointestinal organoids that reflect either murine intestinal or human gastric architecture and cell composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Almeqdadi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dotti and Salas, 2018</xref>). Epithelial cells respond to innate immune stimuli by secreting key inflammatory molecules to promote chemotaxis of immune cells to the micromilieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Okumura and Takeda, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Onyiah and Colgan, 2016</xref>). IL-8 is one of the first chemokines released by injured or inflamed epithelium, and it is constitutively expressed by intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eckmann et al., 1993</xref>). Being a prime modulator of the epithelial immune responses, IL-8 expression is coordinated by multiple signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jundi and Greene, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wen and Wu, 2001</xref>). Transcriptional activation of the IL-8 promoter strictly relies on the binding of inducible transcription factors (TFs) such as NF-κB and activating protein 1 (AP-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoffmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jundi and Greene, 2015</xref>). The AP-1 transcription factor is a homodimeric/heterodimeric protein complex formed between Jun and Fos proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jundi and Greene, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leppä and Bohmann, 1999</xref>). Its transcriptional potential is regulated by protein phosphorylation, its abundance and interaction with protein kinases like MAPKs in the nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoffmann et al., 2002</xref>). The AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun can translocate and be retained in the nucleus as a monomer, without binding to its target sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schreck et al., 2011</xref>). Although c-Jun is predominantly regulated by JNK it was demonstrated that its nuclear translocation is independent of its phosphorylation by and interaction with JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schreck et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we unveil a kinase-independent role of ERK3 in the regulation of the epithelial secretome including maintenance and induction of IL-8, in both, normal and tumorigenic cells. ERK3-mediated IL-8 secretion is critical for the chemotaxis of leukocytes to the epithelium. We further unveil a synergistic role of ERK3 and classical MAPKs in the regulation of epithelial secretome and identify ERK3 as a novel interacting partner of c-Jun and regulator of AP-1 activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ERK3 protein dynamics during morphogenesis and differentiation of gastrointestinal organoids</title><p>To elucidate the physiological role of ERK3 in the establishment of stratified epithelium, we generated murine and human gastrointestinal organoid cultures as described in the Materials and methods.

Interestingly, in these cells, LPS stimulation led to a decrease in the protein levels of ERK3, while activating MK5 and the classical MAPKs: ERK1/2 and p38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–K</xref>). These results also indicate that MK5 might be phosphorylated and activated by p38 MAPK or the closely related ERK4 as these two MAPKs have also been shown to phosphorylate MK5 at T182 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">New et al., 1998</xref>). Interestingly, LPS stimulation also affects the total protein levels of MK5 in a kinetic manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and I</xref>). It has been reported that unlike the tumorigenic cells, primary epithelial cells express low levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cario and Podolsky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pott and Hornef, 2012</xref>). This observation was confirmed in our cell culture models for HCPECs and HT-29 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Despite the observed discrepancy in primary and oncogenic cells in response to LPS, the effects observed are attributed to the altered proteostasis of ERK3, as <italic>ERK3</italic> mRNA levels are not significantly altered in response to LPS in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and L</xref>). Consistently, the polyubiquitination of endogenous ERK3 is modulated in response to LPS in both HT-29 cells and HCPEC: LPS treatment repressed and induced ERK3 ubiquitination in oncogenic and primary epithelial cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M and N</xref>, respectively). These results confirmed that LPS-mediated turnover of ERK3 protein is partially mediated via the ubiquitin proteasome machinery.</p><p>We then tested whether ERK3 is activated in response to other innate immune stimuli like TLR1/2 ligand Pam3CSK4, TLR7/8 ligand R848 and IL-1β.

Interestingly, while IL-8 levels increased over time in HT-29 cells, drastic reduction in chemokine levels was observed in HCPECs upon LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, respectively). More interestingly, IL-8 levels measured in HT-29 and HCPECs in response to LPS reflected ERK3 expression status in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>). In contrast to cancer cells, HCPECs display a high basal level of IL-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Depletion of ERK3 with multiple siRNAs and shRNAs led to a significant reduction in both, basal as well as LPS-induced IL-8 levels, suggesting an obligatory role for ERK3 in the maintenance of IL-8 not only in HCPECs and HT-29 cells, but also in MDA-MB231 and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). To further corroborate these observations, we established ERK3 knockout cells by employing a CRISPR/Cas9 approach. Consistent with the observations made with si- and shRNAs, we affirmed that CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of ERK3 reduces LPS-induced IL-8 levels in CRISPR ERK3 HT-29 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>). Furthermore, we performed loss-of-function studies in HGOs by employing lentivirus-based CRISPR/Cas9 system. The infected cells were then selected for antibiotic resistance and the efficiency of the knockout was verified by western blots. Data obtained from HGOs of two different patients revealed that ERK3 is not required for the 3D growth of human gastric epithelium as we failed to detect any significant change in the number or the size between the control (CRISPR Co) and ERK3-depleted (CRISPR ERK3) HGOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–J</xref>). However, consequently with the observations made for HCPECs, knockout of ERK3 impaired IL-8 secretion in human gastric organoids from two different patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). We also verified mRNA expression of <italic>CXCL8</italic> in HGOs upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>), which correlates with the expression pattern of ERK3 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated the role of ERK3 in the production of IL-8 stimulated by IL-1β and TLR1/2 ligand Pam3CSK4, the other two ERK3 activating stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) apart from LPS. 24 hr stimulation with IL-1β induced ERK3 protein expression in control (siCo) HCPECs with concomitant upregulation of IL-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–3B</xref>). However, knockdown of ERK3 (siERK3) did not reduce IL-8 levels induced by IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–3B</xref>) suggesting that activation of p38 MAPK, but not ERK3 is probably contributing to IL-8 production in primary intestinal epithelial cells as shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Parhar et al., 2003</xref>). On the contrary, depletion of ERK3 inhibited the induction of IL-8 upon stimulation of these cells with Pam3CSK4 despite the activation of p38 MAPK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C–3D</xref>).</p><p>Unlike in primary cells, stimulation of HT-29 cells with IL-1β induced IL-8 in an ERK3-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E–3F</xref>).

Moreover, in several experiments, we found that despite the activation of ERK1/2, direct (ERK3 depletion) and indirect (LPS stimulation in HCPECs) downregulation of ERK3 negatively affected IL-8 production. To further explore the role of canonical MAPKs in the regulation of epithelial cell function, we checked for a potential cross-talk between ERK1/2 and ERK3 in controlling IL-8 levels, as several studies unveiled a critical role for classical MAPKs in the production and secretion of CXCL8/IL-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hartman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marie et al., 1999</xref>). Most of the studies investigating the role of ERK1/2 were employing the MEK1 inhibitor trametinib to evaluate the role of this pathway in mediating several cellular processes. Blocking of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway by trametinib led to a significant reduction of LPS-induced IL-8 levels in HT-29 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that treatment with trametinib severely compromised protein levels of ERK3 in HT-29 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>) with no significant effect on the <italic>ERK3</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Since ERK3 protein abundance played a critical role in IL-8 regulation and trametinib induced the downregulation of ERK3 protein levels, we tested whether the IL-8 decrease observed upon ERK1/2 inhibition was induced by blocked activity of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 module or by an indirect attenuation of ERK3 protein abundance. To address this issue, HT-29 cells were pre-treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 to prevent proteasomal degradation, prior to trametinib treatment which was followed by LPS stimulation to induce IL-8 production. Systemic block in proteasomal activity with MG-132 led to the accumulation of ERK3 protein and rescued IL-8 levels decreased by MEK inhibitor treatment in both, resting and LPS stimulated HT-29 cells despite inactive ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4D and E</xref>). Interestingly, MG-132 treatment itself caused an increase in IL-8 levels comparable with the upregulation obtained by LPS stimulation, while no significant effect was detected in ERK1/2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4D and E</xref>). These data suggest that proteasomal activity is required for the regulation of IL-8 levels and that ERK3 turnover via the proteasomes potentially contributes toward this phenotype in cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Functional interplay between ERK4 and MK5 in the regulation of ERK3 and IL-8</title><p>We also evaluated the role of ERK4 and MK5, the other related components of the ERK3 signaling module.

Interestingly, expression of WT as well as the kinase-dead version rescued the secretion of IL-8 in at least two different cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>).

Transwell migration experiments involving THP1 cells and human neutrophils revealed that depletion of ERK3 in the epithelial cells leads to a significant reduction in the chemotaxis of these leukocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>). We then performed similar experiments in vivo by injecting the secretome of control or ERK3-depleted HCPECs into the peritoneal cavity of mice as presented in the experimental scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Consistent with the observations we made in vitro, injection of the supernatants obtained from ERK3-depleted HCPECs (siERK3 supernatant) resulted in significantly reduced migration of granulocytes and monocytes to the intraperitoneal cavity in comparison to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D–E</xref>), while not exerting any significant effect on the lymphocytes recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>, the presence of the IL-8 antibody decreased the migration of neutrophils and THP1 cells. Moreover, neutralization antibody incubation indicated that the observed decrease in the chemotaxis is mediated by IL-8, as there is an additive effect between untreated and antibody treated variant within each condition (Control-Control+IL-8 Ab and ERK3 KD-ERK3 KD+IL-8 Ab). Importantly, although mice lack the IL-8 encoding gene, they do express a receptor analogous to human CXCR2, which in response to human IL-8 mediates neutrophil chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Singer and Sansonetti, 2004</xref>).

The intestinal epithelium serves as the first line of defence against pathogen entry and bacteria-derived products like LPS trigger TLR signaling, leading to the production of cytokines and chemokines that attract immune cells to the site of infection, thus initiating local inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abreu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cario and Podolsky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kawai and Akira, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mogensen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sallusto and Baggiolini, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Singer and Sansonetti, 2004</xref>). While the classical MAPKs have been shown to be activated and required for innate immune responses, the role of atypical MAPKs remains understudied.</p><p>This study demonstrates a role for ERK3 in regulating epithelial secretome and LPS-mediated immune responses. Although ERK3 protein levels alter during epithelial differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), loss-of-function studies revealed that ERK3 is probably not required for the establishment and maintenance of human gastric epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–J</xref>). However, incorporation of the HGOs confirmed that depletion of ERK3 causes a decrease in CXCL8/IL-8 secretion by epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). We observed that LPS treatment affected ERK3 protein stability in a cell-type-dependent manner. While LPS led to an enhanced ERK3 protein stability in oncogenic cells, opposing effects were observed in human primary colonic epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Unlike the tumorigenic HT-29 cells, primary cells express low levels of <italic>TLR4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Whether this discrepancy contributes to the effects observed on ERK3 protein levels remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cario and Podolsky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tang et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, upregulation of TLR4 is associated with inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cario and Podolsky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan and Liu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tang et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, observed discrepancies in responsiveness to LPS between colon carcinoma and primary epithelial cells can be further explained by previous studies describing upregulation of TLR4 in colorectal cancer, including HT-29 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abreu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Furrie et al., 2005</xref>). Published observations indicate that LPS-TLR4 signaling results in tumor progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gross et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yesudhas et al., 2014</xref>). Intestinal epithelium is constantly exposed to significant levels of luminal LPS and the low expression of TLR4 by HCPECs might provide an explanation why they can tolerate LPS and maintain hyporesponsiveness toward luminal bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Otte et al., 2004</xref>). It is tempting to hypothesize that LPS triggers alterations in the ubiquitin signaling machinery contributing to ERK3 ubiquitination and degradation, leading to the attenuation of IL-8 production and inflammation in primary epithelium. While Usp20 has been shown to function as a DUB for ERK3, the E3 ubiquitin ligase of ERK3 is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mathien et al., 2017</xref>). Also, the kind of ubiquitin chains synthesized on ERK3 in response to LPS deserves further investigations.</p><p>In order to gain more insight into the immune stimuli-dependent ERK3 kinetics in intestine epithelial cells, we tested two other TLR ligands, Pam3CSK4 (for TLR1/2) and R848 (for TLR7/8) as well as IL-1β. These experiments revealed that ERK3 is required in a stimulus- and cell-type-dependent manner for the production of IL-8. Further studies are warranted to uncover the underlying mechanisms contributing to these discrepancies. However, ERK3 is critically required for basal as well as LPS-induced IL-8 levels in both primary and tumor cells. IL-8 was first discovered as a leukocyte chemotactic factor and since then emerged as a double-edged sword of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hammond et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Long et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sallusto and Baggiolini, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Singer and Sansonetti, 2004</xref>). Further, IL-8 has emerged as a crucial factor in mediating tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell survival and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Itoh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Waugh and Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xu and Fidler, 2001</xref>).

Consequently, CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of ERK3 negatively affected secretion of CXCL8/IL-8 in human gastric organoids.

These data suggest a crucial role for ERK3 in IL-8-mediated tumor progression and metastasis formation by regulating critical factors like CXCL8/IL-8.</p><p>Intriguingly, the effect is kinase-independent and we demonstrated that ERK3 controls the transcription factor AP-1/c-Jun in both, HCPECs and HT-29 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, respectively). We further observed that ERK3-AP-1 activity directly correlates with IL-8 levels in both normal and transformed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F and G–H</xref>, respectively).</p><p>In order to activate target genes, transcription factors such as c-Jun have to translocate to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schreck et al., 2011</xref>). Our studies revealed that ERK3 is required for nuclear abundance of c-Jun protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and F</xref>). We provide evidence that ERK3 interacts with c-Jun and regulates the DNA-binding activity of AP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E and G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) which might reflect a non-catalytic scaffolding function described for other kinases as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rauch et al., 2011</xref>). Activated JNK translocates to the nucleus, where it can phosphorylate c-Jun at S63/73 and T91/93, which in turn enables c-Jun homodimerization or heterodimerization with c-Fos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng and Karin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gazon et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, JNK controls c-Jun activity by sub-nuclear localization of AP-1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gazon et al., 2017</xref>), therefore it is tempting to propose ERK3 as a novel MAPK required for the nuclear abundance of c-Jun. Whether ERK3 directly interacts with c-Jun and influences the stoichiometry of the AP-1 complex needs further studies.</p><p>ERK3 has already been reported to be constitutively localized to both, cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Julien et al., 2003</xref>), but its subcellular localization has been shown not to be affected by any of the common MAPKs activating stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Julien et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that LPS stimulation triggers the accumulation of ERK3 protein, resulting in its enhanced expression in both, cytoplasm and nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we consistently observed that loss of ERK3 inhibited IL-8 production and secretion in multiple cell types - despite the activation of classical MAPKs and NF-κB. Interestingly, NF-κB activity was increased upon ERK3 knockdown as indicated by TF activity profiling assay as well as by measuring IκBα degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>, respectively), which is contradictory to the observed decrease in IL-8 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Worth mentioning is that LPS stimulation led to a downregulation of NF-κB activity in ERK3-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>), which surprisingly had no additive effect on neither protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) nor mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) levels of CXCL8/IL-8. The possible cross-talk between ERK3 and NF-κB deserves further investigations.</p><p>We were able to observe that inhibition of MEK1 with trametinib reduces the protein stability of ERK3 and thus the published results claiming a unique role for the classical MAPK in the production of IL-8 needs to be evaluated with caution. Our data suggest an obligatory and synergistic role for ERK3 in mediating LPS-induced chemokines. We also evaluated the role of ERK4 and MK5 in the regulation of ERK3 and IL-8. It is not clear if the heteromerization between these kinases is contributing to their protein stability.</p><p>While verifying the role of ERK3 in the regulation of CXCL8/IL-8, we uncover that ERK3 interacts with c-Jun and regulates AP-1 activity, which directly contributes to the high basal and LPS-mediated IL-8 levels in HCPECs and HT-29 cells, respectively. Although HCPECs and HT-29 cells respond differently to LPS, mechanisms regulating IL-8 in both cell types are ERK3-AP-1 dependent and the decrease in expression of ERK3 directly correlates with IL-8 levels. Taken together, these data present one of the first physiological roles for this understudied MAPK and unveil a critical role for ERK3-IL-8 signaling axis in regulating epithelial function and chemotaxis, which is critical for mediating inflammation and tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at this stage.</p><p>The authors have carried out experiments to show the existence of an ERK3-AP-1/c-Jun axis in modulating IL-8 secretion, which plays a role in neutrophil chemotaxis. The assays and reagents chosen to explore the molecular mechanisms were reasonable and reliable. However, the reviewers felt that unless the contribution of this pathway is shown to be associated with some patho-physiological process (e.g. murine tumor metastasis or microbial infection model), the impact of the work is more limited. It remains unknown whether defects in the neutrophil recruitment are directly linked to insufficient IL-8 production (could be other cytokines/chemokines). To nail down the conclusion and importance of this study, KO mice or local injection of viral vector based shRNA will be necessary.</p><p>The reviewers were concerned that it would be challenging to complete these experiments in two months’ time, as is stipulated by <italic>eLife</italic>. In addition, most of the data were generated with a few cell lines in ex vivo settings. Uncertainty remains whether the conclusions can be generalized (e.g. freshly isolated primary colon cancer cells versus adjacent normal epithelial cells would be more convincing). We would of course be happy to reconsider a new manuscript that includes such experiments that were viewed as potentially increasing the overall impact significantly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors spent efforts to show the existence of ERK3-AP-1/c-Jun axis in modulating IL-8 secretion in epithelial cells, which can play a role in neutrophil chemotaxis.</p><p>1) It remains largely unknown whether this signaling participates in or contributes to any patho-physiological processes.</p><p>2) The authors need to provide more experimental evidence on the importance of this signaling pathway.

We appreciate the concern of the reviewer to validate the relevance of these observations in patho/physiological conditions. We have now added substantial evidence to support our main claims:</p><p>1) By employing mouse colon organoids (MCOs) and human gastric organoids (HGOs) we demonstrate that ERK3 protein levels are reduced under differentiated conditions. In addition, CRISPR-mediated knockout of ERK3 in HGOs failed to prevent the 3D growth of human gastric epithelium (new Figure 1), further indicating that ERK3 is a potential druggable target. This is also in line with the new mouse knockout data (Ronkina et al., 2019; Soulez et al., 2019). In addition, we further present evidence that loss of ERK3 led to a reduction in IL-8 secretion in HGOs (new Figure 4L).</p><p>2) ERK3 regulates IL-8 production in many tested cell lines, including MDA-MB231 (Figure 4G-H and Figure 5A). IL-8 has been reported to enhance migration and thus metastasis of breast carcinoma cells MDA-MB231 (Jayatilaka et al., 2017). To further validate our observations we tested for the lung colonization of these cells upon ERK3 depletion. Consistent with our observations, ERK3-depleted cells exhibited reduced lung metastasis. These data are now added to the manuscript (new Figure 5C-F and Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>3) We would like to remind that we have also demonstrated IL-8 dependent in vivo chemotaxis of granulocytes and monocytes towards ERK3-depleted culture supernatants of primary epithelial cells by employing a mouse model (Figure 8)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors need to provide more experimental evidence on the importance of this signaling pathway. It is not clear whether other ERK members also contributes to LPS-induced IL-8 secretion, knockdown or inhibition strategies are necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We have indeed performed extensive analyses on the cross-talk between the classical MAPKs and ERK3, including ERK1/2 and it is included in the manuscript (“Cross-talk between canonical MAPKs and ERK3 in the regulation of IL-8” is a section in our manuscript). Please see Figure 4—figure supplement 3.</p><p>To summarize our data:</p><p>To explore the role of canonical MAPKs in the regulation of epithelial function we checked for the potential cross-talk between ERK1/2 and ERK3 in controlling IL-8 levels as several studies unveiled a critical role for classical MAPK in the production and secretion of IL-8 (Hartman et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2006; Marie et al., 1999). We performed experiments with trametinib (a well-established MEK1/2 inhibitor) to evaluate the role of canonical MAPKs-ERK1/2 and showed that blocking of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway leads to a decrease in IL-8 production (Figure 4—figure supplement 3A-B). Moreover, in the context of ERK3, our data clearly showed that inhibition of the ERK1/2 activity leads to a significant downregulation of ERK3 protein but not the mRNA levels (Figure 4—figure supplement 3A-C). We further demonstrated that treatment with MG132 prevented ERK3 degradation and rescued IL-8 levels inhibited by the trametinib treatment (Figure 4—figure supplement 3D and E).</p><p>We also present evidence with other innate immune stimuli like IL-1β, R848 and PamCSK3 and we found cell specific and stimulus specific effects with respect to the requirement of ERK3 in stimulus-dependent IL-8 production. These studies deserve follow up to delineate the role of various MAPKs in mediating epithelial chemotaxis and their potential cross-talk with ERK3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is AP-1/c-Jun the only downstream route of ERK3 to promote LPS-triggered IL-8 secretion?</p></disp-quote><p>As presented in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and Figure 6—source data 1, ERK3 is required for the activation of majority of the tested TFs in HCPECs, including AP-1 (Figure 6D), which has been reported to control both, basal and inducible expression of chemokines like IL-8 (Khanjani et al., 2012; O'Hara et al., 2009). Hence, AP-1/c-Jun became the major focus in this study. Nevertheless, we independently validated TF array-derived data by assessing the activity of three most potent regulators of IL-8 (Hoffmann et al., 2002; Jundi and Greene, 2015) in ERK3-depleted cells, which apart from AP1/c-Jun, also involves C/EBP and CREB. Our results highlighted AP-1 as one the TFs positively regulated by ERK3 and therefore regulating IL-8 transcription (new Figure 6—figure supplement 2).</p><p>We cannot with certainty state that ERK3 regulates IL-8 production exclusively through AP-1/c-Jun. Considering that the production of IL-8 is regulated at several levels, including transcriptional regulation, we focused on verifying the role of ERK3 in the transcriptional regulation of IL-8, which unveiled the previously unknown ERK3-AP-1/c-Jun-IL-8 signaling axis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also not clear how ERK3 activate AP-1/c-Jun, though its kinase activity is not required in this process?</p></disp-quote><p>We demonstrated that ERK3 is critical for AP-1 signaling through its interaction and regulation of c-Jun protein and its nuclear abundace (Figure 7).</p><p>In order to activate target genes, transcription factors such as c-Jun have to translocate to the nucleus (Schreck et al., 2011). Our studies revealed that ERK3 is required for nuclear abundance of c-Jun protein (Figure 7B and E-F). We provide evidence that ERK3 interacts with c-Jun and regulates the DNA binding activity of AP-1 (Figure 6D-E, G and Figure 7) which might reflect a non-catalytic scaffolding function described for other kinases as well (Rauch et al., 2011). Sub-nuclear localization of AP-1 proteins is crucial for the AP-1 activity (Gazon et al., 2017), therefore it is tempting to propose ERK3 as a novel MAPK required for the nuclear abundance of c-Jun.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Most of the data were generated with few cell lines in <italic>ex vivo</italic> settings. Have the authors considered testing freshly isolated primary cells (colon cancer cells versus adjacent normal epithelial cells)?</p></disp-quote><p>Well taken! We employed commercially available Human Primary Epithelial Cells (HCPECs) as the primary colonic epithelial cells and performed majority of the experiments in these cells apart from the HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells. Obtaining duly consented patient tissue for such experiments takes months at least in our clinical center. We therefore approached commercial biobank to obtain such normal and colon carcinoma tissue with clean pathology from duly consented patients. We were able to obtain EpCAM sorted epithelial-like cells from tumor and adjacent normal tissue. We attempted to culture these cells and perform ERK3 knockdown studies as well as LPS stimulation. Unfortunately, these cells failed to attach to various substrates and we still pursue to get a clone out of these cells to perform such experiments. In the meantime, we directly lysed some of the sorted normal vs. tumor cells to verify ERK3 protein expression. As you can see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, EpCAM positive cells isolated from normal tissue expressed higher levels of ERK3 protein than the matching tumor epithelial cells.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Western Blot analyses of colon epithelial-like cells isolated using EpCAM microbeads from tumor and adjacent normal tissue of two CRC patients.</title><p>Cells were analysed by Western blot according to the Materials and methods section, expression levels of ERK3 were monitored.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52511-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>These data are very preliminary as they represent only two patients and alone it is insufficient to draw any general conclusions. Our unpublished observations reveal that this phenotype is also reflected in the mRNA levels i.e. ERK3 levels are downregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples in comparison to the matching normal or adjacent normal controls. Whether this has any functional significance in the context of CRC- immune-tumour micromilieu needs a complete study on its own.</p><p>In the meantime, we were able to establish mouse and human gastrointestinal organoids and we did confirm that loss of ERK3 led to a reduction in the secretion of IL-8 in HGOs derived from two patients (new Figure 1 and new Figure 4L).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the differences in ERK3 expression/activation/stability between tumor cells and epithelial cells upon LPS stimulation should be explored more carefully.

However, to further strengthen these studies we employed TLR1/2 ligand-Pam3CSK4, TLR7/9 ligand-R848 and one of the most potent innate immune stimuli-IL-1β and monitored ERK3 kinetics in both HCPECs and HT-29 cells (new Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><p>Additionally, we tested the effect of IL-1β and TLR1/2 ligand Pam3CSK4, two potential ERK3 stimuli in the production of IL-8 by depleting ERK3 from HCPECs and HT-29 by si- shRNA (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2). IL-1β induced IL-8 levels in both cell types (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-B and E-F), however, knockdown of ERK3 negatively affected observed upregulation in chemokine production only in HT-29 cells (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2E-F). Conversely, Pam3CSK4 induced IL-8 levels in HCPECs and depletion of ERK3 prevented this upregulation (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2C-D), while almost no effect of TLR1/2 ligand was detected in HT-29 cells (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2G-H). These data confirmed again the cell type and stimuli specific activation of ERK3 and its requirement for IL-8 production.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) ERK3 deficient cells showed defects to recruit monocytes and neutrophils, and this is due to insufficient chemokine/cytokine production.

Intravenous (i.v.) injection of ERK3-depleted (shERK3) MDA-MB231 cells resulted in less tumor lesions in the lungs and decreased pulmonary metastatic burden (new Figure 5E and F, respectively and Figure 5—figure supplement 1, Results subsection “Depletion of ERK3 reduces metastatic potential of breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The role of TLR4 in the LPS-mediated regulation of ERK3 should be addressed experimentally in order to delineate the pathway from the receptor to the effector.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her support.We appreciate the comment of the reviewer that the entire pathway from the receptor to the effector needs to be established which is a manuscript in itself.
