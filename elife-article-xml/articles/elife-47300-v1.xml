Reck, a multi-domain and multi-functional glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, specifically enhances beta-catenin signaling by Wnt7a and Wnt7b in cooperation with the 7-transmembrane protein Gpr124. Among amino acids that distinguish Wnt7a and Wnt7b from other Wnts, two clusters are essential for signaling in a Reck- and Gpr124-dependent manner. Both clusters are far from the site of Frizzled binding: one resides at the amino terminus and the second resides in a protruding loop. Within Reck, the fourth of five tandem repeats of an unusual domain with six-cysteines (the CC domain) is essential for Wnt7a stimulation: substitutions P256A and W261A in CC4 eliminate this activity without changing protein abundance or surface localization. Mouse embryos carrying <italic>Reck<sup>P256A,W261A</sup></italic> have severe defects in forebrain angiogenesis, providing the strongest evidence to date that Reck promotes CNS angiogenesis by specifically stimulating Wnt7a and Wnt7b signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>canonical Wnt signaling</kwd><kwd>Gpr124</kwd><kwd>Reck</kwd><kwd>Wnt7</kwd><kwd>blood-brain barrier</kwd><kwd>CNS angiogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nathans</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY018637</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nathans</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000997</institution-id><institution>Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nathans</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Molecular dissection of Frizzled, Reck, and Wnt7a provides critical insight into the long-standing question of ligand-receptor specificity in the field of Wnt signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vascularization of the brain and retina requires beta-catenin (i.e. canonical Wnt) signaling in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stenman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daneman et al., 2009</xref>). Later in development and in the mature CNS, beta-catenin signaling is required to generate and maintain the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and its retinal counterpart, the blood-retina barrier (BRB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liebner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stenman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daneman et al., 2009</xref>). In both of these contexts, ligands Wnt7a, Wnt7b, and/or Norrin are produced by CNS glia and/or neurons to activate Frizzled (Fz) receptors and Lrp5/6 co-receptors on ECs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sun and Smith, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). In humans, mutations in the genes coding for beta-catenin, Norrin, Fz4, Lrp5, and the Norrin-specific co-activator Tspan12 cause inherited defects in retinal vascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sun and Smith, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Targeted mutations in the corresponding murine genes, as well as in the genes coding for Wnt7a and Wnt7b, cause defects in retinal and/or brain angiogenesis and barrier formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sun and Smith, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian genomes code for 19 Wnts and 10 Frizzleds, and the genomes of other vertebrate classes code for similarly large numbers of Wnts and Frizzleds. A long-standing question in this field is how Wnts and Frizzleds interact so that signaling occurs via the appropriate subset of ligand-receptor pairs. Characterization of Wnt-Frizzled binding in vitro and the effects of different combinations of Wnts and Frizzleds on beta-catenin signaling in transfected cells, together with analyses of genetic redundancy among Wnt and Frizzled genes, suggest that there is both specificity and promiscuity in Wnt-Frizzled interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhat, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhanot et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hsieh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mulroy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stenman et al., 2008</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yu et al., 2010</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ye et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dijksterhuis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Voloshanenko et al., 2017</xref>). The question of Wnt-Frizzled specificity has been brought into sharper focus by the three-dimensional co-crystal structure of <italic>Xenopus</italic> Wnt8 and the ligand-binding cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of murine Fz8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Janda et al., 2012</xref>). In this structure, XWnt8 resembles a hand that uses only the thumb and one finger to contact the CRD. Much of the contact surface on the amino-terminal lobe of XWnt8 (the âthumbâ) is contributed by a covalently attached lipid that is common to all Wnts, while much of the contact surface on the carboxy-terminal lobe (the âfingerâ) is contributed by evolutionarily conserved amino acids. Thus, these two contact interfaces likely account for only part of the biological specificity of Wnt-Frizzled binding.</p><p>A partial answer to the specificity question is emerging from the study of Wnt7a and Wnt7b signaling in the context of CNS angiogenesis and BBB maintenance. Two membrane proteins that are expressed in CNS ECs â the seven-transmembrane protein Gpr124 and the multi-domain glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein Reck â specifically enhance signaling via Wnt7a and Wnt7b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou and Nathans, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Posokhova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vanhollebeke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ulrich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eubelen et al., 2018</xref>).

Additionally, postnatal elimination of Reck and Gpr124, together with loss of Norrin, compromises BBB integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou and Nathans, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Recent biochemical studies of the interactions between Wnt7a/7b, Frizzled, Gpr124, and Reck have begun to dissect the domains and individual amino acids required for their function and for the exquisite ligand specificity that Gpr124 and Reck impart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Posokhova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eubelen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vallon et al., 2018</xref>). The present study adds to this body of work by (i) comparing the roles of different Fz CRD and transmembrane domains in Wnt7a/Fz/Gpr124/Reck signaling, and (ii) defining amino acids in Wnt7a that are required for Gpr124- and Reck-dependence, and (iii) defining amino acids in Reck that are required for Wnt7a-dependent signaling and complex formation. In mice, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated alanine substitutions at two critical amino acids in Reck cause a severe defect in CNS angiogenesis and likely represents a clean elimination of Wnt7a/7b stimulation without affecting the structure or function of other Reck domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Frizzled CRD specificity in Reck-Gpr124-Wnt7a signaling and complex formation</title><p>Among the ten members of the Frizzled family, Fz5, Fz8, and to a lesser extent Fz4 facilitate Reck-Gpr124-Wnt7a signaling and ligand/receptor/co-activator association on the surface of transfected cells, whereas Fz3 and Fz6 do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vanhollebeke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2017</xref>). To explore the Frizzled domain(s) responsible for this specificity, we examined binding of Reck domains CC1-5 fused to alkaline phosphatase (AP) to intact (live) cells displaying Gpr124, Wnt7a, and various full length Fz proteins or GPI-anchored Fz CRDs. [The N-terminal region of Reck contains five tandem copies of anÂ ~60 amino acid domain with a characteristic pattern of six cysteines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Takahashi et al., 1998</xref>); we refer to these as CC domains.] With full-length Fz targets, Reck(CC1-5)-AP binds Fz5Â =Â Fz8&gt;&gt;Fz4&gt;Fz6, a pattern that is closely matched by the corresponding FzCRDs displayed as Myc-tagged and GPI anchored targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Specifically, Fz4, Fz5, Fz6, and Fz8 CRD-Myc-GPI proteins accumulate at the cell surface of living cells to approximately the same level, and they bind Wnt7a-1D4 with comparable efficiencies â as shown, respectively, by anti-Myc and anti-1D4 binding to intact cells â but only Fz5 and Fz8 CRDs confer high levels of Reck(CC1-5)-AP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, the Reck(CC1-5)-AP binding signals reflect a specificity for particular Fz CRD sequences rather than differences in the abundances of cell-surface Wnt7a-1D4 or FzCRD-Myc-GPI.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47300.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Frizzled CRD specificity for Reck-Gpr124-Wnt7a binding and signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Reck(CC1-5)-AP binding to live HEK293T cells transfected with Gpr124, Wnt7a, and full-length Fz (top) or Gpr124, Wnt7a, and FzCRD-Myc-GPI (bottom).

Upon co-transfection with Gpr124 and Wnt7a, we observed weak binding of Reck(CC1-5)-AP to Fz4CRD-Fz6 (a hybrid with the Fz4CRD joined to the Fz6 linker and transmembrane domains) and strong binding of Reck(CC1-5)-AP to Fz8CRD-Fz6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), signal intensities that mirror those of full-length Fz4 and Fz8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In a luciferase reporter cell line for beta-catenin signaling [Super TOP Flash (STF) cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xu et al., 2004</xref>, co-transfection with Reck, Gpr124, Wnt7a, Lrp5, and WT or chimeric Frizzleds showed that signaling by Fz4CRD-Fz6 and Fz8CRD-Fz6 was comparable to WT Fz4 and Fz8, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). Fz6 showed no STF activity compared to the no-Fz control. Wnt7a signaling by both WT and chimeric Fz4 and Fz8 proteins was enhanced by Reck and Gpr124 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; compare left and right halves; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). Taken together, these data show that part of the specificity for Wnt7a-Fz-Reck-Gpr124 complex formation and signaling resides within the Fz CRD.</p><p>As a point of comparison, we conducted an analogous experiment with Norrin and Fz4, which form a high affinity ligand-receptor complex that activates beta-catenin signaling in conjunction with the co-activator Tspan12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Junge et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast to the results with Wnt7a, while AP-3xMyc-Norrin binds with comparable efficiencies to HEK293T cells expressing Fz4 or Fz4CRD-Fz6, Norrin-dependent beta-catenin signaling in STF cells was dramatically enhanced with Fz4 but was minimally above background with Fz4CRD-Fz6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). These data are consistent with the independent observation that the linker region between the Fz4 CRD and transmembrane domain enhances Norrin binding and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>As an independent measure of Frizzled CRD specificity in the context of Wnt7a signaling, we quantified the inhibition of Wnt7a/Fz/Reck/Gpr124 signaling upon co-transfection with different FzCRD-Myc-GPI proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). [In STF cells, low-level expression of multiple Fz genes likely accounts for beta-catenin signaling in the absence of a co-transfected Fz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou and Nathans, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eubelen et al., 2018</xref>) and therefore co-expression of FzCRD-Myc-GPI might be expected to compete for the ligand and other signaling components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).] As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, beta-catenin signaling induced by Wnt7a, Reck, and Gpr124 was completely inhibited by Fz5CRD-Myc-GPI and Fz8-CRD-Myc-GPI; it was strongly inhibited by Fz4CRD-Myc-GPI; and it was unaffected by Fz6CRD-Myc-GPI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). This rank order of inhibition matches the rank order of cell-surface complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,Â B and D</xref>), lending further support to the conclusion that part of the specificity in Wnt7a-Reck-Gpr124 signaling resides within the Fz CRD. The inhibition rather than activation of signaling by FzCRD-Myc-GPI proteins implies an essential role for the Frizzled 7-TM domain in signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Molecular determinants for Wnt7a function in Reck- and Gpr124-mediated signaling</title><p>Wnt7a and Wnt7b are the only Wnts that exhibit Reck- and Gpr124-stimulated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou and Nathans, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Posokhova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vanhollebeke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2017</xref>). As a first step in defining the region(s) of Wnt7a that account for this specificity, we generated chimeras between Wnt7a and either Wnt3 or Wnt3a, with fusion points at the junction between the N- and C-terminal domains of the horseshoe-shaped Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Janda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hirai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As an adjunct to these experiments, we deployed the live-cell immunostaining assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> to provide a semi-quantitative estimate of the level of expression of correctly folded Wnts by measuring the accumulation of C-terminally 1D4 epitope-tagged Wnt bound to a GPI-anchored CRD at the cell-surface. This assay has the advantage that it imposes two criteria for Wnt immunostaining: (1) transit through the ER-to-plasma membrane quality control system, and (2) Fz CRD binding. Wnt surface localization does not appear to reflect non-specific sticking because it is substantially increased by co-expression of FzCRD-myc-GPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The low level of surface Wnt seen in the absence of a co-expressed FzCRD-myc-GPI likely reflects binding to endogenous full-length Frizzleds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>, with serial 2-fold reductions of transfected Wnt7a-1D4 plasmid, there is a corresponding monotonic reduction in (i) the cell surface accumulation of Wnt7a-1D4 in the presence of Fz8CRD-Myc-GPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) and (ii) the abundance of Wnt7a in whole cell lysates, as assessed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). These data imply that cell surface immunostaining provides a semi-quantitative estimate of the abundance of correctly folded and CRD bound Wnt.

Based on the results of these cell culture experiments and using CRISPR/Cas9 engineering in mice, we have constructed a <italic>Reck</italic> allele with two alanine substitutions in CC4 that produces a severe CNS vascular phenotype, providing the strongest evidence to date that Reck action in CNS angiogenesis is due to stimulation of Wnt7a/7b signaling and is independent of Reckâs other function as a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Oh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chandana et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Almeida et al., 2015</xref>). The anatomic localization of the CNS angiogenesis defect is consistent with earlier studies showing redundancy between the Wnt7a/7b and Norrin signaling systems in the embryonic hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou and Nathans, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>As noted in the Introduction, the molecular basis of Wnt-Fz specificity is, at present, largely enigmatic. In the context of Wnt7a and Wnt7b signaling, the present work provides intriguing insights into specificity determinants in Fz receptors. In particular, the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> show that while Wnt7a can bind to the CRDs of Fz4, Fz5, Fz6, and Fz8, only the CRDs of Fz4, Fz5, and Fz8 â but not of Fz6 â are permissive for Wnt7a/Reck/Gpr124 complex formation. Additionally, while full-length Fz4, Fz5, and Fz8 mediate beta-catenin signaling and CRD-Myc-GPI versions of Fz4, Fz5, and Fz8 inhibit beta-catenin signaling, full-length Fz6 and Fz6CRD-Myc-GPI have little or no effect on beta-catenin signaling. Finally, replacing the CRD of Fz6 with the CRD of Fz4 or Fz8 in the context of full-length Fz6 restores beta-catenin signaling to the levels obtained with full-length Fz4 or Fz8, respectively. The simplest explanation for all of these observations is that Fz specificity in this system is mediated by the CRD, presumably via direct contact with Reck and/or Gpr124.</p><p>It is interesting that the Fz4CRD-Fz6 chimera cannot elicit a beta-catenin response to Norrin despite robust binding, suggesting that regions of Fz4 beyond the CRD are required for signal transmission in the Norrin-Fz4 system. Our observations with Norrin and Frizzled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>) are consistent with those from a recent study from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bang et al. (2018)</xref>, which has identified the linker region between the Fz4 CRD and transmembrane domain, as well as sites in intracellular loop 3, as important for enhanced Norrin binding and signaling.</p><p>In the context of CNS vascular development, the expression of Fz4, Fz5, and Fz8 in ECs, together with their competence for Wnt7a/Gpr124/Reck signaling, implies that they are the mediators of Wnt7a and Wnt7b signaling in vivo. The role of Fz6 in vascular development remains unclear, despite its robust expression in ECs, as <italic>Fz6<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice show no apparent vascular phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>With respect to specificity determinants in Wnt7a, the present work complements recent studies from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eubelen et al. (2018)</xref> that independently identified the protruding region of Wnt7a (encompassing alanine substitutions #15 and #18) as critical for Wnt7a/Fz/Gpr124/Reck signaling based on substitution mutations that primarily targeted large hydrophobic amino acids. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eubelen et al. (2018)</xref> have also presented evidence that Reck(CC1-5) can bind with low micromolar affinity to a synthetic peptide corresponding to this region of Wnt7a or Wnt7b, and that CC4 and CC5 are required for that interaction. Our observation that Reck(CC1-5)-AP carrying the P256A,W261A substitutions is unable to participate in Wnt7a/Fz/Gpr124 complex formation is consistent with the model of Eubelen et al., but it is also consistent with alternate models for CC4 function.</p><p>The present work additionally complements the binding studies performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vallon et al. (2018)</xref> that demonstrate a direct interaction between Reck and Wnt7a. Intriguingly, Vallon et al. showed that a soluble Reck-Fc fusion protein stimulates binding of secreted Wnt7a to a soluble Fz8Â CRD protein, suggesting a model in which Reck, in conjunction with Gpr124, presents Wnt7a and Wnt7b to Fz receptors at the plasma membrane. While a full understanding of Wnt7a/Wnt7b/Fz/Gpr124/Reck/Lrp ligand recognition and signaling will require high-resolution structural information, the biochemical and functional studies to date, including the present work, substantially constrain current models by defining essential protein-protein interactions and the domains that mediate them.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Experimental details are further elaborated below in âLuciferase assaysâ, âAlkaline Phosphatase binding assaysâ, and âCell surface biotinylation assay and immunoblot analysisâ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Luciferase assays</title><p>Dual luciferase assays were performed as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xu et al. (2004)</xref>. Briefly, STF cells were plated on 96-well plates at a confluency of 30â40%. The following day, fresh DMEM/F-12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific 12500) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) replaced theÂ mediumÂ in each of the wells. Three hours later, cells were transfected in triplicate with expression plasmids (180â240 ng of DNA per three wells) using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Promega E2311). The DNA master mix included: 1.5 ng of the internal control Renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-TK), and 60 ng each of the pRK5 expression plasmids for Gpr124, Reck, Wnt7a, Fz, and control vector. 48 hr post-transfection, cells were harvested in 1x Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega E194A) for 20 min at room temperature. Lysates were used to measure Firefly and Renilla luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega E1910) and a Turner BioSystems Luminometer (TD-20/20). Relative luciferase activity was calculated by normalizing Firefly/Renilla values. GraphPad Prism 7 software was used to generate plots and perform statistical analysis. The meanÂ Â±Â standard deviations are shown.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Alkaline Phosphatase binding assays</title><p>AP binding assays were performed as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al. (2017)</xref>. Briefly, conditioned DMEM/F-12 media containing AP fusion proteins were collected from HEK293T cells that were transfected with pRK5 expression plasmids using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent. All conditioned media were collected 72 hr post-transfection and spun-down to remove detached cells. To quantify the yield of AP fusion proteins, an aliquot of the conditioned medium was incubated with BluePhos phosphatase substrate solution (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/tetrazolium; Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories 50-88-00).</p><p>For cell-based AP binding assays to assess multi-protein complexes, HEK293T cells were plated on 0.2% gelatin coated wells. 48 hr post-transfection, cells were incubated with serum-containing conditioned medium at 4Â°C for 2 hr. Cells were washed 3 times with cold serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium prior to fixing with cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Fixed cells were placed in a 70Â°C water bath for 1 hr to heat denature endogenous AP. Bound AP was visualized by incubation with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP) substrate (Roche 11383213001) at room temperature.</p><p>For cell-surface AP immuno-staining assays, HEK293T cells were plated on 0.2% gelatin coated wells. 48 hr post-transfection, cells were incubated with diluted primary antibodies (1:1,000) in serum-containing media at 4Â°C for 1 hr, and then washed 5â6 times with cold PBS. Cells were subsequently fixed and heat denatured as described above. Cells were incubated with diluted AP-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:1000) in 1x PBS at 4Â°C for 1 hr. Cells were washed 3 times with 1x PBS prior to AP visualization as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cell surface biotinylation assay and immunoblot analysis</title><p>Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pavel et al. (2014)</xref>. In brief, HEK293T cells were plated on 0.2% gelatin coated wells and transfected with pRK5 expression plasmids with FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent. The medium was removed 48 hr post-transfection, and cells were washed 3 times with 1xÂ PBS. Cells were incubated in 1xÂ PBS containing Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (250 Î¼g/ml) at 4Â°C for 30 min. Excess biotin was quenched by adding Tris-HCl pH 7.4 to a final concentration of 50 mM at 4Â°C for 5 min. After removing the Tris buffer, cells were detached, washed 3 times in 1x Tris buffered saline (TBS), and lysed in 1xÂ RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitor (Roche 11836170001). Cell lysates were incubated at 4Â°C for 30 min and subsequently centrifuged at 10,000xg at 4Â°C for 20 min to remove cellular debris. Cell-surface proteins were captured by incubating cleared lysates with NeutrAvidin Agarose Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific 29200) overnight at 4Â°C. Resin was washed 5 to 6 times withÂ 1x RIPA buffer, and captured proteins, along with input controls, were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (EMD Millipore IPFL00010) for immunoblotting. Immunoblots were incubated with primary antibodies (1:10,000 mouse anti-1D4, mouse anti-actin, and rat anti-alpha tubulin; 1:2,000 rabbit anti-Reck) diluted in Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LiCor 927â40000) overnight at 4Â°C. Membranes were washed with 1x PBS-T (1x PBSÂ +Â 0.1% Tween 20), and incubated with LiCor secondary antibodies (1:10,000) diluted in Odyssey Blocking Buffer for 1 hr at room temperature. Membranes were washed at least 3 times with 1x PBS-T and developed using the Odyssey Fc Imaging System (LiCor).</p><p>For whole tissue lysates, E11.5 embryos were harvested and homogenized using a plastic pestle in 1xÂ RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Tissue lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants processed for immunoblot analysis, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Modeling Wnt7a structure</title><p>The mouse Wnt7a (mWnt7a) structure was modeled by using the <italic>Xenopus</italic> Wnt8 (XWnt8) crystal structure in complex with mouse Fz8 CRD (Protein Data Bank code 4F0A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Janda et al., 2012</xref>) using The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.2.3 SchrÃ¶dinger, LLC.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Karl Willert as the guest Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have also agreed to reveal their identity: Hsin-Yi Henry Ho (Reviewer #2) and Stefan Liebner (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript addresses an important question in developmental biology, namely how is signaling specificity achieved. The mammalian genome encodes 19 Wnt signaling molecules and 10 Frizzled (Fz) receptors, however, to date relatively little is known about how specific ligand (Wnt) â receptor (Fz) pairs regulate downstream developmental processes. Here, the authors examine the role of Wnt signaling in the development of the vasculature in the CNS, a process that involves the molecular interaction of Wnt7a/b with the Reck-Gpr124-Fzd-Lrp5/6 receptor complex. By generating a series of mutations in both Reck and Wnt7a, they are able to identify small stretches of amino acids that are required for assembly of this complex and subsequent downstream signaling. To ascertain the in vivo significance of a particular sequence motif (involving P256A/W261A) within the CC4 domain of Reck, the authors generated a novel mouse model carrying P256A/W261A point mutations and showed that these mutations cause angiogenic defects when expressed in combination with a hypomorphic Reck (deleted exon2) allele. This manuscript complements previous reports by Eubelen et al., 2018 and Vallon et al., 2018, which have independently shown that Reck mediates specificity for Wnt7 binding and signaling to the receptor complex in endothelial cells. Importantly, this current work builds on these molecular findings by providing the best data yet that specific interactions between Wnt7 and Reck are required for CNS angiogenesis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reck-Wnt7 interaction: The data presented here argue strongly for a direct interaction between Reck and Wnt7. The prior work by Eubelen et al. indicated that a Wnt7 peptide interacted with Reck with low affinity. The P256A, W261A Reck protein is expected to disrupt Wnt7 binding. The authors should provide biochemical evidence for this loss of interaction.</p><p>2) Clarification and further characterization of the ex2 allele of Reck. The authors state that &quot;the Reck protein produced from the exon 2 deletion allele is present at very low levels in embryo extracts&quot;, citing their prior publication (Cho et al., 2017). However, a figure provided in this prior publication (Figure 6E in the 2017 paper) shows no protein on an immunoblot, similar to what is shown here in Figure 4B. Furthermore, the original paper that describes the generation of this Reck allele (Chandana et al., 2010) provides no evidence of low levels of Reck protein expression. Since this current study relies on this hypomorphic allele to analyze the E15.5 phenotype of the newly generated P256A, W261A allele (phenotypically a null allele and embryonic lethal at E11.5 when homozygous), the authors need to provide additional characterization of this reagent. Currently, the hypomorph description is based on phenotype and the fact that animals develop to E15.5, but there is no clear evidence that any Reck protein is made, as indicated by the authors.</p><p>3) Characterization of Reck-CC4: Consistent with other studies, CC4 is required for complex formation, however, is it sufficient? The authors' earlier work (Cho et al., 2017) showed that CC1 is also essential by directly binding Gpr124, so most likely both CC1 and CC4 are required for complex formation. It would be interesting to learn if a protein containing only CC1 and CC4 is sufficient for complex formation and signaling by bridging Gpr124 and Wnt7.</p><p>4) Norrin interactions (Figure 1F,G): In the context of the provided data on norrin binding and signaling, the authors should cite and discuss the manuscript by Bang et al., 2018, which may explain the finding that Fzd4CRD-Fzd6 did not signal. Specifically, a flexible linker domain between the CRD and TM1 in Fzd4 plays an important role in Norrin signaling, and inclusion of this linker in the Fz4CRD-Fz6 construct may rescue the lack of Î²-catenin signaling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47300.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reck-Wnt7 interaction: The data presented here argue strongly for a direct interaction between Reck and Wnt7.

The authors should provide biochemical evidence for this loss of interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data and that of Eubelen et al., 2018, are mutually reinforcing in that both demonstrate an important role for the protruding âknobâ domain of Wnt7a. Furthermore, Eubelen et al. showed that a peptide corresponding to this Wnt7a or Wnt7b sequence binds to a Reck CC domain-Fc fusion with low affinity (1-10 uM). As noted by the editor and the reviewers, our identification of a small region of Reck CC4 that is critical for cell-surface ligand-receptor complex formation and signaling suggests, as the most parsimonious explanation, that this CC4 region directly contacts the Wnt7a âknobâ. In experiments that preceded the initial submission, we attempted to detect such an interaction in two ways, but neither experiment produced a signal over background.</p><p>First, we produced the Wnt7a knob region displayed as an Fc fusion (i.e. a dimeric fusion) and probed it with Reck(CC1-5)-AP (also a dimer). For this analysis, we expressed both a linear version of the Wnt7a âknobâ region and a version in which we engineered a pair of cysteines flanking the Wnt7a âknobâ sequences so that the resulting disulfide bonded loop would create a locally constrained structure similar to the one seen in the Wnt-CRD crystal structure determined by Janda et al., 2012. Although the Fc-dimer-to-AP-dimer binding strategy facilitates the detection of relatively weak interactions and the colorimetric AP detection method is highly sensitive, the binding signals for these experiments were below the limit of detection. We have also tested Reck(CC1-5)-AP binding to cell surface complexes with the Wnt7a alanine substitution mutants (including the ones in the âknobâ region) and we did not observe a correlation between reduced binding and reduced signaling in STF cells.</p><p>Second, we co-transfected full-length Wnt7a-1D4 with Reck(CC1-5)-Fc or Reck(CC1-5+CRD)-Fc [Reck has a Frizzled-like CRD motif C-terminal to the CC domains], captured the Fc fusion proteins from serum-free conditioned medium, and assessed the level of bound Wnt7a-1D4 by immunoblotting. These experiments were performed with WT vs. P256A,W261A versions of the Reck CC4 sequence. With both constructs, we observed no differences between WT vs. P256A,W261A in the levels of bound Wnt7a. For both WT and mutant, the capture is more efficient when the CRD is present. In contrast to the results of these binding experiments using soluble Wnt and Reck proteins, we see a dramatic difference between WT vs. P256A,W261A when we assay Reck(CC1-5)-AP binding to living cells displaying Fz+Gpr124+Wnt7a (shown in Figure 3I).</p><p>What is our interpretation at this point? First, we think that the Wnt7a âknobâ region (as well as the Wnt7a N-terminal region, which is also important for STF signaling) may be doing something more than mediating binding to Reck(CC1-5), but we do not know what that is. Second, in characterizing mutations in Reck(CC1-5), we think that the cell surface Reck(CC1-5)-AP binding assay provides biologically relevant data because: (1) all of the receptor/ligand components are present and all are required for optimal binding, (2) the binding occurs in the living (i.e. native and unfixed) cell surface environment in which signaling occurs, and it includes additional components like proteoglycans and lipids, and (3) this assay shows that the P256A,W261A mutant is severely defective, in agreement with its complete loss of function in the STF signaling assay and in vivo.</p><p>We have not presented the ânegativeâ binding results described above because we are not convinced that those are definitive experiments. For example, the sensitivity of our Wnt7a âknobâ-Fc binding experiment may be lower than the sensitivity of the synthetic peptide binding assays in Eubelen et al. (which used isothermal titration calorimetry), so we do not want to leave the reader with the impression that we have failed to replicate the Eubelen et al. data. Our current view is that Wnt7a recognition by Reck and Gpr124 normally occurs in the context of a multi-protein complex, and, as a result, some of the critical interactions are not easily demonstrated with isolated components or with protein fragments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Clarification and further characterization of the ex2 allele of Reck. The authors state that &quot;the Reck protein produced from the exon 2 deletion allele is present at very low levels in embryo extracts&quot;, citing their prior publication (Cho et al., 2017). However, a figure provided in this prior publication (Figure 6E in the 2017 paper) shows no protein on an immunoblot, similar to what is shown here in Figure 4B. Furthermore, the original paper that describes the generation of this Reck allele (Chandana et al., 2010) provides no evidence of low levels of Reck protein expression.

Currently, the hypomorph description is based on phenotype and the fact that animals develop to E15.5, but there is no clear evidence that any Reck protein is made, as indicated by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>By way of background, the Reck floxed exon 2 mutant was created by Nodaâs group approximately ten years ago and is described in Chandana et al., 2010. The germline deleted version of this allele (âReck exon2delâ) is phenotypically hypomorphic. Reck exon 2 is 59 nucleotides in length and it codes for the first 20 amino acids after the signal peptide. This exon is not a multiple of 3 nucleotides, and therefore, its deletion will lead to a frame-shift. The fact that Reck exon2del is phenotypically hypomorphic, rather than null, implies that a cryptic splicing event or frame-shifting translation is allowing a polypeptide product to be produced. The mouse mAb that we have used for western blotting is a rabbit mAb (from Cell Signaling Technology) that was raised against the C-terminal region, i.e. a region that is not encoded by exon2 and is presumably present in the Reck exon2del protein. The hypomorphism of the Reck exon2del allele and the very low level of the Reck exon2del protein allowed us to (1) study compound heterozygous exon2del and P256A,W261A embryos beyond the age when homozygous P256A,W261A embryos would have died, and (2) observe the P256A,W261A protein produced by compound heterozygous embryos on western blots.</p><p>With respect to the specific point raised above â whether the Reck exon2del protein is âabsentâ or âpresent at very low levelâ â the hypomorphic phenotype implies the latter. If the Reck exon2del protein were âabsentâ, then this allele would be a null. With standard image processing of our western blots, the Reck exon2del protein appears to be âabsentâ â or, stated more precisely, it is âbelow the limit of detection under standard conditionsâ. However, if we electronically increase the signal we see a faint band at a molecular weight a bit lower than that of the WT Reck protein (red arrow in the enclosed image). Similarly, Chandana et al. show a western blot of a CreER mediated deletion of the Reck exon2 floxed allele (see their Figure 5B), which they describe in the legend as showing âthe absence of Reck protein bandâ â in fact, there is a faint band at a bit lower molecular weight. We do not want to draw a firm conclusion from very faint bands, but the data suggest that this faint band may correspond to the Reck exon2del protein. We have added a sentence to the Results to clarify this issue.</p><p>The important point for this analysis is that the very low level of the Reck exon2del protein allows us to observe the Reck P256A,W261A protein on western blots from compound heterozygous embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Characterization of Reck-CC4: Consistent with other studies, CC4 is required for complex formation, however, is it sufficient? The authors' earlier work (Cho et al., 2017) showed that CC1 is also essential by directly binding Gpr124, so most likely both CC1 and CC4 are required for complex formation. It would be interesting to learn if a protein containing only CC1 and CC4 is sufficient for complex formation and signaling by bridging Gpr124 and Wnt7.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for that suggestion. Over the past month, we tested this idea with two Reck mutants, in which CC2 and CC3 were deleted: one with a small gly/ser linker and one with a larger gly/ser linker connecting CC1 and CC4. The interesting result is that the two mutants support a modest level of signaling (4-6 fold lower than WT Reck), and when expressed as AP fusion proteins, they confer nearly WT levels of cell surface binding to cells expressing Wnt7a, Fz, and Gpr124. The data support a model in which (1) CC1 and CC4 are the most important CC domains for complex formation [Cho et al., 2017 and Figure 3A of this manuscript show that CC5 is largely dispensable], and (2) optimal activity for signaling also requires the right 3D spacing between these domains. These data have been added to the Results section and are presented in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Norrin interactions (Figure 1F,G): In the context of the provided data on norrin binding and signaling, the authors should cite and discuss the manuscript by Bang et al., 2018, which may explain the finding that Fzd4CRD-Fzd6 did not signal. Specifically, a flexible linker domain between the CRD and TM1 in Fzd4 plays an important role in Norrin signaling, and inclusion of this linker in the Fz4CRD-Fz6 construct may rescue the lack of Î²-catenin signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out that omission on our part, which we have now corrected. We have added a sentence in the Results section and a sentence in the Discussion section briefly summarizing the Bang et al. results and indicating that they are consistent with what we report in Figure 1F and G.</p></body></sub-article></article>
