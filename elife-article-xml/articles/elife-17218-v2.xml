renew epithelia, shape organs, and enlarge BM openings. How BM sliding is controlled, however, is poorly understood. Using genetic and live cell imaging approaches during uterine-vulval attachment in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we have discovered that the invasive uterine anchor cell activates Notch signaling in neighboring uterine cells at the boundary of the BM gap through which it invades to promote BM sliding. Through an RNAi screen, we found that Notch activation upregulates expression of <italic>ctg-1</italic>, which encodes a Sec14-GOLD protein, a member of the Sec14 phosphatidylinositol-transfer protein superfamily that is implicated in vesicle trafficking. Through photobleaching, targeted knockdown, and cell-specific rescue, our results suggest that CTG-1 restricts BM adhesion receptor DGN-1 (dystroglycan) trafficking to the cell-BM interface, which promotes BM sliding. Together, these studies reveal a new morphogenetic signaling pathway that controls BM sliding to remodel tissues.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17218.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17218.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17218.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All tissues in the human body are encased with a thin, dense, web of proteins called the basement membrane. These membranes separate and help shape tissues, while protecting them from mechanical damage such as stretching. However, despite serving as important barriers, basement membranes must be rapidly removed at specific times and places to allow tissues to grow and change shape. This process also permits cells to enter and leave tissues, such as immune cells when they search for disease-producing agents. This creates a paradox: how does a tissue create a tough, impassable barrier that can also be rapidly removed at specific times and places?</p><p>Recent research has shown that basement membranes can slide over a tissue, and thus rapidly move the barriers to create openings for tissue growth and reshaping. However, it was not known how the cells within tissues that are normally firmly attached to basement membrane control when and where basement membrane can slide.</p><p>Now, McClatchey, Wang et al. have carefully observed the tissues and basement membranes in a small worm called <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> under a microscope. This revealed that a single cell, called the anchor cell, relays a signal that instructs a group of neighboring cells to let go of the basement membrane at a specific time to allow tissue reshaping. Further experiments revealed that this signal causes cells to reduce the amount of a protein named dystroglycan at their surface.</p><p>Dystroglycan is present in most tissues and helps stick the cells of tissues to basement membranes. The loss of dystroglycan was previously reported to promote the spread of cancer, although its role in cancer progression was not clear. The findings of McClatchey, Wang et al. now suggest that tumors that lose dystroglycan might allow the basement membranes surrounding them to slide, creating openings that allow the cancers to spread.</p><p>Finally, McClatchey, Wang et al. also found that a protein named CTG-1, one of a family of proteins thought to regulate the movement of proteins within cells, restricts the levels of dystroglycan at cell surface. As such, the next challenge will be to understand exactly how CTG-1 limits the amount of dystroglycan at the cell surface.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17218.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17218.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>basement membrane</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>Notch signaling</kwd><kwd>Sec14 family phospholipid transfer protein</kwd><kwd>dystroglycan</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM079320</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sherwood</surname><given-names>David R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM100083</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sherwood</surname><given-names>David R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sherwood</surname><given-names>David R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A Notch-mediated signaling pathway upregulates a Sec14-GOLD phosphopholipid binding protein that promotes a morphogenetic process important in tissue remodeling and renewal.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The basement membrane (BM) is a cell-associated, dense, sheet-like form of extracellular matrix that underlies all epithelia and endothelial tissue, and surrounds muscle, fat, and Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Halfter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yurchenco, 2011</xref>). BMs are built on polymeric laminin and type IV collagen networks that arose at the time of animal multicellularity, and may have been required for the evolution of complex tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hynes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ozbek et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with this idea, BMs provide tissues with mechanical support, barrier functions, and cues for polarization, differentiation and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breitkreutz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hay, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Poschl et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rasmussen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Suh and Miner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yurchenco, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although it was generally thought that cell-BM interactions are static, live imaging studies have revealed that cell-BM interfaces are highly dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morrissey and Sherwood, 2015</xref>). One of the most dramatic examples of this mobility is cell-BM sliding, during which epithelial cell layers and their underlying BM sheets move (slide) along one another independently to regulate tissue remodeling or renewal. Examples of cell-BM sliding are varied and include egg chamber rotation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where the follicle cells move along BM and deposit constricting strips of aligned type IV collagen, which direct egg elongation along the anterior-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cetera and Horne-Badovinac, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haigo and Bilder, 2011</xref>). During salivary gland growth in vertebrates, the BM slides away from the bud tip toward the duct, allowing bud expansion while restricting growth at the duct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harunaga et al., 2014</xref>). Further, BM labeling and pulse chase experiments revealed that intestinal epithelial cells derived from the stem cell crypt slide along the BM towards the villus tips during differentiation to rapidly renew the gut epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clevers, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Trier et al., 1990</xref>). Cell-BM sliding may be a common morphogenetic process that regulates organ shaping during development, tissue homeostasis, and diseases such as cancer, where remodeling of cell-BM interfaces frequently occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kelley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rowe and Weiss, 2008</xref>). Because of the challenge of visualizing and experimentally examining dynamic cell-BM interactions in vivo, however, mechanisms controlling cell-BM sliding remain largely unknown.</p><p>An experimentally tractable model to examine cell-BM sliding during tissue remodeling is uterine-vulval attachment in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schindler and Sherwood, 2013</xref>), a developmental process that is necessary for effective mating and egg laying in the worm. During the mid-L3 larval stage, the uterine-vulval connection is initiated by a specialized uterine cell, the anchor cell (AC), that breaches the BM that separate these tissues and attaches to the underlying vulval cells. Following AC invasion, the gap in the BM widens further, which allows additional connection between uterine and vulval cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ihara et al., 2011</xref>). BM gap widening does not involve BM degradation. Instead, optical highlighting of BM and manipulation of tissue dynamics has shown that growth and morphogenesis of the uterine and vulval tissues generate forces on the BM that drive BM sliding over the vulval and uterine cells to further expand the gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ihara et al., 2011</xref>). The vulval cells have a key role in controlling the extent of BM movement. The centrally located vulval E and F cells, which contact the BM gap boundary, undergo precisely timed divisions to initiate BM sliding--cell rounding during divisions dramatically reduces cell contact with the BM and allows the BM to slide over the vulE and F cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matus et al., 2014</xref>). The BM stops sliding on the non-dividing vulD cell, which concentrates the BM adhesion receptor INA-1/PAT-3 (integrin) to stabilize the BM gap boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ihara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matus et al., 2014</xref>). While vulval cell divisions control BM sliding on the vulval side of the uterine-vulval connection, the role of the uterine π cells, which flank the AC, and sit on the opposing side of the BM gap boundary, remain unclear.</p><p>Many receptors bind BM components and are possible regulators of BM sliding. Two of the most prominent classes of adhesion receptors that link BM to the cytoskeleton are integrin family members and the receptor dystroglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kramer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yurchenco, 2011</xref>). Most studies have focused on how these receptors are activated or upregulated to strengthen adhesion; however there is a growing appreciation of the importance of integrin and dystroglycan downregulation in morphogenetic, homeostatic, and disease processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouvard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nakaya et al., 2013</xref>). Cells utilize a variety of mechanisms to reduce BM receptor adhesion. These include transcriptional downregulation, production of negative regulators that interfere with receptor activation, alterations in phosphorylation status, and changes in localization and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouvard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nakaya et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Poulton and Deng, 2006</xref>). Whether these strategies are used to modulate adhesion to control BM sliding is unknown.</p><p>To address how the uterine BM gap boundary cells control BM sliding during uterine-vulval attachment in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we carried out a mutagenesis screen. Through this screen we identified a putative null mutant in the gene encoding the LIN-29 protein, which is a Kruppel-family EGR (early growth response) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harris and Horvitz, 2011</xref>), that is deficient in BM sliding. We show that LIN-29 is expressed and functions in the invading AC to promote BM sliding. We further find that LIN-29 regulates BM sliding through its role in maintaining AC expression of LAG-2, a transmembrane Notch ligand, which activates Notch signaling in the neighboring BM gap boundary cells, the uterine π cells that sit on BM next to the nascent breach. Through a targeted uterine-specific RNAi screen of putative direct Notch targets, we find that Notch activation in these uterine cells upregulates <italic>ctg-1</italic> expression, which encodes a Sec14-GOLD domain phosphatidylinositol transfer protein that belongs to a class of proteins implicated in regulating vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grabon et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, using photobleaching, CRISPR/Cas-9 targeted knockout, and cell-specific rescue experiments, we demonstrate that CTG-1 functions in the uterine π cells to limit the cell surface trafficking of DGN-1 (dystroglycan), and that reduction of DGN-1 is sufficient to promote BM sliding. Together these studies identify a new morphogenetic pathway—from signaling mechanism to effector—that promotes BM sliding, which can be used by invasive cells to enlarge BM openings and allow the direct interaction of cells between tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Summary of AC invasion and BM gap expansion</title><p>During larval development, the uterine and vulval tissues in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are initially separated by the juxtaposed gonadal and ventral BMs. A specialized uterine cell, the AC, breaches these BMs during the mid-L3 larval stage to initiate uterine-vulval connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sherwood and Sternberg, 2003</xref>). AC invasion and BM remodeling occur in tight coordination with vulval development and can be staged according to the centrally located 1° fated P6.p vulval precursor cell (VPC) divisions. During invasion (P6.p 2 and 4-cell stages) the gonadal and ventral BMs are breached and fuse at the edges of the invading AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ihara et al., 2011</xref>). Following AC invasion, the vulval cells grow, invaginate, and divide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ihara et al., 2011</xref>). The rapid expansion and invagination of the vulval cells generate forces on the BM that promote expansion of the nascent BM opening through BM sliding over the vulval and uterine cells that sit at the boundary of the BM gap. Expansion of the BM gap allows direct contact between the cells that mediate uterine-vulval attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ihara et al., 2011</xref>). Precisely timed divisions of the BM gap boundary vulval P6.p descendants (the vulE and vulF cells) during the late L3 stage reduce BM adhesion, allowing the BM to slide over these dividing vulval cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matus et al., 2014</xref>). The BM gap halts its expansion over the non-dividing vulD cells during the early L4 stage (P6.p 8-cell stage); the vulD cells further stabilize the BM gap boundary by upregulating the integrin heterodimer INA-1/PAT-3 and the adhesion regulator VAB-19 (the worm ortholog of Kank) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ihara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matus et al., 2014</xref>). The ventral uterine (VU) cells neighboring the AC are also initially in contact with the BM. During the time of AC invasion, the adjacent six VU cells are specified to adopt a π fate through LAG-2/LIN-12 (Notch) signaling by the AC. During BM sliding the uterine π cells undergo one round of division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Newman, 1995</xref>). The role of the π cells, the uterine BM gap boundary cells, in regulating BM sliding is unknown.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17218.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>BM sliding during uterine-vulval connection and isolation of <italic>lin-29(qy1).</italic></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top left: During the mid-L3 larval stage (vulval P6.p 2-cell stage), the uterine anchor cell (AC) breaches the juxtaposed gonadal and ventral BMs (green) and contacts the central 1° fated vulval precursor cells (VPCs; P6.px cells, red).

BM sliding allows direct connection between vulE and F cells with uterine π cells, which form the mature uterine-vulval connection.

Isolated Pvl mutants were then examined at high magnification (1000x) using differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy at the early L4 stage when BM position can be visualized as a phase dense line separating the uterine and vulval tissue. Through this screen we identified 10 mutants with defects in BM remodeling during uterine-vulval attachment (see Materials and methods). We focused on the mutant <italic>qy1</italic>, which had a highly penetrant defect in the BM gap expansion after the AC invasion (see below).</p><p>To determine the molecular nature of the <italic>qy1</italic> mutation, we used a single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) based mapping strategy and complementation analysis (see Experimental Procedures; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davis et al., 2005</xref>). Using this strategy, we mapped the causative mutation of the <italic>qy1</italic> allele to <italic>lin-29</italic>, which encodes a Kruppel-family EGR zinc-finger protein transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harris and Horvitz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rougvie and Ambros, 1995</xref>). We sequenced the <italic>qy1</italic> allele and found that it introduces a nonsense mutation near the start of the region encoding the DNA binding domain in all three known isoforms of the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As this disrupts translation prior to the previously characterized null allele <italic>lin-29(n546)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rougvie and Ambros, 1995</xref>), it suggests that <italic>qy1</italic> is a null allele of the <italic>lin-29</italic> gene.</p><p>To better visualize and precisely quantify the BM gap defect after the loss of <italic>lin-29</italic>, we crossed integrated transgenes expressing a functional fusion of the main structural BM component laminin to GFP (laminin::GFP) and an AC membrane marker (<italic>cdh-3</italic> &gt; mCherry::PLCδ<sup>PH</sup>) into <italic>lin-29(qy1)</italic> mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Laminin::GFP shows the same localization as immunolocalized laminin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sherwood and Sternberg, 2003</xref>). To quantify the BM gap defect, we measured the diameter of the BM gap at the early L4 (P6.p 8-cell stage) in the plane where the AC is in focus in wild type and <italic>qy1</italic> worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The gap in the BM was significantly reduced in <italic>qy1</italic> mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Further, we found that that while in wild type animals, the BM moved away from both the anterior and posterior sides of the AC in most animals (n = 13/20 animals; the remaining 7 moved on one side), in <italic>qy1</italic> animals the BM never moved away from both sides of the AC (n = 0/20 animals) and only occasionally moved slightly away from one side (n = 5/20 animals).</p><p>We postulated that the defect in BM position in <italic>lin-29</italic> mutant animals could result from the absence of BM sliding or alternatively the inappropriate deposition of new BM after sliding. To differentiate between these possibilities we directly examined BM sliding by performing optical highlighting experiments using transgenic animals expressing laminin tagged with the photoconvertible fluorophore Dendra (laminin::Dendra; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ihara et al., 2011</xref>). Dendra is a stable, photoconvertible fluorescent protein that irreversibly switches from green to red following exposure to short wavelength light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gurskaya et al., 2006</xref>). Segments of the BM adjacent to the invading AC were photoconverted at the P6.p 4-cell stage and imaged at the P6.p 8-cell stage. While marked edges of the BM gap moved away from the AC and rested over the vulD cell in wild type animals (n = 10/10 animals), optically highlighted segments maintained contact with the AC in <italic>lin-29(qy1)</italic> mutants and failed to move over the vulD cell (n = 18/18 animals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These observations indicate that the BM in <italic>lin-29</italic> mutant animals fails to slide away from the AC and excludes additional BM deposition as a mechanism for the defect.

We detected a significant increase in the localization of DGN-1 at the cell-BM interface in the π cells of <italic>lin-29</italic> mutants compared to wild type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>). This difference was not a result of increased expression, as the transcriptional reporter for <italic>dgn-1</italic> was similarly expressed in <italic>lin-29</italic> mutants and wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In addition, the localization of DGN-1 in regions beyond the edges of the BM gap (over the vulD cell) were similar in <italic>lin-29</italic> and wild type, indicating that the alteration in DGN-1 localization was specific to the region of BM sliding near the AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). FRAP experiments indicated that DGN-1 recovered more quickly after photobleaching in <italic>lin-29</italic> mutants versus wild type animals, which may account for the increased DGN-1::GFP localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F,G</xref>). Faster recovery of DGN-1 at the cell-BM interface in <italic>lin-29</italic> mutants could indicate more rapid cell surface trafficking, slower endocytosis/removal, or faster lateral plasma membrane mobility. Notably, the number of DGN-1 containing Rab-7 marked late endosome vesicles in <italic>lin-29</italic> mutants and wild type animals was similar, suggesting that CTG-1 might not direct rapid removal of DGN-1 from the cell surface into the endosomal system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). There was, however, a reduction of F-actin at the basal surface in the π cells in <italic>lin-29</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>). As F-actin is thought to act as a barrier to exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eitzen, 2003</xref>), these observations support the idea of increased DGN-1 delivery to the cell surface. Given the association of the GOLD domain, Sec14 proteins, and PI4-kinase regulation with vesicle trafficking, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anantharaman and Aravind, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clayton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mousley et al., 2007</xref>), CTG-1 may direct a specific trafficking pathway that restricts the delivery of DGN-1 to the cell-BM interface. Importantly, these observations do not rule out the possibility that CTG-1 enhances endocytic removal from the cell surface at levels that we were unable to detect or that it regulates the membrane mobility of DGN-1 to limit DGN-1 at the cell-BM interface.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17218.027</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>LIN-29/CTG-1 restricts dystroglycan (DGN-1) levels and trafficking at the π cell-BM interface.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A functional translational fusion of the BM-receptor DGN-1 (DGN-1::GFP, top) reveals that more DGN-1 localizes on the surface of the ventral uterine cells (blue dashed outlines) at the edges of the BM gap in a <italic>lin-29</italic> mutant compared to a wild type animal.

How BM sliding is controlled, however, remains poorly understood. We show here that the AC in <italic>C. elegans</italic> further widens a breach it creates in BM during uterine-vulval attachment by promoting BM sliding in neighboring uterine cells. LIN-29 maintains the expression of the Notch ligand LAG-2 in the AC, which leads to the activation of Notch signaling and induction of uterine π cell fate in the neighboring cells that sit over the nascent BM gap boundary. Notch activation in turn leads to upregulation of the Sec14 family phospholipid transfer protein CTG-1 in these BM gap boundary cells, which restricts trafficking of the receptor DGN-1 (dystroglycan) to the cell-BM interace. Our data suggest that the proper regulation of DGN-1 trafficking modulates cell-BM adhesion and allows the BM slide, which further widens the BM breach. This work reveals a new morphogenetic signaling pathway that promotes cell-BM sliding (See Summary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17218.041</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Summary of uterine boundary cell regulation of BM sliding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic diagram of the mid L3 stage in wild type (left). The Kruppel-family EGR protein LIN-29 acts in the AC to maintain LAG-2 (Notch ligand) expression, which induces the π cell fate in the six VU cells that contact the AC.

During uterine-vulval attachment in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the linked ventral and gonadal BMs slide over vulval and uterine cells to expand the BM gap, and the vulval cells also appear to move (through migration and invagination) inside the gap to form direct contacts with uterine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ihara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schindler and Sherwood, 2013</xref>). It has previously been shown that vulval cell divisions at the BM gap boundary controls BM sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matus et al., 2014</xref>). During vulval invagination and growth, the centrally located vulE and F cells divide and reduce their contact with the BM during cell rounding, allowing the BM to slide over these cells. The BM ultimately ceases sliding and the BM gap boundary stabilizes on the non-dividing vulD cell. Blocking the divisions of vulE and F halts BM sliding prematurely resulting in a narrower BM gap, while inducing vulD divisions causes the BM to slide further and enlarges the opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matus et al., 2014</xref>). Here we have found that uterine cells at the BM gap boundary regulate BM movement through a distinct mechanism independent of cell division. Uterine π cell divisions are not coordinated with vulval cell divisions during BM movement. Further, blocking uterine π cell divisions did not halt BM sliding. Instead, through a forward genetic screen, site of action, and expression studies, our data indicate that the invading AC directs a morphogenetic signaling program that promotes BM sliding in neighboring uterine cells: (1) the AC expresses the transcription factor LIN-29, (2) LIN-29 activates Notch signaling and induction of the π cell fate in neighboring uterine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Newman et al., 2000</xref>), (3) as a part of π cell fate induction, Notch activation upregulates <italic>ctg-1,</italic> which restricts trafficking of the BM adhesion receptor DGN-1 (dystroglycan) to the cell-BM interface and allows BM sliding. Together, these observations suggest that after AC invasion, the uterine π cells loosen BM adhesion, allowing the BM to slide along the π cells to a precise site determined by the dividing vulE and F cells and non-dividing vulD. This model is supported by the observed flexibility of BM boundary position, which can be adjusted by manipulating vulval cell divisions. The distinct, but temporally coordinated, mechanisms controlling BM movement in the uterine and vulval cells precisely position the BM gap boundary to ensure robust uterine-vulval attachment.</p><p>Very few examples of gene regulatory networks guiding morphogenetic cellular behaviors leading to cell fate specification are known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christiaen et al., 2008</xref>). Using a focused RNAi screen we found that <italic>ctg-1</italic>, which encodes a Sec14 family phosphatidylinositol-transfer protein (PITP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tripathi et al., 2014</xref>), is a crucial target of Notch signaling during π cell fate specification that promotes BM sliding. Consistent with <italic>ctg-1</italic> being a direct transcriptional target of Notch, the <italic>ctg-1</italic> upstream regulatory region contains 19 predicted binding sites for the Notch transcriptional activator LAG-1 (Suppressor of Hairless) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yoo, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>ctg-1</italic> expression is upregulated in the π cells at the time of activated LIN-12 (Notch) signaling, and its expression is dependent on LIN-29-directed Notch signaling. In addition, uterine-cell specific RNAi and genetic loss of <italic>ctg-1</italic> reduced BM sliding, which phenocopies loss of Notch signaling in these cells. Sec14 family PITPs are unlikely to be true carriers of phospholipids. Instead, studies suggest that Sec14 family PITPs function as scaffolds or nanoreactors that present phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase (PI4K) to regulate specific protein and membrane trafficking pathways in the trans-Golgi and endosomal recycling system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cockcroft and Garner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Curwin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Curwin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mousley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schaaf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tripathi et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this notion, our work also indicates that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> PI4K, <italic>pifk-1</italic>, is required in the uterine cells to promote BM sliding.</p><p>The Sec14 family has expanded significantly in multicellular eukaryotes. Whereas yeast have six Sec14 family members, we found <italic>C. elegans</italic> has at least 16 and vertebrates have at least 20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bankaitis et al., 2010</xref>). Little, however, is known about the cellular process controlled by many these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grabon et al., 2015</xref>). Our work suggests that CTG-1 regulates the trafficking of DGN-1(dystroglycan) to the cell surface and promotes de-adhesion from BM to control BM sliding. Notably, localization and photobleaching studies indicate that the integrin heterodimer INA-1/PAT-3, another key BM receptor, was unaffected by loss of <italic>ctg-1</italic>, suggesting that CTG-1 function is highly specific. Loss of LIN-29-mediated Notch signaling (and thus <italic>ctg-1</italic> expression in the uterine cells) led to an increase of DGN-1 on the surface of uterine cells, but did not alter <italic>dgn-1</italic> gene expression. Photobleaching experiments in wild type and <italic>lin-29</italic> mutants (lack upregulation of <italic>ctg-1</italic>) indicated that <italic>ctg-1</italic> expression in the π cells restricts the rate of DGN-1 trafficking to the cell-BM interface. Interestingly, in CTG-1 the Sec14 domain is paired with a GOLD (Golgi Dynamics) domain, which, though its function has yet to be completely characterized, may regulate the selection of proteins being trafficked from the Golgi, thus affecting their secretion to the plasma membrane or routing to the endosome-lysosomal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anantharaman and Aravind, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schimmoller et al., 1995</xref>). These results suggest that CTG-1 might reduce cell-BM adhesion by regulating a vesicular pathway with specificity for DGN-1, possibly slowing DGN-1 delivery to the cell surface or directing it to the endosome-lysosome system. The function of Sec14-GOLD proteins is poorly understood, and CTG-1 does not show strong localization to any specific domain in the uterine π cells. Thus, we cannot rule out possible functions for CTG-1 in mediating increased removal of DGN-1 from the cell surface or slowing lateral plasma membrane trafficking to restrict DGN-1 at the cell-BM interface. While the specific mechanism by which CTG-1 restricts DGN-1 trafficking remains unclear, we found that reduction of DGN-1 restored BM sliding in the absence of <italic>ctg-1,</italic> strongly supporting the functional significance of reduced localization and trafficking of DGN-1.</p><p>The two most prominent BM receptors that transduce signals and link the cells’ cytoskeleton to the BM are integrin heterodimers and dystroglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yurchenco, 2011</xref>). Unlike mammals, which construct 24 known αβ integrin heterodimers, <italic>C. elegans</italic> make only two, and only one of these, αINA-1/βPAT-3, is expressed with DGN-1 (dystroglycan) in the uterine π cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hagedorn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ihara et al., 2011</xref>). Integrin and dystroglycan are co-expressed widely, and likely have many distinct roles, such as having opposing effects on extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferletta et al., 2003</xref>). However, how these proteins interact and coordinate functions in regulating cell-BM communication and adhesion has been challenging to elucidate as a result of tissue complexity and the large family of integrin heterodimers in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nakaya et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, our data suggest that INA-1/PAT-3 is not downregulated to promote BM sliding in the uterine π cells. Further, unlike loss of <italic>dgn-1</italic>, uterine-specific loss of <italic>ina-1</italic> did not rescue BM sliding in the <italic>lin-29</italic> mutant background. Our results indicate that DGN-1 is the primary BM adhesion receptor that controls cell-BM sliding in the uterine π cells, while integrin appears to have a function(s) independent of BM sliding in these cells. These results suggest that different BM receptors may allow cells to have diverse and concurrent signaling and adhesive interactions with BM.</p><p>While dystroglycan has been most extensively studied in its association with the dystrophin complex and muscular dystrophies, it is broadly expressed and implicated in regulating many cellular processes, including BM assembly, cell migration, axon outgrowth, retinal layering, and Schwann cell wrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moore and Winder, 2010</xref>). Notably, dystroglycan is also required for branching morphogenesis in glandular epithelium, a process that is thought to require BM sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Durbeej et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harunaga et al., 2014</xref>). Further, it has been shown that loss of basally localized dystroglycan during chick gastrulation promotes breakdown of BMs during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that forms mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakaya et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, dystroglycan may have a fundamental role in mediating BM remodeling events during development. Importantly, loss or reduction of dystroglycan is also emerging as a common event in the progression of epithelial derived cancers, including breast, prostate, colon, cervical, and renal adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cross et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Esser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sgambato et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2006</xref>). As regulated loss or reduction of dystroglycan during development creates and widens BM gaps through BM loss and sliding, uncontrolled loss of dystroglyan during cancer progression may lead to the breakdown of BM barriers to facilitate tumor spread. Thus, understanding mechanisms that control dystroglycan levels at the cell surface are not only important in understanding tissue morphogenesis, but may provide new strategies to halt cancer progression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm strains</title><p>Worms were reared under standard conditions at 15°C, 20°C, or 25°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Vytas Bankaitis (Reviewer #2) and Kenneth Yamada (Reviewer #3), and the evaluation has been overseen by Janet Rossant as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors use powerful forward genetics, gene silencing, cell ablation and imaging methods to investigate BM sliding in the worm. The question is of general interest as tissue development and organogenesis relies on accurate control of the sliding of epithelial cells along BMs, yet little is known about how the sliding process is regulated. In this work, the authors systematically investigate the BM sliding process in the context of uterine-vulval attachment. The experiments described are logical, systematic and convincingly demonstrate that the invasive uterine AC communicates with neighboring uterine cells to activate a Notch signaling pathway whose major target in the pathway is a Sec14-GOLD protein of previously unknown function. FRAP data suggest that the Sec14-GOLD protein specifically and negatively regulates dystroglycan trafficking to the cell surface. It is modulation of the BM adhesion activity of the cell surface dystroglycan pool that regulates BM sliding at the BM gap boundary.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The data leading to identification of the CTG-1 Sec14-GOLD protein as the main target of Notch signaling in the vulva-uterine BM sliding pathway are comprehensive and beautiful. Those alone make a very nice story and revisions needed are mostly minor. However, the true novelty of the work is that a biological function is described for a Sec14-GOLD protein. Although a number of Sec14 proteins are very well understood from biological and structural perspectives in yeast and in plants (a point miscast by the authors in their general discussions of the topic), the Sec14-GOLD proteins are poorly understood. Where this work could make truly unique inroads is in characterizing how CTG-1 functions. They do not take full advantage of this opportunity. The following comments are suggested to the authors for strengthening this work.</p><p>A) Regarding CTG-1, the interpretations offered in this manuscript for how this protein works largely follow those of those yeast studies. But, Sec14 and other Sec14-like proteins also stimulate the activities of the Stt4 family of PI4kinases. Is the BM phenotype the authors report for <italic>pifk</italic> silencing specific or is it a general phenotype of PI4K knockdown? How about PI4P 5-kinase knockdown?</p><p>B) It is not clear that the FRAP data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> demonstrate enhanced trafficking of dystroglycan to the cell surface. That interpretation implies that CTG-1 is regulating a cargo-specific trafficking pathway to the plasma membrane. While certainly possible, the authors need to repeat the experiment with another cargo not involved in the process (Ina1, Pat2?) in the FRAP experiment as control.</p><p>C) As follow-up to (B), it seems the FRAP experiments do not exclude a role for CTG-1 in dystroglycan endocytosis. The dystroglycan FRAP data are consistent with more exocytosis or just more rapid recycling or more lateral diffusion – these need to be considered.</p><p>Cargo-specific endocytic systems are at least as likely a mechanism as cargo-specific forward trafficking pathways. In that regard, what effect do CTG-1 mutations have on the actin cytoskeleton? The phosphoinositide-actin-endocytosis axis is an attractive one to consider.</p><p>If you can add experimental data to address more completely the function of CTG-1, it would strengthen the impact of the paper. However, this may take longer than the two months that <italic>eLife</italic> allows for revisions. The reviewers are generally positive about the paper and so would be prepared to re-review a revised manuscript that addresses some of the issues.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Boundary cells restrict dystroglycan trafficking to control basement membrane sliding during tissue remodeling&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>Both reviewers are happy with your revisions and the paper is almost ready for acceptance. There are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) There are two concerns with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. The first is that it is quite pixelated, even on the original eps file; can the authors find a better-quality substitute? The second, much more significant concern is that upon further examination, the left bracket for wild type may show an incorrectly wide gap. Although the laminin grayscale image is not shown, the overlay shows white or gray at the upper right rather than green, which means that the magenta (laminin) is co-localizing with the green. Consequently, the right bracket should be significantly further to the left. If the authors disagree, they could resolve this type of concern by showing data from the laminin-staining channel by itself. In that regard, for their quantifications, did the authors measure such single-channel data as opposed to this type of less-definitive merged image?</p><p>2) In the last paragraph of the subsection “LIN-29/AC-mediated uterine π cell fate specification is required for BM sliding”: &quot;likely do to&quot; should read &quot;likely due to&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17218.046</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>The data leading to identification of the CTG-1 Sec14-GOLD protein as the main target of Notch signaling in the vulva-uterine BM sliding pathway are comprehensive and beautiful. Those alone make a very nice story and revisions needed are mostly minor. However, the true novelty of the work is that a biological function is described for a Sec14-GOLD protein. Although a number of Sec14 proteins are very well understood from biological and structural perspectives in yeast and in plants (a point miscast by the authors in their general discussions of the topic), the Sec14-GOLD proteins are poorly understood. Where this work could make truly unique inroads is in characterizing how CTG-1 functions. They do not take full advantage of this opportunity.</italic> </p><p>To address the important point about <italic>ctg-1</italic> encoding a Sec14-GOLD protein (a distinction we only eluded to in the Discussion) in the Abstract, Results section and Discussion we have more specifically delineated this point, including annotating how many Sec14 family members in <italic>C. elegans</italic> contain a GOLD domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD23-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>The following comments are suggested to the authors for strengthening this work.</italic> </p><p><italic>A) Regarding CTG-1, the interpretations offered in this manuscript for how this protein works largely follow those of those yeast studies. But, Sec14 and other Sec14-like proteins also stimulate the activities of the Stt4 family of PI4kinases. Is the BM phenotype the authors report for pifk silencing specific or is it a general phenotype of PI4K knockdown? How about PI4P 5-kinase knockdown?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for these essential revisions and agree that we need to expand our analysis of CTG-1 function in relation to PIP4 kinases and PIP species in general. In our submitted work, we used blind analysis of basement membrane (BM) sliding (see below) to examine RNAi knockdown (in a uterine-specific RNAi sensitive strain) targeting three PIP4-kinases--<italic>pifk-1</italic> (ortholog to <italic>Four wheel drive (Fwd)</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, yeast Pik1, and vertebrate PI4KIIIβ), C56A3.8 (vertebrate PI4KII⟨/®) and ZC8.8 (vertebrate PI4KIIα/β).</p><p>To address these essential revisions, we made a new RNAi clone that targeted the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gene Y75B8A.24, which blast searches identified as the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Stt4 PIP4K ortholog. We also used an RNAi vector from our RNAi library (that was sequenced for verification) targeting <italic>ppk-1</italic>, the only <italic>C. elegans</italic> PI5K (Weinkove et al., 2008, Dev Biol 384-97). RNAi targeting <italic>ppk-1</italic> should reduce PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> production. In blind analysis, loss of both C56A3.8 and <italic>ppk-1</italic> in the uterine cells did not alter BM sliding, suggesting that neither is a downstream effector of CTG-1 function in the uterine π cells. This new data is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>. We have also added the following text to the paper:</p><p>To the Results section entitled, “LIN-29/CTG-1 reduces dystroglycan localization and trafficking in the π cells”at the end of paragraph one:</p><p>“To determine whether CTG-1 might regulate BM sliding through a PI4-kinase, we examined uterine-cell specific RNAi-mediated knockdown of the four PI4-kinases encoded in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome. […] As Sec14 and Pik1/ PI4KIIIβ are implicated as regulators of vesicle trafficking (Clayton et al., 2013; Sciorra et al., 2005), we hypothesized that <italic>ctg-1</italic> might be upregulated in the π cells to alter the trafficking and localization of BM adhesion receptor proteins to promote BM sliding.”</p><p>We also included the orthologs of the PI4-kinases that we examined in the figure legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref> as follows:</p><p>“(A) Quantification of the BM gap size after treatment with L4440 control and uterine-specific <italic>pifk-1</italic> (yeast Pik1 and vertebrate PI4KIIIβ) RNAi, C56A3.8 (vertebrate PI4KIIα/β) RNAi, and ZC8.6 (vertebrate PI4KIIα/β) RNAi (n = 34 each), (B) Quantification of the BM gap size after treatment with L4440 control and uterine-specific Y75B8A.24 (vertebrate PI4KIIIα) (n = 34 each) RNAi, and (C) Quantification of the BM gap size after treatment with L4440 control and uterine-specific <italic>ppk-1</italic> (vertebrate type I PIP 5-Kinase) RNAi (n = 40 each) revealed that only <italic>pifk-1</italic> is required for BM sliding. (*** indicates P &lt; 0.001 Wilcoxon rank sum test).”</p><p><italic>B) It is not clear that the FRAP data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> demonstrate enhanced trafficking of dystroglycan to the cell surface. That interpretation implies that CTG-1 is regulating a cargo-specific trafficking pathway to the plasma membrane. While certainly possible, the authors need to repeat the experiment with another cargo not involved in the process (Ina1, Pat2?) in the FRAP experiment as control.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers about the importance of testing whether the FRAP data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> indicates a specific role for CTG-1 in dystroglycan trafficking at the cell surface. We actually performed the reviewers’ suggested experiment for FRAP on the integrin heterodimer PAT-3/INA-1 (one of two integrins in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and the only integrin heterodimer expressed in the π cells) using the functional expression reporter PAT-3::GFP/INA-1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). We clearly did not do an adequate job of bringing our reviewers/readers attention to this important experiment. We have thus added the following to the paper to make this experiment more prominent:</p><p>We added to the ending of the second paragraph in the Results section entitled, “LIN-29/CTG-1 reduces dystroglycan localization and trafficking in the π cells”:</p><p>“These experiments indicate that CTG-1 does not regulate INA-1/PAT-3 localization or trafficking in the π cells to promote BM sliding.”</p><p>To emphasize the specific nature of CTG-1 in regulating DGN-1 trafficking, we have also added the following to the last sentence of the third paragraph of this section of the Results:</p><p>“These results suggest that LIN-29 activity in the AC leads to LAG-2/LIN-12 (Notch)-mediated upregulation of ctg-1 expression in the uterine π cells that specifically restricts the cell surface trafficking and accumulation of the BM receptor DGN-1.”</p><p>To further emphasize the FRAP data, in the Discussion section, fourth paragraph, we also added the following underlined statement:</p><p>“Notably, localization and photobleaching studies indicated that the levels and trafficking of the integrin heterodimer INA-1/PAT-3, another key BM receptor, was unaffected by loss of <italic>ctg-1</italic>.”</p><p><italic>C) As follow-up to (B), it seems the FRAP experiments do not exclude a role for CTG-1 in dystroglycan endocytosis. The dystroglycan FRAP data are consistent with more exocytosis or just more rapid recycling or more lateral diffusion – these need to be considered.</italic> </p><p><italic>Cargo-specific endocytic systems are at least as likely a mechanism as cargo-specific forward trafficking pathways. In that regard, what effect do CTG-1 mutations have on the actin cytoskeleton? The phosphoinositide-actin-endocytosis axis is an attractive one to consider.</italic> </p><p>This is a terrific point the reviewers bring up. In particular examining and broadening the possible mechanisms by which CTG-1 might restrict dystroglycan levels and trafficking at the cell surface is important to explore and acknowledge. This is particularly important, as the functions of Sec14-GOLD proteins are poorly understood. We have now examined the co-localization of DGN-1 with Rab-7, a marker for the late endosome, and found no significant difference in the number of DGN-1 containing late endosomes. In addition, we have examined the localization of F-actin in the uterine π cells and discovered that there is less F-actin in <italic>lin-29</italic> mutants (– <italic>ctg-1</italic>) at the cell-BM interface compared with wild type animals. As cortical F-actin is thought to generally act as a barrier to secretion (Eitzen G., (2003) Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1641:175– 181), this observation is consistent with the idea that more DGN-1 may be delivered to the cell surface in <italic>lin-29</italic> mutants. However, reduced cortical F-actin might also promote more rapid lateral diffusion of DGN-1. Given the specificity of CTG-1 function in regulating DGN-1 trafficking (and not integrin) our data support the idea of a specific trafficking mechanism regulated by CTG-1 (either endocytosis, secretion or possibly lateral mobility). We have incorporated the new data into the manuscript and broadened our discussion on the possible function of CTG-1 in regulating DGN-1 trafficking as follows:</p><p>To account for the possibility that CTG-1 restricts lateral mobility, in the Abstractwe have changed:</p><p>“our results suggest that CTG-1 restricts BM adhesion receptor DGN-1 (dystroglycan) trafficking to the cell surface, which promotes BM sliding.”</p><p>To:</p><p>“our results suggest that CTG-1 restricts BM adhesion receptor DGN-1 (dystroglycan) trafficking to the cell-BM interface, which promotes BM sliding.”</p><p>In the Results section, “LIN-29/CTG-1 reduces dystroglycan localization and trafficking in the π cells”at the end of paragraph one:</p><p>“FRAP experiments indicated that DGN-1 recovered more quickly after photobleaching in <italic>lin-29</italic> mutants versus wild type animals, which may be responsible for the increased DGN-1::GFP localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F,G</xref>).[…] Importantly, these observations do not rule out the possibility that CTG-1 enhances endocytic removal from the cell surface at levels that we were unable to detect or that it regulates the membrane mobility of DGN-1 to limit DGN-1 at the cell-BM interface.”</p><p>In the Discussion section, paragraph four, we also added:</p><p>“Photobleaching experiments in wild type and <italic>lin-29</italic> mutants (which lack upregulation of <italic>ctg-1</italic>) indicated that <italic>ctg-1</italic> expression in the π cells restricts the rate of DGN-1 trafficking to the cell-BM interface. […]While the specific mechanism by which CTG-1 restricts DGN-1 trafficking remains unclear, we found that reduction of DGN-1 restored BM sliding in the absence of <italic>ctg-1</italic> strongly supporting the functional significance reduced localization and trafficking of DGN-1.”</p><p>In the Materials and methods section we have added the following to describe F-actin and Rab-7/DGN-1 quantification:</p><p>“F-actin quantification</p><p>Fluorescence intensities were measured as the mean gray values of 0.3- µm x 0.3- µm regions of interest selected either adjacent to the edge of the expanding BM gap or no longer in contact with the BM (past the zone of BM sliding) in the π cells at the P6.p 6-cell stage. […] RAB-7 and DGN-1 Co-localization</p><p>RAB-7::GFP positive vesicles were selected and marked using ImageJ. Regions of interest were then overlaid on images of corresponding DGN-1::mCherry and assessed for overlap.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>1) There are two concerns with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. The first is that it is quite pixelated, even on the original eps file; can the authors find a better-quality substitute? The second, much more significant concern is that upon further examination, the left bracket for wild type may show an incorrectly wide gap. Although the laminin grayscale image is not shown, the overlay shows white or gray at the upper right rather than green, which means that the magenta (laminin) is co-localizing with the green. Consequently, the right bracket should be significantly further to the left. If the authors disagree, they could resolve this type of concern by showing data from the laminin-staining channel by itself. In that regard, for their quantifications, did the authors measure such single-channel data as opposed to this type of less-definitive merged image?</italic> </p><p>First, we agree with the reviewers that the image presented in our manuscript is pixelated. Because the signal for laminin::mCherry is weak, images were acquired using pixel binning to maximize intensity. However, this led to a reduction in overall image quality. We have replaced the images in this figure with ones acquired under imaging conditions without binning using longer exposure times to resolve the pixilation issue.</p><p>Second, we thank the reviewers for their careful attention to our data pinpointing the boundaries of the BM gap. The reviewer has astutely noted that an area of signal exists (dashed arrow in the laminin::GFP grayscale <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>) to the left of the BM gap edge that we have identified (solid arrow). This isolated puncta of BM is a small piece of BM that was internalized during AC invasion and not the boundary of the BM that has slid. AC invasion involves physical forces that move and break up this barrier (Hagedorn et al., (2013) Journal of Cell Biol., 10; 201(6): 903-13) resulting in small portions of BM that are internalized or remain outside of the AC after invasion. We often see small puncta of isolated BM after AC invasion (for example see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> in Morrissey et al., PLOS Genetics, Feb 29; 12(2); e1005905 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> (internalized) and 1F (outside the AC) in Ihara et al., (2011) Nat Cell Biol. 13:641-651).</p><p>It is also important to point out that we have extensively characterized BM sliding and stabilization during uterine-vulval attachment and found that in wild type worms, as presented in the image in question, the BM gap edge always stabilizes over vulD (Ihara et al., (2011) Nat Cell Biol. 13:641-651 and Matus et al., (2011)Nat Commun. 5: 4184). In addition, the BM gap boundary displays increased laminin relative to the rest of the BM (Matus et al., (2011)Nat Commun. 5: 4184, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Neither the positioning, nor the relative intensity of the puncta in question is consistent with these characteristics of the BM gap edge.</p><p>We agree that measurement of merged, multi-channel images may obscure the edges of the BM gap and wish to reassure the reviewers that measurements were made on single-channel images for quantifications.</p><p>We have made the following changes to address these concerns:</p><p>We have replaced the images of vulval precursor morphology in wild type and <italic>lin-29</italic> mutants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> with higher quality (i.e., not pixelated) images.</p><p>We are presenting the grayscale image for the laminin::mCherry channel for the image appearing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> in the manuscript previously submitted on August 23, 2016 for further examination here (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>):<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17218.044</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B</bold>) Are the image panels from the manuscript submitted on August 23, 2016.</title><p>(<bold>C</bold>) The single-channel image of laminin::mCherry showing the BM gap edge (solid arrow) and a puncta of laminin signal to the left (dotted arrow) that is discontinuous from the rest of the BM.
