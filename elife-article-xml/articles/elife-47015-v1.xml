They are the main producers of ‘natural’ IgM, spontaneously secreted serum antibodies predominately reactive to self antigens, like phosphatidylcholine (PtC), or antigens expressed by the intestinal microbiota. The mechanisms that regulate the B-1a immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire and their antibody secretion remain poorly understood. Here, we use a novel reporter mouse to demonstrate that production of self- and microbiota-reactive antibodies is linked to BCR signaling in B-1a cells. Moreover, we show that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are critical for shaping the Ig repertoire of B-1a cells as well as regulating their antibody production. Strikingly, we find that both the colonization of a microbiota as well as microbial-sensing TLRs are required for anti-microbiota B-1a responses, whereas nucleic-acid sensing TLRs are required for anti-PtC responses, demonstrating that linked activation of BCR and TLRs controls steady state B-1a responses to both self and microbiota-derived antigens.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>B cells</kwd><kwd>microbiota</kwd><kwd>Toll-like receptors</kwd><kwd>antibodies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI142926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kreuk</surname><given-names>Lieselotte SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Koch</surname><given-names>Meghan A</given-names></name><name><surname>Slayden</surname><given-names>Leianna C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lind</surname><given-names>Nicholas A</given-names></name><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>Sophia</given-names></name><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>Gregory M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI063302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kreuk</surname><given-names>Lieselotte SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Koch</surname><given-names>Meghan A</given-names></name><name><surname>Slayden</surname><given-names>Leianna C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lind</surname><given-names>Nicholas A</given-names></name><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>Sophia</given-names></name><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>Gregory M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM007232-36</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kreuk</surname><given-names>Lieselotte SM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI100829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kreuk</surname><given-names>Lieselotte SM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Microbial-sensing TLRs drive responses to the microbiota, while nucleic-acid sensing TLRs control responses to endogenous ligands, revealing novel regulation of B-1a responses through integrated BCR/TLR mediated activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>B-1a cells were discovered 35 years ago and have characteristics that bridge the innate and adaptive immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herzenberg et al., 1986</xref>).

More recently B-1a cells have been implicated as a source of microbiota-reactive, class-switched IgG and IgA antibodies, which are important for intestinal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kroese et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kroese et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lalor, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kroese et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bos et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Macpherson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Savage et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>B-1a cell-derived antibodies are often reactive with self epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayakawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mercolino et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). For example, the most common B-1a specificity is for phosphatidylcholine (PtC), a phospholipid present within the plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mercolino et al., 1988</xref>). Other specificities include nucleic acids, LPS, and carbohydrates. Early studies from Hayakawa and colleagues showed that the absence of a specific self-antigen, such as Thy-1, results in the absence of self-reactive B-1a specificities to that antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khan et al., 1995a</xref>). Moreover, mice harboring mutations in BCR signaling molecules such as Btk exhibit a reduction in B-1a B cell numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khan et al., 1995b</xref>), whereas mice with deficiencies in BCR coinhibitory molecules such as CD72 have increased frequencies of B-1a cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pan et al., 1999</xref>). These studies strongly suggest that positive selection via BCR signaling is critical for B-1a cell development and/or maintenance.</p><p>Many B-1a derived antibodies have been termed polyreactive due to their ability to bind shared structures present on a variety of apparently unrelated self and foreign antigens. For example, B-1a-derived monoclonal antibodies can recognize epitopes present on cell membranes of apoptotic cells but also on bacterial cell wall polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ehrenstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Notley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al. (2015)</xref> reported no significant difference in the immunoglobulin heavy chain repertoire of B-1a cells from adult germ free (GF) and specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice, supporting a model whereby the B-1a repertoire is not defined by microbiota-derived antigens. Consequently, B-1a antibody responses directed against the microbiota are generally thought to arise from BCR specificities selected on self but cross-reactive to microbial antigens. However, the extent to which self versus microbiota-derived antigens contribute to the clonal expansion or antibody secretion of B-1a cells remains unknown.</p><p>B-1a derived serum antibodies are termed ‘natural’ IgM due to their constitutive secretion, which is thought to be independent of antigen exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ochsenbein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baumgarth et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, whereas the B-2 cellular compartment is maintained by BM-derived hematopoietic cells (HSCs), B-1a cells are primarily of fetal and neonatal origin and are maintained by self-renewal throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lalor et al., 1989a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lalor et al., 1989b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Montecino-Rodriguez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yoshimoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kobayashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hardy and Hayakawa, 2015</xref>). Unlike B-2 cells, in vitro ligation of the BCR with anti-IgM on mature B-1a cells leads to reduced calcium mobilization and induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morris and Rothstein, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bikah et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ochi and Watanabe, 2000</xref>). The inability of mature B-1a cells to proliferate in response to BCR-mediated stimulation in vitro has been attributed to their expression of CD5, a negative regulator of TCR and BCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bikah et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hippen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perez-Villar et al., 1999</xref>). These observations have led to a model whereby B-1a cell development is mediated by positive selection on self antigens, whereas activation and antibody production is regulated by non-clonal activation through pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or cytokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nisitani et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waffarn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ha et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, B-1a cells express a variety of TLRs (TLR1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9) and are more prone to terminal plasma cell differentiation than B-2 cells upon in vitro stimulation by TLR ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Genestier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyer-Bahlburg et al., 2009</xref>). B-1a cell-intrinsic TLR signaling has also been implicated in the egress of B-1a cells from the peritoneal cavity to the spleen and intestinal sites following challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ha et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murakami et al., 1994</xref>). However, studies investigating TLR-dependent B-1a responses have largely been performed either in the context of infection or in vitro. Thus, the contribution of TLR signaling to steady state in vivo B-1a responses remains unclear.</p><p>In addition to positive selection, there is evidence that B-1a cells receive intermittent or ongoing BCR signaling throughout life, leading to their activation and expansion. A high frequency (15–30% of peritoneal cavity and 10–15% of splenic) of PtC-reactive B-1a cells is consistently observed in all strains of inbred mice, a significant percentage of which express the canonical VH11-2/VK14 heavy and light chain gene pair. Additionally, while young mice have a more diverse B-1a repertoire, dramatic BCR restriction occurs as animals age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). This restriction suggests an antigen-specific BCR-mediated expansion process. In support of this model, a recent study from Zikherman and colleagues found that B-1a cells express high levels of Nur77 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huizar et al., 2017</xref>), a gene associated with BCR signaling. Therefore, it is likely that B-1a cells are indeed receiving antigen specific BCR signaling in vivo, which may be important for their activation and expansion. However, it is still unclear how B-1a cells are able to respond to BCR-mediated activation, given their inherent inability to response to anti-IgM stimulation in vitro and expression of negative regulators of BCR signaling such as CD5.</p><p>In the present study we investigate the contribution of BCR and TLR signaling in regulating B-1a activation and function. We use a novel reporter mouse to show that the generation of self- and microbiota-reactive antibodies is linked to BCR signaling in B-1a cells. Moreover, we show that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are critical not only for antibody secretion but also for defining the steady state B-1a immunoglobulin repertoire. Specifically, we find that nucleic acid-sensing TLRs are required for anti-PtC responses, whereas both a microbiota and bacterial-sensing TLRs are required for anti-commensal responses. Altogether, we propose a model whereby dual BCR and TLR signaling is required for the maintenance and antibody secretion of steady state B-1a responses to both self and gut microbial antigens, which may be important for preventing inappropriate responses leading to autoimmunity while aiding in the maintenance of tissue and intestinal homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ighg3 reporter mouse marks a subset of activated, antibody secreting B-1a cells</title><p>Previous findings from our group showed that healthy mice make class-switched IgG3 and IgG2b serum antibodies reactive with the microbiota, which coordinate with IgA to dampen neonatal mucosal T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koch et al., 2016</xref>).

However, we found that only a small fraction of Tomato<sup>+</sup> cells were IgG3<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Unexpectedly, over half of Tomato<sup>+</sup> splenic B cells were IgG3<sup>–</sup>IgM<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We considered three possible mechanisms that could lead to the high frequency of IgG3<sup>–</sup>IgM<sup>+</sup>Tomato<sup>+</sup> cells. First, these cells may have recently class-switched to IgG3 and therefore still express surface IgM. However, sorted IgM<sup>+</sup>Tomato<sup>+</sup> splenic B cells retained surface IgM after 48 hr in culture and did not gain expression of IgG3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Furthermore, single-cell RT-PCR of in vitro LPS stimulated Tomato<sup>–</sup> splenocytes revealed that the resulting IgM<sup>+</sup>IgG3<sup>–</sup>Tomato<sup>+</sup> B cells expressed <italic>Ighm</italic> mRNA but not <italic>Ighg3</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Altogether, these results argue against the possibility that IgG3<sup>–</sup>IgM<sup>+</sup>Tomato<sup>+</sup> cells lack IgG3 because they recently class switched to IgG3. Second, we ruled out that <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:TdTomato</sup> mice were simply defective in IgG3 class switch recombination (CSR) by inducing IgG3 CSR via LPS stimulation of splenocytes in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,G</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we considered the possibility that IgG3<sup>–</sup>IgM<sup>+</sup>Tomato<sup>+</sup> cells express Cre without class switching to IgG3. The simplest way Cre expression could occur in the absence of CSR is translation of the T2A-Cre fusion protein from the <italic>Ighg3</italic> germ-line transcript (GLT), which precedes IgG3 CSR, especially since there is an in frame ATG upstream of the <italic>Cre recombinase</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Such a mechanism would not be unprecedented, as previous work by Wabl and colleagues showed the translatability of the <italic>Ighm</italic> GLT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachl et al., 1996</xref>). As predicted, IgM<sup>+</sup>IgG3<sup>–</sup>Tomato<sup>+</sup> B cells expressed both <italic>Ighm</italic> mRNA and the <italic>Ighg3</italic> GLT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Thus, the <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:TdTomato</sup> mouse appears to report induction of the <italic>Ighg3</italic> GLT rather than class switching to IgG3. Moreover, the presence of large numbers of IgG3<sup>–</sup>IgM<sup>+</sup>Tomato<sup>+</sup> cells indicates that a significant fraction of B cells has received signals that induce <italic>Ighg3</italic> GLT but not CSR to IgG3.</p><p>When we examined different subsets of B cells from <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:TdTomato</sup> mice in vivo, we discovered that the highest frequency of Tomato expression was in IgM<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells (CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup>CD5<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C,F</xref>). To begin to characterize the signals controlling induction of Cre in B cells of <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:TdTomato</sup> mice, we tracked Tomato expression in B cells in vivo. The Tomato<sup>+</sup> splenic B-1a cells were larger in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>) and had lower surface IgD expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) relative to Tomato<sup>–</sup> splenic B-1a cells. Moreover, the frequency of cells spontaneously secreting IgM was much higher in sorted Tomato<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells when compared to Tomato<sup>–</sup> B-1a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Based on these findings, we considered the possibility that the <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:TdTomato</sup> mouse marks a subset of activated B-1a cells and that activation of these cells correlates with induction of the <italic>Ighg3</italic> GLT rather than CSR to IgG3. To test this model, we stimulated splenocytes from <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:TdTomato</sup> mice with LPS in vitro. Induction of Tomato expression correlated with reduction of surface IgD expression and increased size, indicative of cells that have undergone activation and/or plasmablast differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>). Finally, to test the functional significance of the Cre-expressing cells in <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre</sup> mice, we crossed <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre</sup> mice with <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>STOP-flox<italic>-DTA</italic></sup> mice to ablate any Cre-expressing cells due to forced expression of diphtheria toxin and induction of cell death. As expected, the resulting <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:DTA</sup> mice had a complete loss of serum IgG3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>), but also significantly reduced titers of serum IgM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), indicating that the Tomato<sup>+</sup> activated B-1a cells marked in the <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:TdTomato</sup> mice are a significant source of serum IgM.</p><p>Importantly, <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:TdTomato</sup> and <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:DTA</sup> mice had no apparent defects in B cell development in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A-C</xref>). Moreover, Tomato expression was restricted to both mature and likely re-circulating B-1 cells in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D-E</xref>). <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:TdTomato</sup> and <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:DTA</sup> mice also had normal absolute counts of follicular, marginal zone, B-1a, and B-1b cells in the spleen and peritoneal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A,B,E</xref>). Intriguingly, a significant fraction of Tomato<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup> cells in the spleens of <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:TdTomato</sup> mice lack IgM expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D</xref>). However, the majority of these cells express the B-1 marker CD43 and likely represent another subset of spontaneously secreting B-1 cells recently described by Savage et. al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Savage et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Thus, while the <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:TdTomato</sup> mouse did not function as we originally intended, our results indicate that the mouse can be used as a tool to track an activated, antibody-secreting subset of B-1a cells.

Because we determined that the <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:TdTomato</sup> mouse marks a subset of activated B-1a cells with enhanced ‘spontaneous’ IgM secretion, we next sought to determine the contribution of BCR signaling to Tomato expression. In agreement with recent studies, we found that B-1a cells express high levels of Nur77, a gene whose expression is tightly linked to BCR-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, we found that splenic B-1a cells express even higher levels of Nur77 than peritoneal cavity B-1a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), consistent with our findings and previous studies showing that splenic, but not peritoneal cavity, B-1a cells secrete IgM when cultured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), and that the spleen is the site where B-1a cells are initially activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wardemann et al., 2002</xref>).

Using fluorescently labeled PtC-coated liposomes to quantify PtC-reactive B-1a cells by flow cytometry, we observed a higher frequency of PtC-reactivity within Tomato<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells versus Tomato<sup>–</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We also cloned the immunoglobulin light (IgL) and heavy (IgH) chain genes from individual Tomato<sup>+</sup> and Tomato<sup>–</sup> splenic IgM<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells from adult mice and generated recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) using a hIgG1 scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tiller et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Consistent with the higher frequency of PtC-reactive Tomato<sup>+</sup> splenic B-1a cells measured by flow cytometry, the canonical VH11-2/VK14 heavy and light chain paired genes that encode PtC-reactive BCRs were enriched in mAbs generated from Tomato<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells in comparison to mAbs generated from Tomato<sup>–</sup> B-1a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>We also examined the reactivity of mAbs generated from Tomato<sup>+</sup> and Tomato<sup>–</sup> B-1a cells with the microbiota.

Binding of each mAb to fecal microbiota was measured by flow cytometry, using an assay we have previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koch et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, after incubating with individual hIgG1 mAbs, fecal contents are stained with the DNA-binding dye SYBR to differentiate bacteria (SYBR<sup>+</sup>) from other components present in the feces such as food (SYBR<sup>–</sup>). Remarkably, mAbs generated from Tomato<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells were significantly more reactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). While this assay cannot track specific epitopes, the data indicate that the BCRs of Tomato<sup>+</sup> cells are enriched for specificities against the microbiota.</p><p>Altogether, the increased frequency of BCR specificities for common B-1a antigens like PtC and the microbiota in the activated, antibody-secreting Tomato<sup>+</sup> pool of splenic B-1a cells indicates that antigen-specific BCR signaling, as opposed to antigen-independent polyclonal expansion, mediates the activation and function of at least certain B-1a cells at steady state. In further support of this conclusion, we did not detect Tomato expression in D0 neonatal liver IgM<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>); instead, Tomato<sup>+</sup> cells first appeared at about 4 days of age in splenic CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) and increased in frequency during the first few weeks of life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Thus, Tomato expression correlates with the acquisition of a microbiota and migration of B-1a cells from the neonatal liver to distal sites such as the spleen, where they likely first encounter antigen.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Colonization with a microbiota is required for the production of B-1 derived microbiota-reactive IgM</title><p>We next sought to determine the extent to which self antigens versus microbial antigens impact B-1a responses. A recent study reported no significant difference in B-1a immunoglobulin heavy chain repertoire between adult GF and SPF mice, favoring a model whereby microbiota-reactive serum IgM present in healthy SPF mice arises from antibodies selected on self antigens that are cross-reactive to microbial antigens present on constituents of the microbiota (e.g. PtC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2015</xref>).

In this system IgH<sup>b</sup> peritoneal cavity B-1 cells are transferred into neonatal mice of the IgH<sup>a</sup> allotype that are treated with anti-IgM<sup>a</sup> for the first 6 weeks of life. This treatment depletes the host IgH<sup>a</sup> B cells but not the transferred IgM<sup>b</sup> B-1 cells.

However, bone marrow-derived IgH<sup>a</sup> cells are able to reconstitute the B-2 cell compartment, allowing one to determine the cellular origin of antibodies using Ig allotype specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Consistent with previous studies validating the B-1 chimera experimental model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lalor et al., 1989a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Savage et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumgarth et al., 1999</xref>), we found that the majority of serum IgM in adult B-1 chimeras was B-1 derived.

Moreover, in adult B-1 chimeric mice essentially all microbiota-reactive IgM was derived from IgM<sup>b</sup> B-1 cells, comparable to the levels of microbiota-reactive IgM in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,E</xref>).

To examine how TLR signaling modulates B-1a activation, we performed an in vitro stimulation of B-1a cells with various TLR ligands. Strikingly, in vitro TLR activation of B-1a cells with TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9 agonists resulted in the reduction of surface CD5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>), a known inhibitor of BCR signaling. These results support a model in which TLR activation renders B-1a cells responsive to BCR stimulation by negatively regulating an inhibitor of BCR signaling. In work co-submitted with this manuscript, Savage and colleagues show that TLR activation of B-1a cells both in vitro and in the context of influenza infection results in the loss of surface CD5 and a concomitant increase in BCR-downstream signaling. Taken together with our previous mFLOW and PtC-liposome results, these data suggest that the specificity of the BCR determines the nature of the TLR ligand encountered by a given B-1a cell. More specifically, we propose a model whereby BCR engagement with the self antigen PtC present on dead or dying cells may facilitate Unc93B1-dependent TLR engagement by ‘self’ nucleic acids within endosomes, whereas BCR engagement with microbiota-derived antigens may coordinate with PAMP sensing by TLR2 or TLR4 to regulate responses to the microbiota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47015.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>TLR stimulation results in CD5 downregulation on B-1a cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative flow cytometry histogram plot and quantification of mean fluorescence intensity of CD5 expression (<bold>B</bold>) of in vitro Pam3CSK (black), LPS- (gray), R848- (red) and CpG-B- (blue) stimulated peritoneal cavity B-1a cells at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 cycles of division as determined by their CFSE dilution (n = 3, technical replicates).

In this study, we generated <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:TdTomato</sup> mice, which serendipitously mark a subset of activated, antibody-secreting IgM<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells, allowing us to define the signals that regulate B-1a activation in vivo. The significantly higher expression of the BCR-downstream signaling gene Nur77 in splenic versus peritoneal cavity B-1a cells combined with the enrichment of BCR reactivities to both PtC and the intestinal microbiota in the Tomato<sup>+</sup> activated subset of splenic B-1a cells from reporter mice strongly suggests a BCR-mediated expansion process. Interestingly, we did not see Tomato expression in fetal or neonatal liver B-1a cells; rather, Tomato expression in B-1a cells correlated with their entry into the spleen or other distal sites where they likely first encounter antigen. Given the observed reduction in microbiota reactive B-1-derived serum IgM in GF mice, we hypothesize that the microbiota is one such source of antigen. Moreover, we demonstrate that TLR signaling is important for defining the B-1a repertoire and the steady state antibody secretion by B-1a cells, and implicate specific and distinct TLRs for PtC-reactive versus microbiota-reactive B1a responses. Altogether, our data suggest a model whereby dual BCR and TLR activation regulates the steady state maintenance and antibody secretion of a distinct subset of B-1a cells.</p><p>While we found that Tomato expression in <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:TdTomato</sup> mice correlated with GLT in the <italic>Ighg3</italic> locus, the exact signals that modulate Tomato expression in reporter mice are still not fully understood. Moreover, why there is preferential expression of Tomato in B-1 cells over other B cell subsets is also not known. One likely explanation is that B-1 cells are the primary source of serum IgG3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Savage et al., 2017</xref>), and therefore may preferentially receive signals that ‘poise’ B-1 cells for IgG3 CSR. Additionally, NF-κB binding sites have been identified in enhancers linked to IgG3 CSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Michaelson et al., 1996</xref>). Accordingly, <italic>p50</italic><sup>-/-</sup> activated B cells fail to induce <italic>Ighg3</italic> GLT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Snapper et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, BCR and/or TLR signaling, which both result in NF-κB activation, could mediate induction of <italic>Ighg3</italic> GLT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Snapper et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cogné et al., 1994</xref>). The presence of these signals would induce <italic>Ighg3</italic> GLT but not CSR, unless <italic>Aicda</italic> is also expressed. This mechanism is supported by evidence of BCR-mediated activation in Tomato<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells and the ability to induce Tomato expression in <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:TdTomato</sup> splenocytes activated in vitro with TLR ligands. Future studies involving the re-derivation <italic>Ighg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:TdTomato</sup> mice to GF status would be very interesting, since we would expect the loss of microbiota-reactive Tomato<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells.</p><p>Our data also shed light on the role of self versus foreign antigens in shaping B-1a responses. Previous studies have shown that B-1a cell numbers and serum IgM titers are unaltered in GF mice, demonstrating that exogenous antigens are not required for ‘natural’ serum IgM. IgH sequencing studies in GF and SPF mice have shown that the mature B-1a repertoire is not significantly different in mice lacking a microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). We were therefore surprised to observe a significant reduction in microbiota-reactive serum antibodies in GF mice, despite no change in the frequency of PtC reactivity. This finding reveals that a subset of B-1a cells require a microbiota for their expansion and/or antibody secretion.</p><p>Like GF mice, we found that mice lacking TLR2 and TLR4 also had a significant reduction in serum IgM reactive against the microbiota. Taken together, these results suggest that the reduction in anti-commensal serum IgM observed in GF mice may be due to the loss of a microbiota-dependent TLR2/4 signal that drives the expansion and antibody secretion of a subset of commensal-reactive B-1a cells. Consistent with previous studies showing no significant differences in the IgH B-1a repertoire in SPF versus GF mice, the VH usage patterns in <italic>Tlr2<sup>-/-</sup>Tlr4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are almost indistinguishable from WT mice. We did, however, find a significant reduction in VH3-6 and VH9-3 gene usage in B-1a cells from mice lacking TLR2 and TLR4. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies generated from WT splenic B-1a cells expressing VH3-6 germline alleles are reactive against the microbiota, suggesting that commensal bacteria may result in the selective expansion and antibody secretion of a subset of B-1a cells through dual BCR and TLR2/4 stimulation. This model is further supported by our results showing the selective reduction in steady state generation of and antibody secretion by PtC-reactive, VH11-2-expressing B-1a cells in mice lacking Unc93B1-dependent TLRs. In this context, BCR engagement with PtC present on dead or dying cells may provide an environment where exposed nucleic acids can be sensed by Unc93B1-dependent TLRs within endosomes. The development of new tools capable of specifically tracking commensal-reactive B cells or the generation of monoclonal antibodies from GF or <italic>Tlr2<sup>-/-</sup>Tlr4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice B-1a cells will be important to further elucidate the contribution of a microbiota to the development and/or expansion of commensal-reactive B-1a cells.</p><p>Of note, we were surprised that TLR-deficient mice did not have significantly altered serum IgM titers and B-1a frequencies despite a significant reduction in anti-microbiota and PtC reactivity. However, adoptive transfer of TLR-deficient B cells into B-cell deficient mice resulted in ~2–4 fold reduction in total serum IgM titers when compared to mice adoptively transferred with WT B cells, suggesting that a significant source of serum IgM is indeed mediated through TLR activation of B-1 cells. Of note, as evidenced by the incomplete abrogation of serum IgM, microbiota- and PtC- reactive B-1a responses, and otherwise very similar B-1a IgH BCR repertoire in TLR-deficient mice when compared to WT counterparts, other signals, such as cytokines, also likely play a role in regulating TLR-independent B-1a derived antibody responses at steady state. Previous studies have identified IL-5, IL-10, and IFN-γ as important regulators of B-1 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nisitani et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waffarn et al., 2015</xref>). These mechanisms may even compensate for the absence of TLR signaling, resulting in apparently normal total IgM titers and B-1a frequency, despite differences in the B-1a repertoire and specificities of B-1a derived serum IgM.</p><p>The presence of a B cell subset that produces self-reactive antibodies contradicts the paradigm that self-reactive clones are deleted in B cell development to avoid autoimmunity. However, B-1a-derived serum IgM likely evolved as an important first line of defense important for both tissue and intestinal homeostasis. Our finding that microbial sensing TLRs regulate anti-microbiota responses, whereas nucleic acid sensing TLRs regulate responses to PtC present on dead or dying cells where DNA or RNA may be sensed, strongly supports a model wherein TLR signaling integrates with BCR signaling to control B-1a responses at steady state. The balance between protective and harmful B-1a responses is likely achieved, in part, through the integration of these two signals. These results could be especially relevant to autoimmune disease where several studies have linked disease severity with hyper-responsive nucleic acid-sensing TLR responses and increased autoantibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leadbetter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lau et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fukui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Subramanian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pisitkun et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Our in vitro results showing that TLR activation of B-1a cells results in downregulation of the BCR inhibitory protein CD5, provide a possible mechanism for how TLRs may render B-1a cells responsive to BCR-mediated activation. Supporting our model of coordinated integration of TLR/BCR signaling in regulating B-1a responses at steady state, Savage et al. (in an accompanying manuscript) found that B-intrinsic TLR signaling is also critical for the differentiation of B-1a cells into antibody secreting cells in the context of influenza infection. Moreover, Savage et al. reveal through biochemical analysis that TLR activation of B-1a cells results in both reduced expression of CD5 and reduced association of CD5 with the IgM-BCR complex, which correlates with an increase in BCR downstream signaling. These results raise important questions regarding the precise molecular mechanism of how TLR and BCR signaling coordinate to control B-1a responses in vivo. Of particular interest is the relative timing of TLR versus BCR signaling on B-1a cells. It is possible that TLR signaling precedes the subsequent ability of B-1a cells to respond to BCR-mediated activation by inducing downregulation of CD5. It is not clear, however, how this mechanism explains our finding that certain B-1a BCR specificities are linked with subsets of TLRs. One possible explanation is that TLR ligands are not present at sufficiently high levels in vivo, so BCR-mediated acquisition of TLR ligands may be required for efficient TLR activation and conversion of B-1a cells into antibody-secreting CD5<sup>–</sup>‘ex-B-1a’ B-1b cells. In vitro stimulation with high concentrations of TLR ligands may bypass this requirement. Future studies using conjugates of antigens and TLR ligands could enable a more precise delineation of the sequence of events leading to B-1a proliferation and antibody secretion.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

CD19<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>hi</sup>IgD<sup>lo</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup>CD5<sup>+</sup> depleted spleen and peritoneal cavity lavage cells were sorted using a FACS Aria (BD Biosciences). Sorted cells were immediately resuspended in TRIzol (Invitrogen) and snap frozen. Samples were subsequently processed using the services provided by iRepertoire Inc. Briefly, bulk RNA was extracted, heavy chain cDNA libraries were generated, and CDR3 nucleotide sequences were amplified and sequenced using paired-end MiSeq sequencing technology. Regular un-normalized or normalized CDR3 nucleotide sequencing data were analyzed. For CDR3 length and N-nucleotide addition analysis, each unique CDR3-VDJ combination was treated as a quantity of one regardless of read count, allowing us to view the repertoire independent of skewing which may occur to just one or a few highly dominant clones. Because our analysis was performed on sorted B-1a cells, excluding plasma cells, which do not express CD5, the frequency of a given Ig transcript is roughly viewed as the relative index of frequency of cells expressing this Ig transcript. Additionally, clonal expansion starting at around the time of weaning is a hallmark of self-replenishing B-1a cells. Therefore, for VH gene usage frequencies, we did not normalize the data by scoring each distinct IgH CDR3 nucleotide sequence expressing a given VH gene as one, independent of how often this sequence was detected, as is often done with bulk RNA-based Ig sequencing methods. For VH gene usage frequencies and pair-wise comparisons of percentage shared CDR3 sequences between samples, total read counts were normalized to 10 million reads to account for differences in read depth between samples. A minimum frequency cutoff of 1000 was applied to pair-wise comparison analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are presented as mean (± SEM).

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;B cell receptor and TLR signaling coordinate to control distinct B-1 responses to both self and the microbiota&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Thank you for your patience during the evaluation process. Since your paper was submitted in parallel with the manuscript &quot;TLR-signaling induces reorganization of the IgM-BCR complex regulating B-1 cell responses to infections&quot; from Baumgarth and colleagues, we aimed to secure two reviews of both manuscripts (Nos. 1 and 3) and to carry out the consultation in parallel.</p><p>We believe that the work addresses an extremely important problem of the coordination of B cell receptor and TLR signaling, although a major concern of reviewer 2 (who had not seen the other manuscript) was the evidence in this paper for the B cell intrinsic TLR effects. The 2 rounds of consultation came to the view that although there is no exact complementarity between the two papers in terms of antigens examined and experimental systems, a combination of cross-referencing between the papers and express caveats for the evidence on this point in your manuscript may address the issue without necessarily requiring in vivo chimeras. We do not think that further germ-free colonization experiments are in the current scope.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Barton et al. describe the serendipitous development of a B1 B cell reporter mouse and the subsequent use of this mouse (and derivations of) to interrogate the mechanisms that lead to the development of self-reactive and commensal-reactive IgM. Most notably, they identify unique contributions of nucleic acid-sensing versus bacterial-sensing TLRs to the emergence of these two antibody specificities, respectively. Overall, this is an elegant and nicely-done study that addresses long-standing issues regarding B1 cell biology and reveals a new mechanism of integration of innate and adaptive signals in B cells themselves. I only have one major experimental concern, which revolves around the data arguing for a role of TLR2/4 in commensal reactivity. It seems highly likely that gut microbiota composition (particularly the presence or absence of pathobionts like Helicobacter or others) could influence the development of commensal-specific IgM. Thus, different mouse colonies (or even lines within a facility that are bred separately) might exhibit differing levels of anti-commensal IgM based merely on differences in commensal composition.</p><p>Unless I am mistaken, it appears that the authors performed nearly all of their experiments using mice that were bred as lines rather than using littermate controls, which would be the proper standard in this case for determining the effect of a gene(s) on the observed phenotype. I am certainly sympathetic to the fact that breeding lines with multiple alleles creates a challenge here.</p><p>Nonetheless, I would have hoped that the authors would have at least co-housed the different lines to partially correct for potential effects of the microbiota, but based on the methods it seems that these lines were all bred and housed separately. There is even an outside possibility that microbiota-dependent differences could explain the seeming discrepancy between the authors' data and the recently published data by Yang showing that GF and SPF mice have equivalent B1a repertoires-that is, that the Yang experiments were done with a microbiota that failed to induce the specificities that Barton et al. discover here. I would strongly suggest that the authors perform at least a few of the critical experiments (e.g., Figure 5D and E) using littermates or (at minimum) comparing mice that are co-housed to normalized the microbiota. Even more interesting, but likely beyond the scope of this manuscript, would be to colonize GF mice with different microbes or communities and then evaluate the effects on commensal-specific IgM.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The crosstalk of TLRs and the BCR on B1 cells is still poorly understood. Kreuk et al. generated a novel mouse strain by targeting Cre into the constant region of Igg3. In combination with a Rosa26-Tomato allele, this strain was used as a reporter mouse. Tomato was found to be expressed in IgG3+ and (predominantly) IgG3- B cells, with the highest frequencies in peritoneal B-1a cells. Splenic Tomato+ B-1a cells showed an increased cell size and enhanced spontaneous antibody secretion compared to their Tomato- counterpart, along with increased frequencies of PtC-specific cells. Moreover, the percentage of splenic Tomato+ B-1a increased with age, which the authors connect to the acquisition of microbiota. Based on transfer and depletion experiments, the authors conclude that the microbiota-reactive IgMs are B1-derived and that their presence in the serum is microbiota-dependent. In a second set of experiments, the authors show that a smaller fraction of the microbiota is bound by IgMs derived from TLR-deficient mice compared to wild-type controls, and that the fraction of splenic and peritoneal PtC-specific B-1a cells is reduced in these animals. By BCR repertoire sequencing, the authors show that the usage of some VH segments is altered in the absence of certain TLR subsets. Overall, the study contains interesting results, but needs to be improved (and restructured) significantly, as pointed out below.</p><p>- As the authors are well aware, TLRs are expressed on many cell types. Thus, the phenotype observed in TLR germline-knockout animals may be due to TLR-deficiency on other cell types, i.e. not B-cell intrinsic. As the paper addresses B cell-intrinsic BCR-TLR cross-talk, it is essential that the authors clarify this issue by e.g. mixed bone marrow reconstitution experiments.</p><p>- The data on the B1 cell transfer experiments do not include a phenotypic analysis of the B cell subsets in the recipients after depletion of endogenous B cells and at the time of serum isolation. Did the B-cell depletion work? Do the donor cells solely give rise to B1a cells in the recipients? These controls are essential and should be included.</p><p>- The Igg3-Cre mouse line is presented as a reporter line for activated B-1a cells. However, a complete characterization of the mouse (B cell development, expression of Tomato in various B cell subsets (including pro-B, pre-B, MZ, B1-b, etc.), comparison of B cell subset frequencies and absolute cell numbers to wild-type counterparts, etc.) is missing and should be provided, as this is a new, previously unpublished transgenic mouse line. Furthermore, how B cell development was affected when Igg3-Cre expressing cells were eliminated through DTA might be very informative and thus worth to be included in the manuscript.</p><p>- A substantial fraction of Tomato+ B cells is negative for IgM and IgG3. Do these cells represent plasma cells, or what else do they represent?</p><p>- The subset of Tomato+ B-1a cells should be characterized in more detail (e.g. by analyzing B1-typical markers, responses to stimuli, etc.). Furthermore, given that B-1a cells predominantly reside in the peritoneal cavity, the analysis of Tomato+ cells should not be restricted to the spleen, as it appears to be the case in some figures (such as Figure 2H).</p><p>- It is an obvious deficit of the paper that Tomato+ cells are not analyzed under GF conditions. This may be technically impossible to achieve, but the authors may comment in the text.</p><p>- Some conclusions of the authors are overstatements, such as the title of Figure 4 (&quot;Toll-like receptor signaling is required for B-1a responses to both phosphatidylcholine and the microbiota&quot;). In reality, microbiota reactive IgM and PtC-specific B-1a cells are reduced, but not absent in the TLR knockout animals. Thus, TLRs may be involved but not required. The same applies for the title of Figure 6: Most CDR frequencies in B-1a cells are not affected by the absence of TLRs in the mutant mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors generated IgG3-Tomato reporter mouse and observed that Tomato expression was preferentially found in IgM-secreting, activated fraction of B1a cells. The Tomato+ B1a cells express high levels of Nur77, and the IgM generated by Tomato+ cells efficiently recognize PtC and fecal microbiota. These results show that Tomato+ B1a cells received BCR-signal upon their differentiation, probably through PtC and microbiota. Microbiota binding serum IgM was produced by B1, but not by B2 cells, and the differentiation of this fraction of B1a cells required microbiota colonization and also TLR2/4 signals. Interestingly, the differentiation of PtC reactive B1a cells require the function of Unc93B1 but not TLR2/4 signals. Thus, the authors proposed the model in which the responses of B1a cells to microbiota and self-antigen PtC are regulated by coordinated signals through the BCR and the distinct TLR signaling. This is very interesting study based on their serendipitous observation with IgG3-Tomato reporter mouse. The experiments are well-done and the manuscript is well-written.</p><p>Some confusion come from the data in which normal amount of IgM was detected in the serum of GF and TLR-/- animals (Figure 3DFigure 4CFigure 5C). Since Tomato+B1a cells are not present in day0 neonatal liver and accumulate upon microbiota colonization (Figure 2F-H), germ free mice are expected to have fewer amount of Tomato+B1a cells. If so, IgM-secreting B1a cells should be fewer in GF and TLR-/- animals. This can be tested by ELISPOT assay for sorted B1a cells in PerC and SPL of GF and TLR-/- mice, like the authors show in Figure 1G. The normal amount of serum IgM gives the impression that there is no defect on Tomato+B1a cells in GF and TLR animals, which gives confusion and disturbance for interpretation of the results related with these animal models.</p><p>Another confusion comes from the data by showing the in vitro down-regulation of CD5 upon TLR stimulations (Figure 7), because the authors suggest that TLR stimulation &quot;induce&quot; the IgM-secreting B1a cells. Especially, Figure 4E directly shows that CD5<sup>+</sup> B1a cells were reduced in TLR-/- mice. This is confusing, because if TLR stimulation down-regulate CD5 expression, the numbers of CD5<sup>+</sup> B1a cells should be increased in TLR-/- mice. One possible explanation is that the strength of TLR signal (or amount of the TLR ligands) might be totally different for in vivo B1a induction and for in vitro CD5 down-regulation. The authors can test this possibility by injecting TLR ligands into WT and TLR-/- mice, and compare the numbers of CD5<sup>+</sup>B1a cells, like in Figure 4E.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47015.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] <italic>I only have one major experimental concern, which revolves around the data arguing for a role of TLR2/4 in commensal reactivity.

Therefore, in order to normalize the microbiota between different strains of mice, we cohoused WT and TLR KO mice for 4 weeks after weaning, prior to analyzing PtC and microbiota-reactive B-1a responses. We observed the same reduction in anti-PtC and anti-microbiota B-1a responses in TLR KO mice when cohoused with WT mice as we show in Figure 4, allowing us to conclude that the observed differences we see in B-1a responses in TLR KO mice are not due to alterations in their microbiota but rather due to the loss of TLR signaling. We have included these data as a supplement for Figure 4 (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Overall, the study contains interesting results, but needs to be improved (and restructured) significantly, as pointed out below.</p><p>- As the authors are well aware, TLRs are expressed on many cell types.

Additionally, we appreciate reviewer 3’s comment concerning the confusion presented by the unaltered serum IgM titers in TLR KO mice, given that the data presented in the manuscript supports a model whereby TLR KO B-1a cells secrete less IgM. In order to address these two points in parallel, we performed WT versus TLR KO B cell transfers into B-cell deficient neonates and measured serum IgM responses 10 weeks post transfer. While we had originally proposed including analysis of WT vs. TLR KO B-1 chimeras (generated in collaboration with Baumgarth’s group) to address the question of whether the requirement for TLR function is B cell intrinsic, we were unable to use these data due to technical issues related to the chimera generation.. Fortunately, in parallel we had performed B cell transfers (WT or TLR KO) into B cell deficient mice, as an independent approach to address this question. These experiments clearly demonstrate that B-cell intrinsic TLR signaling is required for optimal antibody secretion and anti-microbiota reactivity (Figure 5K, L). We have included the results from the transfer experiments in our revised manuscript and hope that the Editor and reviewers agree that these data are sufficient to address the B cell intrinsic issue.</p><p>We observed significantly reduced microbiota-reactive serum IgM in mice that received TLR KO B cells when compared to WT B cell transfer recipients, allowing us to conclude that TLR-dependent microbiota-reactive B-1 responses are B-cell intrinsic. Additionally, we also observed significantly lower total serum IgM titers in TLR KO B cell transfer recipients. Importantly, while it is not statistically significant, we do see a trend of lower total serum IgM in global TLR deficient animals (Figure 4C). We therefore speculate that the loss of TLRs on other cell subsets may contribute to elevated IgM levels, masking the requirement of B-cell intrinsic TLR signaling for IgM secretion revealed by these B-cell transfer experiments. We have added discussion of this point of confusion in the main text, and have added WT vs. TLR KO B cell transfer data to Figure 4 (Figure 4H-L).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The data on the B1 cell transfer experiments do not include a phenotypic analysis of the B cell subsets in the recipients after depletion of endogenous B cells and at the time of serum isolation. Did the B-cell depletion work? Do the donor cells solely give rise to B1a cells in the recipients? These controls are essential and should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>While we do not have cellular data for the B-1 chimeras upon sacrifice, we have added ELISA data that show endogenous B-1 cell depletion efficiency. Specifically, we have added a panel to Figure 3 (Figure 3B) showing serum IgM<sup>a</sup> (endogenous B-2 derived) versus IgM<sup>b</sup> (Donor B-1 derived) titers in the B-1 chimeras presented in Figure 3, which shows that essentially all of the serum IgM is B-1 derived (consistent with previously published data on B-1 Chimeras). This readout is a proxy for endogenous B-1 cell depletion efficiency, as IgM<sup>a</sup> titers negatively correlate with endogenous B-1 depletion efficiency. We have added to the main text of the manuscript a more detailed description of the B-1 chimera system, which is an extensively validated approach originally published in detail by Lalor et al., 1989. Cellular analyses of B-1 chimeras are further described by Baumgarth et al., 1999. In short, transfer of either purified B-1 cells or total PerC lavage results in only B-1 cells surviving for longer than a few days (i.e. the transferred B-2 cell do not survive post transfer). We hope that the combination of serum ELISA data, which we have added to Figure 3, and referencing previous studies validating the B-1 chimera model in the main text of the manuscript will be sufficient to address this point.</p><p>As pointed out by reviewer 2, a PerC lavage contains both CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1a (~80%) and CD5<sup>–</sup> B-1b (~20%) cells, which are both self-renewing. However, as shown in the accompanying manuscript from Savage et al., CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1a differentiate into IgM-secreting CD5<sup>–</sup> “ex B-1a” B-1b cells, whereas CD5<sup>–</sup> PerC B-1b cells do not. Moreover, while in the context of influenza infection, Savage et al. generated B-1 chimeras with either purified CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells or purified CD5<sup>–</sup> B-1b cells and show that B-1a cells are the main source of IgM ASCs (whereas transferred B-1b cells were not). We therefore feel it is appropriate to conclude that serum IgM derived from transferred PerC lavage cells are largely of B-1a origin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The Igg3-Cre mouse line is presented as a reporter line for activated B-1a cells.

B cell development was assayed by plotting absolute counts of total B220<sup>+</sup>, Pre-B, Pro-B, early Pro-B, immature B, and mature B cells in the bone marrow, which is unaltered in <italic>Igg3</italic><sup>T2ACre:TdTomato</sup> and <italic>Igg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:DTA</sup> mice when compared to C57BL/6 mice. We also show Tomato expression is predominantly restricted to mature IgM<sup>+</sup> and likely re-circulating IgM<sup>–</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup> B-1 B cells in the bone marrow. The absolute numbers of total CD19<sup>+</sup>, follicular B, marginal zone B, B-1a, and B-1b cells in the spleen and PerC of <italic>Igg3</italic><sup>T2ACre:TdTomato</sup> and <italic>Igg3</italic><sup>T2A-Cre:DTA</sup> mice is also comparable to C57BL/6 mice. We also provide Tomato expression in these various splenic and PerC B cell subsets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A substantial fraction of Tomato+ B cells is negative for IgM and IgG3. Do these cells represent plasma cells, or what else do they represent?</p></disp-quote><p>Upon further characterization of these Tomato<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>–</sup>IgG3<sup>–</sup> cells, a significant percentage of these cells express CD43, and are likely of B-1 origin. Recent work from Savage et al., 2017, identified a population of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>–</sup> cells, that also spontaneously secrete IgM. We have included a representative flow cytometry plot of CD43 expression on Tomato<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>–</sup>IgG3<sup>–</sup> in Figure 1—figure supplement 5D, and we reference the Savage et al. study when discussing these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The subset of Tomato+ B-1a cells should be characterized in more detail (e.g. by analyzing B1-typical markers, responses to stimuli, etc.). Furthermore, given that B-1a cells predominantly reside in the peritoneal cavity, the analysis of Tomato+ cells should not be restricted to the spleen, as it appears to be the case in some figures (such as Figure 2H).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer importantly points out that the predominant B cell subset in the peritoneal cavity is B-1a cells. However, while only a small percentage of the total B cells in the spleen, B-1a cell numbers are actually comparable in both sites. We, and published work from several other groups, have found that, unlike splenic B-1a cells, peritoneal cavity B-1a cells do not spontaneously secrete IgM. We apologize for not including these data in our original submission, and have added PerC ELISPOT data (comparing Tomato<sup>–</sup> and Tomato<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells) to Figure 1G. The rationale behind not including the same time course of Tomato expression in PerC B-1a cells, like we show for splenic B-1a cells in Figure 2H, is that B-1a cells are not detectible in the PerC until about 2 weeks of age. We have revised the main text to better highlight the growing body of evidence that suggests that the spleen is an important site of B-1a activation and spontaneous IgM secretion, which was the rationale behind focusing our analyses on splenic B-1a cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It is an obvious deficit of the paper that Tomato+ cells are not analyzed under GF conditions. This may be technically impossible to achieve, but the authors may comment in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that this is an exciting future direction, we believe re-deriving the <italic>Igg3</italic><sup>T2Acre:TdTomato</sup> reporter mouse in germ-free conditions is currently beyond the scope of this work. We have however added a discussion of this to the main text of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Some conclusions of the authors are overstatements, such as the title of Figure 4 (&quot;Toll-like receptor signaling is required for B-1a responses to both phosphatidylcholine and the microbiota&quot;). In reality, microbiota reactive IgM and PtC-specific B-1a cells are reduced, but not absent in the TLR knockout animals. Thus, TLRs may be involved but not required. The same applies for the title of Figure 6: Most CDR frequencies in B-1a cells are not affected by the absence of TLRs in the mutant mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any overstatements, as we agree titles should accurately summarize the findings. The title of Figure 4 has been changed to “Loss of Toll-like receptor signaling results in reduced B-1a responses to both phosphatidylocholine and the microbiota”. The title of Figure 6 has been changed to “B-1a immunoglobulin repertoire analysis reveals unique regulation of a subset of heavy chain genes by distinct subsets of TLRs<italic>”.</italic> </p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] <italic>Some confusion come from the data in which normal amount of IgM was detected in the serum of GF and TLR-/- animals (Figure 3DFigure 4CFigure 5C). Since Tomato+B1a cells are not present in day0 neonatal liver and accumulate upon microbiota colonization (Figure 2F-H), germ free mice are expected to have fewer amount of Tomato+B1a cells. If so, IgM-secreting B1a cells should be fewer in GF and TLR-/- animals. This can be tested by ELISPOT assay for sorted B1a cells in PerC and SPL of GF and TLR-/- mice, like the authors show in Figure 1G. The normal amount of serum IgM gives the impression that there is no defect on Tomato+B1a cells in GF and TLR animals, which gives confusion and disturbance for interpretation of the results related with these animal models.</italic> </p><p>Please see our first response to reviewer #1.</p><p> <italic>Another confusion comes from the data by showing the</italic> in vitro <italic>down-regulation of CD5 upon TLR stimulations (Figure 7), because the authors suggest that TLR stimulation &quot;induce&quot; the IgM-secreting B1a cells. Especially, Figure 4E directly shows that CD5<sup>+</sup> B1a cells were reduced in TLR-/- mice. This is confusing, because if TLR stimulation down-regulate CD5 expression, the numbers of CD5<sup>+</sup> B1a cells should be increased in TLR-/- mice. One possible explanation is that the strength of TLR signal (or amount of the TLR ligands) might be totally different for</italic> in vivo <italic>B1a induction and for</italic> in vitro <italic>CD5 down-regulation. The authors can test this possibility by injecting TLR ligands into WT and TLR-/- mice, and compare the numbers of CD5<sup>+</sup>B1a cells, like in Figure 4E.</italic> </p><p>It appears the reviewer may have misinterpreted the data presented in Figure 4E, which actually shows that there is reduction in PtC+ B-1a cells in TLR KO mice. We have spatially reorganized this part of the figure for clarity. We thank the reviewer for this insight, however, since there actually is a trend towards an increased frequency of CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1a cells in TLR KO mice when compared to WT counterparts (Figure 4B). However, this difference is not significant, which is why we did not feel comfortable originally discussing it in the text. This trend towards an increased frequency of B-1a cells in TLR KO mice indeed fits with our model of TLR stimulation resulting in the down regulation of CD5 on B-1a cells, resulting in “ex-B-1a” B-1b cells. While only speculative, one possible explanation for this difference not being greater is that B-1a cells can regenerate, which may be occurring in WT mice at a more frequent rate to renew the B-1a niche.</p></body></sub-article></article>
