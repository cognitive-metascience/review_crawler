During endosome maturation, integral membrane proteins are either retained, leading their eventual turnover in the lysosome, or they are exported and delivered to other organelles for re-use. Molecular sorting reactions in the endosome thus play a fundamental role in controlling the composition of the plasma membrane by determining which molecules are recycled back to the plasma membrane and which are degraded.</p><p>The retromer protein complex is an evolutionarily conserved sorting device that orchestrates export of integral membrane proteins from the endosome via tubular and vesicular ETCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burd and Cullen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chi et al., 2015</xref>). Retromer is composed of three proteins: Vps35, which resembles an alpha solenoid similar to well characterized vesicle coat proteins such as clathrin; Vps26 (standard name: Pep8), which binds the N-terminal region of Vps35; and Vps29, which binds the C-terminal region of Vps35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hierro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Norwood et al., 2011</xref>). The full range of molecular functions that are executed by each retromer subunit have yet to be definitively established, and this is a major obstacle for understanding the mechanisms that underpin retromer-mediated cargo export from the endosome. The helical repeats of Vps35 are thought to provide binding sites for cargo and accessory factors, such as the Snx3 and Snx27 sorting nexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harrison et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hierro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) and, in mammals, the WASH complex, an activator of the Arp2/3 actin polymerization complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harbour et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jia et al., 2012</xref>). Vps26 is structurally related to α- and β-arrestins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shi et al., 2006</xref>), which function as sorting adapters for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, raising the possibility that it may function in the selection of integral membrane proteins for export. Given the central role that retromer plays in controlling plasma membrane composition and organelle biogenesis, it is logical to expect that retromer activities would be regulated in order to integrate its functions with cell physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seaman, 2012</xref>), but examples of such regulation have yet to be identified.</p><p>In this study, we used genetic selection in budding yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) to identify gene products that control plasma membrane residence of integral membrane proteins. One mutant obtained displays a loss of retromer-dependent plasma membrane recycling of multiple integral plasma membrane proteins. This phenotype results from a gain-of-function mutation in the dual specificity protein phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Camps et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patterson et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>MIH1</italic>, encoding the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> homolog of <italic>CDC25</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pal et al., 2008</xref>). We show that Vps26 directly recognizes a retromer sorting signal and that the phosphorylation state of Vps26, controlled by Mih1, modulates the affinity of retromer for the Chs3 recycling signal.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Isolation of yeast mutants deficient in endosomal trafficking</title><p>To identify factors that regulate post-Golgi trafficking of integral membrane proteins, we harnessed the activity of yeast chitin synthase 3 (Chs3), an integral membrane enzyme that is trafficked between Golgi and endosomal compartments and the plasma membrane. Delivery of Chs3 to the cell surface is mediated by transport vesicles that are coated with the ‘exomer’ protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). In cells lacking functional exomer, Chs3 is constitutively retained within the cell by a Golgi-endosome trafficking circuit involving a clathrin adapter protein complex 1 (AP1)-dependent retention mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Valdivia et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).

Whereas growth of exomer-deficient cells is resistant to calcofluor white (CFW), a cytotoxic molecule that binds chitin in the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roncero and Durán, 1985</xref>), growth of cells lacking exomer and AP1 is exquisitely sensitive to CFW in the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Valdivia et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24126.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Selection of yeast mutants resistant to calcofluor white.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of post-Golgi trafficking pathways.

Accordingly, this hypothesis was further tested by deleting the gene encoding the Swe1 kinase that phosphorylates Cdc28/CDK to inhibit its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lianga et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pal et al., 2008</xref>); if the <italic>mih1-1</italic> allele exerts its effect via activated Cdc28/CDK, deletion of <italic>SWE1</italic> should revert the CFW<sup>R</sup> and Chs3-GFP trafficking phenotypes.

We tested this by assaying the activities of purified Mih1, Mih1-1, and the catalytically inactive C320S form of Mih1, toward phosphorylated Vps26. Mih1 proteins were purified from yeast strains that overexpress each protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), and Vps26-GFP was purified from a <italic>mih1Δ</italic> strain. The results clearly show that the wild-type and Mih1-1 phosphatases, but not Mih1(C320S), dephosphorylate Vps26, which was confirmed by comparing to the products of a reaction using pure protein phosphatase derived from bacteriophage lambda (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Accumulation of phosphorylated Vps26 in <italic>mih1Δ</italic> cells, decreased phosphorylation of Vps26-GFP in <italic>mih1-1</italic> cells, and the demonstration that phosphorylated Vps26 is a substrate for purified Mih1 in vitro, lead us to conclude that Vps26 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> substrate of Mih1 in vivo.</p><p>Ten phosphorylated residues in Vps26 have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stark et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bodenmiller et al., 2008</xref>), notably including five serine residues located within a loop that connects two β strands (corresponding to ‘loop 6’ in the structure of mammalian Vps26), as well as several positions corresponding to structurally significant features of arrestin family proteins, to which Vps26 is structurally related. To address the significance of Vps26 phosphorylation status controlled by Mih1, we first compared localizations and steady state abundances of GFP- and/or FLAG epitope-tagged Vps26 and Vps35 in wild-type, <italic>mih1-1</italic>, and <italic>mih1Δ</italic> cells; no differences were noted between these strains, suggesting that Mih1 does not control organelle targeting or turnover of retromer proteins (not shown). Therefore, as an indicator of retromer function, we assessed CFW resistance of mutant strains in which annotated phosphorylated residues in Vps26 were changed to alanine (Ala), and observed that no single point mutation affected CFW resistance of the cells (not shown). We therefore removed most of loop 6 (22 of 33 amino acids) including the five annotated phosphorylated serine and threonine residues, using the structure of human Vps26A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shi et al., 2006</xref>) as a guide to avoid distorting the global fold of the mutant protein. Deletion of loop 6 (‘Vps26ΔL6’) confers increased sensitivity to CFW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), suggesting that this enhances plasma membrane localization of Chs3-GFP. That is, deletion of this loop appears to potentiate retromer-mediated recycling of Chs3. Consistent with residues of loop 6 being targets of Mih1 activity, the amount of phosphorylated Vps26ΔL6 detected by immunoblotting was reduced by ~50% compared to native Vps26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Next, each of the known and potential sites of phosphorylation of loop 6 were substituted with a phosphomimetic or non-phosphoryl residues and growth on CFW medium was scored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Similar to cells with the loop 6 deletion, substitution of all serine (Ser) and threonine (Thr) residues with glutamate (Glu) results in enhanced CFW sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, rows 1, 5), suggesting that phosphorylation of these residues potentiates retromer-mediated recycling. Importantly, these substitutions exerted this effect in the context of the <italic>mih1-1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, compare rows 2 and 3), correlating the charge on these residues with the CFW<sup>R</sup> phenotype of <italic>mih1-1</italic> cells. In contrast, substitution of these residues with non-phosphoryl alanine residues conferred modest resistance CFW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, compare rows 1 and 8), indicating that these substitutions diminish retromer function. Thus, the data argue that Mih1 regulates retromer-dependent recycling in part by controlling the phosphorylation status of Vps26 loop 6 residues. We note that the data also suggest Mih1 has additional targets that affect the growth response to CFW, as deletion of <italic>mih1</italic> is epistatic to the Vps26 loop 6 (A) substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, compare rows 7 and 8).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24126.008</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Substitutions within Vps26 loop 6 influence cargo recycling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Deletion of loop 6 of Vps26 confers CFW sensitive growth.

Thus, Chs3 should possess a recycling signal that is recognized by retromer. As previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weiskoff and Fromme, 2014</xref>), a ‘YYL’ sequence (amino acids 12–14) located within the N-terminal cytoplasmic segment of Chs3 is a candidate and the results of three experiments confirmed this. First, substitution of these three residues with Ala results in CFW resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Second, an immobilized fusion protein composed of the first 52 amino acids of Chs3 fused to glutathione S transferase (GST) captures both Vps26 and Vps35 retromer subunits from cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We note that a previous report found that isolated human Vps26 recognizes the retromer sorting motif of the SorLA protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fjorback et al., 2012</xref>), and that in our experiments Vps26 was slightly, but reproducibly enriched on this matrix relative to Vps35. As Vps26 is the least tightly associated yeast retromer subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Seaman et al., 1998</xref>), these data suggest that Vps26 may directly recognize GST-Chs3(1-52) while Vps35 capture is indirect. Third, ligand-binding assays employing pure recombinant Vps26 and GST-Chs3(1-52) shows that Vps26 does indeed recognize GST-Chs3(1-52) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), while there is no detectable binding to GST with an irrelevant C-terminal sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

This form of Vps26 exhibits a nearly 4-fold higher affinity for GST-Chs3(1-52) (<italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> of 5.2 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In close agreement with this measurement, the loop 6 phosphomimetic form of Vps26 (Vps26(L6E) binds GST-Chs3(1-52) with a <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> of 4.3 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Taken together, the data correlate an increase in the affinities with which the Chs3 recycling signal is recognized by Vps26 with sorting outcome; an increase in the affinity of cargo resulting from phosphorylation of loop 6 results in enhanced recycling of Chs3.</p><p>How does phosphorylation of Vps26 control the affinity with which Vps26 recognizes cargo? A role for Vps26 in cargo recognition had been raised previously on the basis of its structural homology to arrestin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shi et al., 2006</xref>), which serve as cargo adapters for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moore et al., 2007</xref>), and the finding that Vps26 binds the retromer sorting motif of SorLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fjorback et al., 2012</xref>). Atomic structures of activated β-arrestin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2013</xref>), especially that of β-arrestin1 bound to a phosphorylated peptide derived from the human V2 vasopressin receptor (termed ‘V2Rpp’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shukla et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), potentially provide remarkable insight into this question. Arrestins are composed of two tandem β sandwich domains whose relative orientation toggles between an inactive conformation and an active conformation that binds ligand-activated, phosphorylated GPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shukla et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2014</xref>). The phosphorylated C-terminal segment of GPCR binds to the N-terminal domain in a concave ‘cup’ that is partly occluded in the inactive conformation by a loop, termed the ‘finger loop,’ that connects two strands within a β sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shukla et al., 2013</xref>). In the active, receptor-bound conformation of β-arrestin1, the finger loop extends from the domain, allowing it to contact the membrane core of the GPCR and exposing the binding site of the GPCR C-terminal segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shukla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szczepek et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The finger loop of β-arrestin1 corresponds to the phosphorylated loop 6 of Vps26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). It is unlikely that loop 6 directly recognizes the retromer sorting signal. Rather, we suggest that it functions as a gate that controls access of the β sheet of N-terminal domain to cargo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In its unphosphorylated state, the extended loop would antagonize cargo engagement via an auto-inhibited conformation, akin to the conformation of the finger loop of β-arrestin1 in the inactive state, and phosphorylation of loop residues would displace it from occluding access to the surface of the β sheet, akin to the displacement of the β-arrestin-1 finger loop in the active conformation. This mechanism provides for a tunable system for adjusting the abundance of proteins on the cell surface via recycling regulated by kinase-phosphatase networks that are responsive to metabolic and environmental cues. Surprisingly, neither the <italic>mih1-1</italic> or <italic>mih1</italic>Δ mutations affect the distribution of Vps10, a well characterized retromer cargo that cycles between the Golgi apparatus and endosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating the existence of at least one additional mode of cargo recognition by retromer, speculated to be mediated by the Vps35 retromer subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nothwehr et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2000</xref>). Consistent with this, a recently published structure of a Vps35-Vps26-Snx3 complex bound to a peptide containing a retromer sorting signal revealed an additional mode of cargo recognition involving the Snx3-Vps26 interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lucas et al., 2016</xref>). Multiple modes of cargo recognition by retromer provide a mechanistic explanation for the diversity of cargo-specific sorting factors that function with retromer, such as the Snx3, SNX-BAR, and Snx27 sorting nexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cullen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cullen and Korswagen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strochlic et al., 2007</xref>). As cargo recognition plays a key role in targeting soluble retromer to the endosome membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harrison et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lucas et al., 2016</xref>), an important implication of our findings is that distinct cargo recognition modes could drive the formation of distinct retromer-containing complexes on the endosome membrane.</p><p>A future challenge is to identify the signaling pathways and regulatory inputs that modulate plasma membrane composition via retromer-mediated recycling. Importantly, the identification of Mih1 as a physiological regulator of retromer function reveals a new facet of function for CDC25 family phosphatases, which are currently thought to act solely on cyclin-dependent kinases to control cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boutros et al., 2007</xref>). The activities of CDC25 family phosphatases are subject to intricate regulation via kinases and phosphatases that respond to a variety of cellular stimuli and impinge on various cell cycle checkpoints. One possible regulator of Mih1 function with regard to Chs3 recycling is PKC, which is has been shown to control Mih1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yano et al., 2013</xref>) and to promote Chs3 trafficking from the TGN to the plasma membrane via the exomer pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Valdivia and Schekman, 2003</xref>). As PKC is a core component of the cell wall integrity pathway, Mih1-mediated regulation of Chs3 recycling by retromer might reflect a stress response to defects in the cell wall.</p><p>The results presented here indicate that, in addition to the role that yeast Mih1 plays in cell cycle progression, it also controls trafficking of plasma membrane proteins that impact nutrient homeostasis and cell wall remodeling – key axes of cell growth control. Over-expression of CDC25 proteins is observed in some human cancers, leading to speculation that gain-of-function dysregulation, akin to the Mih1-1 protein characterized in this study, contributes to cell transformation. However, it has not been possible to attribute the effects of increased CDC25 expression levels solely to inappropriate progression through the cell cycle and our study raises the possibility that this may be due, in part, to unappreciated activities of CDC25 proteins on non-CDK substrates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Yeast strains and culture conditions</title><p>All yeast strains were constructed in BY4742 (<italic>MAT</italic>α <italic>his3-1</italic>, <italic>leu2-0</italic>, <italic>met15-0</italic>, and <italic>ura3-0)</italic> (Open Biosystems/Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) by homologous recombination of gene-targeted, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-generated DNAs using the method of Longtine et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Longtine et al., 1998</xref>).

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A CDC25 family protein phosphatase gates cargo recognition by the Vps26 Retromer subunit&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom Suzanne Pfeffer, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Here, Cui et al. use a genetic screen to identify a mutant form of the Mih1 phosphatase that alters the recycling of specific proteins at endosomes. They show that Mih1 de-phosphorylates the retromer subunit Vps26, and suggest that phosphorylation of &quot;loop 6&quot; blocks an autoinhibitory interaction to enhance the binding of a subset of retromer cargo. The discovery of a new mechanism to regulate cargo recognition by the retromer complex is novel and important. However, data supporting key elements of the model could be strengthened by additional controls and quantitative analyses throughout, as described below.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) Better quantification of cargo recycling defects is needed, and statistical significance should be reported. While statistical tests are described in the methods, p-values were not reported in the figures or results. Because the cargo missorting phenotypes are relatively weak, careful quantification and statistics are needed to show differences are significant. As an example, it was not obvious that <italic>mih1∆</italic> significantly decreased Chs3-GFP or Mup1-GFP cleavage in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> or 2D as suggested on pages 7 and 8. (Please add quantification to all figures and supplements with p values where possible. Completely independent experiments should be compared.)</p><p>For other cargo, fluorescence microscopy is the only technique used to evaluate missorting, and no quantification is provided. It would strengthen the manuscript to use additional measures of Can1 and Mup1 localization. The Mup1-pHluorin reporter developed by Wendland lab (Prosser et al. Traffic. 2010) is widely used, and canavanine resistance can detect retromer-dependent missorting of Can1, particularly in a snx41 background (see Shi et al., MBoC 2011).</p><p>2) Evidence that Mih1 dephosphorylates the Vps26 L6 loop should be bolstered. While the L6E mutant does phenocopy <italic>mih1∆, mih1∆</italic> is epistatic to L6A and this should not be the case if <italic>mih1∆</italic> phenotypes result from enhanced L6 phosphorylation. Moreover, <italic>mih1-1</italic> is epistatic to both L6A and L6E. To explain the epistasis, the authors suggest Mih1 has additional targets that affect growth on CFW. If this is the case, other measures of cargo missorting should be used that do not rely on CFW, such as the Mup1-pHluorin assay described above.</p><p>To test the hypothesis that Mih1 dephosphorylates the L6 loop, the phosphorylation status of the L6A, L6E and L6∆ mutants should be examined in the <italic>mih1∆</italic> strain, and compared to wild type Vps26 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>.</p><p>3) Additional experiments are needed to establish that YYL is the retromer signal. To show that YYL is the retromer-binding site, a YYL-&gt;AAA mutant form of the GST-Chs3(1-52) construct should be included in one or more of the retromer-binding assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B-D</xref>. Other experiments to strengthen this conclusion could include the demonstration of an equivalent degree of suppression by YYL-&gt;AAA, <italic>vps26∆</italic>, and the YYL-&gt;AAA <italic>vps26∆</italic> double mutant (note the CFW concentration is not indicated in 6A, making it difficult to compare with other figures). Fluorescence microscopy could also be used to test if Chs3-YYL-GFP mutant is localized to the vacuole, similar to Chs3-GFP in a retromer mutant.</p><p>4) CFW data suggest removing the L6 loop makes Vps26 work <italic>better</italic>. This is actually pretty cool, so it would be nice if the authors had another line of evidence to support this result.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the error bars are huge and no error estimates are given, presumably because the experiments have only been done once and to quote K<sub>D</sub>s to 3 significant figures is inappropriate. Could ITC or thermofluor be used here? A better estimate of K<sub>D</sub>s would be really valuable and support the model proposed. It would also be good if the authors could show that mutations do not affect Vps35 binding but this would be dependent on being able to make recombinant Vps35. It would also be nice if a poly phosphorylated version could be used but if the kinase or a fraction containing the kinase is unknown this is probably too much to ask for and using the poly Asp/Glu mutant would suffice.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A CDC25 family protein phosphatase gates cargo recognition by the Vps26 retromer subunit&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman, Senior editor, and Suzanne Pfeffer, Reviewing editor. We appreciate the thoughtful manner in which you responded to the reviewer comments.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved significantly, and we would like to be able to present this story in <italic>eLife</italic> after the following issue is corrected. We believe there is an error in the estimation of the binding affinity for the AAA mutant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; the data shown would imply only that the affinity is &gt;40µM, not 130. Please investigate this and correct the figure accordingly. (Also, the legend indicates average of 3 preps, each done in singlicate? Duplicate? Is the error between preps or between individual samples?)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24126.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Better quantification of cargo recycling defects is needed, and statistical significance should be reported.

We report the means of three independent determinations and provide statistical analyses of significance in the revised figure legends and figures. The recycling defects observed for Chs3-GFP and Can1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) in <italic>mih1-1</italic> cells are significant (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05), or highly significant (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). For <italic>mih1Δ</italic> cells, where we observed reduced processing of the fusion proteins (probably due to a difference in the rate of endocytosis), only the Chs3-GFP is significant (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). Nonetheless, the trend of the Mup1 and Can1 data are highly reproducible and therefore physiologically significant. The epistasis data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> was analyzed in the same manner as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The difference in Chs3-GFP processing in <italic>mih1-1</italic> and <italic>mih1-1 end4-1</italic> cells is significant (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05), but the difference for the Mup1 data is not because the amount of Mup1 that is processed in <italic>mih1-1</italic> cells is small.</p><p>The reviews pointed out that for the GFP-tagged cargoes that are not affected by the <italic>mih1-1</italic> mutation (presented in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we relied solely on the localization patterns of the proteins in the original submission. In the revised manuscript, we more rigorously address this by quantifying the amounts of full-length fusion proteins because essentially no free GFP was observed to be liberated from any of them. We observed no statistically significant differences in protein abundances in <italic>mih1-1</italic> or <italic>mih1Δ</italic> cells.</p><p><italic>2) Evidence that Mih1 dephosphorylates the Vps26 L6 loop should be bolstered. While the L6E mutant does phenocopy mih1∆, mih1∆ is epistatic to L6A and this should not be the case if mih1∆ phenotypes result from enhanced L6 phosphorylation. Moreover, mih1-1 is epistatic to both L6A and L6E. To explain the epistasis, the authors suggest Mih1 has additional targets that affect growth on CFW. If this is the case, other measures of cargo missorting should be used that do not rely on CFW, such as the Mup1-pHluorin assay described above.</italic> </p><p><italic>To test the hypothesis that Mih1 dephosphorylates the L6 loop, the phosphorylation status of the L6A, L6E and L6∆ mutants should be examined in the mih1∆ strain, and compared to wild type Vps26 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We addressed this by measuring the amount of phospho-Vps26ΔL6 to phospho-Vps26 by immunoblotting of the Vps26-GFP proteins immuno-purified from <italic>mih1Δ</italic> cells, as suggested by the reviewers. We observe that deletion of loop 6 reduces the phospho Vps26 signal by approximately 50%, indicating that loop 6 phosphorylation sites accumulate in the absence of Mih1. The new data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (panel B).</p><p><italic>3) Additional experiments are needed to establish that YYL is the retromer signal.</italic></p><p><italic>To show that YYL is the retromer-binding site, a YYL-&gt;AAA mutant form of the GST-Chs3(1-52) construct should be included in one or more of the retromer-binding assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B-D</xref>. Other experiments to strengthen this conclusion could include the demonstration of an equivalent degree of suppression by YYL-&gt;AAA, vps26∆, and the YYL-&gt;AAA vps26∆ double mutant (note the CFW concentration is not indicated in 6A, making it difficult to compare with other figures). Fluorescence microscopy could also be used to test if Chs3-YYL-GFP mutant is localized to the vacuole, similar to Chs3-GFP in a retromer mutant.</italic> </p><p>We measured the affinity of Vps26 for a mutant version of the GST-Chs3 fusion protein in which the YYL sequence was changed to AAA. We did not observe saturation binding to this protein, even with 100 μM Vps26, indicating a dissociation constant ≥130 μM. This result indicates that this sequence is necessary for recognition by Vps26 and is, therefore, consistent with it constituting a retromer-dependent sorting signal. These data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) CFW data suggest removing the L6 loop makes Vps26 work *better*. This is actually pretty cool, so it would be nice if the authors had another line of evidence to support this result.</italic> </p><p>We agree – this is a cool result. A second line of evidence in support of this interpretation was presented in panel D of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, where we showed that a version of Vps26 lacking loop 6 binds to the portion of Chs3 containing the retromer sorting signal with approx. 4-fold higher affinity than the native protein (which contains loop 6). The increase in affinity for the Chs3 sorting signal indicates that the mutant protein “works better”.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the error bars are huge and no error estimates are given, presumably because the experiments have only been done once and to quote K<sub>D</sub>s to 3 significant figures is inappropriate.</italic> </p><p>Evidently, we did not make clear in the original manuscript that each point represents the mean (s.d. indicated) of three independent binding experiments (not one), where <italic>three independent protein preparations</italic> of the four different Vps26 proteins (total of 12 preps) and the GST-Chs3 fusion proteins were assayed. Although the implementation of different protein preparations likely contributes to the variability noted by the reviewer(s) (s.d. for each point is shown), and despite the substantial effort required to prepare all of the proteins, we consider this rigorous practice. In the revised manuscript, we present the results to two significant digits and indicate the standard errors of the mean <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> calculations.</p><p><italic>Could ITC or thermofluor be used here? A better estimate of K<sub>D</sub>s would be really valuable and support the model proposed. It would also be good if the authors could show that mutations do not affect Vps35 binding but this would be dependent on being able to make recombinant Vps35. It would also be nice if a poly phosphorylated version could be used but if the kinase or a fraction containing the kinase is unknown this is probably too much to ask for and using the poly Asp/Glu mutant would suffice.</italic> </p><p>Yes, other techniques could have been used to calculate affinities. In retrospect, it would have been a good idea to identify a collaborator with access to and expertise with the suggested instrumentation. We hope, however, that the reviewers will appreciate the considerable effort that has already been dedicated to these experiments and that our limited resources preclude us from simply discarding the results in hand.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved significantly, and we would like to be able to present this story in eLife after the following issue is corrected. We believe there is an error in the estimation of the binding affinity for the AAA mutant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; the data shown would imply only that the affinity is &gt;40µM, not 130. Please investigate this and correct the figure accordingly. (Also, the legend indicates average of 3 preps, each done in singlicate? duplicate?
