It has been understood that <italic>bcd</italic> RNA is sequestered at the anterior pole during oogenesis, is not translated until fertilization, and produces a protein gradient that functions in the syncytial blastoderm after 9–10 nuclear divisions. However, technical issues limited the sensitivity of analysis of pre-syncytial blastoderm embryos and precluded studies of oocytes after stage 13. We developed methods to analyze stage 14 oocytes and pre-syncytial blastoderm embryos, and found that stage 14 oocytes make Bcd protein, that <italic>bcd</italic> RNA and Bcd protein distribute in matching concentration gradients in the interior of nuclear cycle 2–6 embryos, and that Bcd regulation of target gene expression is apparent at nuclear cycle 7, two cycles prior to syncytial blastoderm. We discuss the implications for the generation and function of the Bcd gradient.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13222.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13222.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13222.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As an embryo develops, a single cell transforms into a collection of different types of cells. One protein that is crucial for this process in fruit fly embryos is Bicoid. Thirty years ago, scientists discovered that Bicoid protein is concentrated at the head end of the embryo and gradually decreases in amount towards the rear end. This concentration gradient of Bicoid protein organizes the embryo body and regulates the expression of many genes, thus directing the cells to develop different identities.</p><p>Several assumptions had been made about how this gradient is established. It was thought that in the unfertilized egg, the mRNA molecules that will be translated to produce Bicoid proteins are stored in an inactive state in the region of the egg that later develops into the embryo’s head. In the embryo, the mRNA molecules were believed to remain in the head region while being translated, with the newly formed proteins then gradually spreading from this site to create the Bicoid gradient. It was also thought that no Bicoid proteins are stored in the unfertilized egg. However, no known methods were sensitive enough to investigate these assumptions.</p><p>Now, using newer and more sensitive methods, Ali-Murthy and Kornberg show that Bicoid protein is present in the unfertilized fruit fly egg in the same region as the mRNA molecules that make Bicoid. Furthermore, the Bicoid gradient forms when the embryo has fewer than 32 nuclei, much earlier in development than previously thought. The Bicoid protein also does not appear to spread passively towards the rear of the embryo, but is transported in a more orchestrated manner.</p><p>Overall, Ali-Murthy and Kornberg’s results suggest that the early fruit fly embryo is more organized and actively regulated than had been previously understood. This paves the way for further studies that use sensitive techniques to investigate this early stage of development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13222.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13222.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>drosophila</kwd><kwd>embryo</kwd><kwd>oocyte</kwd><kwd>bicoid</kwd><kwd>krüppel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007100</institution-id><institution>Sandler Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kornberg</surname><given-names>Thomas B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM109410</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kornberg</surname><given-names>Thomas B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The concentration gradient of Bicoid protein positions gene expression domains along the anterior/posterior axis of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo during the cleavage, pre-syncytial blastoderm stages.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The discovery of the concentration gradient of Bicoid (Bcd) protein in the early Drosophila embryo established the existence and functional importance of a morphogen gradient for the first time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Driever and Nusslein-Volhard, 1988a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">1988b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frigerio et al., 1986</xref>); it was a watershed moment in developmental biology.

The five division cycles that follow delineate the syncytial blastoderm stages nc10-nc14. Nuclear divisions cease at nc14, whereupon the nuclei begin to individuate into single cells and gastrulation ensues. Various measures, including in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Erickson and Cline, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pritchard and Schubiger, 1996</xref>), RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harrison et al., 2010</xref>), genome array hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Renzis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Little et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2009</xref>), RNA seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lott et al., 2011</xref>), DNA footprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harrison et al., 2010</xref>), chromatin profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>) and ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2015</xref>), show that the zygotic genome is transcriptionally activated during the syncytial blastoderm period.</p><p>Oogenesis provides the Drosophila egg with a rich dowry of mRNA that is essential to the development of the early, pre-cellular embryo, and for a number of reasons, the period that precedes the maternal-to-zygotic transition has been considered to depend only on maternal stores and to be independent of the zygotic genome. One, the early nuclear divisions are so rapid (9.6 min) that productive gene expression has been deemed impossible. Two, molecular analyses of transcriptional activity have almost universally failed to detect RNA synthesis at pre-syncytial blastoderm stages, even as the sensitivity of the detection methods has increased. Three, comprehensive genetic screens for mutants defective in early development identified many genes that are required maternally, but found no evidence for genes that must be active in the zygote prior to cellularization at nc14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luschnig et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Merrill et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Perrimon et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schupbach and Wieschaus, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">1986</xref>).</p><p>Although these observations have substantiated the idea that the gene products supplied by the mother during oogenesis are sufficient for first thirteen cleavage cycles, this conclusion is based on negative findings, and because it depends on the sensitivity of the analysis, it leaves open the possibility that more sensitive methods might detect zygotic transcripts expressed from a small number of active genes or might recognize phenotypes in mutant embryos that were not revealed by then available histological techniques. Drosophila embryos are heavily populated with yolk and glycogen granules that impede histological studies, and have few obvious morphological features that can be evaluated for dependence on genotype. In addition, the idea that rapidly dividing nuclei are incapable of expression has no experimental basis because the capacity for transcription and translation at early nuclear cycles has not been analyzed. It is possible therefore that the normal transcriptional processes are sufficient for transcription units that are small (approximately 70% of transcripts made by nc10-12 embryos lack introns; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Renzis et al., 2007</xref>), or it may be that yet unexplored mechanisms produce and use transcripts more rapidly at early stages.</p><p>There are, in fact, several reports of expression by the zygotic genome in pre-syncytial blastoderm Drosophila embryos. The earliest reported zygotic expression obtained by in situ hybridization is at nc8 for the gene <italic>sis-A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Erickson and Cline, 1993</xref>). Evidence for earlier gene expression (β-galactosidase activity in nc4 embryos) was reported for a transgene construct that carried the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene regulated by a FTZ-F2 enhancer fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 1991</xref>). The strongest evidence for functional expression in pre-syncytial blastoderm embryos is for the <italic>engrailed (en</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali-Murthy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karr et al., 1985</xref>). En protein synthesized in the embryo was detected by antibody staining in nc2 nuclei, a mutant phenotype was identified in <italic>en</italic> nc2-3 embryos, and PCR and RNA-seq studies provided evidence for expression of a small cohort of genes prior to nc7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali-Murthy et al., 2013</xref>). These findings show that development of the early embryo is not entirely pre-programmed and that the processes that orchestrate the early stages are actively and directly regulated.</p><p>The work described here investigates the development of the early embryo further, focusing on the formation and function of the Bcd gradient. To do so, we needed to develop methods that overcome the technical impediments that have limited analysis of the early stages. For instance, because Drosophila fertilization cannot be made synchronous and because females hold their embryos for variable periods prior to laying, an embryo of any particular stage must be identified histologically and individually, and methods must be used that are sensitive enough to detect expression from a small number of active genes in the small number of nuclei. Although molecular detection methods have improved, antibody staining and in situ hybridization have been ineffective due to the large number of yolk and glycogen granules that reduce signal to noise and sensitivity. By using sensitive methods that we modified for studies of the early embryo, we found that the processes that generate the Bcd protein gradient are more complex and operate earlier than had been appreciated, and that the function of the Bcd gradient begins prior to formation of the syncytial blastoderm.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bicoid-dependent Krüppel expression</title><p><italic>Krüppel</italic> (<italic>Kr</italic>) is a 'gap'” gene that is expressed by pre-cellular, syncytial blastoderm embryos in a central band that spans approximately 20% embryo length.

The increase in dot brightness during the nuclear cycle suggests that the in situ hybridization signal is proportional to the quantity (number and length) of transcripts, and although the longer nuclear cycle at nc11 relative to nc9 may account for the increased signal at the later cycle, the signal increase observed in embryos with additional Bcd dosage was not expected.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13222.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Characterization of <italic>Kr</italic> transcripts detected in situ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In situ hybridization detected <italic>Kr</italic> transcripts in mid-interphase to late prophase nuclei as discrete red fluorescent dots in nuclear cycle 9 and 11 embryos.

Chromosomes in nuclei at the cortex of syncytial blastoderm embryos are organized and polarized such that the centromeric regions congregate apically and the telomeres congregate basally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marshall et al., 1996</xref>).

During stage 14, the oocyte 'undresses': the follicle cells unfasten from the chorion and re-arrange into longitudinal rows and the nuclei elongate (stage 14b), and the cells begin to migrate toward the anterior end and concentrate in an anterior 'collar' (stage 14c). The follicle cells are shed from the tips of the fully formed and separated dorsal appendages (stage 14d). At stage 14c-d, oocytes exit from the distal end of the ovary and enter the lateral branches of the oviduct.

The improved method we developed to monitor RNA in situ did not detect <italic>Kr</italic> in nc3-6 embryos, presumably due to insufficient sensitivity, but the unexpected finding that <italic>Kr</italic> is expressed by nuclei in the middle region of embryos as early as nc7 has fascinating implications that this work explores.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Nuclear polarity prior to syncytial blastoderm</title><p>The cortical nuclei at the surface of late syncytial blastoderm embryos have apical-basal polarity that is manifested in the organization of their chromosomes. Whereas the centromeric regions of the chromosomes coalesce to form a chromocenter that is at the most apical aspect of the nuclei, the telomeres congregate basally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marshall et al., 1996</xref>). Our in situ hybridization experiments located nascent transcripts at the <italic>Kr</italic> gene, which is situated just proximal to the telomere of chromosome 2R, and analysis of serial optical sections revealed that the nascent transcripts are at the basal regions of nc7 and nc8 nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These nuclei are approximately 34 μm and 22 μm, respectively, from the embryo surface, indicating that nuclei in the interior of the embryo are organized and polarized with respect to the cortex. The idea that internal chromosome organization is related to gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marshall et al., 1996</xref>) is consistent with our finding that these nuclei are transcriptionally active. Nuclear divisions in the pre-syncytial blastoderm embryo are precisely synchronized even as the nuclei move to collectively occupy larger volumes of the embryo at later nuclear cycles, and the choreography they follow as they move to the cortex is highly reproducible. Our finding that nuclei are oriented prior to their arrival at the cortex indicates that their apical-basal polarity is not a consequence of short-range interactions with the cortex, and suggests that a global system of structural organization and regulation exists in the early embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Bicoid protein production</title><p>The Bcd concentration gradient is generated from mRNA that is made by nurse cells and is transported to the oocyte where it is sequestered in an inactive state at the anterior end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frigerio et al., 1986</xref>). Previous studies reported that Bcd protein was absent from stage 13 oocytes but present in embryos and unfertilized eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Driever and Nusslein-Volhard, 1988b</xref>). Although stage 14 oocytes were not examined, the assumption that Bcd protein is also absent from stage 14 oocytes was the basis for the current model that translation of Bcd protein begins at egg activation. Our finding that Bcd protein is made in late stage oocytes prior to activation and fertilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) revises this model, but does not fundamentally change it. The distribution of Bcd protein in stage 14c and 14d oocytes is consistent with the idea that Bcd protein is made by mRNA that was localized to the anterior end. Its production in the oocyte raises the question whether Bcd protein is made only in the oocyte and not in the embryo, but this seems unlikely because the level of staining by α-Bcd antibody increased during the pre-cellular cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title><italic>bcd</italic> RNA and Bcd protein distribution in the pre-syncytial blastoderm embryo</title><p>Two models have been proposed for the formation of the Bcd protein gradient. One is based on the observation that both <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA and Bcd protein distribute in concentration gradients at syncytial blastoderm stages (nc9-14), and because of the spatial relationship between these distributions, it posits that the Bcd protein gradient is a direct consequence of the location of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fahmy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Spirov et al., 2009</xref>). This model does not require or invoke a role for protein diffusion, but proposes instead that a process of directed and regulated transport produces a concentration gradient of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA that precedes and generates the Bcd protein gradient. The second model also involves a gradient of <italic>bcd</italic> RNA, but because the <italic>bcd</italic> RNA was not observed to extend as far posteriorly as Bcd protein, it proposes a major role for Bcd protein diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Little et al., 2011</xref>). Although our studies of pre-syncytial blastoderm stages do not address the RNA and protein distributions at the later syncytial blastoderm stages, they are likely to be relevant to them.</p><p>We observed that <italic>bcd</italic> RNA and Bcd protein formed similar distributions in the interior of pre-syncytial blastoderm embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Although these distributions were constantly changing, the approximate match between the RNA and protein patterns remained constant. The RNA and protein were tightly concentrated at the anterior end of stage 14 oocytes, broader in nc1 embryos, and formed a graded internal plume that extended the farthest toward the posterior in nc3-4 embryos. The plume had complex geometries that were not radially symmetric, but after nc6-7, the internal plume was no longer visible and most of the <italic>bcd</italic> RNA and protein was near or at the cortex. The cortical distributions were radially symmetric. The mechanisms that generate these distributions are not known, but because the patterns of <italic>bcd</italic> RNA and protein are so similar, we suggest that the mechanisms are probably related. Although these mechanisms cannot be deduced from the geometries of the distributions, the complex and well-defined shapes and the rapidity with which the distributions form and change would seem to be incompatible with passive diffusion.</p><p>The <italic>bcd</italic> RNA and Bcd protein distributions we observed in the pre-cellular embryo reveal two distinct concentration gradients – one in the embryo interior that forms between nc1 and nc6, and a second one that forms later at the embryo cortex. We assume that the <italic>bcd</italic> RNA and Bcd protein of the early, first gradient contribute to the second, and therefore call this a two-step model. This model contrasts with the models that have been proposed previously in which the dispersion of protein (and RNA) from the anterior pole is continuous during both the pre-syncytial blastoderm and syncytial blastoderm stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Although the two-step model is presumably generated by motor-driven directed movement, the high yolk content of the embryo cytoplasm has impeded analysis of its cytoskeletal elements. However, several studies have reported microtubule networks in the pre-syncytial embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fahmy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karr and Alberts, 1986</xref>) and threads of microtubules up to 50 μm long extending from the cortex into the interior at syncytial blastoderm stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fahmy et al., 2014</xref>).

Although the number of nuclei with nascent <italic>Kr</italic> transcripts was small, the internal nuclei with transcripts were at the approximate position along the anterior/posterior axis where older, syncytial blastoderm embryos have robust <italic>Kr</italic> expression, and this position was influenced by the level of Bcd protein in a similar way as the later, cortical expression. We also detected a concentration gradient of nuclear Bcd protein at the nc6 stage, when the embryo has just 32 nuclei that are deep in the interior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and observed that the both the internal and cortical Bcd gradients as well as both internal and cortical <italic>Kr</italic> expression were abnormal in <italic>exu</italic> and <italic>stau</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results show that Bcd regulates <italic>Kr</italic> in nuclei that are far from the cortex, and importantly, that the internal plume of Bcd protein is a functional distribution. These findings therefore establish that it is the pre-syncytial blastoderm, internal Bcd gradient that regulates gap gene expression and organizes the embryo’s anterior/posterior axis. Although these findings do not imply what the role of the subsequent cortical Bcd gradient in the syncytial blastoderm stages Bcd gradient might be, it is most likely that the cortical gradient derives from the earlier distribution and therefore that it reflects the outputs of the pre-syncytial blastoderm, internal gradient.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Perspectives</title><p>Morphogens such as Hedgehog, Wingless, Decapentaplegic, and Fibroblast growth factor distribute in concentration gradients across fields of cells in the tissues of developing animals. Their distributions are generated by transport along actin-based cytonemes (Roy, 2011 #56 and reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kornberg, 2014</xref>) and direct exchange between producing and receiving cells at morphogenetic synapses where release and uptake of secreted proteins is regulated (Roy, 2014 #57 and reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kornberg and Roy, 2014</xref>). The generation of the Bcd concentration gradients in the pre-cellular embryo would appear to have little in common with the gradients that form by cytoneme-mediated dispersion across fields of cells, but we pose the question whether they do. Neither appears to be dependent on passive diffusion and both appear to involve dispersion along cytoskeletal cables. The critical attribute that these mechanisms share is that they provide ways to regulate movement in space and time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Fly lines</title><p>(WT) <italic>DGRP-208; stau<sup>1</sup> cn<sup>1</sup> bw<sup>1</sup>/CyO; Df(2R)PC4/CyO; cn<sup>1</sup> exu<sup>4</sup> bw<sup>1</sup>/CyO, l(2)DTS100<sup>1</sup>; w*; Df(2R)exu<sup>2</sup>/CyO; bcd<sup>E1</sup>; Diap1<sup>1</sup> st<sup>1</sup> kni<sup>ri-1</sup> bcd<sup>6</sup> rn<sup>roe-1</sup> p<sup>p</sup>/TM3, Sb<sup>1</sup>; Dp(bcd:GFP); bcd<sup>E1</sup>/TM3; +/CyO, Dp(bcd); bcd<sup>E1</sup>/TM</italic>3; <italic>Df(2R)Kr<sup>10</sup>, b<sup>1</sup> pr<sup>1</sup> Bl<sup>1</sup> c<sup>1</sup>/SM1; Dp(bcd:GFP)</italic> (4x <italic>bcd); p(BAC, +5 +8)</italic> (6x <italic>bcd</italic>)</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Primary antibodies: rabbit α-Bcd (M.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Allan Spradling as the Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Eisen and Markus Noll (peer reviewers).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> egg and early embryo provide much of our current insight into how maternal factors contribute to early developmental patterning. The formation of the bicoid protein gradient by the regulated translation of maternally localized <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA represents a key aspect of this process, one that has become the textbook example of a &quot;morphogen gradient.&quot; However, the mechanisms which shape the gradient remain imperfectly understood and competing models have been put forward. The consensus opinion among the reviewers is that the work presented here adds to our understanding of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo patterning and Bcd gradient formation.</p><p>Several important findings are reported. (1) The gap gene <italic>Kr</italic> is expressed as nascent transcripts by nuclear cycle 7 and 8 (nc7 and 8) at the proper location (2) in nuclei that are already polarized (as these transcripts are associated with chromosome arms and located basally; <italic>Kr</italic> is located at the telomere), i.e., prior to their arrival at the cortex. (3) Bcd protein is visible in a concentration gradient already at nc2 to nc6, which depends also at early presyncytial blastoderm stages on the presence of maternal Stau and Exu proteins. (4) At these early presyncytial blastoderm stages, the Bcd protein gradient extends posteriorly in what the authors call a medial plume rather than at the cortex as at later stages. This proves that the process of gradient formation must be more complex than previously thought. (5) The distribution of <italic>bcd</italic> RNA is very similar to that of Bcd protein also at these early cleavage stages (nc2 – nc6), with the medial plume reaching its maximum intensity at nc4. (6) The authors detected Bcd protein already at nc1 and (7), most astonishingly, in stage 14c and 14d oocytes, again coincident with the anterior location of <italic>bcd</italic> RNA in oocytes. (8) In contrast to <italic>bcd</italic> RNA, which was evident in oocytes at earlier stages, Bcd protein was not detected before stage 14c. This demonstrates that the translational block of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA is relieved prior to fertilization and that Bcd protein is present precisely where <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA is sequestered.</p><p>The authors describe a different shape and demonstrate that zygotic gene expression starts earlier than the pre-cellular blastoderm stage by forcing a revision in the previously accepted timing and spatial distribution of <italic>bcd</italic> RNA and protein, and by contradicting some aspects of the leading model for how the gradient is produced.</p><p>In the Discussion, the authors propose a two-step model of Bcd gradient formation, which differs from an earlier model mainly by the initial gradient formation of the medial plume during nc2-6. This gradient is followed by a cortical gradient, consistent with a model previously proposed (Spirov et al., 2009). This latter model and the model proposed by the authors are consistent with the gradient being formed by the <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA that, by translation, produces the Bcd protein gradient although the authors are more conservative. The most important conclusion is that mechanisms of morphogen gradient formation in general are not dependent on passive diffusion, overthrowing a tenet maintained over many decades, but &quot;appear to involve dispersion along cytoskeletal cables.&quot;</p><p>A small number of relatively minor revisions are now requested.</p><p>1) The major weakness of the paper relates to the authors' claim to have developed new and more sensitive methods for detecting RNA and protein in preblastoderm <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. While the authors document expression earlier than previously reported, an achievement that likely required improved sensitivity of DIG in situ hybridization as well as of antibody staining of early embryos to achieve a much better signal-to-noise ratio. However, the manuscript does not include experiments directly comparing different in situ hybridization methods, including in particular smFISH, which is generally accepted to have greater sensitivity in many applications. It remains unclear why the low level expression described here was not detected in previous studies. Consequently, statements about the relative sensitivity of various methods should be removed from the manuscript unless data from such tests are added.</p><p>2) The finding that the <italic>bcd</italic> RNA translational block is relieved in late stage 14 oocytes is interesting but because follicles were incubated in vitro for an extended period, the possibility of artifact remains. A recent study shows that stage 14 oocytes about to be ovulated can be recognized by the loss of posterior follicle cells (Deady et al. 2015). The authors may wish to investigate whether the onset of <italic>bcd</italic> translation takes place before or after ovulation, in vivo.</p><p>3) The authors should more adequately reference earlier literature, which shows that nuclear foci of in situ hybridization are often sites of nascent transcription.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13222.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>A small number of relatively minor revisions are now requested. 1) The major weakness of the paper relates to the authors' claim to have developed new and more sensitive methods for detecting RNA and protein in preblastoderm Drosophila embryos.

Consequently, statements about the relative sensitivity of various methods should be removed from the manuscript unless data from such tests are added.</italic> </p><p>A supplemental figure to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> has been added that compares results of <italic>bcd</italic> and <italic>Kr</italic> in situ hybridization with FISH, Quantigene and DIG probes. The text in the Results now reads:</p><p>“To identify the nuclei that express <italic>Kr</italic> transcription prior to nc10, we evaluated various different techniques for in situ hybridization, and determined that a procedure we developed that uses DIG probes was the most sensitive for our studies of <italic>Kr</italic> and <italic>bcd</italic> transcripts in pre-cellular embryos (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><p> <italic>2) The finding that the bcd RNA translational block is relieved in late stage 14 oocytes is interesting but because follicles were incubated in vitro for an extended period, the possibility of artifact remains. A recent study shows that stage 14 oocytes about to be ovulated can be recognized by the loss of posterior follicle cells (Deady et al. 2015). The authors may wish to investigate whether the onset of bcd translation takes place before or after ovulation, in vivo.</italic> </p><p>The following sentence has been added to the Methods:</p><p>“Results of in situ hybridization and antibody staining with oocytes obtained from freshly dissected ovaries and from ovaries incubated ex vivo were indistinguishable.”</p><p> <italic>3) The authors should more adequately reference earlier literature, which shows that nuclear foci of in situ hybridization are often sites of nascent transcription.</italic></p><p>The earlier literature showing foci of in situ hybridization as sites of nascent transcript has been cited as follows:</p><p>“In situ hybridization can detect sites of nascent transcript production as points of staining or fluorescence (Femino et al., 1998; Shermoen and O'Farrell, 1991), and the nc10-13 embryos we analyzed had bright dots in most or all nuclei in the “<italic>Kr</italic> band”.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
