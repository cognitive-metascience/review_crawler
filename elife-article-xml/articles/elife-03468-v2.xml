However, evidence supporting an essential role for negative selection is limited. Loss of Bim, a Bcl-2 BH3-only protein essential for thymocyte apoptosis, rarely results in autoimmunity on the C57BL/6 background. Mice with T cell-specific over-expression of Bcl-2, that blocks multiple BH3-only proteins, are also largely normal. The nuclear receptor Nur77, also implicated in negative selection, might function redundantly to promote apoptosis by associating with Bcl-2 and exposing its potentially pro-apoptotic BH3 domain. Here, we report that T cell-specific expression of a <italic>Bcl2</italic> BH3 mutant transgene results in enhanced rescue of thymocytes from negative selection. Concomitantly, T<sub>reg</sub> development is increased. However, aged BH3 mutant mice progressively accumulate activated, autoreactive T cells, culminating in development of multi-organ autoimmunity and lethality. These data provide strong evidence that negative selection is crucial for establishing T cell tolerance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03468.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03468.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03468.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our immune system protects us from disease by recognizing and mounting a defence against harmful pathogens that enter our bodies. T cells, a type of white blood cell, play a key role in this process. Each T cell has a unique protein called a T cell receptor on its surface that is able to recognize particular pieces of pathogens. Together, the millions of T cells in our bodies, each with its own unique T cell receptor, can initiate an immune response to eliminate a vast array of potential pathogens.</p><p>T cells are made in an organ called the thymus. During this production process, immature T cells are generated, including some with T cell receptors that recognize the harmless molecules that make up our bodies. If allowed to enter the bloodstream and left to their own devices, these T cells could trigger an immune response against the body, leading to the development of autoimmune disease.</p><p>Normally, many of these ‘auto-reactive’ T cells are instructed to die in the thymus by a process called negative selection. Furthermore, auto-reactive cells that escape into the blood can also be shut down by additional failsafe mechanisms. Given the success of these failsafe mechanisms, notably the effectiveness of a class of T cells called T regulatory cells, some researchers have begun to ask if negative selection is necessary to prevent autoimmunity.</p><p>During negative selection T cells die as a result of a process called apoptosis. Multiple proteins have been implicated in T cell apoptosis, including Bim, Puma and the Nur77 family of nuclear receptors. Blocking the function of some these proteins individually can rescue some autoreactive T cells from death: however, this rarely results in the development of autoimmune disease.</p><p>Burger et al. have now created a mouse strain with T cells that produce large amounts of a mutant form of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, which can block the function of multiple pro-apoptotic proteins, including Bim and Puma. Additionally, it has been proposed that Bcl-2 can be converted to a pro-apoptotic protein by Nur77 proteins, but the Bcl-2 proteins in the mutant strain are able to resist this process.</p><p>T cells in the thymus of the mutant mice were highly resistant to apoptosis accompanying negative selection. Moreover, as the mice aged, they accumulated autoreactive T cells in the blood, which led to symptoms of autoimmune disease and early death. While various failsafe mechanisms were engaged, they did not provide sufficient protection. The work of Burger et al. thus provides strong evidence that negative selection in the thymus is crucial for the prevention of autoimmune disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03468.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03468.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Nur77</kwd><kwd>Bcl-2</kwd><kwd>autoimmunity</kwd><kwd>negative selection</kwd><kwd>T cell tolerance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA66236</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winoto</surname><given-names>Astar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cancer Research Coordinating Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burger</surname><given-names>Megan L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA168007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burger</surname><given-names>Megan L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Using mice expressing a Bcl-2 mutant protein to suppress multiple central tolerance pathways, it is shown that central tolerance is crucial for preventing autoimmunity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Maintenance of T cell self-tolerance is essential for the prevention of autoimmune diseases. A series of mechanisms are thought to be involved in establishing T cell tolerance, the first of which is deletion of potentially self-reactive T cells in the thymus. During T cell development, autoreactive T cells bind self-peptide presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules with high affinity and receive strong T cell receptor (TCR) signals that trigger apoptosis and clonal deletion. Some of these cells can also differentiate down an alternative pathway to a harmless lineage, such as T regulatory cells (T<sub>reg</sub>), or also CD8αα and invariant NK T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stritesky et al., 2012</xref>). The importance of this process, termed negative selection, in establishing self-tolerance and preventing autoimmunity was best demonstrated in studies of mice deficient in the autoimmune regulator (<italic>Aire</italic>) gene. These mice develop a multi-organ autoimmune disease as the result of defective deletion of auto-reactive T cells specific to tissue-restricted antigens (TRA), which would normally be expressed by medullary thymic epithelial cells under the control of AIRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>). Humans with loss of AIRE function develop similar disease pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finnish-German APECED Consortium., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nagamine et al., 1997</xref>). However, additional models that implicate a breakdown in negative selection as the driving force behind the development of autoimmune disease are lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">von Boehmer and Melchers, 2010</xref>). This might suggest that under most circumstances, subsequent tolerizing mechanisms in the peripheral compartments such as anergy or T<sub>reg</sub>-mediated suppression are sufficient to compensate for defective thymic deletion. Even in the case of AIRE-deficiency, impaired tolerization of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the periphery by extra-thymic AIRE expressing cells likely contributes to the development of autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>). This has cast doubt on the relative importance of negative selection for maintaining immunological self-tolerance.</p><p>Apoptosis of thymocytes during negative selection is dependent on the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tischner et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, the pro-apoptotic, Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3) only protein, Bim, which is upregulated in response to strong TCR signals, is essential for this process. Bim and other BH3-only proteins are thought to promote apoptosis by binding and inhibiting anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (such as Bcl-2, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> and Mcl-1) that directly suppress downstream effectors Bax and Bak, which are responsible for disrupting mitochondrial membrane integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Youle and Strasser, 2008</xref>). Bim-deficiency has been shown to cause defective thymocyte apoptosis in several TCR transgenic (HY, OTI, OTII) models of negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouillet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suen and Baldwin, 2012</xref>). However, this apoptotic defect does not lead to emergence of autoreactive mature T cells except in the case of negative selection to TRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kovalovsky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suen and Baldwin, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Bim</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice on a mixed 129/Sv X C57BL/6 background develop a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like autoimmune disease, indicative of a breakdown in tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouillet et al., 1999</xref>). However, loss of Bim in other immune compartments likely contributes to the disease, especially B cells, which are important mediators of SLE pathology. This phenotype was greatly ameliorated on the autoimmune-resistant C57BL/6 background and is distinct from the multi-organ, T cell dominant disease found in AIRE-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouillet et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Labi et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, a study showed that additional loss of Puma (<italic>Bbc3</italic>), another BH3-only protein, enhanced the <italic>Bim</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> thymic deletion defect and led to the development of immune pathology more similar to that found in AIRE-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray et al., 2012</xref>). T cells from these mice were able to transfer the disease, lending support to it being T cell-driven. However, the role of non-T cells in these mice cannot be excluded due to germline deletion of Puma and Bim. In addition, T-cell specific over-expression of Bcl-2, which can inhibit both Bim and Puma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2005</xref>), does not lead to autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sentman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Linette et al., 1995</xref>), suggesting that a defect in T cells alone may be insufficient to cause disease. Alternatively, redundant negative selection pathways involving Bim, Puma and the Nur77 family members (See below) may not allow Bcl-2 over-expression to block all pathways leading to negative selection.</p><p>In addition to Bim, the Nur77 family of orphan steroid receptors, which includes Nur77, Nor-1 and Nurr1, has also been implicated in apoptosis accompanying negative selection. Nur77 expression, like that of Bim, is induced by strong TCR signals that result in negative selection. Low expression of both proteins has been correlated with defective clonal deletion in Non-obese Diabetic (NOD) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sohn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liston et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, T cell-specific over-expression of Nur77, or Nor-1, results in massive apoptosis of thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 1997b</xref>). Expression of a dominant negative Nur77 protein that can block all family members results in inhibition of apoptosis in the F5 and HY TCR transgenic models of negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calnan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 1996</xref>). Deficiency in Nur77 alone (<italic>Nr4a1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>) results in moderate inhibition of apoptosis accompanying negative selection in the OTII and BDC2.5 TCR transgenic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fassett et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the Nur77 family has also been shown to transcriptionally regulate <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression and deletion of all three Nur77 family members (<italic>Nr4a3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> <italic>X</italic> Cd4<italic>-Cre</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup><italic>Nr4a1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>Nr4a2</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup>) results in impaired T<sub>reg</sub> cell production and development of a quick onset, severe autoimmune disease resembling that of Foxp3-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sekiya et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, Nur77 could contribute to the maintenance of immunological tolerance both by facilitating deletion of autoreactive thymocytes and ensuring production of T<sub>reg</sub> cells. The mechanism by which Nur77 and its family members promote thymocyte apoptosis has long been under investigation. We and others showed that strong TCR signals induce the translocation of Nur77 and Nor-1 from the nucleus to the mitochondria in thymocytes, a phenomenon first reported to occur in cancer cells in response to apoptotic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thompson and Winoto, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). At the mitochondria, Nur77 and Nor-1 bind Bcl-2 and cause exposure of Bcl-2's BH3 domain, the ‘death’ domain of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Bcl-2 BH3 exposure correlates with thymocyte apoptosis in TCR-stimulated thymocytes and HY and F5 TCR transgenic thymocytes undergoing negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thompson and Winoto, 2008</xref>). BH3-exposed Bcl-2 might act similarly to BH3-only protein Bim to bind and inhibit other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, such as Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, as was demonstrated in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kolluri et al., 2008</xref>). It is thus possible that Nur77 converts Bcl-2 to a pro-apoptotic effector during negative selection, preventing over-expression of Bcl-2 from completely blocking negative selection.</p><p>Here, we generated a T cell-specific <italic>Bcl2</italic> BH3 mutant transgenic mouse, in which Bcl-2's purported pro-apoptotic BH3 function should be abolished by changing its conserved BH3 residues, GDD, to alanines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 1997a</xref>). We found that over-expression of both wild-type and BH3 mutant Bcl-2 efficiently rescued thymocyte apoptosis in two TCR transgenic models of negative selection. However, the BH3 mutant transgene more effectively blocked TCR-induced thymocyte apoptosis in vitro and better rescued high affinity TCR clones from deletion in polyclonal systems in vivo. Interestingly, BH3 mutant transgenic mice, in contrast to the reported wild-type <italic>Bcl2</italic> transgenic mouse phenotype, developed multi-organ autoimmune pathology and died around one year-of-age. Thus, we provide strong evidence that a breakdown in thymocyte apoptosis during negative selection is indeed sufficient to cause autoimmune disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of T cell-specific <italic>Bcl2</italic> BH3 domain mutant transgenic mice</title><p>To investigate the role of the Bcl-2 BH3 domain in thymocyte apoptosis, we created T cell-specific <italic>Bcl2</italic> BH3 mutant transgenic mice.

Although the transgene is expressed by the <italic>Cd4</italic> promoter, increased Bcl-2 expression was detected in DN (CD4<sup>−</sup> CD8<sup>−</sup> double negative) thymocytes as early as CD25<sup>+</sup> CD44<sup>−</sup> DN3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This was very similar to the expression pattern of the <italic>Lck</italic>-driven wild-type <italic>Bcl2</italic> transgene. Additionally, the level of Bcl-2 upregulation in BH3 Tg vs Bcl-2 Tg thymocytes was very similar in DN, DP and CD4 single positive (CD4 SP) thymocytes. Only slightly higher expression of the BH3 transgene was noted in DP and CD4 SP cells. As expected, BH3 transgene expression was downregulated in CD8 single positive (CD8 SP) thymocytes due to loss of CD4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Lymph node CD8 T cells further downregulated BH3 transgene expression, while both BH3 Tg and Bcl-2 Tg CD4 T cells maintained similarly high levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a compensatory downregulation of endogenous mouse Bcl-2 in the thymus, lymph nodes and spleen of both BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, we do not have to consider a contribution of endogenous mouse Bcl-2 to the phenotype of these mice. Due to close similarity in transgene expression level and pattern in the two BH3 Tg lines, BH3 A and BH3 B, we used these mice interchangeably throughout our study (Data not shown). In both BH3 Tg lines, we observed a decreased proportion of DP thymocytes and an increased proportion of SP thymocytes compared to wild-type littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, only the absolute SP cell numbers were increased, especially for CD4 SP cells, while the DP cell number was comparable to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This is largely similar to the thymocyte distribution found in the wild-type Bcl-2 Tg mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sentman et al., 1991</xref>). As expected, the peripheral mature T cell compartment reflects the increased SP thymocyte numbers in both the BH3 Tg and Bcl-2 Tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Relative to wild-type mice, the CD4 to CD8 T cell ratio is therefore somewhat skewed in favor of CD4 T cells in the BH3 Tg mice and CD8 T cells in the Bcl-2 Tg mice. Hence, differential expression in the CD8 compartment is one caveat to comparison of BH3 and Bcl-2 transgenic mice. However, similar expression levels in the CD4 compartment should allow fair comparison of DP, CD4 SP and CD4 T cell phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Defective negative selection in BH3 Tg mice</title><p>A defect in thymocyte apoptosis accompanying negative selection could potentially contribute to increased SP thymocyte and mature T cell numbers in the BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg mice.

We also examined Bcl-2/F5 mice for comparison. In response to injection with the F5 TCR-specific peptide, NP, F5 DP thymocytes undergo massive apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mamalaki et al., 1992</xref>). Strikingly, however, expression of either the BH3 or <italic>Bcl2</italic> transgene almost completely inhibited thymocyte death, with thymocyte numbers only marginally decreased compared to PBS-injected control mice after 48 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Analysis of thymocyte proportions indicated a significant rescue of the DP thymocyte population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We sought to increase the sensitivity of the assay by using a previously described ex vivo thymic slice approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dzhagalov et al., 2013</xref>). This assay allows assessment of apoptosis over a more acute timeline, free of possible cytotoxic effects inherent in the NP injection model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mamalaki et al., 1992</xref>). In this assay, transgenic thymic lobes were embedded in agarose, cut into 500 μm slices by vibratome and cultured in transwells. The slices were then briefly exposed to the relevant or an irrelevant control peptide and thymocyte apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry at 12-hr intervals. Here, again, we saw near complete and equivalent protection of BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg thymocytes from apoptosis in response to NP peptide treatment over a 36-hr time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thymocytes of all genotypes were similarly activated as measured by upregulation of CD69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We also performed an analogous thymic slice assay comparing apoptosis of thymocytes from female BH3 or Bcl-2 Tg mice crossed to HY TCR transgenic mice (BH3/HY or Bcl-2/HY, respectively) in response to the HY TCR-specific peptide, Smcy. Remarkably, just as in the F5 model, thymocytes expressing either transgene were significantly protected from apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Hence, we conclude that Bcl-2 over-expression very efficiently inhibits thymocyte apoptosis accompanying negative selection in these models and this potent blockade could not be enhanced by expression of a BH3 mutant form of Bcl-2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>BH3 transgene enhances rescue of high affinity TCR clones in a polyclonal system</title><p>We next sought to test whether over-expression of Bcl-2 is sufficient to block negative selection in a normal, polyclonal system and if in this context, the BH3 transgene might exhibit enhanced anti-apoptotic activity. To investigate this, we employed the Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> BAC transgenic reporter mouse system, in which GFP is inserted into the start site of the <italic>Nr4a1</italic> (Nur77) transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moran et al., 2011</xref>). Studies of these mice have clearly demonstrated that the level of Nur77 expression in T cells directly correlates with the intensity of the TCR signals received (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moran et al., 2011</xref>). During thymocyte selection, cells receiving strong TCR signals are destined to die by negative selection while cells receiving very weak to no signal die by neglect. Hence, the post-selection thymocyte pool is largely comprised of cells expressing an intermediate level of GFP, reflecting their receipt of moderate, positively selecting TCR signals. In <italic>Bim</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> X Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice, however, a significant number of post-selection thymocytes express high levels of GFP, indicating that high affinity TCR clones are rescued from negative selection in the absence of Bim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stritesky et al., 2013</xref>). This rescue was also reflected by an increase in the total number of post-selection DP and SP thymocytes. When we assessed GFP expression of post-selection thymocytes in BH3/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> and Bcl-2/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice, we observed a strikingly similar phenotype. A large population of GFP-high post-selection DP thymocytes was rescued with the expression of either transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As in <italic>Bim</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice, the proportion of post-selection DP thymocytes was consequently increased compared to wild-type mice, reflecting the rescue of these cells from deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03468.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>BH3 transgene expression rescues high affinity TCR clones in a polyclonal system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow cytometric analysis of GFP expression in pre-selection (CD69<sup>−</sup> TCRβ<sup>−</sup>) vs post-selection (CD69<sup>+</sup> TCRβ<sup>+</sup>) DP thymocytes from Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice expressing the BH3 and <italic>Bcl2</italic> transgenes.

The percent increase in GFPhi cells over wild-type is indicative of the proportion of cells rescued from negative selection by transgene expression. Interestingly, a significantly greater increase in the percentage of GFPhi post-selection DP cells was observed in BH3/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> vs Bcl-2/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice, suggesting that the BH3 transgene might indeed have an enhanced ability over wild-type <italic>Bcl2</italic> to rescue high affinity TCR clones from apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). No increase was observed in GFP-intermediate (GFPint) cells, indicating that the GFPhi population encompasses all rescued cells and that BH3 and <italic>Bcl2</italic> transgene expression, similar to Bim-deficiency, only rescues high affinity clones and therefore does not seem to enhance positive selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stritesky et al., 2013</xref>). BH3 and <italic>Bcl2</italic> transgene expression also rescued GFPhi CD4 and CD8 SP thymocytes from apoptosis. This likely indicates rescue of high affinity clones from deletion in response to self-antigens presented in the medulla and possibly rescue of DP cells that have differentiated into SP thymocytes. Confirming what has been shown in Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moran et al., 2011</xref>), GFP expression in BH3 and Bcl-2 Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> double transgenic mice was also TCR-dependent, as BH3/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> and Bcl-2/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> SP thymocytes removed from MHC in culture down-regulated GFP similarly to WT/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). A greater percentage of GFPhi CD4 SP cells were rescued in BH3 Tg vs Bcl-2 Tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Consistent with the BH3 transgene being downregulated in CD8 SP cells, BH3 expression rescued a smaller percentage of GFPhi CD8 SP thymocytes compared to CD4 SP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D vs 3C</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that Bcl-2 over-expression causes a significant defect in thymocyte negative selection even in a normal, polyclonal system and in this context, the BH3 mutant protein rescues significantly more cells from death than wild-type Bcl-2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Defective superantigen negative selection in BH3 Tg mice</title><p>Endogenous superantigen negative selection is another polyclonal model of clonal deletion whereby specific Vβ TCR-expressing T cells are deleted through interaction of their specific Vβ chain with endogenously-expressed superantigen bound to class II MHC (usually I–E) on antigen presenting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Scherer et al., 1993</xref>). Whether Bcl-2 over-expression can inhibit negative selection against endogenous superantigens is controversial. In one study, <italic>Bcl2</italic> transgene expression did not block superantigen negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sentman et al., 1991</xref>) while another group clearly saw a rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Siegel et al., 1992</xref>).

To assess endogenous superantigen negative selection in BH3 Tg mice, we crossed them to the class II MHC I-E expressing CBA/J strain of mice. CBA/J mice express superantigens that delete T cells expressing Vβ3, 5, 6, 7, 8.1, 9 and 11, but not Vβ8.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Scherer et al., 1993</xref>). We examined the proportions of Vβ5, Vβ6, Vβ8.1/8.2 and Vβ11 expressing DP and SP thymocytes in BH3 Tg X CBA/J mice and their wild-type littermate controls as well as in Bcl-2 Tg X CBA/J mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the proportions of Vβ5, Vβ6 and Vβ11, but not Vβ8.1/8.2, expressing cells decreased between the DP and SP stage in non-transgenic mice, indicative of superantigen negative selection. In both BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg mice, however, increased proportions of Vβ5, Vβ6 and Vβ11 expressing SP thymocytes were observed, suggesting that expression of either transgene can block superantigen-mediated deletion. The BH3 transgene rescued CD8 SP thymocytes less efficiently than the wild-type <italic>Bcl2</italic> transgene, reflective of the relative levels of transgenic protein in the CD8 compartment. CD4 SP thymocytes were rescued to a similar extent by both transgenes, however modestly better by the BH3 transgene for Vβ5<sup>+</sup> and Vβ6<sup>+</sup> cells. Interestingly, we observed a significant increase in Vβ5<sup>+</sup> and Vβ6<sup>+</sup> (but not Vβ11<sup>+</sup>) DP thymocytes in the BH3 Tg mice that was not seen in the Bcl-2 Tg mice. The pattern of rescue in this model parallels that observed in the Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> polyclonal system. Together, these data are consistent with the notion that overexpression of both wild type and BH3 mutant <italic>Bcl2</italic> transgenes leads to an enhanced rescue of thymocytes from negative selection, with the BH3 mutant providing a more complete rescue.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03468.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Superantigen negative selection is inhibited in BH3 Tg mice.</title><p>Flow cytometric analysis of TCR vβ chain expression in DP, CD4 SP and CD8 SP thymocyte subsets from BH3 Tg and Bcl-2 Tg mice (closed shapes, black) compared to littermate wild-type controls (open shapes, grey) on a C57BL/6 X CBA/J genetic background.

Hence, we sought to investigate the fate of the rescued, high affinity T cell clones in the Bcl-2 Tg and BH3 Tg mice. We observed that the GFP mean fluorescence intensity was higher in lymph node T cells from both BH3/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> and Bcl-2/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). GFP expression was also dependent on TCR signaling, as removal of BH3/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> and Bcl-2/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mature T cells from MHC in culture resulted in downregulation of GFP at a rate similar to that observed for WT/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, the increased GFP expression might be leftover from strong TCR signals received in the thymus and/or due to tonic TCR stimulation in the periphery. Interestingly, GFP levels were higher in Bcl-2 Tg vs BH3 Tg T cells, even for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The reason for this is unclear, but it may be due to distinct T cell repertoires in these two lines of mice that lead to differences in T cell signaling in the periphery. T<sub>reg</sub> cells have self-reactive TCRs and express a high level of GFP, however T<sub>reg</sub> cells did not account for the majority of the GFP-high CD4 T cells (data not shown). This indicates that conventional T cells with higher than normal TCR affinity are permitted to migrate into the periphery. Since presumably autoreactive T cells are found in the periphery, mechanisms must exist to keep these cells in check. One mechanism might be the production of more T<sub>reg</sub> cells to mediate suppression of the autoreactive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stritesky et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that GFP-high CD4 SP thymocytes rescued from negative selection express GFP at a very similar level to T<sub>reg</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Since high TCR affinity contributes to T<sub>reg</sub> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stritesky et al., 2012</xref>), we hypothesized that more thymocytes might be directed down this pathway in BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg mice. Indeed, we found greater Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cell proportions and numbers in the both the thymus and lymph nodes of BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). BH3 Tg mice had a more significant increase in peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> numbers compared to Bcl-2 Tg mice (3-fold vs 2-fold), mirroring the higher mature CD4 T cell numbers in these mice. Most of the increase in total T<sub>reg</sub> number was caused by an increase in CD25<sup>−</sup>, and not CD25<sup>+</sup> cells. CD25<sup>−</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells are thought to be derived from diverted, potentially autoreactive thymocytes and are functional, but have reduced suppressive capacity compared to CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhan et al., 2011</xref>). Despite the increase in total T<sub>reg</sub> number in BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg mice, the ratio of CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells to total CD4 T cells was similar to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, some of the rescued high affinity clones appear to be diverted down the CD25<sup>−</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> pathway, but not the CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> pathway. Intriguingly, consistent with this, we observed that CD25<sup>−</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells express higher levels of GFP than CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells, at a similar level to the highest GFP-expressing BH3 Tg clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Another mechanism employed to maintain peripheral tolerance is the induction of T cell anergy upon antigen encounter. In addition to increased T<sub>reg</sub> cells, we also observed a higher proportion of previously activated, anergic CD4 T cells in BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg mice marked by upregulation of the markers FR4 and CD73 in CD44hi T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martinez et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, increased diversion to the T<sub>reg</sub> lineage/T<sub>reg</sub> suppression and CD4 T cell anergy might cooperate to suppress the emergence of autoimmunity in these mice.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03468.008</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Alternative tolerance mechanisms in BH3 Tg mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow cytometric analysis of GFP expression by mature CD4 and CD8 lymph node T cells.

We also observed a significant increase in CD44hi/CD62Lhi central memory CD8 T cells. An increase in activated T cells was also sometimes observed in Bcl-2 Tg mice, but the phenotype was greatly attenuated. While we did not observe an increase in activated T cells in young mice (data not shown), starting as early as 20 weeks-of-age, there was significant accumulation of activated T cells in the peripheral blood of BH3 Tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This increase became very dramatic and nearly ubiquitous in 40 to 50-week-old mice. In comparison, only a couple Bcl-2 Tg mice at 40 to 50 weeks were found to have increased activated T cells. To directly test the possible autoreactivity of BH3 Tg T cells, we stimulated T cells with syngeneic or allogeneic irradiated splenocytes and measured T cell proliferation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). All T cells were able to proliferate in response to allogeneic stimulators, although CD4 T cells proliferated less than CD8 T cells and the presence of Bcl-2 further reduced proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This datum is consistent with the known inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 on cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Linette et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2004</xref>). When presented with syngeneic stimulators, little proliferation was observed for all the Tg and wild-type CD4 T cells, even with T<sub>reg</sub> depletion, most likely due to a combination of the lackluster ability of CD4 T cells to proliferate in this system and the inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 on cell cycle progression. In contrast, CD8<sup>+</sup> BH3 Tg T cells exhibited significant proliferation in response to syngeneic stimulators, suggesting that the BH3 Tg mice contain autoreactive T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Despite our inability to detect autoreactive CD4 T cells in BH3 Tg mice by MLR, we found that the activated CD4 T cells in aged mice appear to have increased effector function, as splenic CD4 T cells from 50-week-old mice secrete increased amounts of IFNγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Only IFNγ and not IL-17 or IL-4 was increased, suggesting that the activated T cells are Th1 polarized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Autoimmunity manifested as significant infiltration of lymphocytes into the liver, lung and kidney of BH3, but not Bcl-2 Tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In addition, autoantibodies against multiple non-lymphoid tissues (pancreas, eye, lung, liver, kidney, stomach) were detected by immunoblot of whole tissue extracts with sera from 40 to 50-week-old BH3 Tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Interestingly, autoantibody binding was detected for all the BH3 Tg mice examined and most if not all the mice had autoantibodies against multiple tissues. Common banding patterns were observed amongst the BH3 Tg mice within a given tissue suggesting common autoantibody targets. Occasionally, autoantibodies were also found in some Bcl-2 Tg mice, but to a much lesser extent. An occasional band was sometimes observed in one of the wild-type controls, but these bands did not match the patterns observed in the BH3 Tg mice. A few BH3 Tg mice also exhibited a significant increase in anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). However, for the majority of the BH3 Tg mice, the levels were not appreciably higher than wild-type or Bcl-2 Tg mice, perhaps consistent with the autoimmune pathology in these mice being more predominantly T cell- rather than B cell-driven. In a few mice with high levels of ANA, significant disruption of kidney morphology was observed, reminiscent of glomerulonephritis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Aged BH3 Tg mice also had significantly increased numbers of both CD25<sup>+</sup> and CD25<sup>−</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells in their lymphoid organs, making up approximately 50% of all CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–F</xref>).

However, whether thymocyte deletion is necessary to maintain immunological self-tolerance remains under debate. Here, we find that T cell-specific over-expression of a <italic>Bcl2</italic> BH3 mutant transgene results in T cell-driven multi-organ autoimmunity, strongly suggesting that a defect in thymic deletion is indeed sufficient to cause a breakdown in tolerance. Consistent with previous observations, we found that T cell-specific over-expression of wild-type Bcl-2 did not cause significant autoimmune pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Linette et al., 1995</xref>). However, our results show that Bcl-2 Tg mice may develop autoimmunity at low penetrance, as some mice exhibited a modest accumulation of activated T cells and autoantibodies. In contrast, expression of a <italic>Bcl2</italic> BH3 mutant transgene significantly increased the severity of the disease and resulted in greater than 70% lethality by one year-of-age. A significant accumulation of activated T cells was observed starting at 20 to 30 weeks-of-age and ultimately resulted in massive lymphoid hyperplasia, inflammation, lymphocyte infiltration into non-lymphoid organs and organ-targeted auto-antibody accumulation. This phenotype of low ANA antibody titers, activated T cells and organ-targeted autoantibodies is suggestive of a primarily T cell-mediated disease.</p><p>Our data in the Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> and superantigen mouse models indicate that the Bcl-2 BH3 mutant is better able to rescue autoreactive thymocytes from negative selection than wild-type Bcl-2. Abolishing the Nur77-dependent pro-apoptotic function of Bcl-2 by BH3 mutation might therefore enhance the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcl-2 over-expression. Alternatively, it is also possible that slightly higher BH3 transgene expression levels in DP and CD4 SP cells could be responsible for this phenotype, although the levels of transgene expression do not necessarily correlate with GFP expression as demonstrated by the higher GFP M.F.I. in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of Bcl-2 over BH3 Tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Cause set aside, a greater defect in negative selection could allow a threshold to be crossed in which other mechanisms of maintaining tolerance are no longer sufficient to prevent disease. This would be consistent with the recent study comparing the severity of disease in <italic>Bim</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> vs <italic>Bim</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup><italic>Bbc3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. <italic>Bim</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice on the C57BL/6 background were reported to have attenuated autoimmunity and 80% of them still survive at 70 weeks-of-age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouillet et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Labi et al., 2014</xref>). Additional loss of Puma (<italic>Bbc3</italic>), however, enhanced the thymic deletion defect of <italic>Bim</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice and resulted in more severe, T cell-driven multi-organ autoimmune pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray et al., 2012</xref>). It remains to be seen if loss of Bim and Puma in T cells alone would result in the same phenotype. Our observations in a T cell-specific model provide strong evidence that a severe thymic clonal deletion defect is sufficient to cause autoimmune pathology. Arguably, a defect in peripheral T cell deletion due to increased T cell survival may also contribute to the BH3 Tg phenotype. Although we cannot completely rule out this possibility, the fact that Bcl-2 Tg mice do not develop autoimmunity would suggest a minimal role for defective peripheral tolerance in this model.</p><p>Despite the large disparity in autoimmune phenotype, we found that both BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg thymocytes were significantly protected from apoptosis in TCR transgenic models of negative selection. Previously, Bcl-2 over-expression was directly compared with Bim-deficiency in the HY model and Bcl-2 over-expression fell significantly short of Bim-deficiency in rescuing thymocytes from deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouillet et al., 2002</xref>). However, in our thymic slice assay of HY TCR-mediated deletion, we find that Bcl-2 over-expression almost completely blocks thymocyte death. Similarly, over-expression of Bcl-2 in F5 TCR transgenic mice dramatically blocked thymocyte deletion by thymic slice assay and in vivo peptide injection. One possible explanation for the discrepancy between our results and previously published observations might be the negative selection models used. Apoptosis of HY TCR transgenic mice is notoriously difficult to block due to accelerated T cell development and early expression of the transgenic TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldwin et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, using thymic organ culture, another group has previously reported a significant inhibition of negative selection by Bcl-2 in the F5 model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Williams et al., 1998</xref>). Regardless, however, we have demonstrated that Bcl-2 over-expression has a potent anti-apoptotic effect on negative selection in a normal, polyclonal system. Mirroring observations in <italic>Bim</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stritesky et al., 2013</xref>), we observed a striking increase in GFP-high post-selection thymocytes in Bcl-2/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice, indicating a significant rescue of high affinity TCR clones from deletion. Here, over-expression of the BH3 mutant transgene resulted in substantially greater rescue of GFP-high DP and CD4 SP thymocytes compared to over-expression of wild-type <italic>Bcl2</italic>. BH3 transgene expression also enhanced rescue of vβ5 and vβ6 DP and CD4 SP thymocytes from deletion in a polyclonal superantigen model of negative selection. Increased rescue of these cells in the thymus might lead to the development of a more self-reactive T cell repertoire, accelerating the expansion of activated T cells in BH3 Tg mice.</p><p>Differential expression of the BH3 vs wild-type <italic>Bcl2</italic> transgenes in the CD8 T cell compartment might also contribute to the development of autoimmunity in BH3 Tg, but not Bcl-2 Tg mice. <italic>Cd4</italic>-driven transgene expression in the BH3 transgenic mice preferentially enhances CD4 T cell seeding of the peripheral lymphoid organs. BH3 Tg mice have about a 3:1 ratio of CD4 to CD8 T cells in the lymph nodes compared to a 2:1 ratio in wild-type mice. In Bcl-2 Tg mice, the proportions are skewed in the opposite direction, resulting in a 1:1 ratio. This is likely due to a combination of transgene-biased rescue of cells from negative selection and increased survival of transgene-expressing T cells. BH3 Tg mice are therefore expected to have increased numbers of autoreactive CD4 T cells, which as key mediators of autoimmunity, could be responsible for the acceleration of disease in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Palmer and Weaver, 2010</xref>). Alternatively, as Bcl-2 over-expression reduces the ability of T cells to proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Linette et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2004</xref>), downregulation of the BH3 transgene in CD8 T cells might enhance their functional capacity over that of Bcl-2 Tg CD8 T cells. As CD8 T cells play a well-documented role in T cell-mediated, tissue-specific autoimmune diseases (i.e. multiple sclerosis and diabetes), more functionally competent autoreactive CD8 T cells in the BH3 Tg mice might contribute to the development of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gravano and Hoyer, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In response to defective clonal deletion in the thymus, we observed compensatory induction of alternative tolerizing mechanisms that might prevent earlier onset of autoimmunity in BH3 Tg mice. An increase in the proportion and number of T<sub>reg</sub> cells was noted in both the thymus and lymph nodes of young mice. Interestingly, CD25<sup>−</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells accounted for most of the increase in total T<sub>reg</sub> numbers and these cells have been reported to have reduced suppressive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhan et al., 2011</xref>). These CD25<sup>−</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells are thought to be derived from diverted, autoreactive cells that were not deleted in the thymus. Consistent with this, CD25<sup>−</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells in the thymus expressed GFP at a higher level than CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells and at a similar level to the most GFP-high naïve CD4 SP cells in the BH3/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice. Hence, diverting a portion of these GFP-high autoreactive cells to this lineage might be the more effective tolerizing strategy. Notably, our observation that CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> proportions were not increased in the BH3 Tg mice suggests that T cells with self-reactive TCRs are not automatically committed to the T<sub>reg</sub> lineage and that there is likely a saturated niche for CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> development determined by availability of other factors, such as IL-2 and IL-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stritesky et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to increased T<sub>reg</sub> cells, we observed a 2-fold increase in the proportion of anergic CD4 T cells in the BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg mice. This was similarly observed in <italic>Bim</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stritesky et al., 2013</xref>). Induction of anergy could cooperate with diversion to the T<sub>reg</sub> lineage/T<sub>reg</sub> suppression to inhibit T cell-mediated promotion of autoimmunity and prevent early onset of disease. However, differential induction of these tolerizing mechanisms was not observed in BH3 Tg vs Bcl-2 Tg mice and therefore cannot account for the eventual development of autoimmunity in BH3 Tg, but not Bcl-2 Tg mice. Interestingly, in aged BH3 Tg mice, T<sub>reg</sub> cells made up almost 50% of the CD4 T cell pool in mice displaying autoimmune pathology. However, this protective response was still apparently insufficient to suppress autoimmunity.</p><p>Finally, the enhanced ability of the <italic>Bcl2</italic> BH3 mutant transgene to rescue autoreactive thymocytes from apoptosis compared to wild-type <italic>Bcl2</italic> could suggest that the Bcl-2 BH3 domain might indeed have some pro-apoptotic function. This finding may provide in vivo support for the notion that Nur77 promotes thymocyte apoptosis through conversion of Bcl-2 to a pro-apoptotic effector. However, this still needs to be further confirmed in a knock-in model. Additionally, analysis of a Bcl-2 protein that cannot interact with Nur77 would also be required to confirm that Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic function is Nur77-dependent. Intriguingly, it has previously been suggested that Nur77 and Bim might function in the same pathway, as Bim-deficiency was unable to synergize with Nur77-deficiency to inhibit thymocyte apoptosis in the OTII TCR transgenic model of negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fassett et al., 2012</xref>). If Bcl-2 conversion is indeed critical for Nur77-mediated thymocyte apoptosis, this would support the idea that Nur77 and Bcl-2 family members come together at the mitochondria to cooperatively regulate cell death during negative selection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>The mutant allele for the <italic>Bcl2</italic> BH3 mutant transgenic mice (BH3 Tg) was generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) from a pCI-human <italic>Bcl2</italic> vector using the following primers: BH3 forward CTGACCCTCCGCCAGGCCGCGGCCGCCTTCTCCCGCCGCTACCGC, BH3 reverse GCGGTAGCGGCGGGAGAAGGCGGCCGCGGCCTGGCGGAGGGTCAG.

The idea is that this form will be more effective at blocking negative selection and will more definitively address the need for central tolerance. Increased expression of a Nur77-promoter/enhancer-driven GFP transgene indicated that thymocytes that received stronger TCR signals accumulated in the thymus. A thorough characterization of the Bcl-2 BH3 mice as compared with mice over-expressing Bcl-2 alone revealed no substantial differences. Yet, as the mice aged (&gt;30 weeks old), they became ill and, sometimes, died. These mice had large spleens and more activated T cells.</p><p>On the whole the authors' data, especially with regard to CD8+ T cells, do back up their conclusion. The experiments are well done and the data are clearly presented. Expression of the transgene clearly protects thymocytes from various types of activation-induced cell death. However, the following points need to be dealt with in a revised version.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) An important concern with these studies is that the primary interpretation of the data, that disrupted negative selection leads to autoimmunity, is correlative. The most significant outcome, which is the onset of illness in old mice, could, arguably, be the result of many factors other than failed negative selection. Definitive proof of a one-to-one correlation in a system such as this (in other words, a T cell that escaped negative selection causes autoimmunity) is very difficult to prove. Indeed, in this model, it is not even clear whether the described disease is the direct result of T cell mediated autoimmunity. The authors need to discuss such caveats, in particular potential impacts of peripheral tolerance.</p><p>2) It is disappointing that no target of the autoimmune attack can be identified. The authors should use serum Igs to probe tissue sections or extracts for autoantibodies against targets other than nuclear antigens, the only targets tested in the manuscript.

The most significant outcome, which is the onset of illness in old mice, could, arguably, be the result of many factors other than failed negative selection. Definitive proof of a one-to-one correlation in a system such as this (in other words, a T cell that escaped negative selection causes autoimmunity) is very difficult to prove. Indeed, in this model, it is not even clear whether the described disease is the direct result of T cell mediated autoimmunity. The authors need to discuss such caveats, in particular potential impacts of peripheral tolerance</italic>.</p><p>We agree that it is difficult to prove that T cells that have escaped negative selection are directly causing autoimmunity; however, we believe we offer strong correlative evidence. The generally low autoantibody titers against ANA along with the early activated T cell phenotype and multi-organ autoantibody response (see response to point 2 below) argue in favor of T cell-mediated autoimmunity rather than a systemic, SLE-like disease. A defect in peripheral T cell deletion due to increased T cell survival may also contribute to the BH3 Tg phenotype. Although we cannot completely rule out this possibility, the fact that Bcl-2 Tg mice do not develop autoimmunity would suggest a minimal role of peripheral tolerance in this model. We have included a statement concerning this point in the revised discussion. In addition, we have softened our language throughout the text to reflect the caveat that factors other than negative selection may play a role in the autoimmunity of BH3 Tg mice.</p><p><italic>2) It is disappointing that no target of the autoimmune attack can be identified. The authors should use serum Igs to probe tissue sections or extracts for autoantibodies against targets other than nuclear antigens, the only targets tested in the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We have performed the suggested experiment and presented the findings in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>. This figure depicts tissue extracts from non-immune organs (pancreas, eye, lung, liver, kidney and stomach) probed with sera from aged mice. Interestingly, autoantibody binding was detected for all the BH3 Tg mice examined and most if not all the mice had autoantibodies against multiple tissues. Common banding patterns were observed amongst the BH3 Tg mice within a given tissue suggesting common autoantibody targets. Occasionally, we also detected autoantibody binding in some Bcl- 2 Tg mice, but fewer or weaker bands were observed compared to the BH3 Tg mice. We also detected an occasional band in one of the wild-type controls, maybe due to the old age of the mice, but these bands did not correspond with the banding patterns observed in the BH3 Tg mice. The presence of autoantibodies in all the BH3 Tg mice that react to multiple bands in the tissue extracts further support our conclusion that the BH3 Tg mice develop multi-organ autoimmunity.</p><p><italic>The authors might also get a bigger hit from their CD4+ MLRs if they were to use CD4+ T cells that are depleted of Tregs</italic>.</p><p>The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> is a representative T<sub>reg</sub>-depleted MLR. However, we did not observe an improvement of CD4 T cell proliferation with T<sub>reg</sub> depletion.</p><p><italic>3) The primary argument used to support a failure of negative selection is that GFP expression from a Nur77 transgene is elevated. Nur77/GFP expression from this transgene is reported to directly report TCR mediated signaling.

GFP signal is gradually downregulated as thymocytes mature from DP to SP to recent thymic emigrant and naïve T cells in the periphery. They showed that naïve T cells do continue to express a low level of Nur77 GFP because naive T cells presumably need a low level tonic TCR stimulation to survive (as demonstrated by several classical papers) . Indeed, CD4 T cells transferred to an MHC II-deficient host downregulated GFP further over time (Moran et al. JEM 2011). Hence, Nur77 GFP expression in mature T cells is likely in part leftover from TCR engagement in the thymus, but is also due to TCR engagement in the periphery.</p><p>The Nur77 GFP expression observed in BH3 and Bcl- 2 Tg T cells also appears to be TCR-dependent, and not transgene-dependent, as transgenic T cells downregulated GFP at a similar rate to WT T cells when removed from MHC in culture (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). Since SP thymocytes continue to undergo negative selection in the medulla, increased Nur77 GFP expression by BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg SP cells can be due to both rescue of cells seeing ligand in the medulla and leftover expression from stimulus at the DP stage. Similar to mature T cells, we found that SP thymocytes removed from MHC by culturing, downregulate GFP at a similar rate to WT SP thymocytes, suggesting that GFP expression is TCR-dependent, and not transgene-dependent (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we have shown in the original manuscript that transgenic pre-selection DP thymocytes do not express Nur77 GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting again that Nur77 GFP expression is TCR -dependent. As bone marrow chimera-derived thymocytes in an MHC- deficient host would be arrested at the pre-selection DP stage, we don’t believe this experiment would provide any additional information.</p></body></sub-article></article>
