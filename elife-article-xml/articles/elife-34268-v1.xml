housekeeping genes. What accounts for this distribution has not been well understood. Here, we demonstrate that Ll.LtrB, the group II intron residing in a relaxase gene on a conjugative plasmid from <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>, inhibits its host gene expression and restrains the naturally cohabiting mobile element from conjugative horizontal transfer. We show that reduction in gene expression is mainly at the mRNA level, and results from the interaction between exon-binding sequences (EBSs) in the intron and intron-binding sequences (IBSs) in the mRNA. The spliced intron targets the relaxase mRNA and reopens ligated exons, causing major mRNA loss. Taken together, this study provides an explanation for the distribution and paucity of group II introns in bacteria, and suggests a potential force for those introns to evolve into spliceosomal introns.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34268.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins, the molecular workhorses of the cell, are encoded by genes within the DNA. A given gene is often formed of several portions of coding DNA, the exons, which are separated by sections of non-coding DNA called introns. When it is expressed, the entire gene, including the introns, is ‘copied’ into a molecule of pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). Enzymes then remove the introns and stitch the exons together to produce a mature messenger RNA (mRNA) that can serve as a template to create a protein. However, a particular type of intron, known as a group II intron, can remove or ‘splice’ itself out of a pre-mRNA without the help of additional enzymes. Once this is done, these introns can also insert themselves into DNA.</p><p>Scientists think that group II introns originated in bacteria, yet only about a quarter of bacterial genomes sequenced so far contain this particular kind of intron. When these introns are present, their numbers are low, and most of the time they are restricted to genes that are not required for survival. It is not well understood why group II introns are so few and far between, and why they are often not associated with essential genes in bacteria.</p><p>Qu et al. looked into a gene that contains a group II intron in the bacterium <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>, and discovered that the expression of this gene was dramatically low. This decrease was due to interactions between the group II intron and the exons within the mRNA. Once group II introns were spliced out, they could target their mRNAs and reopen the junction where the exons had been stitched together. These mRNAs were therefore lost, and the cell made less of the protein that the gene encoded.</p><p>The findings by Qu et al. can help to explain why group II introns are so scarce, how they are excluded from essential genes, and also how cells could use these sequences. In particular, group II introns could have evolved to form the spliceosome, a complex structure that processes introns in higher organisms. Finally, group II introns could be used in the laboratory to artificially silence genes of interest.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA-RNA interaction</kwd><kwd>reverse splicing</kwd><kwd>spliced exons reopening</kwd><kwd>conjugation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM39422</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Belfort</surname><given-names>Marlene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM44844</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Belfort</surname><given-names>Marlene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Group II introns can target mRNA, causing inhibition of gene expression, as a potential driver for evolution to the spliceosome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Introns interrupt genes in all domains of life. Group II introns, which are found in bacterial and organellar genomes, are ribozymes that self-splice from pre-mRNA transcripts independent of protein catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lambowitz and Belfort, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lambowitz and Zimmerly, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zimmerly and Semper, 2015</xref>). Splicing of group II introns occurs by the same pathway as that of spliceosomal introns, of which group II introns are the presumed ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lambowitz and Belfort, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Novikova and Belfort, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zimmerly and Semper, 2015</xref>). Group II introns are also mobile retroelements that transpose into DNA via an RNA intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lambowitz and Zimmerly, 2011</xref>). Both splicing and retromobility of group II introns in vivo require an intron-encoded protein (IEP) that is in complex with the intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Matsuura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matsuura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wank et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zimmerly et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Group II introns have a highly conserved RNA structure consisting of six domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Toor et al., 2008</xref>). The largest domain, DI, contains the exon-binding sequences (EBS), which interact through base pairing with the intron-binding sequences (IBS) in the RNA exons or DNA homing target, to define the sites for splicing and retromobility of the intron, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lambowitz and Zimmerly, 2011</xref>). DV is structurally the most conserved domain, which contains the ‘catalytic triad’, nucleotide residues critical for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Toor et al., 2008</xref>). DVI has a bulged adenosine, which is the nucleophile that initiates the splicing reaction, yielding the branch-point of an intron lariat resulting from splicing. DIV often accommodates an open reading frame (ORF) encoding the IEP, which is a reverse transcriptase (RT) with maturase activity that facilitates intron splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Matsuura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matsuura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wank et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zimmerly et al., 1995</xref>), and can promote retromobility of the intron in combination with the DNA endonuclease activity of the IEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matsuura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zimmerly et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Distribution of group II introns is different in bacteria and eukaryotes. Only about one quarter of sequenced bacterial genomes contain group II introns and they are usually present in small numbers within one genome. Moreover, they are mostly located in intergenic regions or non-conserved genes that are rarely essential. In addition, bacterial group II introns frequently reside in various types of mobile DNAs, which include pathogenicity islands and virulence plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Candales et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Toro and Martínez-Abarca, 2013</xref>). This distribution suggests that bacterial group II introns might be deleterious to host gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai and Zimmerly, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zimmerly and Semper, 2015</xref>). In contrast, organellar introns are distributed more densely in mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes, and are almost exclusively in essential housekeeping genes. In addition, group II introns are absent in eukaryotic nuclear genomes although they are ancestrally closely related to spliceosomal introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lambowitz and Belfort, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Novikova and Belfort, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zimmerly and Semper, 2015</xref>). Factors, including nucleus-cytosol compartmentalization, intracellular magnesium concentrations, and interactions between the intron and spliced mRNA, have been conjectured to be the evolutionary drivers for the evolution of group II introns into spliceosomal introns in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Martin and Koonin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Qu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Truong et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here we investigated the impact of group II introns on their host gene expression in bacteria, using Ll.LtrB, the group II intron that resides on a conjugative plasmid pRS01 and interrupts a relaxase host gene <italic>ltrB</italic>, in the bacterium <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mills et al., 1996</xref>). We demonstrate that this intron inhibits relaxase host gene expression and mobilization of the cohabiting conjugative element. This group II intron-promoted inhibition results from RNA-RNA interactions between the spliced intron and mRNA, reducing mRNA levels. These discoveries can explain the distribution of group II introns in bacteria and provide yet another example of strict control and silencing of conjugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Singh and Meijer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zatyka and Thomas, 1998</xref>). These data also suggest a driving force for the evolutionary transition of the group II introns to spliceosomal introns.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A group II intron inhibits gene expression at the mRNA level</title><p>The group IIA Ll.LtrB intron interrupts the <italic>ltrB</italic> relaxase gene, which resides on the conjugative plasmid pRS01 and is required for pRS01 conjugative transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belhocine et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belhocine et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mills et al., 1996</xref>).

Northern blotting analysis of RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) indicated that the relaxase mRNA abundance was much lower in the presence of the intron than in its absence (21% vs. 100%).

The larger of the two, termed RNA 1, was also revealed with both relaxase mRNA 5′- and 3′-exon probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>, lane 7), and was identified as the intron-containing relaxase pre-mRNA.

This result suggests that the intron expressed in trans, is reverse splicing into the relaxase mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

With selective Northern blotting, along with 5′-RACE followed by cDNA sequencing, this RNA was identified as the unspliced intron expressed in trans, with its small 3′-exon replaced by the full-length 3′-exon of the relaxase mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This result suggests that there was shuffling of exons or RNA recombination, possibly between two reverse splicing reactions, that resulted in the formation of a chimeric precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>The third RNA, RNA 3, previously seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, was observed in both the exon splice junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, lane 7) and the relaxase mRNA 3′-exon-specific probings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>, lane 7), but it was absent from the probing for 5′-exon of the relaxase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>, lane 7).

Identification of RNA 3 suggested that RNA 2, the chimeric intron precursor resulting from reverse splicing and RNA recombination described above, could be subject to forward splicing in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This result is in accord with splicing being favored over reverse splicing in vivo. Notably, RNA 3 appeared much more abundant than the relaxase mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B,D</xref>).</p><p>Besides reverse splicing and its related RNA recombination, these experiments also suggested the occurrence of a <bold>s</bold>pliced <bold>e</bold>xons <bold>r</bold>eopening (SER) reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jarrell et al., 1988</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This was evidenced by identification of the fourth RNA product, RNA 4, a free 5′-exon of the relaxase mRNA. RNA 4 was observed in the probing specific for the 5′-exon of the relaxase mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>, lane 7) but was absent with all other probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B,D</xref>, lane 7). Additionally, its presence was validated by 3′-RACE analysis followed by PCR amplification and sequencing of the cDNA products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). However, free 3′-exon of the relaxase mRNA, which should be produced simultaneously with the free 5′-exon from the SER reaction, was not detected either by Northern blotting or 3′-RACE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>, lane 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This could be attributed to bacterial mRNAs usually having a triphosphate at the 5′ end that is more resistant to mRNA decay than monophosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Celesnik et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schoenberg, 2007</xref>). Notably, this free 5′-exon RNA was also revealed when the intron was expressed in cis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>, lane 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, these results suggest the SER, followed by RNA decay of the opened 3′-exon, to be a mechanism resulting in mRNA loss in the cell.</p><p>To further elucidate how these retargeting reactions are responsible for mRNA disappearance, we sought to examine mutants that were already created for this study. Initially we chose to identify the four RNA molecules in the intron_EBSm* and mRNA_IBSm* mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using the in trans system, Northern blotting analyses showed that none of the four RNA products 1–4, that appeared with the wild-type strain existed in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, lanes 3,5 versus lane 2). However, they reappeared when the EBS from the intron was mutated to complement the IBS within the relaxase mRNA in this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, lanes 6).

We discovered that group II introns reduce gene expression by robustly decreasing the spliced mRNA level in bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This group II intron-induced mRNA disappearance appears independent of plasmids and promoters from which the genes are expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and is independent of stresses and changes of environmental conditions (data not shown). While this intron-induced reduction of mRNA levels was revealed mainly for the well-defined group IIA intron Ll.LtrB and its host <italic>ltrB</italic> relaxase gene in its native bacterial host <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>, it was also shown for two other types of bacterial group II introns, the group IIB EcI5 and group IIC BhI1 introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Using the Ll.LtrB intron as the model, we also demonstrated that this mRNA reduction results from interaction between the intron with its spliced mRNA, via EBS-IBS base pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>).

Here, EBS-IBS-based intron-mRNA interactions shut down nuclear gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Qu et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that group II introns are inherent and general inhibitors of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>How the mRNA level is controlled by the intron</title><p>By using the in trans system, we revealed that through RNA-RNA interactions, the spliced intron can retarget the mRNA in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <bold>2</bold>). The intron’s ribozyme activities include reverse splicing into the spliced mRNA, and the SER reaction. Because forward splicing is usually favored in the cell, based on the high splicing efficiency shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>, we speculate that reverse splicing accounts for a relatively small portion of mRNA loss. Additionally, a robust SER, which was also revealed in the in cis system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), splits the 5′-exon from the mRNA, and the free 3′-exon appears to be degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34268.019</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for group II intron regulation of gene expression and pRS01 conjugation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) How the group II intron controls the mRNA. Intron-mRNA interaction via EBS-IBS base pairing is the basis of three biochemical processes: splicing, reverse splicing, and spliced exons reopening (SER). While all these reactions could affect mRNA levels, SER is a major driver of the mRNA loss. It splits the mRNA into free 5′- and 3′-exons, the latter of which is susceptible to cellular RNA decay. Meanwhile, the intron could function as a ‘shelter’ that protects the mRNA that survives SER and is being retained within the intron from RNA decay. Because of these contradictory effects and equilibrium between pairs of reversible processes, a fraction of mRNA can be maintained for translation.

However, RNP invasion of DNA is a relatively unfavorable event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aizawa et al., 2003</xref>), which makes it tempting to speculate that the RNA SER and subsequent RNA degradation may favor DNA invasion and retromobility.</p><p>The RNA decay study with rifampicin indicated slower mRNA degradation in the Int<sup>+</sup> cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, this result may be misleading as the residual RNA that escapes intron targeting may be a more stable fraction. Alternatively, the intron may act as ribosomes do on bacterial mRNA, providing a ‘protective barrier’ by binding the mRNA that escapes degradative attack by the group II intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deana and Belasco, 2005</xref>). Additionally, enhanced stability may be a reflection of the reciprocal relationship between the stability and concentration of bacterial mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nouaille et al., 2017</xref>), such that lower mRNA levels in the Int<sup>+</sup> cell, would lead to higher stability of the mRNA. Whichever mechanism underlies the phenomenon, the consequence is that a fraction of the mRNA is maintained for translation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for distribution and spread of group II introns</title><p>The discovery that group II introns inhibit gene expression likely explains why they are located mostly outside of genes or in non-essential genes, and why they are maintained at low frequency in bacterial genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai and Zimmerly, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zimmerly and Semper, 2015</xref>). Group II intron-promoted reduction of gene expression could be the major driver that selected for group II introns residing in intergenic or non-essential regions. It is therefore intriguing that there are rare cases of essential genes containing group II introns in bacterial genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Candales et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai and Zimmerly, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zimmerly and Semper, 2015</xref>). We speculate that, in these cases, either robust gene expression is not needed, that reduction in gene expression is modest or that the intron plays a regulatory role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belfort, 2017</xref>). The effect of organellar group II introns that are commonly present in essential genes is largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai and Zimmerly, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zimmerly and Semper, 2015</xref>). Perhaps many of these introns have lost the ability to target mRNA and cause its loss, or do so very inefficiently. Alternatively, a lower expression level might be required for proper functions of these host genes. Notably, favoring the latter notion, a recent study showed that the presence of self-splicing introns including group II introns in the mitochondrion of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> was required for inefficient expression of host genes that was essential for maintaining proper mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rudan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Group II introns are also frequently found in mobile DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Candales et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai and Zimmerly, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zimmerly and Semper, 2015</xref>). One of the examples is the Ll.LtrB group II intron that naturally resides in the conjugative plasmid pRS01, interrupting the <italic>ltrB</italic> relaxase gene whose expression is required for the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of the plasmid. A recent study indicated that pRS01 promotes retromobility of the intron by providing LtrB relaxase that stimulates both the frequency and diversity of retrotransposition (RTP) events with its off-target DNA nicking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Novikova et al., 2014</xref>). Here our study showed that the Ll.LtrB group II intron reduces the conjugal transfer of pRS01 via inhibition of its host gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, these findings together suggest that the two mobile genetic elements (MGEs) functionally interact by exploiting <italic>ltrB</italic> relaxase gene expression. Whereas relaxase expression stimulates intron RTP and HGT of the conjugative element, inhibition of relaxase expression by the group II intron opposes the promotion of RTP and HGT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), effects that are likely in equilibrium. In general, expression of conjugative transfer genes is tightly controlled to minimize the burden on the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zatyka and Thomas, 1998</xref>). Indeed conjugative plasmid gene expression is kept in a default ‘off’ state and is switched on only under conditions that are optimal for transfer of the conjugative element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Singh and Meijer, 2014</xref>). Silencing of the relaxase gene by its resident group II intron therefore represents a novel way in which a conjugative element is down-regulated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Evolutionary implications</title><p>The demonstration that intron RNAs are not only able to transpose and cleave exogenous RNAs, but can also recombine RNAs from different sources, suggests that progenitors of group II introns could have processed RNAs in primitive genomes. These actions could have contributed to the generation of an evolved genome and a cell that has novel functions and evolutionary advantages.</p><p>In regard to the ancestral relationship between group II and spliceosomal introns, expression of group II introns in nuclei causes gene silencing in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chalamcharla et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zerbato et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that group II introns also hinder gene expression in bacteria. Notably, a common mechanism underlying the group II intron-promoted inhibition of gene expression in bacteria and eukaryotes is based on interactions between intron and mRNA via EBS-IBS base pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Qu et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast to group II introns, many spliceosomal introns are shown to enhance gene expression in plants and other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Le Hir et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rose, 2008</xref>). Interactions between the intron and mRNA no longer exist in the splicing of spliceosomal introns, where such pairings have been functionally substituted with interactions between U5 snRNA and mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yan et al., 2015</xref>). We speculate that, through these changes, introns can promote mRNA levels and gene expression, or at very least not be inhibitory, and therefore provided a force that could have stimulated evolution of group II introns into spliceosomal introns in primitive nuclear genomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>)</td><td>IL1403</td><td>PMID: 11337471</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>)</td><td>IL1403 (FA-R)</td><td>Belfort Lab</td><td/><td>Fusidic Acid <break/>Resistant</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>MC1061</td><td>PMID:6997493</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>LtrB antibody</td><td>Gary Dunny, <break/>personal communication</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="bottom">QuikChange Lightning <break/>Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit</td><td valign="bottom">Agilent, Santa Clara, CA</td><td valign="bottom">210519</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit</td><td>Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA</td><td>1708890</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>iTaq Universal SYBR <break/>Green Supermix</td><td>Bio-Rad</td><td>172–5120</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>5' RACE System</td><td>Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA</td><td>18374058</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>3' RACE System</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>18373019</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>SMARTer RACE 5'/3' kit</td><td>Takara, Mountain View, CA</td><td>634860</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> IL1403 was used for <italic>ltrB</italic> gene expression and RNA and protein analysis.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Nilsen as Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alan M Lambowitz (Reviewer #1); Aaron Robart (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>There was a consensus that this work reports for the first time a new pathway that contributes to the exclusion of group II introns from essential genes. All the reviewers felt that it was, in principle, suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Nevertheless, some reviewers raised concerns, which if dealt with would strengthen the paper. These issues should be addressed as thoroughly as possible. Because the comments of the reviewers cannot be condensed into a short list of required revisions, the entire reviews are attached.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript addresses the question of why mobile group II introns inserted within protein-coding genes are rare in bacteria, possibly providing clues as to the evolutionary driving force for the evolution of group II introns into spliceosomal introns. The paucity of group II introns in bacterial protein-coding genes had previously been attributed to slow rates of RNA splicing combined with coupled transcription/translation leading to impaired gene expression and accumulation of translational errors, thereby necessitating the evolution of the nuclear envelope to separate transcription from translation (e.g., Martin and Koonin, 2006). Qu et al. identify a very interesting additional factor, the targeting of mRNA sequence by reverse splicing and spliced-exon reopening reactions of excised group II intron RNAs. Although mobile group II introns are well known to reverse splice and cleave DNA target sequences in vivo, physiologically relevant RNA-guided targeting of RNA sequences in vivo had not been described previously. Thus, this is an interesting and important manuscript, which after satisfactory responses and revisions, should be very suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) Abstract, – the sentence beginning &quot;Here…&quot; and continuing &quot;inhibits relaxase host-gene expression&quot; may be confusing for a general audience and should be rephrased to make clear at the outset that the intron is present within the relaxase gene and that &quot;host gene&quot; here is referring to the gene in which the intron resides and not genes in the host that harbors the mobile element. Similar changes might help the last paragraph of the Introduction.</p><p>2) The Introduction should make reference to other factors that may contribute to the paucity of group II introns in bacterial protein-coding genes and to the evolutionary driving force for the evolution of group II into spliceosomal introns in eukaryotes, such those discussed in Martin and Koonin (2006) and Truong et al., 2015), as well as the authors' previous work on the contribution of nonsense-mediated decay in eukaryotes. The reactions found here are quite interesting but unlikely to be the sole factors that account for the distribution of bacterial group II introns or drove their evolution into spliceosomal introns.</p><p>3) Figure 1B – the authors should indicate in the legend whether the data shown are from the same blot after stripping and reprobing.</p><p>4) Figure 1C – it would have been helpful to have a protein standard in the western blots to control for differences in efficiency of transfer to the membrane.</p><p>5) Figure 1D – It is not clear how greater difference in mRNA levels between Int<sup>-</sup> and Int<sup>+</sup> cells measured by Northern hybridization or RT-qPCR can be accounted for by difference in reference RNA standard unless one of the reference RNA standards is changing as a result of the intron being present (in which case it should not have been a reference RNA standard). Perhaps the RT-qPCR is simply more quantitative than the Northern blots, e.g., due to uneven transfer of RNA to the membrane.</p><p>6) Figure 1—figure supplement 2 - The sequence shown for the pre-mRNA in panel A appears to be the sequence of the cDNA. Given the location of the primer shown in the figure, it is not clear why the cDNA sequence extends beyond a chain terminating dideoxy T in the cDNA sequence just upstream of the primer. A more descriptive figure legend describing what was done in the experiment would be helpful.</p><p>7) – Figure 1—figure supplement 4 - it would be helpful to show the UV spectrum of the gradient in the figure supplement so that readers can evaluate the cutoff from polysome enrichment. I'm also curious as to whether one can detect polysomes translating the intron ORF in unspliced precursor RNA. What are the lanes at the left labeled &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot;? Labels for the top and bottom of the gradient might be helpful.</p><p>8) Subsection “A group II intron inhibits gene expression at the mRNA level”, second paragraph. The authors seem to be assuming that the relatively small decreases in the rates of transcription and splicing would result in proportional decreases in mRNA levels, so that the observed larger decrease must reflect intron RNA targeting. However, it seems possible that the small decreases in rates of transcription and splicing are cumulative and synergistic and result in disproportionate decreases in mRNA levels.</p><p>9) Figure 2B – the splicing efficiency of the EcI5 intron in the GFP construct appears to be substantially lower than that of the Ll.LtrB intron in the relaxase gene construct and could thus make a substantially higher contribution to decreased mRNA levels with this intron.</p><p>10) Figure 2 data not shown – the group IIC intron BhI1 is mentioned in the text as being tested for effect of mRNA levels in parallel with EcI5, but data for this intron are not shown in Figure 2, which shows data only for EcI5. The degree of inhibition of gene expression by a group IIC intron inserted within a gene is of particular interest because the EBS/IBS interactions are very short (EBS1/IBS1, 4 bp; EBS3/IBS2, 1 bp) compared to group IIA and IIB introns, yet these introns are a prime example of group II introns that avoid protein coding genes (by inserting downstream of transcription terminators).</p><p>11) Figure 5 – the trans expression system data and controls are excellent for establishing the type of RNA-guided mechanism proposed by the authors. It might be relatively easy to extend that case by similar trans experiments for the EcI5 intron in <italic>E. coli</italic>, perhaps with fewer controls needed for this second example. The generality of the mechanism would then be supported by results for two different introns in two different bacteria. Subsection “Intron-mRNA interaction inhibits gene expression”, first paragraph – I suggest changing to &quot;Similar to a previous study in yeast,…&quot;</p><p>12) Figure 5C and D – Does the decrease in mRNA levels return when the mutant EBS is paired with the complementary mutant IBS? I may be missing something here, but I'm unclear how the construct with the mutant IBS splices to produce mature mRNA. It's possible that the mutant IBS1 construct has been paired with a complementary EBS1 in cis, but I can't easily find that information.</p><p>13) Figure 5—figure – supplement 1B – is it possible to add a panel showing that splicing of the RT and EN mutant construct occurs at the same level as the wild-type protein? A concern is that these mutant proteins are not produced at wild-type levels and this deficiency or partial inactivation by the mutations may decrease splicing, which would in turn lead to decreased mRNA levels, thereby complicating the interpretation of the results.</p><p>14) Figure 6 – although the interpretation of the Northern hybridizations is likely correct, they are not sufficient to characterize this complex set of RNA products. This should be done by RNA-seq, which is needed to verify the proposed junctions.</p><p>15) Figure 7 – do RNA products I-IV reappear when the mutant IBS is paired with a comp.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Qu et al. provide the first evidence for group II introns inhibiting gene expression through mRNA targeting. This is an exciting discovery and provides an explanation for the frequency and distribution of group II introns in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Specifically, Qu et al. found that the EBS-IBS interactions found in group II introns are responsible for binding to target mRNAs through Watson-Crick pairing and then cleaving/reverse splicing these mRNAs to reduce gene expression. This finding also makes biochemical sense given the in vitro propensity of group II introns to efficiently bind to RNA/DNA substrates through EBS-IBS interactions. The authors also tested their hypothesis using group II introns corresponding to the major phylogenetic classes of IIA, IIB, and IIC introns. However, I was curious as to why the data for the IIC intron B.h.I1 was not shown in Figure 2B. This also has major implications for the evolution of group II introns into spliceosomal introns. In order to maintain expression, the EBS-IBS interactions were lost from the actual introns themselves and instead incorporated into the spliceosome. This may provide a biochemical rationale for the evolutionary transition from a cis-splicing system as seen in group II introns into a trans-system in the spliceosome. Overall, the authors provided thorough in vivo experimental evidence that group II introns inhibit gene expression and I highly recommend publication of this manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>It is well established that bacteria group II introns favor insertions into other selfish elements, such as transposons, and avoid essential host genes. This distribution has been rationalized by group II introns seeking out &quot;safe harbors&quot; in bacterial genomes to avoiding deleterious effects on the host, thus ensuring their survival. However, no substantial biochemical or genetic evidence has been published to show that insertion of a group II intron into essential host genes has unfavorable outcomes. Here Qu and colleagues fill this critical knowledge gap using the well-established group IIA L.l.LtrB model system to investigate how group II intron splicing, and reverse splicing, dictates mRNA accumulation levels. Furthermore, this study was performed in the natural <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> host environment, strengthening its significance. The major finding of this manuscript is that group II intron reverse splicing, normally targeted to DNA for initiation of mobility reactions, also targets mRNA and significantly reduces total mRNA accumulation levels.</p><p>In principle reverse splicing can occur at both the DNA and RNA level. The DNA mobility reaction pathways are well known; however, before this study it was unclear if the competing RNA reverse-splicing reaction occurred at significant levels what the consequences of this reaction would be. In this manuscript, Qu and Belfort present exciting evidence that RNA level group II intron reverse splicing does indeed occur, but causes the phosphodiester bond connecting the two spliced exons to be opened up, leading to subsequent degradation of the message. The authors characterized this mRNA reduction using thoughtful controls to separate splicing from mobility effects, show that mRNA reduction has significant effects on conjugation efficiency (function encoded by the mRNA), and provide both in vitro and in vivo mechanistic insight. The data are clearly presented, the conclusions are supported, and the significance level is appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>. I strongly recommend publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34268.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) Abstract, the sentence beginning &quot;Here…&quot; and continuing &quot;inhibits relaxase host-gene expression&quot; may be confusing for a general audience and should be rephrased to make clear at the outset that the intron is present within the relaxase gene and that &quot;host gene&quot; here is referring to the gene in which the intron resides and not genes in the host that harbors the mobile element.
