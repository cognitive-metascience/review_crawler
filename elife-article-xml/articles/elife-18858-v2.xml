efficient switches in mammalian systems. Here we describe a rational-design approach that enables rapid development of efficient <italic>cis</italic>-acting aptazyme riboswitches. We identified communication-module characteristics associated with aptazyme functionality through analysis of a 32-aptazyme test panel. We then developed a scoring system that predicts an aptazymes’s activity by integrating three characteristics of communication-module bases: hydrogen bonding, base stacking, and distance to the enzymatic core. We validated the power and generality of this approach by designing aptazymes responsive to three distinct ligands, each with markedly wider dynamic ranges than any previously reported. These aptayzmes efficiently regulated adeno-associated virus (AAV)-vectored transgene expression in cultured mammalian cells and mice, highlighting one application of these broadly usable regulatory switches. Our approach enables efficient, protein-independent control of gene expression by a range of small molecules.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18858.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18858.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>aptazyme</kwd><kwd>RNA switch</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>mammalian cells</kwd><kwd>small molecule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI091476</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farzan</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 AI100263</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farzan</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An empirically derived scoring system for identifying optimal communication modules of aptazymes accelerates the development of ligand-responsive RNA genetic switches functional in mammalian cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ligand-responsive <italic>cis</italic>-acting riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breaker, 2012</xref>) function independently of protein factors and can be programmed to respond to a wide range of small-molecule ligands. They therefore have a number of potential scientific and medical applications. Aptazymes are a class of engineered riboswitches that control gene expression by small molecule-induced self-cleavage of a ribozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The first aptazyme was developed by the Breaker group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tang and Breaker, 1997</xref>) by fusing an ATP binding aptamer with a minimal hammerhead ribozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Scott et al., 2013</xref>).

In vitro allosteric selection has been used to generate aptazymes in a high-throughput and massively parallel format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koizumi et al., 1999</xref>), but aptazymes identified in this way function in cell-free conditions but not in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Link et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wittmann and Suess, 2011</xref>). Similarly, aptazymes obtained from bacterial screens function efficiently in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wieland and Hartig, 2008</xref>) but poorly in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auslander et al., 2010</xref>). Direct screening of an aptazyme library in mammalian cells is labor intensive and generally performed in a medium-throughput non-pooled format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auslander et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rehm et al., 2015</xref>), thus library sizes are small, and the chance of identifying an efficient aptazyme is low.</p><p>In this study, we describe a general method for rapid development of efficient aptazymes from diverse pre-existing or novel aptamers. Specifically, this approach streamlines identification of optimal communication modules connecting an aptamer to a hammerhead ribozyme. We demonstrate the power and modularity of this approach by developing efficient aptazymes regulated by three distinct ligands, each aptazyme exhibiting a significantly wider dynamic range in mammalian cells than any previously described aptazyme. We highlight the utility of these aptazymes by using them to regulate expression from an AAV vector in cell culture and in mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of a test panel of tetracycline-regulated aptazymes</title><p>We initially characterized a panel of aptazymes responsive to tetracycline (Tc). These aptazymes share a common architecture, composed of an optimized <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> hammerhead ribozyme N107 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yen et al., 2004</xref>), a communication module, and a Tc-binding aptamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xiao et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). They differ only in their communication module, a region that signals the binding state of the aptamer to the ribozyme. We started by directly fusing four base pairs of the P1 stem of the aptamer to the base of ribozyme stem III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The resulting aptazyme (Tc01) was placed downstream of a gene encoding <italic>Gaussia</italic> luciferase (GLuc). As expected, Tc01-regulated GLuc expression in the absence of Tc was markedly lower than that from control constructs without any regulatory elements (CNTL) or with an inactive form of the N107 ribozyme (in-N107), likely due to high level of ribozyme auto-activation triggered by its stable communication module. In addition, the aptazyme had a narrow (2.1-fold) dynamic range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We then generated 31 variants of Tc01 by altering Tc01 communication-module bases by trial and error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These variants were again placed downstream of the GLuc gene and tested for their ability to control GLuc expression in HeLa cells using varying concentrations of Tc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A comparison of GLuc expression at 0 µM Tc (basal expression, BE) and GLuc expression at 100 µM Tc (ligand-inhibited expression, LE) is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. As shown, this test panel exhibited widely varying BE and the Tc-induced fold change in expression. To correct for the non-specific inhibitory effects of Tc on gene expression, we report here the corrected dynamic range (CDR), namely the Tc-induced fold change in aptazyme-regulated gene expression divided by the fold change observed in the expression of a control construct (CNTL) lacking any regulatory elements.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A function of communication-module bases that predicts an aptazyme’s dynamic range</title><p>To better understand the determinants of aptazyme dynamic range, we comprehensively analyzed the communication-module characteristics and the functionality of the test-panel 32 aptazymes. It has been suggested that the annealing energy of the communication module, ΔG<sub>CM</sub>, determines CDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wieland and Hartig, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kumar et al., 2009</xref>). However, we observed no obvious relationship between predicted ΔG<sub>CM</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellaousov et al., 2013</xref>) and BE, LE, or CDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We then focused on BE because it reflects the efficiency of ribozyme-mediated mRNA cleavage in the absence of ligand and is primarily determined by the communication module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We hypothesized that an energy-like function of the communication-module sequence which predicts BE would identify values of the function where a small change would have the largest impact on target gene expression. Thus, for communication modules with these values, additional energy provided by aptamer binding would yield the largest differences between BE and LE, and thus the largest CDR. We therefore sought to construct a simple function that correlates with the rank order of BE among our 32 aptazymes.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18858.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Development of rational-design principles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The predicted hybrid free energies of the communication modules (ΔG<sub>CM</sub>) of test-panel aptazymes were calculated with RNAstructure Web Server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellaousov et al., 2013</xref>). BE (blue circles) and LE (red triangles) were then plotted against the negative ΔG<sub>CM</sub> value for all aptazymes whose ΔG<sub>CM</sub> could be determined. Note the poor correlation between ΔG<sub>CM</sub> and BE or LE. (<bold>B–C</bold>) BE and LE of the indicated aptazyme variants are shown. Expression levels are normalized to that of the CNTL control construct. The communication-module sequences of these variants are displayed to the left of the figures. Red indicates base pairs different from the consensus. Note that all constructs in each set have the same base pairs, and that order of these pairs impacts BE. (<bold>D</bold>) Accordingly, every CM base pair was assigned a weight based on its proximity to the ribozyme, with distal bases assigned lower weights. A Weighted Hydrogen Bond Score (WHBS) was then calculated as the weighted sum of hydrogen bonds in the communication module. BE (blue circles) and LE (red triangles) of each variant were plotted against WHBS. Note that WHBS better correlates with the rank order of BE than does ΔG<sub>CM</sub> or the unweighted sum of hydrogen bond numbers in the communication module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). (<bold>E</bold>–<bold>F</bold>) The BE and LE of the indicated aptazymes are shown, with their communication-module sequences indicated to the left. Nucleotides with the potential to form inter-strand base-stacking interactions are highlighted as red. (<bold>G</bold>) Potential inter-strand purine base-stacking interactions were weighted by proximity to the ribozyme, and added to the WHBS to form a modified score (WHSS). BE (blue circles) and LE (red triangles) were plotted against WHSS of the corresponding aptazyme variant. Note that the WHSS better correlates with the rank order of BE than does the WHBS or ΔG<sub>CM</sub>. An inflection point of the BE at WHSS 6.7 is indicated with a dashed line. Shading indicates a region with WHSS values 6.7 ± 0.3. (<bold>H</bold>) The CDR values of all 32 test-panel aptazymes were plotted against their WHSS. Note the CDR optimum near the WHSS value of 6.7 (shaded). Aptazymes that exhibited the highest (Tc12, Tc15) or lower-than-expected (Tc31 and Tc32) CDRs are indicated. (<bold>I</bold>–<bold>K</bold>) The CDRs of the indicated aptazymes are shown, with their communication-module sequences displayed to the left. Note that aptazymes in each panel share identical sequences (<bold>I</bold>) or similar WHSS (<bold>J</bold>,<bold>K</bold>), but differ in the stability of the communication-module base pair immediately proximal to the Tc aptamer (red). Aptazyme WHSS values range from 6.13 to 6.29 in (<bold>J</bold>), and from 6.58 to 6.63 in (<bold>K</bold>). Tc31 and Tc32, with 1 and 0 hydrogen bonds at this position, are outliers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, likely because these weak bonds destabilize the aptamer, and lower its affinity for Tc. (<bold>L</bold>) Efficient aptazymes met two criteria: a communication-module WHSS value within the range of 6.7 ± 0.3, and an aptamer-proximal communication-module base pair with stability similar to or higher than that of the original aptamer. Aptazymes that meet both criteria have high BE and CDR ('optimal' aptazymes), whereas those that fail to meet one have low BE or narrow CDR ('suboptimal' aptazymes). The CDR and BE of the both optimal and suboptimal aptazymes are ordered by CDR and plotted.

Ribozyme autoactivation reduces gene expression to BE and is primarily determined by the communication module sequence (CM; red). Ligand-aptamer binding triggers a conformational change in the aptamer. The communication module signals this change to the ribozyme. Subsequent activation of the ribozyme lowers gene expression to LE. (<bold>B</bold>) A plot of BE versus WHSS as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>.

In particular, when base pairs with few hydrogen bonds (G-U or U-U) were placed close to the ribozyme, as in Tc14 and Tc08, higher BE levels were observed. Accordingly, we assigned every base a weight reflecting its proximity to the enzymatic core, and multiplied that weight by the number of hydrogen bonds to get a Weighted Hydrogen Bond Score (WHBS). We found that WHBS better correlates with the rank order of BE than does ΔG<sub>CM</sub> or the unweighted sum of hydrogen bonds in the communication module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>).</p><p>Inter-strand purine base stacking (here referred to as 'base stacking') can also contribute to the stability of A-form RNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Egli, 2009</xref>). We observed in aptazymes with identical WHBS that base stacking in the communication module also affected BE in a position-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). We thus amended WHBS to include a correction for base stacking. The resulting Weighted Hydrogen-bond and Stacking Score (WHSS) better correlates with rank order of aptazyme BE values than does WHBS or ΔG<sub>CM </sub>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>). Notably, there is an inflection point in the BE values plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> at WHSS of 6.7. At this value, the additional energy provided by the ligand-bound aptamer will have a large impact on the activation of the ribozyme and thus the aptazyme’s dynamic range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>). Indeed, when CDR is plotted against WHSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), the highest CDRs were observed at WHSS values 6.75 (Tc15) and 6.92 (Tc12). Accordingly, we focused hereafter on communication-modules with WHSS values within the range of 6.7 ± 0.3.</p><p>We also noted in this analysis two outliers, Tc31 and Tc32, both of which had CDR scores substantially lower than what their WHSS values would predict. This effect is due to a high LE rather than a lower-than-expected BE. Comparison of Tc31 and Tc32 with Tc11 indicates that the aptamer-proximal base pair accounts for their low CDR values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Consistent with this, aptamers with WHSS values similar to Tc31 and Tc32, but with an aptamer-proximal A-U base pair, had higher CDR values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and K</xref>). Because a communication module with WHSS value around 6.7 tends to have lower annealing energy than the P1 stem of the original Tc aptamer, we speculated that an aptamer-proximal base pair with few hydrogen bonds lowers the affinity of the aptamer for its ligand. In addition, proximity of this base pair to the aptamer may subtly impair aptamer folding. We therefore used the base pair present in the original aptamer, or one with higher stability, in our subsequent efforts. When this final <italic>ad hoc</italic> principle was incorporated, aptazymes with WHSS values 6.7 ± 0.3 had consistently higher CDRs than aptazymes outside of this range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Validation of design principles through development of four classes of efficient aptazymes</title><p>To test the utility of the basic design principles, we first generated Tc aptazymes with the same architecture as the test panel, but with 4 bp, 6 bp, or 7 bp communication modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We evaluated three more validation panels: (1) aptazymes using the same tetracycline aptamer, but fused at a different aptamer stem (Tc-P2 aptazymes), (2) aptazymes constructed using a theophylline aptamer (Theo aptazymes), and (3) aptazymes constructed with a guanine aptamer (Gua aptazymes). To date, all reported Tc aptazymes are fused at the aptamer P1 stem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Win and Smolke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wittmann and Suess, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beilstein et al., 2015</xref>), but the structure of the Tc aptamer suggests that Tc-binding might have a larger effect on the P2 stem than the P1 stem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xiao et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore explored variants of our Tc aptazymes in which the ribozyme was fused to the P2 stem of the Tc aptamer (Tc-P2 aptazymes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) rather than the P1 stem (Tc-P1 aptazymes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). All aptazymes except Tc39 and Tc44 exhibited high CDR (CDR ≥ 10 ± 0.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Tc39 had a relatively low WHSS of 6.0, and Tc44 was intentionally designed with an aptamer-proximal A-U replacing the original G-C pair. Thus the basic principles developed with Tc-P1 aptazymes extend to a novel Tc-P2 aptazyme architecture. One of the Tc aptazymes with this alternative architecture, Tc40, outperformed all Tc-P1 aptazymes, and was used in subsequent studies. We then generated aptazymes constructed from entirely different aptamers, specifically those binding theophylline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jenison et al., 1994</xref>) and guanine (Gua) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mandal et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,D, and E</xref>). In both cases, we could readily generate aptazymes of high CDR, establishing the modularity of our approach.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref> plots the BE and LE of all the aptazymes against their WHSS values. Despite the diversity of these aptazymes, WHSS well predicted BE, consistent with our use of a common ribozyme, and the generality of our approach. Similarly, all aptazymes with high CDR had WHSS values near the region (WHSS 6.7 ± 0.3; grey) found to be optimal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Finally, we directly compared our best Tc, Theo, and Gua aptazymes with previously described aptazyme off-switches with the highest reported dynamic ranges. Consistent with the original reports, Tc aptazyme 9.19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wittmann and Suess, 2011</xref>) showed no functionality in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>), while both P1-F5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auslander et al., 2010</xref>) and RzGuaM5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nomura et al., 2012</xref>) showed a maximal dynamic range of approximately 5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L and M</xref>). In each case, our rationally designed aptazymes substantially outperformed these previously described aptazymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–M</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). We also directly compared our Tc40 off-switch with a previously described Tc aptazyme on-switch, 3’K19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beilstein et al., 2015</xref>). Again Tc40 showed significantly higher CDR (19.6-fold at 100 µM Tc) than the CDR (6.6-fold at 100 µM Tc) of this previously described aptazyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Aptazyme-mediated control of transgene expression in mammalian cell culture and in vivo</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, Tc40 exhibited the highest CDR of all Tc-regulated aptazymes. We generated a Tc40 variant, Tc45, in which ribozyme N107 is replaced by the closely related hammerhead ribozyme N117 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yen et al., 2004</xref>). Tc40 or Tc45 were then inserted either upstream (5′) or downstream (3′) of the GLuc gene, as a single copy (Tc40-5′, Tc40-3′, Tc45-3′), in tandem repeats (Tc40-5′5′, Tc45-3′3′), or across the GLuc gene (Tc40×45) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We observed in transiently transfected cells that Tc45-3′ has a lower CDR than Tc40-3′, but a higher BE, advantageous when aptazymes are used in tandem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). When these aptazymes were combined, with Tc40 placed 5′ of the GLuc reporter and Tc45 placed 3′, the resulting construct (Tc40×45) provided a 44-fold CDR with a 41% BE. We then measured regulation of GLuc in cells generated by retroviral transduction. Again, Tc40×45 exhibited a wider dynamic range than either Tc40-3′ or Tc45-3′ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and the regulation observed was completely reversed when Tc was withdrawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

We prepared high-titer recombinant AAV1 viruses carrying the GLuc gene regulated or not by Tc40×45. These two vectors were then injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of BALB/c mice. Two in vivo studies were performed. In the first, ten male mice were injected with a Tc40×45-regulated or control vector, and imaged for luciferase expression on day 10 post injection. Mice were then treated four days later with tetracycline (250 mg/kg) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for four days, and again imaged. All mice injected with control or Tc40×45-regulated vectors exhibited robust luciferase expression in the gastrocnemius muscle, and Tc treatment significantly reduced luciferase expression in the Tc40×45 mice but not the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Two weeks after injection, the mice were treated for three days with tetracycline or PBS, and imaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Combining both studies, we obtained an average dynamic range of 6.9-fold in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), lower than that observed in tissue culture cell lines. We speculate that this difference is due to the high metabolism of tetracycline in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sizemore et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agwuh and MacGowan, 2006</xref>), and inefficient access of tetracycline to AAV1-transduced muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bocker et al., 1984</xref>). Ribozyme based control of AAV-transgene expression in mice has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yen et al., 2004</xref>), however this switch control is possibly mediated by direct incorporation of the regulatory drug toyocamycin into the ribozyme RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yen et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, our data present the first example of aptazyme-mediated regulation in primary animal tissues in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Aptazymes have the potential to be useful in a number of important scientific and medical applications. For example, they afford simple and immediate regulation of gene expression in cell biology studies. In addition, aptazymes can be introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 into an untranslated region of an exon to exogenously control endogenous genes in their native contexts. They also have the potential to transform gene therapy, allowing controlled dosing of a biologic with a well tolerated drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). In these applications, aptazymes have several key strengths. First, they are smaller than most other gene-regulation systems, typically less than 200 base pairs. They therefore can be easily included in gene therapy vectors such as AAV with limited space for additional genes. Second, in contrast to transcription factor-dependent systems like Tet-Off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gossen and Bujard, 1992</xref>), aptazyme-mediated regulation does not require an immunogenic non-self protein. Third, aptazymes cleave in <italic>cis</italic>, and only the message bearing an aptazyme is affected. They are therefore highly specific, with few off-target effects. Finally, as we show here, they can be tailored to different aptamers regulated by different ligands, including those shown to be safe in humans.</p><p>Here we describe a straightforward method for converting aptamers into aptazymes with wide dynamic ranges in mammalian cells. We began with several straightforward and intuitive principles. For example, a communication module that anneals with too high overall energy will induce premature auto-activation of the ribozyme, even when the aptamer is unbound. In contrast, a communication module that is unstable will not convey the state of the aptamer to the ribozyme. However, between these limiting cases, we found that the communication-module annealing energy correlated poorly with an aptazyme’s dynamic range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and C</xref>). As shown here, the reason for this poor correlation is that base pairs proximal to the ribozyme have a disproportionate impact on the ribozyme’s enzymatic activity. Any energy-like function describing the impact of the communication module on the ribozyme should therefore take into account the distance of communication-module bases to ribozyme. Accordingly, we developed a scoring function, WHSS, based on the weighted sum of hydrogen bonds and inter-strand base-stacking interactions. This function accurately predicted the rank order of the BE of a test panel of 32 aptazymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), and was validated with 21 newly designed aptazymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Critically, when BE was plotted against WHSS, an inflection point was observed in the vicinity of a WHSS value of 6.7. As the WHSS values increased after this point, the BE of aptazymes rapidly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). At this inflection point, then, additional energy provide by the ligand-bound aptamer has a greater impact on aptazyme activity and therefore its dynamic range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). Thus, in most cases, aptazymes with WHSS values near 6.7 exhibited relatively high CDRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and L</xref>). We also observed that communication-module bases immediately adjacent to the aptamer affected CDR independently of WHSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–K</xref>), likely due to their effect on ligand affinity.</p><p>Importantly, we show that this approach is general. For example, it has allowed us to develop tetracycline-regulated aptazymes with two different architectures. These aptazymes exhibited high levels of basal expression and dynamic ranges wider than any previously described aptazymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wittmann and Suess, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beilstein et al., 2015</xref>). To underscore the modularity of this approach, we also developed aptazymes regulated by two additional ligands, theophylline and guanine. In both cases, the newly developed aptazymes again significantly outperformed all previously described aptazymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auslander et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nomura et al., 2012</xref>). These data suggest that any aptamer which anneals an accessible stem region upon ligand binding would likely be convertible to an efficient aptazyme off-switch. Ligand-aptamer binding-induced stem formation or stabilization could also be used to develop aptazyme on-switches. For example, an on-switch could use ligand-induced stem formation or stabilization to hide the hammerhead-ribozyme loop II or bulge I sequences important to ribozyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De la Peña et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Khvorova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martick and Scott, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Win and Smolke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beilstein et al., 2015</xref>). Our empirical approach may therefore be used to establish WHSS-like scoring functions for generating aptazyme on-switches. Thus this study provides a general rational-design method for rapidly converting diverse aptamers into aptazymes with wide regulatory ranges in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>DNA fragments encoding aptazyme variants were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA).

We also counted the number of potential hydrogen bonds (HBN) formed in the communication module. Both values correlated poorly with basal expression (BE). Specifically, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zar, 1998</xref>) was −0.64 for ΔG<sub>CM</sub> and −0.80 for HBN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We observed that hydrogen bond interactions from every communication-module base pair contributed to basal expression (BE), but that the location of these hydrogen bonds relative to the ribozyme determined the scale of this contribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Accordingly, we assigned every communication-module base pair an empirically determined weight reflecting its proximity to the ribozyme, and multiplied this weight by the number of hydrogen bonds to assign a Weighted Hydrogen Bond Score (WHBS). Specifically, we observed a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient of −0.91 when the ribozyme-proximal starting base pair (A-U) was assigned a weight of 1.0, and the subsequent base pairs were sequentially assigned weights of 5/6, 4/6, 3/6, and 2/6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). When longer communication modules were considered, bases 6, 7, 8, and 9 were assigned weights of 1/6, 5/36, 4/36, and 3/36, respectively. We also observed that inter-strand purine base stacking in the communication module also affected BE in a position-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). We thus added a weighted sum of base-stacking interactions to the WHBS to calculate a Weighted Hydrogen-bond and Stacking Score (WHSS) for each aptazyme. The relative energy of a hydrogen bond and an RNA base-stacking interaction remains undefined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Egli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Šponer et al., 2012</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Rational design of aptazyme riboswitches for efficient control of gene expression in mammalian cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Ronald Breaker (Reviewer #1) served as Guest Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Dr. Farzan and coworkers have presented a general method for the rapid and efficient development of ligand-responsive RNA genetic switches that can be used to regulate gene expression in mammalian cells. The authors use a novel intellectual framework to guide the engineering of unique linker sequences or communication modules between ligand-binding aptamer domains and self-cleaving ribozymes. By synthesizing and testing a series of RNA constructs, the authors generate a set of empirical data that reveals the importance of hydrogen bond number, base stacking, and distance between key RNA structures to functional switch outcomes. For successful switches, the binding of a corresponding ligand to the aptamer domain alters ribozyme function at a level sufficient to substantially affect expression from mRNAs carrying the engineered RNAs. The engineering approach is demonstrated to apply to multiple different aptamer domains, suggesting that the design principles be applicable to a large diversity of additional RNA domains. The concepts and methods presented in this work should permit others to create novel types of engineered riboswitches for practical applications.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should consider making a more appropriate comparison between their RNA switches and the mammalian Tc switches created by Suess and coworkers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript by Zhong et al. and Farzan provides convincing support for an exciting strategy to create RNA switches or 'aptazyme riboswitches' that work inside mammalian cells. The ability to control gene expression in a precise manner has been a long-sought goal by a number of laboratories, as various applications can be envisioned. As examples, the capability to create new switches quickly would allow researchers to more easily artificially regulate, and thereby study, numerous biological systems, and synthetic biologists would have a versatile set of gene control tools with which to create new regulatory networks. Moreover, there will be opportunities to use engineered RNA switches for future gene therapy applications.</p><p>In the current study, the authors have used an empirical approach to create an apparently powerful intellectual framework that yields novel switches that respond to several small molecules. Using their &quot;Weighted Hydrogen-bond and Stacking Score&quot; or WHSS, they demonstrate that each communication module made exhibits a predictable value for basal gene expression, ligand-inhibited expression, and corrected dynamic range. Perhaps future researchers will add additional biophysical rigor to understand precisely how this approach works at atomic resolution. However, it seems very likely that the authors have made an excellent technical advance for this field, and I do not think this work should suffer publication delays until all this is better understood. The success of their WHSS system plus the ad hoc retention of the aptamer-proximal base-pair is remarkable. Simply put, it seems likely that other researchers can easily adopt the strategy described by the authors to create novel RNA switches that work well in cells. I have only two very minor comments:</p><p>1. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and elsewhere, the authors should consider annotating a 5' terminus of the sequences depicted just to ensure that the readers maintain the right orientation.</p><p>2. The references are not entirely in the style of the journal and these should be edited accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Farzan and co-workers present a novel algorithm for the rational design of communication modules of ligand-responsive ribozymes. It takes into account additional parameters that allow for designing switches with better performances. The obtained responses with tetracyclin-dependent HHR systems in human cell culture are very impressive. Moreover, they demonstrate that the approach can be extended to theophylline- and guanine-dependent systems and that in these cases also improved performances are obtained. In addition, they demonstrate the application of tetracycline-dependent switches in AAV-mediated transgene expression in mice. This part is especially interesting since it demonstrates a principle applicability of aptazymes as switches in gene therapy applications. Taken together I can support acceptance for <italic>eLife</italic> given that the following (in some cases major) issues are appropriately addressed:</p><p>In general, the comparison of performances of artificial riboswitches is difficult because different expression systems etc. are often compared. On the other hand, in order to demonstrate the power of the approach such comparisons are necessary. However, in the present case the authors compare their Tc switches with the performance of an HHR-based switch by Wittmann and Suess. This switch has been engineered to function in yeast, however for comparison it is utilized in mammalian cells. It is reported that the switch is not working under these conditions; this is also why Suess and coworkers engineered Tc switches in mammalian cells which function very nicely as ON-switches. Hence the comparison is not valid and without further comment very unjustified sheds doubt on the work of Suess and co-workers. Why not compare the ON-switches with the present Tc switches? It is the dynamic range that defines the performance, even if the switching mode is opposite.</p><p>Also, regarding the comparison of performances, two more ribozyme-based switches are compared (guanine and theophylline). More background information should be given here. For example, it is unclear how exactly these previously reported ribozymes were tested. Sequences and how they were inserted into the reporter mRNAs should be provided. Or are the values shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K-M</xref> adopted from the literature?</p><p>Measurement of gene expression: When quantifying gene expression in mammalian cell culture, it is good practice to use dual luciferase systems in order to correct for transfection efficiency etc. The authors present all their results using just one reporter without a suited control. Is this a problem? To be discussed with the other reviewers.</p><p>Limitation of the design algorithm: The algorithm seems to work nicely, however it only allows designing OFF-switches since it works via computing solutions for stabilization of the aptazyme structure upon ligand binding. The design of ON-switches required other designs. This aspect should at least be discussed.</p><p>The AAV-mediated transgene expression in mice is very impressive; however, ligand-dependent ribozymes have been utilized before in mice for controlling gene expression by Mulligan and co-workers. Although that work is limited and the present work extends this concept very nicely, the mentioned work needs to be discussed appropriately. The respective publication (Yen et al., Nature, 2004) is mentioned briefly in the Introduction and later in a technical context but it is not discussed with regard to transgene expression in a mammalian organism.</p><p>In the last sentence, the authors state that &quot;Thus this study provides a robust rational-design method for rapidly converting diverse aptamers into aptazymes with wide regulatory ranges in mammalian cells.&quot; Since no new ligand selectivity has been demonstrated, this sentence is too optimistic. Only three known ligand-responsive systems have been optimized.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Zhong et al. describe a clear and systematic study describing the engineering of aptamers into aptazymes to modulate gene expression in mammalian cells. This work builds off seminal papers describing riboswitches and aptazymes (Breaker lab) and earlier engineering of hammerhead ribozymes in mammalian cells (Mulligan lab) to establish important design principles across the different RNA modules (i.e., communication module, aptamer, ribozyme) to quantitatively characterize the key determinants that govern basal expression, ligand inhibition and dynamic range of their engineered aptazymes. Specifically, the authors elucidate the impact of the number of hydrogen bonds (as opposed to δ-G) and the distance of communication-module bases to ribozyme have on basal expression and dynamic range of the aptazyme switches. This allowed the authors to develop a scoring function (WHSS) to predict the basal expression of 32 aptazymes that was subsequently validated with 21 newly designed aptazymes. Notably, the authors applied their findings to develop aptazymes of different architectures and for two additional ligands (theophylline and guanine). The systematic and exhaustive suite of aptazyme variants coupled by their detailed characterization is an important strength of this manuscript and a necessary and welcome step in this field. Finally, the authors describe an impressive demonstration of aptazyme-mediated gene regulation in a mouse model. Overall, I think the paper is clear and describes a rigorous set of experiments to support the key results and conclusions of the manuscript. I only have a few minor points that I encourage the authors to pursue before publication in <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>1. Subsection “Validation of design principles through development of four classes of efficient aptazymes” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> – dynamic range for CDR seems arbitrarily defined. I encourage the authors to establish quantitative bounds for low-medium-high CDR. I also think the authors have a typo – did they intend to refer to Tc44 rather than Tc43?</p><p>2. In the first paragraph of the Discussion, the authors propose introducing aptazymes via CRISPR/cas9 into precise positions in the genome. Given some of the specificity constraints via PAM sites and the potential for off-target affects or mutagenic activity of NHEJ, do the authors have a citation that reports such a capability or their own data to support this statement? Achieving this level of precision via CRISPR/cas9 could be quite challenging and worthy pursuit.</p><p>3. To what extent was the dosing required to achieve the observed (6.9-fold) switch-like behavior toxic to the animal? Commenting on this would be helpful in actualizing some of the discussion points associated with safe gene therapy applications currently described in the first paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>4. In my opinion, I recommend changing the order of the Discussion points. Specifically, many points in the first paragraph are better suited in the last paragraph of the Discussion and preceded by discussion points (currently second-third paragraphs of the Discussion) that are more central to the key findings of this study.</p><p>5. Although the authors demonstrate the ability to engineer aptazyme behavior with three commonly used ligands and associated aptamers, I think it would strengthen the paper and the authors' claims of broad applicability for the authors to comment on other ligand-aptamer pairs that they attempted and similarly how they envision adapting their programmable strategy for other ligands that may not yet have existing aptamers, highlighting challenges.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18858.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors should consider making a more appropriate comparison between their RNA switches and the mammalian Tc switches created by Suess and coworkers.</italic> </p><p>The tetracycline (Tc) aptazyme off-switch 9.19 (Wittmann and Suess, 2011) created by Suess and coworkers was originally developed by in vitro selection. They then tested some candidates for control of reporter gene expression in yeast as well as in mammalian cells. One candidate, 9.19, showed around 2-fold dynamic range in yeast but no any regulation in mammalian cells. As 9.19 is the only reported Tc aptazyme off switch functional in eukaryotic cells, we chose it for the comparison in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>.</p><p>Suess and coworkers have also engineered Tc aptazyme on switches functional in mammalian cells, and their best construct, 3'K19, showed 4.8-fold dynamic range at 50 µM Tc and 8.7-fold dynamic range at 250 µM Tc (Beilstein et al., 2015). Although we did not originally include a comparison with 3'K19 because the switching mode was opposite to that of our off switches, we have now included a direct comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>).</p><p>For the reviewers’ benefit, we provide more technical details. Specifically, we did a careful comparison between our Tc40 construct and 3'K19. We cloned both into 3'-UTR of a <italic>Gaussia</italic> luciferase (GLuc) gene in pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid. Both were flanked with same spacer sequences (Win and Smolke, 2007) to avoid interference of aptazyme folding by the surrounding sequences, and inserted between <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Eco</italic>RI restriction sites immediately downstream of the GLuc stop codon. They were then transfected into HeLa cells for measurement of corrected dynamic range (CDR) in response to different concentrations of Tc. The CDR data and relative GLuc expression data were presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>. Consistent with our previous data with Tc40 in different plasmid context, as well as that reported by Beilstein et al., Tc40 (19.6-fold at 100 µM Tc) showed significantly better CDR than that of 3'K19 (6.6-fold at 100 µM Tc).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>This manuscript by Zhong et al. and Farzan provides convincing support for an exciting strategy to create RNA switches or 'aptazyme riboswitches' that work inside mammalian cells.

We have addressed the minor points raised, as described above.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] In the last sentence, the authors state that &quot;Thus this study provides a robust rational-design method for rapidly converting diverse aptamers into aptazymes with wide regulatory ranges in mammalian cells.&quot; Since no new ligand selectivity has been demonstrated, this sentence is too optimistic.

First, he/she notes that comparisons among aptazymes are challenging or even unfair because switches function optimally in different contexts (e.g. yeast vs. mammalian cells). Also, we did not include a comparison with a very useful on switch that functions nicely in mammalian cells. We have now addressed this by including such a comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>). We would also note that our quantitative results conform nicely to descriptions of both on- and off-switches published by the Suess lab. To address a question of this reviewer, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K-M</xref> were experiments done in the lab, not taken from the literature.

Although the authors demonstrate the ability to engineer aptazyme behavior with three commonly used ligands and associated aptamers, I think it would strengthen the paper and the authors' claims of broad applicability for the authors to comment on other ligand-aptamer pairs that they attempted and similarly how they envision adapting their programmable strategy for other ligands that may not yet have existing aptamers, highlighting challenges.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her generous comments. We have now included quantitative bounds for our CDR, and corrected the error noted by the reviewer. Given the explosive changes with CRISPR/Cas9, we have not modified the text as suggested, and note here that Cas9 and Cpf1 have been engineered or identified with novel PAM specificities, and we think of our comments regarding CRISPR systems as somewhat forward looking. With regard to toxicity in our in vivo studies: as indicated in the methods, four out of 28 mice exhibited some negative reaction to tetracycline treatment, as indicated by weight loss. These mice were removed from the study and not analyzed further. No outward signs of toxicity were observed in the remaining mice. Finally, we have not yet attempted to engineer aptazymes with ligand different from the three described in the paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
