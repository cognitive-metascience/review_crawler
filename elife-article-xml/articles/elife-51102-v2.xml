We identified reduced LXA<sub>4</sub> levels in posterior segment uveitis patients and investigated the role of LXA<sub>4</sub> in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). Immunization for EAU with a retinal self-antigen caused selective downregulation of LXA<sub>4</sub> in lymph nodes draining the site of immunization, while at the same time amplifying LXA<sub>4</sub> in the inflamed target tissue. T cell effector function, migration and glycolytic responses were amplified in LXA<sub>4</sub>-deficient mice, which correlated with more severe pathology, whereas LXA<sub>4</sub> treatment attenuated disease. In vivo deletion or supplementation of LXA<sub>4</sub> identified modulation of CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and sphingosine 1- phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1) expression and glucose metabolism in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as potential mechanisms for LXA<sub>4</sub> regulation of T cell effector function and trafficking.

Posterior autoimmune uveitis accounts for 10–15% of blindness in the Western world and primarily affects working age adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Durrani et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gritz and Wong, 2004</xref>). Autoimmune uveitis is mediated by pathogenic Th1 and Th17 responses to retina-specific antigens, such as interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) and retinal arrestin. EAU in mice closely recapitulates human disease. Upon peripheral immunization with retinal antigens in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA), T cells are primed in the inguinal lymph nodes that drain the immunization sites. Activated retina-specific T cells then traffic to the eye and elicit inflammation that starts 9–11 days and peaks 14–16 days after immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caspi, 2010</xref>).</p><p>LXA<sub>4</sub> is an endogenous arachidonic acid-derived signaling molecule that exerts anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving activities via formyl peptide receptor 2 (ALX/FPR2) in mice and humans. To control the severity and duration of acute inflammation, cells expressing 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) oxygenate arachidonic acid in tandem to synthesize LXA<sub>4</sub> locally. 5-LOX is the only enzyme in mammals that can generate the 5,6 epoxide intermediate leukotriene A<sub>4</sub> required for the formation of LXA<sub>4</sub> and other epoxide intermediates of several specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wei and Gronert, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Serhan, 2014</xref>). Even though 5-LOX also initiates the generation of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes by leukocytes, 5-LOX in the retina has protective roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sapieha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Livne-Bar et al., 2017</xref>). Emerging evidence indicates that LXA<sub>4</sub> is an important tissue-resident pathway in eyes and draining lymph nodes that controls ocular surface inflammation and immune responses, and it is neuroprotective in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wei and Gronert, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Livne-Bar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kenchegowda and Bazan, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The defining functions of LXA<sub>4</sub> include inhibition of neutrophil infiltration to the site of inflammation, promotion of macrophage efferocytosis, and reduction of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Serhan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Serhan et al., 2008</xref>). In vitro studies demonstrated that LXA<sub>4</sub> and SPMs have a role in T follicular and helper cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nagaya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiurchiù et al., 2016</xref>), and neutrophil-derived LXA<sub>4</sub> was previously shown to inhibit T effector cell responses in lymph nodes in immune-driven dry eye disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2015</xref>). ALX/FPR2 is expressed on T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ariel et al., 2003</xref>), providing a modality for LXA<sub>4</sub> regulation of adaptive immunity. However, role of LXA<sub>4</sub> and its direct action on T lymphocytes in autoimmune responses has been minimally explored.</p><p>Specific aim of this study was to uncover whether and how LXA<sub>4</sub> regulates T effector cell function in the pathogenesis of autoimmune uveitis. Here, we report that expression of the homeostatic LXA<sub>4</sub> pathway and endogenous LXA<sub>4</sub> formation are dynamic and temporally defined in the target tissue, that is the eye, and the inciting lymph nodes that drain the site of immunization. T cells from LXA<sub>4</sub>-deficient (<italic>Alox5<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mice exhibited enhanced effector function with augmented cytokine production and altered metabolism that resulted in exacerbated disease, while LXA<sub>4</sub> treatment in wild type (WT) mice attenuated development of autoimmune uveitis. The resident LXA<sub>4</sub> pathway in draining lymph nodes was identified as a significant regulator of CCR7 and S1PR1, which control egress of T effector cells from lymph nodes. Lastly, LXA<sub>4</sub> deficiency as well as LXA<sub>4</sub> treatment regulated T cell glycolysis, an essential metabolic pathway required for T effector cell function. Our findings identify novel mechanisms and a homeostatic role for LXA<sub>4</sub> in lymph nodes to control the development of adaptive autoimmune responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LXA<sub>4</sub> is generated during autoimmune uveitis in a time- and site- dependent manner</title><p>Changes of SPMs in human blood have been proposed as diagnostic markers of health and disease outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Norris et al., 2018</xref>). Postmortem uveitic retinas are not readily available considering uveitis is not a fatal condition, therefore, we analyzed serum samples from 41 healthy subjects and 78 uveitis patients using ELISA to assess whether LXA<sub>4</sub> levels are affected in patients diagnosed with posterior uveitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The 78 uveitis patients had posterior uveitis that was either standalone or associated with various primary conditions such as Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH), birdshot chorioretinopathy, panuveitis, intermediate uveitis, choroidopathy and retinopathy. Average serum level of LXA<sub>4</sub> in patients were significantly lower than in healthy subjects (p=0.0135). Most uveitis diagnoses (n = 2 to 23 per diagnosis) had mean serum LXA<sub>4</sub> levels that were lower than healthy controls, with the exception of VKH. However, differences between individual diagnoses and healthy subjects did not reach significance, except for the group of intermediate uveitis (n = 5, p=0.019). The overall decrease in serum LXA<sub>4</sub> level in patients suggests that the LXA<sub>4</sub> pathway is physiologically relevant during pathogenesis of posterior segment uveitis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>LXA<sub>4</sub> is generated during autoimmune uveitis in a disease- and tissue- dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bar graph of LXA<sub>4</sub> concentration in pg/ml measured in human serum by ELISA.

Samples were collected from naive and immunized mice at disease onset (day 10) and peak disease (day 16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). LXA<sub>4</sub> and its 5-LOX and 12/15-LOX pathway markers (5-HETE and 15-HETE) were significantly elevated in eyes at peak disease compared to naive unimmunized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By contrast, LXA<sub>4</sub>, 5-HETE and 15-HETE levels were significantly downregulated at peak disease in the inguinal lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). LXA<sub>4</sub> levels did not change in the distal lymph nodes or eye-draining submandibular lymph nodes. Serum was analyzed at onset and peak of EAU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) to determine if the induced autoimmune response in mice would replicate changes in serum LXA<sub>4</sub> observed in uveitis patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While serum LXA<sub>4</sub> levels in EAU-challenged mice did not change compared to naïve mice, pathway markers 5-LOX and 15-LOX showed significant and progressive decreases during EAU (naïve vs. EAU day 16, p=0.0078 and p=0.0048 for 5-HETE and 15-HETE respectively). Analytes in lipidomic analysis also included DHA- and EPA-derived SPMs and leukotrienes. Pathway markers for DHA-derived SPMs (4-HDHA, 7-HDHA, 14-HDHA and 17-HDHA) were detected in all tissues, but DHA- or EPA- derived SPMs were not robustly detected or were below the signal-to-noise threshold (5:1) in our method. Leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> (LTB<sub>4</sub>), a 5-LOX product, was detected in lymph nodes of healthy mice and during the time course of EAU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, unlike LXA<sub>4</sub>, LTB<sub>4</sub> levels did not change significantly in inguinal lymph nodes during EAU pathogenesis. The finding is consistent with our previous lipidomic analysis that identified changes in LXA<sub>4</sub>, but not LTB<sub>4</sub>, in eye draining lymph nodes of an immune-driven dry eye disease model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). Altogether, the current findings indicate selective and differential regulation of LXA<sub>4</sub> formation at inductive and effector sites of autoimmunity in EAU.</p><p>We next assessed gene expression of the LXA<sub>4</sub> pathway during EAU. Retinas and inguinal lymph nodes were harvested from naïve and immunized mice on day 3, day 7, and day 14 post-immunization. Expression of 5-LOX (<italic>Alox5</italic>), 12/15-LOX (<italic>Alox15</italic>), and LXA<sub>4</sub> receptor (<italic>Fpr2</italic>) was measured by RT-PCR. In the retina, <italic>Alox5</italic> expression was upregulated by approximately five-fold on day 14 post-immunization in comparison to earlier time points and to naive mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which directly correlated with upregulation of LXA<sub>4</sub> formation in the eye. <italic>Alox15</italic> expression remained comparable to naïve mice during the entire time course of EAU, whereas <italic>Fpr2</italic> expression changed throughout the time course of EAU, likely reflecting changes in circulating leukocytes populations that express varying levels of <italic>Fpr2</italic> in the lymph node, and in temporal regulation of the homeostatic LXA<sub>4</sub> pathway by resident cells in the retina.</p><p>In the inguinal lymph nodes, <italic>Alox5</italic> expression was significantly upregulated on day 3 and day 14 post-immunization, whereas <italic>Fpr2</italic> expression was highly upregulated on day 3, but not on day 14 post-immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Increased RNA levels of <italic>Alox5</italic> in inguinal lymph nodes did not correlate with 5-LOX activity and LXA<sub>4</sub> production as both 5-HETE and LXA<sub>4</sub> levels were decreased on day 10 and day 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Since EAU pathogenesis is mediated by retina-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we evaluated <italic>Fpr2</italic> expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from inguinal lymph nodes and found that the receptor expression was significantly upregulated at peak disease in comparison to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from inguinal lymph nodes of naïve mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). RNA expression of lipoxygenases (5-LOX and 12/15-LOX) demonstrates selective and temporal modulation of tissue-resident LXA<sub>4</sub> pathway during EAU, while increased <italic>Fpr2</italic> expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the inguinal lymph nodes potentiates their ability to interact with LXA<sub>4</sub> during the effector phase of the immune response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Endogenous LXA<sub>4</sub> limits development and progression of EAU</title><p>In light of LXA<sub>4</sub> pathway modulation observed during EAU, we investigated whether endogenous LXA<sub>4</sub> deficiency would affect the course of autoimmune uveitis. <italic>Alox5</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice are LXA<sub>4</sub> deficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aliberti et al., 2002</xref>), since 5-LOX is a necessary enzyme required for LXA<sub>4</sub> biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The <italic>Alox5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse line is an established Jackson Laboratory strain that has been used to study the role of leukotrienes and LXA<sub>4 </sub>in vivo. There are no reports of compensatory upregulation of other eicosanoid pathways (cyclooxygenases, 12-LOX or 15-LOX) in this mouse line. Lipidomic analysis did not detect significant differences in basal levels of 12-HETE, 15-HETE, prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> (PGD<sub>2</sub>), prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>), or thromboxane B<sub>2</sub> (TXB<sub>2</sub>) in inguinal lymph nodes of <italic>Alox5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Low amounts of 5-HETE and LXA<sub>4</sub> were detected in <italic>Alox5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). It is possible that one of the other mouse lipoxygenase enzymes, which do not exist in humans (e.g. 8-LOX), is able to catalyze LXA<sub>4</sub> formation in mice with low efficiency. Age-matched <italic>Alox5</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and WT mice were immunized with IRBP<sub>651-670</sub> peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mattapallil et al., 2015</xref>) and EAU pathogenesis was assessed by fundoscopy. Disease scores of <italic>Alox5</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were significantly higher than WT mice starting on day 16 post-immunization, and retinal inflammation in <italic>Alox5</italic><sup>-/-</sup> persisted while inflammation gradually resolved in WT by day 20 post-immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Representative Micron III fundus images of WT and <italic>Alox5</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice revealed more inflammation in the <italic>Alox5</italic><sup>-/-</sup> eye, with retinal haze resulting from severe cellular infiltration in the retina and vitreous, as opposed to clear vitreous in the WT eye allowing visualization of the underlying retinal folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Electroretinography showed that visual function of immunized <italic>Alox5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was significantly impaired compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), in line with the more severe disease phenotype in <italic>Alox5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.

A key finding is the downregulation of basal LXA<sub>4</sub> levels in lymph nodes that accompany the adaptive immune response in a mouse model of autoimmune uveitis. Reduced levels of serum LXA<sub>4</sub> were also identified in serum of human patients with posterior uveitis diagnoses, suggesting that the LXA<sub>4</sub> pathway is dynamically regulated in human uveitis. In contrast, LXA<sub>4</sub> levels were elevated in the uveitic eyes of mice, which is consistent with the established role of LXA<sub>4</sub> as an induced counter-regulatory mediator that is generated at sites of inflammation. Despite the established role of LXA<sub>4</sub> in innate immune cell regulation, direct regulation of adaptive immune responses by endogenous LXA<sub>4</sub> is not well defined in vivo, as most research efforts have focused on LXA<sub>4</sub>’s ability to dampen and resolve acute inflammation elicited by innate immune cells. Beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of LXA<sub>4</sub> have been previously reported in the LPS-induced anterior uveitis model, however, pathogenesis of LPS-induced uveitis is driven exclusively by innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karim et al., 2009</xref>). In a murine asthma model induced by allergen immunization, LXA<sub>4</sub> treatment reduced airway inflammation by increasing natural killer cell-mediated eosinophil apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnig et al., 2013</xref>), demonstrating LXA<sub>4</sub> regulation of innate responses in vivo. Our data indicate that downregulated endogenous LXA<sub>4</sub>, specifically in inguinal lymph nodes that drain the immunization site, is a key feature of developing adaptive immunity, that is EAU. This is consistent with a previous report, which linked lower LXA<sub>4</sub> levels in draining lymph nodes to exacerbated dry eye disease in female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2015</xref>). LXA<sub>4</sub>-deficient <italic>Alox5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and adoptive transfer in T cell-deficient mice also demonstrated that in vivo disruption of the LXA<sub>4</sub> pathway amplifies effector T cell responses in autoimmune uveitis. These experiments provide strong evidence for LXA<sub>4</sub> regulation of adaptive immune responses initiated in lymph nodes by demonstrating that (a) LXA<sub>4</sub> deficiency causes dysregulated T effector cell function that leads to exacerbated autoimmune pathogenesis and (b) supplementation with exogenous LXA<sub>4</sub> reverses this effect. Thus, we identified a new role for LXA<sub>4</sub> in T cell-driven adaptive autoimmunity and uncovered a lymph node – eye axis that regulates this process.</p><p>It is not possible to capture changes in LXA<sub>4</sub> tissue levels after a low dose (1 μg) injection of LXA<sub>4</sub> at the time of tissue harvest since increases of LXA<sub>4</sub> in eye or lymph nodes are likely rapid and of short duration. LXA<sub>4</sub>, like all eicosanoids, is enzymatically inactivated in minutes when not bound to an endogenous carrier protein such as albumin. However, several research groups have established that tail vein, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous or subconjunctival injections of LXA<sub>4</sub> or other SPMs (10 ng-1 μg) in mouse disease models induce long-lasting protective actions through changes in lymphocyte and neutrophil function and macrophage phenotype at distant tissue sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Livne-Bar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Serhan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fosshaug et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wei and Gronert, 2019</xref>), which indicate direct actions at the target tissue.</p><p>Our findings provide evidence for LXA<sub>4</sub> regulation of T cell trafficking as a potential mechanism for controlling EAU progression. The S1PR1-sphingosine-1 phosphate axis is a primary mechanism for regulating lymph node T cell egress and lymphocyte recirculation. LXA<sub>4</sub> treatment selectively downregulated <italic>S1pr1</italic> expression only in inguinal lymph nodes of WT EAU-challenged mice. Pharmacological downregulation of S1PR1 prevents trafficking of autoreactive T cells and is an FDA-approved treatment for multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garris et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, a role of the lymph node LXA<sub>4</sub> pathway in regulating <italic>S1pr1</italic> expression in lymphocytes warrants further investigation into the crosstalk between these two classes of lipid mediators. The CCR7-CCL19/CCL21 axis facilitates naïve T cell homing to secondary lymphoid organs, activated T cell egress, and the interaction between T cells and dendritic cells (DC) to induce peripheral tolerance or to elicit an adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Comerford et al., 2013</xref>). LXA<sub>4</sub> treatment differentially regulated this axis at the effector and initiation sites of the adaptive immune response by reducing <italic>Ccr7</italic> and <italic>Ccl19</italic> expression in the eye and increasing <italic>Ccr7</italic> and <italic>Ccl21</italic> expression in inguinal lymph nodes.</p><p>The endogenous role of LXA<sub>4</sub> in regulating effector T cell function through <italic>Ccr7</italic> was confirmed with <italic>Alox5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice using T cell adoptive transfer and in vitro migration experiments. LXA<sub>4</sub> deficiency was coincident with dysregulated (i.e. lower) expression of CCR7 in T cells from inguinal lymph nodes, increased IFN-γ production and an almost two-fold increase of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell migration towards CCL19/21 gradient. <italic>Ccr7</italic> is expressed predominantly in DC and T cells, and its ligands CCL19 and CCL21 can be secreted by several cell types. In this study, we did not investigate the cellular source of CCL19 and CCL21 in tissues, the effect of LXA<sub>4</sub> on <italic>Ccr7</italic> expression in DC or assess direct LXA<sub>4</sub> regulation of <italic>Ccr7</italic> expression on T cells. LXA<sub>4</sub> has established actions with DC and other cell types, therefore, we cannot rule out that LXA<sub>4</sub> also controls T cell responses in inguinal lymph nodes through priming by DC and/or regulation of CCL19 and CCL21 production by other cell types.</p><p>T cell glycolysis is vital in regulating T cell effector function. Metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis is required to sustain T effector function and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Salmond, 2018</xref>). Inhibition of glycolysis abrogates IFN-γ production in activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, implicating glycolysis as regulator of sustained T effector responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). LXA<sub>4</sub> treatment decreased CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells glycolytic responses and reduced IFN-γ production from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, providing evidence of direct regulation of T cell function by LXA<sub>4</sub>. Increased glycolytic responses of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from <italic>Alox5</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice underscores the relevance of lymph node resident LXA<sub>4</sub> in controlling T cell effector function. T cell glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism as potential therapeutic targets are supported by elevated glycolytic metabolism in T cells of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and reduced IFN-γ production and disease biomarkers upon inhibition of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell glycolysis in mouse models of SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yin et al., 2015</xref>). The ability of LXA<sub>4</sub> to downregulate glycolysis in activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell is of interest and suggests that the lymph node resident LXA<sub>4</sub> pathway is a potential checkpoint to limit inflammatory cytokine production and the magnitude of adaptive immune responses.</p><p>In mice and humans, LXA<sub>4</sub> cognate receptor ALX/FPR2 is expressed in T cells, B cells and innate lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wei and Gronert, 2019</xref>), and has been shown to regulate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell cytokine production in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiurchiù et al., 2016</xref>). During peak EAU, <italic>Fpr2</italic> expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was highly upregulated in the inguinal lymph nodes that drain the site of immunization, suggesting that increased capacity of LXA<sub>4</sub> signaling in T cells is a counter-regulatory mechanism in response to the development of adaptive immunity. Consistent with our hypotheses that dysregulated LXA<sub>4</sub> signaling allows for development of EAU and facilitates augmented effector T cell functional responses, adoptive transfer of either <italic>Alox5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> or <italic>Fpr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> T cells to <italic>TCRb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> recipients caused exacerbated EAU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Transferred T cells from <italic>Fpr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Alox5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice induced different signatures of inflammatory ocular infiltrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), likely due to differential regulation of donor T cells and innate effector cells by the host LXA<sub>4</sub> pathway in <italic>TCRb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> recipient mice. However, unlike <italic>Alox5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, global <italic>Fpr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (which generate LXA<sub>4</sub>) did not develop more severe EAU than WT controls after immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). A second LXA<sub>4</sub> receptor GPR32 has been identified in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dalli and Serhan, 2019</xref>), which currently has no mouse homolog. Our data suggest that additional receptors for LXA<sub>4</sub> may exist in mice. Incomplete abrogation of LXA<sub>4</sub> signaling due to a putative second receptor may explain why immunized global <italic>Fpr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice did not develop more severe autoimmune disease.</p><p>EAU is an induced and well characterized model of autoimmune uveitis that recapitulates features of human posterior autoimmune uveitis. Although the immune-regulatory roles of LXA<sub>4</sub> in human draining lymph nodes remain to be defined, LXA<sub>4</sub> has been identified as an abundant SPM in human axillary lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colas et al., 2014</xref>). While it is important to note that there are significant differences in mouse and human immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seok et al., 2013</xref>), LXA<sub>4</sub> pathway and receptors are conserved in humans and mice and are targeted as novel therapies based on promising results from animal studies.</p><p>In summary, our data established that the basal tone of LXA<sub>4</sub> in lymph nodes is selectively downregulated in the draining lymph node during development of an adaptive immune response. We identified regulation of CCR7 and S1PR1 expression and glycolytic responses in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as new mechanisms for LXA<sub>4</sub> to control effector T cell functions and egress from lymph nodes, which establishes LXA<sub>4</sub> as an important homeostatic regulator for fine tuning adaptive immune responses. Thus, amplification of the resident lymph node LXA<sub>4</sub> pathway may be a potential target to prevent the development of pathogenic adaptive immune responses and autoimmunity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patients and healthy controls</title><p>Male and female patients ages 30–76 with clinical diagnosis of non-infectious posterior segment uveitis were enrolled in the National Eye Institute protocol number 16-EI-0046.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nicolas G Bazan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Please aim to submit the revised version within two months.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Wei et al. conducted experiments to determine whether and how LXA<sub>4</sub> regulates T effector cell function in the pathogenesis of autoimmune uveitis. They showed that LXA<sub>4</sub> serum concentration may be increased in posterior uveitis patients, and the disease severity can be altered by modulating LXA<sub>4</sub> concentration, i.e. ALOX5-deficient mice and LXA<sub>4</sub> injection in the mouse experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) model.</p><p>These findings clearly provide evidence for the involvement of LXA<sub>4</sub> signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of autoimmune uveitis. However, the study falls a little short to provide sufficient mechanistic insight how LXA<sub>4</sub> regulates T effector cell function in the pathogenesis of EAU. The main criticism is that it is not clear where is the specific site of LXA<sub>4</sub> action to regulate T cell function. They suggest that the resident LXA<sub>4</sub> circuit in inguinal lymph node plays roles, but it is not clear if the LXA<sub>4</sub> signaling is up-regulated or down-regulated in the inguinal lymph node during the EAU, since LXA<sub>4</sub> concentration goes down while All/Fpr2 expression goes up (Figure 1C and 1E). After LXA<sub>4</sub> i.p. injections, LXA<sub>4</sub> concentration should be determined in eyes, inguinal lymph, and serum. 5-LOX is involved in the production of not only LXA<sub>4</sub>, but also leukotriene species. Also, the Cox pathway might be augmented in the compensatory manner in the 5-LOX-deficient background. So it is not clear whether the EAU phenotype observed in the ALOX4<sup>-/-</sup> mice can be attributed to LXA<sub>4</sub> alone or not. In the adoptive transfer experiment of T cells, they transfer the T cells from the EAU mice. These T cells are already activated in the global ALOX5-/- environment, and do not support the conclusion that effect of LXA<sub>4</sub> is T cell mediated.</p><p>As potential mechanisms, they suggest the regulations by LXA<sub>4</sub> of chemokine receptors and sphingosine-1 receptor expression as well as glucose metabolism. These observations are descriptive, only based on the gene expression levels and glycolytic rate, not providing the direct regulation by LXA<sub>4</sub>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1A.</p><p>It is important to see if the rodent findings translate to human inflammation / immune responses. So this figure is critical. Within the &quot;other&quot; uveitis group was there a difference between &quot;pan uveitis&quot; which also has posterior (choroidal) uveitis and &quot;anterior uveitis&quot;? Anterior uveitis alone may be a better control if you suggest that specific ocular tissue inflammation determines the level of LXA<sub>4</sub> and thus pan uveitis should be added to the posterior group. If on the other hand you suggest the instigating insult is associated with LXA<sub>4</sub> levels then more explanation about the choices of categories of human disease is needed particularly because the difference between groups you currently have defined is small. An unbiased approach (put all human data together and see which patient groups are associated with what LXA<sub>4</sub> levels) would be the most telling. &quot;Dot plots&quot; should be done as in the rest of the paper as it would give more information.</p><p>2) There are great differences between mouse and human inflammation/immune responses (Seok et al., 2013). Please comment in detail in the Discussion and Introduction with respect to this work.</p><p>3) Figure 2.</p><p>Alox5<sup>-/-</sup> mice lack more than LXA<sub>4</sub>. What are the possible effects of other metabolic products that are missing in these mice?</p><p>What was the diet composition for the mice specifically regarding omega 3 and 6 LCPUFAs and was it maintained throughout as standard chow can vary batch to batch? A diet high in AA versus DHA would likely influence results.</p><p>Figure 2D The authors are presenting a single point for the electroretinography analysis, for which we have no indication on the light intensity used to get this b-wave response. In Materials and methods it is mentioned that the ERG was performed with controlled light stimuli (subsection “Electroretinography and fundus imaging”), meaning that more than one stimulus was performed, however this figure presents the response from only one intensity point. Moreover, the aforementioned subsection mentions a-wave, which are not apparent in this figure, nor discussed in Results. A complete ERG plot with increasing light stimuli showing a-wave and b-wave would be more appropriate.</p><p>4) Figure 3.</p><p>Figure 2G and Figure 3H Are the statistical analysis missing in these graphs or the differences are not significant? If the latter mention it in the legend.</p><p>Figure 3C What is the mouse strain background of EAU and EAU+LXA<sub>4</sub> animals, because their RPE is not pigmented. This is not clear, because according to the subsection “Mice, EAU induction and LXA<sub>4</sub> treatment”, C57BL/6J (pigmented animals) were used for the EAU induction and LXA<sub>4</sub> treatment. Can the authors clarify the reason of the lack of pigmentation in the EAU and EAU+LXA<sub>4</sub> pictures?</p><p>Figure 3D Can the authors improve the quality of their immunofluorescent pictures? For example, the DAPI staining is barely visible, which is essential for the identification of the layering of the retina and proper morphological localization of the labeled targets. Moreover, a thicker line for the scale bar to make it more visible would help improve this picture.</p><p>5) Mechanism.</p><p>As potential mechanisms, they suggest the regulations by LXA<sub>4</sub> of chemokine receptors and sphingosine-1 receptor expression as well as glucose metabolism. These observations are descriptive, only based on the gene expression levels and glycolytic rate, not providing the direct regulation by LXA<sub>4</sub>.</p><p>To strengthen their conclusion, additional experiments listed below are needed.</p><p>1) Provide LXA<sub>4</sub> concentrations in the eye, inguinal lymph node, and serum after i.p. injection of LXA<sub>4</sub> during the EAU model.</p><p>2) Provide evidence or discussion to show that other lipid mediators (i.e. leukotrienes and prostaglandins) are not affected in the ALOX5-deficient mice.</p><p>3) Examine if LXA<sub>4</sub> treatment of isolated T cells in vitro can impact the gene expression levels of chemokine receptors and S1pr1, like they did in the glycolysis analysis (Figure 6).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51102.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1A.</p><p>It is important to see if the rodent findings translate to human inflammation / immune responses.

Detailed analysis of all uveitis groups identified patients with 13 distinct diagnoses. Only 1 patient had a diagnosis of anterior uveitis. All other uveitides can include posterior uveitis and/or immune responses as part of the pathogenesis. In total there were 4 uveitis variants with only 1 patient (edema, retinal detachment, anterior uveitis, photopsia), which were excluded from the new analysis. All other uveitides ranged from 2 to 23 patient serum samples per group. Decoding of the samples also revealed that our original dataset erroneously included a number of plasma (and not serum) samples, which skewed the mean of the uveitis groups. After excluding the plasma samples, the new analysis revealed an opposite result from our original finding, namely serum LXA<sub>4</sub> levels in patients with posterior uveitis symptoms (n=78) were significantly lower (p=0.0092) than in healthy controls (n=41). Revised Figure 1A shows significantly lower serum levels of LXA<sub>4</sub> when all posterior uveitis patients were compared to healthy controls. All individual diagnosis groups had means that were lower than the healthy controls, with the exception of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH, n=9). Due to the variation in sample size in each group, differences between individual diagnosis groups and healthy controls did not reach significance, except for intermediate uveitis (n=4, p=0.04). We are fortunate to have access to these human samples, but it is a post-hoc analysis of all available serum samples and we cannot increase the number of samples for individual diagnosis groups to establish which type of uveitis or pathogenesis correlates with the most significant decrease in serum LXA<sub>4</sub> levels. Our findings add to a growing body of evidence that has recently been published by the Serhan and Dalli research groups (1-4), which document dynamic and disease-specific changes in SPM serum or plasma levels in humans. A new section for Figure 1A (subsection “LXA<sub>4</sub> is generated during autoimmune uveitis in a time- and site- dependent manner”) has been added to Results and corresponding discussion (Discussion, first paragraph) has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There are great difference between mouse and human inflammation/ immune responses (Seok et al., 2013).

As requested by the reviewer we added the PNAS reference that compared genomic responses in mice and humans and added discussion to highlight the limitations of our mouse model (Discussion, seventh paragraph). It is important point out that despite limitations of mouse models, major breakthroughs in our understanding of human immunology and disease treatment were discovered in mouse and invertebrate models (e.g., 2011 and 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2.</p><p>Alox5-/- mice lack more than LXA4.

LTB<sub>4</sub> and peptido-leukotriene (LTC<sub>4</sub>/D<sub>4</sub>/E<sub>4</sub>) formation is impaired in Alox5<sup>-/-</sup> mice. LTB<sub>4</sub> has established roles in regulation of innate immune cells and Th2 responses. However, in the Th1/17 -driven autoimmune uveitis model, peptido-leukotrienes were not consistently detected in tissues and LTB<sub>4</sub> levels did not significantly change in lymph nodes or the eye during EAU development (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1), which is why our study focused on the 5-LOX metabolite LXA<sub>4</sub>. Our previous studies (5, 6), which investigated SPM formation in draining lymph nodes during the initiation of ocular surface immune responses, also did not detect significant levels or changes in LTB<sub>4</sub>. 5-LOX is also the required enzyme for the formation of several DHA-, DPA- and EPA-derived SPM; however, these were not consistently detected in lymph nodes or the eye with our LC-MS/MS method. New text has been added to the Results section (subsection “LXA<sub>4</sub> is generated during autoimmune uveitis in a time- and site- dependent manner”, second paragraph) to justify our focus on LXA<sub>4</sub> as the most relevant 5-LOX metabolite in the EAU model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What was the diet composition for the mice specifically regarding omega 3 and 6 LCPUFAs and was it maintained throughout as standard chow can vary batch to batch?

Vendor, name and PUFA composition of the standard rodent chow have been added to the Materials and methods section. Mice were housed in the same animal room and experienced the same controlled environmental conditions. Control and experimental animals were on the same open formula NIH rodent diet from weaning through the duration of the experiment thus batch to batch variation in the diet would equally affect all experimental and control groups. We agree that batch to batch variation in rodent diets could potentially change the ratio of dietary intake of AA:DHA:EPA. However, in all our tissue lipidomic analyses AA, DHA and EPA are included as standard analytes and we did not notice any marked changes in the ratio of AA:DHA:AA among different sets of mouse experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2D The authors are presenting a single point for the electroretinography analysis, for which we have no indication on the light intensity used to get this b-wave response.

LXA<sub>4</sub>, like all eicosanoids, is enzymatically inactivated in minutes when not bound to an endogenous carrier protein such as albumin. However, several research groups have established that tail vein, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous or subconjunctival injections of LXA<sub>4</sub> or other SPMs (10 ng-1 mg) in mouse disease models induce long-lasting protective actions through changes in lymphocyte and PMN function and macrophage phenotype at distant tissue sites. We did measure LXA<sub>4</sub> in inguinal lymph nodes in LXA<sub>4</sub> or vehicle control treated mice on day 10 and day 16 in the pathogenesis of EAU (Author response image 2). Since the tissue was collected 2-3 hours after the last LXA<sub>4</sub> treatment, as expected, LXA<sub>4</sub> tissue level did not change. We added discussion (Discussion, second paragraph) to clarify that we cannot directly prove that LXA<sub>4</sub> treatment is increasing LXA<sub>4</sub> levels in the inguinal lymph nodes or the eye.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Quantification of LXA<sub>4</sub> in EAU-challenged mice treated with LXA<sub>4</sub> or vehicle control.</title><p>LXA<sub>4</sub>, 5-HETE, 12-HETE, 15-HETE in pg per sample in inguinal lymph nodes of EAU-challenged mice harvested on day 10 and day 16 post-immunization, quantified by LC-MS/MS. n=4-5 per group.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51102-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Provide evidence or discussion to show that other lipid mediators (i.e. leukotrienes and prostaglandins) are not affected in the ALOX5-deficient mice.</p></disp-quote><p>The Alox5<sup>-/-</sup> mouse line used in our experiments was generated in 1994 (7) and is an established Jackson Laboratory strain that has been used in numerous publications to study the 5-LOX pathway in disease models. Deficient LTB<sub>4</sub>, peptido-leukotrienes and LXA<sub>4</sub> formation has been established for this mouse line. We are not aware of any publications that have reported marked compensatory upregulation of other eicosanoid pathways (COX, 12-LOX or 15-LOX) in this mouse line. In response to the reviewer’s concern, we performed lipidomic analysis (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Results subsection “LXA<sub>4</sub> limits development and progression of EAU”) but did not detect significant differences in basal inguinal lymph node levels of 12-HETE, 15-HETE, PGE2 or PGD2 in Alox5<sup>-/-</sup> mice. In addition, in WT mice LTB<sub>4</sub> levels did not significantly change in lymph nodes or the eye in EAU (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). Therefore, we focused on LXA<sub>4</sub>, which is selectively down-regulated in inguinal lymph nodes during the development of an adaptive immune response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Examine if LXA4 treatment of isolated T cells in vitro can impact the gene expression levels of chemokine receptors and S1pr1, like they did in the glycolysis analysis (Figure 6).</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have carried out additional experiments to examine the direct action of LXA<sub>4</sub> with T cells in vitro.
