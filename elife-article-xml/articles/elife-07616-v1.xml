influenced by a variety of environmental factors, such as seasonal variations in climate or abiotic conditions in water and soil, which confounds our understanding of the main drivers of many multi-host pathogens. Here, we take advantage of a combination of large environmental data sets on <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic> (<italic>MU</italic>), an environmentally persistent microorganism associated to freshwater ecosystems and present in a large variety of aquatic hosts, to characterize abiotic and biotic factors driving the dynamics of this pathogen in two regions of Cameroon. We find that <italic>MU</italic> dynamics are largely driven by seasonal climatic factors and certain physico-chemical conditions in stagnant and slow-flowing ecosystems, with an important role of <italic>pH</italic> as limiting factor. Furthermore, water conditions can modify the effect of abundance and diversity of aquatic organisms on <italic>MU</italic> dynamics, which suggests a different contribution of two <italic>MU</italic> transmission routes for aquatic hosts (trophic vs environmental transmission) depending on local abiotic factors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07616.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07616.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07616.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic> is a slow-growing bacterium that causes a rare tropical disease in humans called Buruli ulcer. The infection affects the skin and underlying tissues, initially causing small painless lesions that can develop into large open sores or ulcers that are responsible for significant handicap in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>Disease outbreaks generally occur in close association with stagnant and slow-flowing aquatic ecosystems, mostly after floods or other large environmental disturbances. It is believed that contact with water sources that contain the bacteria causes infection in humans, but the specific mode of transmission remains a mystery. By defining the factors that influence the bacteria's presence in the environment, public health officials could develop initiatives that would reduce an individual's risk of infection when conditions support a <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> outbreak.</p><p>To identify the environmental conditions that affect the prevalence of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> in two regions of Cameroon where Buruli ulcer is present, Garchitorena et al. have now analyzed a large amount of ecological data about the bacteria using cutting-edge statistical techniques. This revealed that the amount of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> varies following seasonal changes in climate, at least in the region dominated by tropical rainforest. In this region, the bacteria are also generally present in waters that are more alkaline and contain fewer animals, especially from certain species that could prevent the infection spreading to other aquatic hosts. In the other region, dominated by a savannah landscape, the bacteria are most abundant in stagnant or slowly moving waters that have optimal physical and chemical conditions and contain many diverse species of potential animal hosts. The discovery of contrasting results for the two regions suggests that there are at least two ways that <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> can persist in the environment and infect the aquatic animals. The prevailing method—through environmental transmission or through interactions between hosts—depends on the properties of the water.</p><p>Many other infectious diseases are caused by pathogens that, like <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>, infect many different hosts and persist in the environment for long periods. Future research following methods like those used by Garchitorena et al. would help to reveal whether these pathogens are affected by environmental factors in similar ways to <italic>M. ulcerans.</italic></p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07616.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07616.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>environmental driver</kwd><kwd>disease ecology</kwd><kwd>multi-host pathogen</kwd><kwd>neglected tropical disease</kwd><kwd>Buruli ulcer</kwd><kwd>multi-model inference</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR 11 CEPL 007 04 EXTRA-MU</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garchitorena</surname><given-names>Andrés</given-names></name><name><surname>Guégan</surname><given-names>Jean-François</given-names></name><name><surname>Léger</surname><given-names>Lucas</given-names></name><name><surname>Eyangoh</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name><name><surname>Marsollier</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name><name><surname>Roche</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>École des hautes études en santé publique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garchitorena</surname><given-names>Andrés</given-names></name><name><surname>Guégan</surname><given-names>Jean-François</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Institut de recherche pour le développement</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JEAI AtoMyc</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garchitorena</surname><given-names>Andrés</given-names></name><name><surname>Guégan</surname><given-names>Jean-François</given-names></name><name><surname>Eyangoh</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Raoul Follereau</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marsollier</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001677</institution-id><institution>Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Programme Inserm Avenir, AtOMycA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marsollier</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Region Pays de la Loire</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ARMINA project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marsollier</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDT20130928241</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marsollier</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Different transmission routes of <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic> to aquatic organisms may prevail depending on local physico-chemical conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite increased understanding of infectious disease ecology and dynamics, recent decades have seen an upsurge in the emergence and re-emergence of multiple infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jones et al., 2008</xref>). Most emerging pathogens are zoonotic and have a very broad range of hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Woolhouse et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005</xref>), and as a result, host–parasite interactions are often embedded within complex host communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Plowright et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roche et al., 2013b</xref>). Biotic interactions between hosts in the community may play an important role on disease transmission, either promoting or diluting the overall prevalence of the pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">LoGiudice et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keesing et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roche et al., 2013a</xref>). In addition, the effect of seasonal variations in climate on abiotic conditions in water and soil can influence the composition of host communities and in turn have an impact on the ecological dynamics of the pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ostfeld et al., 2008</xref>). Because of the intertwined nature of biotic and abiotic drivers, disentangling their respective contribution to pathogen dynamics and transmission through complex and different-scale processes remains a challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Plowright et al., 2008</xref>). Nonetheless, identifying the underlying ecological mechanisms driving the emergence and persistence of diseases is essential to reduce disease risk in human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41a">Roche and Guégan, 2011</xref>).</p><p>An illustrative example is the case of <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic> (<italic>MU</italic>), an environmentally persistent microorganism associated to freshwater ecosystems in tropical countries and present in a large variety of aquatic hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benbow et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marion et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garchitorena et al., 2014</xref>). From a public health perspective, <italic>MU</italic> is the agent responsible for Buruli ulcer (BU), a devastating skin disease with great health and socio-economic consequences in tropical and subtropical countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">WHO, 2008</xref>). Emergence, distribution, and risk factors for BU in many parts of the world are associated with stagnant and slow-flowing ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jacobsen and Padgett, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marion et al., 2011</xref>). The environmental factors that favour <italic>MU</italic> persistence and transmission within these ecosystems are still poorly understood but the environmental and multi-host nature of the pathogen suggests that its environmental dynamics can be the result of a complex interplay between environmental factors and biotic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garchitorena et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morris et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p><italic>MU</italic> is broadly present across taxa in aquatic communities over space and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benbow et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marion et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garchitorena et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that a multiplicity of hosts can play a role in <italic>MU</italic> persistence in the environment. Biotic interactions between hosts are thought to be a pathogen transmission route between organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merritt et al., 2010</xref>), with <italic>MU</italic> being integrated in the aquatic community from the environment thanks to filter feeder, herbivorous, and scavenger organisms and then transmitted across the community through predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marsollier et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mosi et al., 2008</xref>). As a result, community-level factors such as biodiversity or abundance of aquatic organisms could drive the environmental load of <italic>MU</italic> through amplification or dilution effects, as demonstrated for other pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ezenwa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Suzán et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keesing et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, some keystone species could play an overwhelming role in the transmission and overall <italic>MU</italic> prevalence in host communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roche et al., 2013a</xref>).</p><p>Some specific water conditions, physical or chemical, could also favour <italic>MU</italic> environmental persistence and dynamics in aquatic ecosystems. <italic>MU</italic> seems to grow better under laboratory conditions with low oxygen, high temperature, and mildly acidic <italic>pH</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Portaels and Pattyn, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Palomino and Portaels, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palomino et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dega et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marsollier et al., 2004</xref>). Genomic studies show that <italic>MU</italic> is sensitive to UV light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stinear et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doig et al., 2012</xref>) so turbid or protected environments could promote <italic>MU</italic> persistence. Many of these conditions are generally met in swamps and other stagnant and slow-flowing ecosystems, and therefore, if optimal abiotic conditions are met, <italic>MU</italic> could grow and persist in these ecosystems as free-living stages in the water and infect aquatic organisms directly, without the need for a trophic transmission to take place. Besides, numerous abiotic factors within aquatic ecosystems can influence host community structures and assemblages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eric Benbow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garchitorena et al., 2014</xref>), since aquatic invertebrate and vertebrate taxa have different ranges of optimal water conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dickens and Graham, 2002</xref>). This could represent an indirect influence of abiotic conditions on <italic>MU</italic> transmission within aquatic communities.</p><p>A direct transmission of <italic>MU</italic> driven mostly by abiotic factors and a trophic transmission driven by biological interactions are not two mutually exclusive routes but rather could complement each other to allow persistence of <italic>MU</italic> under a wide range of environments. Identifying the contribution of such transmission routes requires a deep understanding of the dynamics of <italic>MU</italic> within aquatic communities through space and time. A recent characterization of <italic>MU</italic> dynamics with unprecedented detail in two BU endemic areas with very distinct environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garchitorena et al., 2014</xref>) offers the variability needed to address this question. Indeed, in Bankim, a region located in a transition zone between forest and savannah, swamps had remarkably higher <italic>MU</italic> positivity, as initially expected, whereas in Akonolinga, where rainforest is the prevailing landscape, all ecosystems had similar <italic>MU</italic> positivity. These regional differences suggested that savannah swamps had unique favourable conditions for <italic>MU</italic> that were not found elsewhere, but <italic>MU</italic> was still able to persist in unfavourable environments. Furthermore, temporal fluctuations in <italic>MU</italic> presence in Akonolinga suggested a potential role of seasonal climatic events as drivers of <italic>MU</italic> dynamics.</p><p>Relying on this work, the aim of this paper is to study for the first time the contribution of ecological factors, both biotic and abiotic, to the dynamics of <italic>MU</italic> in the aquatic environment. More specifically, we attempt to identify a set of abiotic conditions that could be optimal for <italic>MU</italic> growth and allow direct transmission to aquatic organisms, likely in stagnant waters and, in the absence of these, explore which biotic factors could still allow <italic>MU</italic> to persist, potentially through trophic transmission. Insights into the ecological mechanisms allowing for <italic>MU</italic> growth and persistence over space and time, while accounting for the potential impact of seasonal climatic events, may have profound implications for understanding BU risk to human populations.</p><p>To address these questions, we model <italic>MU</italic> positivity in 32 aquatic communities over time with generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), including all relevant seasonal, abiotic, and biotic factors as fixed effects. We use cutting-edge multi-model selection procedures and information theory to identify and quantify the most important predictors of <italic>MU</italic> dynamics, using a genetic algorithm to screen multiple models from all potential combinations of explanatory variables and making inference from a set of weighted best-performing models. In addition, we back the results of this novel approach, which deals with the uncertainty associated with model selection, by comparing them to those obtained by classical model selection procedures. We then discuss the implications of disentangling biotic and abiotic factors for host/parasite interactions and the importance of rigorously analysing the underlying drivers of pathogen dynamics mediated through complex and different-scale processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>By simultaneously accounting for multiple seasonal, abiotic, and biotic factors, our results show the complex interplay that drives <italic>MU</italic> environmental dynamics. In a previous step to the statistical modelling of <italic>MU</italic> positivity, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) of the most relevant physico-chemical characteristics in the water, as a means to explore common patterns in the ecosystems and to include these PCs as alternative abiotic predictors in the model. The ecosystems sampled and followed up in both Akonolinga and Bankim regions consistently revealed common physico-chemical patterns depending on water flow (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The first PC, explaining about 50% of variation in aquatic ecosystems in both regions, showed a positive correlation between water flow, dissolved oxygen, and <italic>pH</italic>, while temperature was inversely correlated. Furthermore, the inverse correlation between temperature and water flow held in the second PC, and the positive correlation between water flow and oxygen was also present in the third PC. Using multi-model selection for our GLMMs, a combination of seasonal factors, water conditions (abiotic factors), and community-level characteristics (biotic factors) remained as important predictors of <italic>MU</italic> positivity in the final set of best models for Akonolinga (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) and Bankim (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Among all possible models tested, 39 were selected for estimation of model average estimates in Akonolinga and 100 in Bankim, since these models were similarly performing according to their Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) scores (see the methodology section). Although all factors were included together as part of the full model, the results explained below are divided in groups of factors for clarity.

This suggests that seasonal fluctuations in <italic>MU</italic> presence might be directly related to climatic pressures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Indeed, while the seasonal effect is not directly linked to rainfall dynamics (Pearson's correlation test, p = 0.45), it is highly correlated with the 3-month mean rainfall accumulation in the region (Current month, plus two previous months; Pearson's correlation test, p &lt; 0.01). As a result, we propose that the cumulative effect of rainfall over several months, increasing water levels in the environment either boosts <italic>MU</italic> growth or washes it off from other environmental matrices (mud, soil, plants) to aquatic ecosystems, as previously suggested from epidemiological evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morris et al., 2014</xref>).

Unfortunately, the less frequent sampling in Bankim (only 4 months instead of 12) may have prevented to capture seasonal variations appropriately, explaining the lack of associations with <italic>MU</italic> in this region.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07616.006</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Link between the seasonal effect for <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> and the rainfall dynamics in Akonolinga.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Represents the monthly values for the seasonal effect (red), the mean rainfall for the period under study and the 3-month cumulative rainfall (blue).

Indeed, <italic>pH</italic> range for slow-growing mycobacteria has been estimated between 5.8 and 6.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Portaels and Pattyn, 1982</xref>), which corresponds to the lower range of <italic>pH</italic> in Bankim, associated with stagnant waters.

Less abundant communities are associated with a reduction of <italic>MU</italic> in this region, and individual taxa have an independent effect on <italic>MU</italic>. Higher relative abundance of aquatic snails (Gastropoda), shrimps (Decapoda), water bugs (Hemiptera), and tadpoles (Anura) is associated with reduced <italic>MU</italic> prevalence in the aquatic community. The protective role of aquatic snails is supported by experimental infections, where <italic>MU</italic> has been unable to grow within these organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marsollier and Sévérin, 2004</xref>), but this is not the case for Hemipteran water bugs, where <italic>MU</italic> can grow and even colonize their salivary glands after they have fed on infected prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marsollier et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mosi et al., 2008</xref>). Even though water bugs can host <italic>MU</italic> and allow its growth, they are voracious predators of aquatic organisms, and therefore, an increase in water bugs in the community may result in a decrease of infected prey available to other predators such as Coleoptera or Odonata; this could result in an overall reduction in <italic>MU</italic> positivity. This is an example of how considering the full breadth of factors taking place in real ecological systems can provide unexpected insights on this type of host–pathogen interactions. Furthermore, differences in community composition may partly explain the different effects of biotic factors in the two regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>). Total abundance in aquatic communities was significantly higher in Akonolinga (Mann–Whitney test, p &lt; 0.001), and the relative abundance of more than half of the taxa included in our model was significantly different between Akonolinga and Bankim (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>, section 2).</p><p>These different distributions of biotic and abiotic factors can nevertheless yield a hypothesis to explain the contrasting results between the two regions. Indeed, two transmission routes, not competitively exclusive, may coexist for <italic>MU</italic> colonization of aquatic organisms, through a trophic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roche et al., 2013a</xref>) and/or a pathogen transmission through infection with free-living stages present in favourable aquatic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merritt et al., 2010</xref>). In our study, community abundance has opposite effects in Akonolinga and Bankim, while water flow and <italic>pH</italic> suggest contrasted influence of stagnant waters in these regions. These results could suggest that the prevailing transmission modes could be different within these two environmentally distinct regions. Transmission could be mainly environmentally mediated in Bankim, since stagnant waters, through weak water flows and optimal physico-chemical conditions, are strongly associated with <italic>MU</italic> presence. Furthermore, a lack of association of <italic>MU</italic> abundance with specific taxa in addition to strong positive associations with host diversity and abundance under these favourable conditions, suggests that infection probability in these environments is density dependent, a characteristic feature of this type of transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Codeço, 2001</xref>). Conversely, in Akonolinga, trophic transmission may be expected since optimal abiotic conditions are not met in stagnant ecosystems, and host abundance has a negative impact on <italic>MU</italic> presence, suggesting that presence of some taxa, at least Gastropoda and Hemiptera, can limit transmission in aquatic communities. These alternative transmission routes proposed for <italic>MU</italic> to persist and thrive in aquatic ecosystems could partly explain why BU distribution in humans is greatly associated with stagnant ecosystems but expands over larger geographical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jacobsen and Padgett, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marion et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our results demonstrate the complex interplay between abiotic and biotic factors driving the dynamics of multi-host/multi-environment diseases. By studying and comparing savannah- and rainforest-like regions, we provide a comprehensive ecological picture of <italic>MU</italic>, that is, a unified framework that reconciles the many contrasting findings observed during the last decade that could apply to a broader geographical area in the tropics and could help us understand the risk of BU for human populations. This study provides a new illustration of emerging infectious diseases for which further investigations looking for a ‘bigger picture’ are clearly needed in order to cope with the complexity of local and regional environmental situations, and different-scale processes. Judging by the number and importance of multi-host and environmentally persistent pathogens in the total number of emerging infectious diseases appeared in the last four decades such hypotheses deserve to be rigorously tested across multiple epidemiological systems and diverse local conditions. More comprehensive environmental studies in other contexts are needed to assess the generalizability of our findings.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Environmental data collection</title><p>Data were collected as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garchitorena et al.

This approach allows exploring a comprehensive set of potential models obtained as a result of multiple combinations of the explanatory variables. Instead of considering a unique final model, as is the case in classical forward, backward, or stepwise model selection procedures, with multi-model selection, it is possible to identify a set of ‘top models’ that can be ranked and weighted according to information criteria such as AIC. Model averaging within this set of top models provides quantitative measures of each variable's relative importance (Akaike Weights, <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) and allows obtaining robust parameter estimates and addressing the uncertainty associated with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burnham and Anderson, 2002</xref>). This methodology can be particularly appropriate in the study of complex ecological systems, where multiple interactions take place, and the interest is in finding strong and consistent predictors of a particular outcome. In our study, variables with a relative importance (<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) larger than 0.8 in these sets of best models and with consistent sign (positive or negative) within the CI were considered to have strong support as predictors of <italic>MU</italic> positivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calcagno, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Multi-model selection of GLMMs generated with the package ‘lme4’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1a">Bates et al., 2013</xref>) was performed using the package ‘GLMulti’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calcagno, 2013</xref>) in R statistical software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">R Development Core Team, 2011</xref>), which uses a genetic algorithm to improve the efficiency of model selection.

We also transformed water flow into a categorical variable with three levels, stagnant (0 m/s), lentic (0–0.1 m/s), and lotic (&gt;0.1 m/s). In addition to their individual effect, since several water characteristics correlate and define specific environments, we performed a PCA (using the correlation matrix) on the most relevant physico-chemical parameters (water flow, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and <italic>pH</italic>), and the loadings of the three PCs were included in the analysis as explanatory variables in order to remove the co-linearity between them.

To study community composition, we calculated total abundance and Shannon index (at the taxonomic order level) for each aquatic community. Relative abundance of each aquatic taxon (taxon abundance/total abundance) was also included. Since total and relative abundance of aquatic taxa were Poisson distributed, these were log transformed to avoid problems related to the skewness of variable distributions. Furthermore, the less abundant aquatic taxa (with more than 40% zero values) were introduced as dichotomous variables, and we removed the very rare taxa (with more than 90% zero values; essentially Plecoptera and Bivalvia). Semi-aquatic or terrestrial taxa collected during the aquatic sampling (Lepidoptera, Araneae, Collembola) were not included either, since they are not likely to play an important role in the aquatic community. Finally, the taxon Cladocera, with more than 5% missing values, was also discarded.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Roger Kamgang and Joachim Ossomba at Centre Pasteur du Cameroun for their contribution to the data collection and Jérémie Babonneau and Myriam Benhalima at INSERM for their contribution to the molecular analysis of samples.

As a result, this approach and its results for each region are described in the main text. In this section, we describe the methodology and results of additional analyses using a classical forward–backward selection approach. We demonstrate that this selection procedure gives comparable results to those from the multi-model selection described in the main text.</p><sec id="s6-1"><title>Methodology</title><p>A combination of backward and forward procedures based on Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC) and likelihood ratio tests was used to select the final multivariate model. Firstly, all variables were tested individually as fixed effects in univariate binomial regressions with the site of collection as random effect. Those variables showing a significant effect were retained for an initial multivariate model. A backward procedure was then applied on this initial model in order to select, one by one, the variables that did not significantly improve the model (based on likelihood ratio tests) and, among these, we dropped those variables that resulted in the model with the lowest AIC. Secondly, a forward procedure was carried out by adding to this reduced model, one by one, all variables that significantly improved the model (likelihood ratio test) and, among those, those that resulted in the model with the lowest AIC. At each step, we checked whether the addition of the new variable made others insignificant, in which case, we dropped those variables from the model. The final model was obtained when no significant improvement could be achieved with the addition of new variables. Violation of model assumptions was checked in the final models. Colinearity was assessed through graphical exploration of explanatory variables, correlation tests, and variance inflation factors (VIF) in the final model. Independence was assessed by studying the spatial (correlograms) and temporal correlation (cross-correlations) of the model residuals.</p></sec><sec id="s6-2"><title>Multivariate results</title><p>Similarly to the results obtained with multi-model selection, a combination of seasonal factors, water conditions, and community composition remained in the final models for Akonolinga and Bankim (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Appendix table 1</xref>). Firstly, the effect of seasonality remained for Akonolinga after accounting for water parameters and biological factors. Secondly, regarding water conditions, <italic>pH</italic> had a significant positive effect on <italic>MU</italic> presence in Akonolinga, whereas in Bankim the negative effect of water flow was evident, with lotic ecosystems being the least positive, followed by lentic ones, which had significantly lower positivity than stagnant ecosystems. Finally, the effect of aquatic communities through total abundance was significant and inversely correlated with <italic>MU</italic> in Akonolinga, while in Bankim Shannon's diversity showed a positive correlation with <italic>MU</italic> presence. Individual taxa that remained significant and inversely correlated with <italic>MU</italic> were Gastropoda, Decapoda, Hemiptera and Anura for Akonolinga; and Ephemeroptera, fish, Diptera and Anura for Bankim. The only taxon positively correlated with <italic>MU</italic> in the final model was Hirudinea in Akonolinga and Coleoptera for Bankim. In summary, the results obtained from multi-model selection and classical model selection procedures were qualitatively and quantitatively similar.<table-wrap id="tbl5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07616.011</object-id><label>Appendix table 1.</label><caption><p>Results of multivariate analyses for Akonolinga (12 months of sampling) and Bankim (4 months of sampling)</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07616.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07616.011</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Variable</th><th colspan="3">Akonolinga (n = 183)</th><th colspan="3">Bankim (n = 61)</th></tr><tr><th>Effect</th><th>Std. error</th><th>p-value</th><th>Effect</th><th>Std. error</th><th>p-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Model AIC</td><td>400.7</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>182.7</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Variance of random effect</td><td>0.20</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>1.77</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>(Intercept)</td><td>−12.56</td><td>4.40</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>−7.40</td><td>1.97</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7">Seasonality</td></tr><tr><td> Sine(2pi*Month/12)</td><td>0.34</td><td>0.14</td><td>0.02</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> Sine(2pi*Month/4)</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> Cos(2pi*Month/12)</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> Cos(2pi*Month/4)</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7">Physico-chemical parameters</td></tr><tr><td> Temperature</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> <italic>pH</italic></td><td>8.63</td><td>2.44</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> Dissolved oxygen</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> Conductivity</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> Iron</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> Water flow (Lentic)</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>−2.10</td><td>0.47</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td> Water flow (Lotic)</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>−3.18</td><td>0.69</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7">Physico-chemical parameters (PCA)</td></tr><tr><td> PC1</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> PC2</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> PC3</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7">Community</td></tr><tr><td> Abundance</td><td>−0.64</td><td>0.17</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> Shannon</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>4.16</td><td>0.97</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7">Orders (%)</td></tr><tr><td> Fish</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>−1.62</td><td>0.35</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td> Anura</td><td>−0.34</td><td>0.14</td><td>0.02</td><td>−0.84</td><td>0.32</td><td>0.01</td></tr><tr><td> Gastropoda</td><td>−0.64</td><td>0.16</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> Decapoda (presence)</td><td>−1.37</td><td>0.37</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> Odonata</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> Ephemeroptera</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>−0.94</td><td>0.21</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td> Hemiptera</td><td>−0.47</td><td>0.20</td><td>0.02</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> Tricoptera</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> Oligochaeta (presence)</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> Hirudinea (presence)</td><td>0.59</td><td>0.23</td><td>0.01</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> Coleoptera</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td> Diptera</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>1.08</td><td>0.36</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td> Hydracarine</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>−1.58</td><td>0.49</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>The models used are Binomial regressions with random effect site, selected with forward–backwards procedure (see section 1 for details).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="appendix"><title>Section 2: differences in communities in Akonolinga and Bankim</title><p>In the main text, we justify the different results obtained for Akonolinga and Bankim partly based on differences between the two regions, both in terms of physico-chemical parameters and community composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

It is however important to unravel the multiple pathways and relative contributions of each to informing, customising and targeting interventions. The authors took advantage of a combination of large environmental datasets on <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic> (<italic>MU</italic>) to characterize abiotic and biotic factors driving the dynamics of this pathogen in two different regions of Cameroon. <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> is an environmentally persistent microorganism associated to freshwater ecosystems and present in a large variety of aquatic hosts and from a public health perspective, it is the agent responsible for Buruli ulcer (BU), a devastating skin disease with great health and socio-economic consequences in tropical and subtropical countries. They were able to identify abiotic and biotic drivers that may promote or block MU transmission in aquatic communities in two climatically distinct regions of Cameroon through a comprehensive multi-model selection procedure. They demonstrate regional differences in transmission dynamics that is influenced by seasonality, pH, rate of water flow, density of biotic and abiotic systems thereby advancing our understanding of underlying ecological mechanisms driving the emergence and persistence of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>. These findings are by no means definitive and would require additional studies to validate these findings. Notwithstanding this limitation in the context of an upsurge in the emergence and re-emergence of multiple infectious diseases identifying main drivers of host–parasite interactions particularly those associated with pathology and have public health implications these types of endeavours are critically important. The findings are novel and the approach used is a mix of classical model selection procedures with cutting-edge new selection methods to identify and quantify the most important predictors of <italic>MU</italic> dynamics. The authors are very careful and considered in their discussion of the implications of separating out the contributions of biotic and abiotic factors for host/parasite interactions and the importance of rigorously analysing the underlying drivers of transmission dynamics mediated through complex and diverse processes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>While in general I find this a very clear manuscript, with well-conceived and executed science, and very well described, clear, and reasonable statistical methods, I feel the paper does lack a strong take home message.</p><p>Something that could help here would be advancing the comparative rationale between the two major locations (Akonolinga and Bankim) and setting that up in the Introduction. The results seem quite different between the two sites, and there seem to be good biological reasons for this, but we don't really find that out until the Discussion.</p><p>Another question is how can these results from two specific sites be understood to generalize to a broader area, and help provide a broader understanding of <italic>MU</italic> risk and/or mitigation strategies. Again, I think if the comparison was more strongly setup in the Introduction, this might help.</p><p>Lastly, I think the authors really need to decide what the take home message is, and make sure they close the loop on this. Right now this is a bit of a muddled message about abiotic and biotic factors mattering depending on location, and while likely true, that message doesn't provide any insight or predictive value.</p><p>There seems to be a more specific conclusion that a certain <italic>pH</italic> range, which was important in the lab, is also found to be important in the field. Even in the specifics, the conclusions are a bit muddled with hydrologic regime and community being important, but not in a cross site way. Again some sort of comparative setup that helps create some generalizability would be useful here.</p><p><italic>Additional data files and statistical comments:</italic></p><p>I found the rigor and extent of the statistical information supplied to be commendably high.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I find this to be an interesting and substantive work that attempts to better understand the roles of climatic factors as well as other biotic factors</p><p>in the persistence and transmission of <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic> (<italic>MU</italic>).</p><p>The paper uses extensive data collected in two endemic areas in Cameroon (Akonolinga and Bankim), and a series of statistical/data analysis tools to</p><p>explore these questions.</p><p>Although the data are described in their previous work, this paper focuses on using a suite of statistical tools to explore the role of environmental and biotic factors: a clear strength of the paper. Through the use of these methods in two different locations, the authors uncover interestingly different dynamics in the two sites:</p><p>In Akonolinga, TU persisted in less abundant aquatic communities, and showed seasonal pattern, whereas in Bankin, TU persisted in diverse and abundant communities, and showed no seasonal pattern. This has enabled the authors to propose several interesting hypotheses: The role of biotic interactions, <italic>pH</italic> level, and two-transmission routes.</p><p>My main comments concern making the paper more accessible and compelling.</p><p>1) The paper could be made more accessible by motivating the use of each of the statistical methods used in the paper. In particular, before carrying out a test, it would useful for the readers to have an expectation of what question a particular method is testing. The paper uses many of them, making it somewhat confusing to follow results from all of them. It would also be useful to have a better sense of what value a specific test is bringing in the context of the questions.</p><p>2) The authors propose several hypotheses that could explain the patterns observed in the data, particularly the difference seen in the two sites. These are all compelling, but somewhat difficult to follow in the Discussion. This is particularly true for the hypothesis with two transmission routes, and the hypothesis concerning the biotic interaction. I would urge the authors to organize this better, and discuss whether the hypotheses are mutually exclusive, or whether are inter-related.</p><p>Overall, I find the paper rich (in terms of the use of data and methods), rigorous (in terms of different use of statistical methods), and compelling/interesting (particularly, with regards to interesting hypotheses the authors were able to pose).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07616.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) As this is a complex manuscript with many outcomes kindly provide a key message(s) for the reader.</italic></p><p><italic>[…] There seems to be a more specific conclusion that a certain</italic> pH <italic>range, which was important in the lab, is also found to be important in the field.

Following the suggestion of the reviewer #2, we have better explained the rationale behind the potential transmission routes, and used the regional differences between the two regions from the Introduction section to illustrate the potential contributions of each transmission route in each region depending on abiotic conditions:</p><p>“A direct transmission of <italic>MU</italic>, driven mostly by abiotic factors […] may have profound implications for understanding BU risk to human populations.”</p><p>The manuscript has therefore been organized around the following take home message: we identify a set of abiotic conditions that could be optimal for <italic>MU</italic> growth and could imply a direct transmission to aquatic organisms in stagnant waters; and in the absence of these, notably because of too acidic <italic>pH</italic> in rainforest swamps, biotic interactions still allow <italic>MU</italic> to persist through trophic transmission.</p><p>The Discussion has also been modified accordingly, explaining better the implications of our results for these two transmission routes and better organizing the flow of the Discussion to separate the sections around abiotic and biotic factors, instead of discussing them together in the same paragraphs. We have also linked the key findings of the study to the potential implications in terms of risk for human populations and make an effort to improve generalizability of our results to similar geographical regions:</p><p>“Transmission could be mainly environmentally-mediated in Bankim […] and could help us understand the risk of BU for human populations.”</p><p><italic>2) The manuscript tests multiple hypotheses – structure the Methods and Results section so that approach and results for each hypothesis being tested can be tracked easily by the reader</italic>. <italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>The paper could be made more accessible by motivating the use of each of the statistical methods used in the paper.

We have restructured the Results section to explain separately the three groups of factors (seasonal, abiotic, and biotic), instead of separating them by region. We also provide a short background of what is being tested in each case before explaining the results obtained. In addition, we have expanded the Materials and methods section to explain the hypothesis being tested for each of these three groups of factors and the expected results before explaining how they were tested in the models. This can now be found as a separate part of the data analysis subsection called “Hypotheses and use of variables”.</p><p>Materials and methods, Results and Discussion sections now follow the same logical order (seasonality, then abiotic and then biotic factors), which we hope will improve the clarity for the reader and will make it easier to track hypotheses, tests, results and implications for each of these factors through the different sections of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) The statistical approach is novel and an explanation or rationale for the choice of methods will be useful to help readers understand the decision making processes better</italic>.</p><p>We thank the referees for allowing us to better explain the novel methodological approach used and the rationale that brought us to use it. Indeed, we feel that multi-model inference could be an appropriate alternative to overcome some of the limitations of classical selection approaches, especially when studying complex ecological systems. We have expanded the explanation of this method and its advantages in the corresponding part of the Materials and methods section, multi-model selection and inference:</p><p>“Multi-model inference is increasingly recognised as an alternative approach […] the interest is in finding strong and consistent predictors of a particular outcome.”</p><p>In addition, we have added a short summary of the approach rationale in the last paragraph of the Introduction section in order to help the reader understand the decision for the choice of method from the beginning of the article:</p><p>“[…] We use cutting-edge multi-model selection procedures and information theory to identify and quantify the most important predictors of <italic>MU</italic> dynamics, using a genetic algorithm to screen multiple models from all potential combinations of explanatory variables and making inference from a set of weighted best performing models. In addition, we back the results of this novel approach, which deals with the uncertainty associated with model selection, by comparing them to those obtained by classical model selection procedures.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
