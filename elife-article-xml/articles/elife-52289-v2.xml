Whether separate strongly interacting circuits exhibit traveling waves remains unknown. The hippocampus exhibits traveling ‘theta’ waves and interacts strongly with the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). To determine whether the MEC also activates in a traveling wave, we performed extracellular recordings of local field potentials (LFP) and multi-unit activity along the MEC. These recordings revealed progressive phase shifts in activity, indicating that the MEC also activates in a traveling wave. Variation in theta waveform along the region, generated by gradients in local physiology, contributed to the observed phase shifts. Removing waveform-related phase shifts left significant residual phase shifts. The residual phase shifts covaried with theta frequency in a manner consistent with those generated by weakly coupled oscillators. These results show that the coordination of anatomically distributed circuits could be enabled by traveling waves but reveal heterogeneity in the mechanisms generating those waves.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>theta oscillations</kwd><kwd>memory circuits</kwd><kwd>weakly coupled oscillators</kwd><kwd>waveform</kwd><kwd>entorhinal cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001391</institution-id><institution>Whitehall Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>Ehren L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003141</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>232364</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hernández-Pérez</surname><given-names>Jesus J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006733</institution-id><institution>Indiana University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>Ehren L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders provided resources for the study design, data collection, and interpretation.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The existence of traveling waves in the medial entorhinal cortex, like those observed in the hippocampus, supports the hypothesis that traveling waves coordinate the activity of anatomically distributed circuits.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The recent recognition that numerous cortical circuits exhibit traveling waves when engaged motivates the hypothesis that traveling waves are a basic organizing principle of cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muller et al., 2018</xref>). By this hypothesis, traveling waves generate macroscopic activation dynamics that coordinate interaction between anatomically distributed circuits. It remains to be shown, however, whether anatomically distributed circuits generate the coordinated activation dynamics using traveling waves as predicted by this hypothesis. To date, traveling waves have only been observed in isolated circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van Ede et al., 2015</xref>). The hippocampus, for example, has been established to activate in a traveling wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang and Jacobs, 2015</xref>). It is unknown, however, whether the entorhinal cortex, an anatomically separated area but one that is highly inter-connected with the hippocampus, also activates in a traveling wave. A goal of this work was to test whether the entorhinal cortex, like the hippocampus, activates in a traveling wave.</p><p>Hippocampal activity exhibits traveling waves that have been hypothesized to contribute to the functionality of the circuit. An ~8 Hz ‘theta’ rhythm is readily observed at individual electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grastyán et al., 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kahana et al., 1999</xref>) and comparison of theta activity across electrodes reveals progressive theta phase shifts between the dorsal/septal and the ventral/temporal poles of the hippocampus in humans and rats alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang and Jacobs, 2015</xref>). Theta activity is well studied in terms of its underlying physiology (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dickson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vinogradova, 1995</xref>). Functionally, theta activity is attributed with supporting navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blair et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgess et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hasselmo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Newman and Hasselmo, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Onslow et al., 2014</xref>), mediating associational learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caplan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hasselmo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hernández-Pérez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hernández-Pérez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Honey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Norman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patel et al., 2012</xref>), and coordinating the distinct components of the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizuseki et al., 2009</xref>). These proposed functions are not mutually exclusive. Yet, for each function, entorhinal input to the hippocampus must arrive at a specific theta phase locally within the hippocampus. Because theta phase varies along the hippocampus, we hypothesize that theta phase also varies along the entorhinal cortex to form a traveling wave.</p><p>The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), like the hippocampus, exhibits clear extracellular field theta rhythms at individual electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mitchell and Ranck, 1980</xref>). Simultaneous recordings of theta activity in dorsal MEC and dorsal hippocampus reveal a stable phase offset between these areas in terms of theta phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mitchell and Ranck, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizuseki et al., 2009</xref>), consistent with the idea that theta activity facilitates interaction between these areas. Recordings performed across the layers of MEC at a single position along the dorsal-ventral axis show that theta activity is largely synchronous in layers III-V and reverses phase between layers III and I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mitchell and Ranck, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso and García-Austt, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizuseki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Quilichini et al., 2010</xref>). It is unknown, however, whether theta phase varies systematically along the dorsal-ventral axis of the MEC, reflecting the existence of a traveling wave.</p><p>Traveling waves, as we use this term here, are spatiotemporal oscillations with steady phase shifts as a function of space, consistent with the previous use of this term to describe phase offsets in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang and Jacobs, 2015</xref>). Multiple mechanisms are capable of generating steady phase shifts, including variable waveform asymmetries, propagating pulses in an excitable network, delayed excitations from a single oscillator, and weakly coupled oscillators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cole and Voytek, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ermentrout and Kleinfeld, 2001</xref>). Weakly coupled oscillators have been shown to be more likely to underlie hippocampal traveling theta waves than propagating pulses or delayed excitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang and Jacobs, 2015</xref>). The contribution of waveform asymmetry to hippocampal traveling theta waves, however, has not been explicitly explored.</p><p>Here, we aimed to establish whether traveling waves exist in the MEC and to identify the nature of the underlying mechanism. To do so, we used custom high-density electrode arrays to record the field potential at regular intervals along the dorsal-ventral axis of the MEC in freely behaving rats. Our recordings revealed reliable phase shifts across the dorsal-ventral extent of the MEC, indicating the existence of traveling waves. Further analyses of these recordings revealed that much of the phase shift was generated by systematic variation in waveform asymmetry and that the residual shifts resembled those generated by weakly coupled oscillators.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Theta phase shifts gradually across the dorsal-ventral axis of the MEC</title><p>To determine whether there is a traveling wave in the MEC, we used custom high-density electrode arrays to record extracellular field potentials at regular intervals along the dorsoventral axis of MEC while the rats completed laps on a circle track for food rewards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

The phase offset between any two channels was relatively stable over the duration of the recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and E</xref>) given the median phase locking observed between sites of 0.90 [0.85–0.95]. The strength of phase locking (i.e., mean resultant length) decreased modestly but reliably as a function of the distance between the electrodes (slope of −0.067/mm ± 0.011; rank sum [max]=0 [21], p<italic>=</italic>0.03, n=6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Theta coherence across the MEC was 0.73 [0.66–0.81]. Coherence also decreased as a function of the distance between electrode pairs (slope: 0.067/mm ± 0.018; rank sum [max]=21 [21], p<italic>=</italic>0.03, n=6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and F</xref>). These patterns are consistent with previously reported shifts in theta phase and coherence across the long axis of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patel et al., 2012</xref>).

This enabled comparison of theta phase differences along versus across the layers of MEC. The positions of individual electrodes were fixed relative to those of other electrodes in the arrays, so that the displacement for each electrode pair with respect to axes running parallel to (i.e., along) the layers of MEC and perpendicular to (i.e., across) the layers was known. For each electrode pair, we plotted the observed theta phase shift as a function of the displacement along one axis or the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>). Phase shift was positively correlated with displacement ‘along the cell layer’ (rho = 0.58) but not with displacement ‘across the layers’ (rho = 0.02). From this, we conclude that the phase shifts observed along the dorsal-ventral axis were not due to variable placement across the layers of MEC. The lack of evidence of clear phase shifts resulting from variable placement of the electrodes across the layers of the MEC is consistent with prior reports that there are no phase offsets across layers III–V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mitchell and Ranck, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso and García-Austt, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizuseki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Quilichini et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Progressive theta phase shift expressed along layers but not across layers in MEC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Custom multi-shank electrode array with tips positioned to allow simultaneous recording along and across the cortical layers of the MEC.

To do so, the electrodes were moved from layer III, where theta is clearly visible in the LFP but units are sparse, to layer II, where units are densely packed to facilitate recording of multi-unit activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We then asked whether the timing of multi-unit activity mirrored that of the field potential. In three animals, clear multiunit activity was observable simultaneously across four or more of the channels, enabling us to test for reliable delays between sites. The multiunit activity exhibited clear theta-rhythmicity as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mitchell and Ranck, 1980</xref>). The amplitude envelope of the 600–3000 Hz spiking-band activity showed a progressive phase shift across channels, resembling that which we observed in the theta field potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Computing the cross-correlogram of the amplitude envelope between each channel and the dorsal-most channel showed that multiunit activity also generated a traveling wave with a lag consistent with a 33.20°/mm ± 2.69°/mm phase shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>).

Such phase- dependent differences are washed out when theta phase is estimated by filtering the signal down to the theta-band and applying the Hilbert transform. The Hilbert transform was used in the preceding analyses to match the methods used previously in order to characterize the hippocampal traveling theta wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patel et al., 2012</xref>). Critically, however, previous work did not consider the impact of varying waveform asymmetry on the observed phase shifts. To address the asymmetry here, we used waveform-based methods of deriving estimates of theta phase using established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cole and Voytek, 2017</xref>). We then computed the median time for specific identifiable portions of the waveform (peak, falling phase, trough, and rising phase) to shift 1 mm along the dorsal-ventral axis, and we report this as the conduction delay (see 'Materials and methods' for discussion of this quantity).</p><p>We found that the conduction delay was shortest for the falling phase (5.47 ms/mm [2.87–8.70]) and greatest for the peak to travel from dorsal sites to ventral sites (12.00 ms/mm [6.52–14.43]) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. These conduction delays differed significantly (rank sum [max]=0 [21], p=0.03, n=6). The conduction delay increased at a rate of 0.02 (ms/mm)/deg [0.017–0.025] between the falling phase and the peak, a relationship that was fit well by a linear trendline (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.82; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To compare the observed phase-dependent differences in conduction delay to the phase shift found using the Hilbert-transform-based approach described above, we converted these lags to degrees assuming an 8 Hz (125 ms period) theta rhythm. The converted phase shifts varied from 15.38°/mm [8.27–25.06] to 34.56°/mm [17.78–41.56] between the falling phase and peak phase, respectively. As expected given the phase smoothing that occurs during the filtering step of the Hilbert-based phase estimation approach, the phase shift estimate derived from the Hilbert-based approach(~26°/mm) falls between these limits (see dotted gray line on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results show that theta is most synchronized during the falling phase and becomes progressively more desynchronized across phases until the peak of theta.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The conduction delay for theta to travel along the dorsal-ventral axis depends upon which phase is used as a reference point.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative example of LFP.

To do so, the conduction delay between the first and each of the other channels that was attributable to varying asymmetry was calculated on the basis of the difference in the asymmetry index between these channels (see 'Materials and methods'). These calculations revealed that the conduction delay due to varying asymmetry was 3.56 ms/mm [5.89–1.56] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and D</xref>).

This raised the question of what mechanism, beyond the waveform asymmetry, could account for the apparent phase shifts. We sought to differentiate between two mechanisms in particular, weakly coupled-oscillators vs. fixed-delay propagation. These mechanisms make distinct, contrasting, predictions regarding how phase differences between electrodes should vary as a function of theta frequency. Because the delay in a fixed-delay propagation mechanism is fixed, the delays observed across electrodes (i.e. absolute delays) should not vary as a function of theta frequency. By contrast, normalizing the absolute delays to reflect what percentage of the cycle period the observed delay accounts for, in order to generate a ‘relative delay,’ should reveal an increasing relative delay as theta frequency increases and the period length decreases. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>. Coupled-oscillators, on the other hand, exhibit absolute delays that change as a function of theta frequency changes. This happens in the coupled-oscillator model because changes in theta frequency occur across a set of oscillators that are hypothesized to be distributed along the dorsal-ventral axis of the MEC (e.g., resonant neurons receiving a common modulatory input). When these distributed oscillators receive input causing them to increase the frequency of their rhythmic activity, for example, the apparent delays between them will decrease. Accordingly, the observed delays (i.e., absolute delays) should decrease as theta frequency increases. However, because of the coupling, the relative phase alignments should remain largely the same. This causes the relative delays to be invariant across varying theta frequencies. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>. To test between the fixed-delay and coupled-oscillator mechanisms, we examined the asymmetry-corrected data (see 'Materials and methods') to compare how cycle-by-cycle changes in theta frequency were related to either of two types of delays, which we refer to as absolute conduction delays and relative conduction delays.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Residual phase shifts after accounting for varying waveform asymmetries are consistent with the pattern of effects that would be generated by a coupled-oscillator-based mechanism.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of a coupled oscillator mechanism for generating a traveling wave and the associated relationships between theta frequency and either absolute conduction delay or relative conduction delay.

We answered this question by recording at regular intervals along the dorsal-ventral axis of the MEC in freely behaving rats. These recordings showed reliable phase shifts like those described previously to exist along the dorsal-ventral (septal-temporal) axis of the hippocampus. We showed that varying waveform asymmetry contributed to the observed phase offsets and that the remaining phase offsets were consistent with those that would be generated by weakly coupled oscillators.</p><p>The present work adds the MEC to the growing list of circuits recognized to exhibit traveling waves when engaged (for a recent review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muller et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, however, it is also the first work to demonstrate that interacting functionally distinct circuits have matched traveling waves. This is a necessary condition for traveling waves to serve as a basic mechanism for coordinating interactions between distinct circuits. As such, the present work provides empirical support for existing theories regarding the utility of traveling waves in allowing the inherently distributed nervous system to operate as a coherent whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ermentrout and Kleinfeld, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muller et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are neighboring anatomically, the traveling waves observed here are not volume conducted from the hippocampus for a couple of reasons. First, laminar profiles of theta in the MEC demonstrate that theta is generated locally given the existence of a local phase reversal spanning layer II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mitchell and Ranck, 1980</xref>). Second, our analysis of the multi-unit activity distributed along the dorsal-ventral axis of the MEC revealed a phase-delayed sequence of activation that resembled that observed in the field potentials.</p><p>The existence of traveling theta waves in the MEC and hippocampus suggests the possibility of a wide-spread network of brain areas for which graded phase offsets regulate the functional dynamics. The phase gradients observed here, if extrapolated to span the 6–7 mm total length of the MEC would resemble those in the hippocampus. That is, if the ~26°/mm phase gradient that we observed continued along the reported 6–7 mm length of the MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Insausti et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Long et al., 2015</xref>), the total theta phase shift along the MEC would be 158–185°. This is shorter than the ~200–220° phase shift that would be inferred if the 20.3–21.7°/mm phase gradient reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lubenov and Siapas (2009)</xref> continued across the ~10 mm length of the hippocampus. It more closely resembles the ~180° phase shift observed between the septal and temporal poles by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patel et al. (2012)</xref>. The MEC and hippocampus are only two of a broad set of brain areas that exhibit theta rhythmic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>). If each of these areas had similar graded phase offsets, it would facilitate structured functional processing in this distributed circuit. Indeed, prior models of theta function have presupposed such a distributed set of graded phase offsets and have shown that such offsets can afford the related network with adaptive functional properties related to navigation and memory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blair et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgess et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dickson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hasselmo et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Crucial for linking function to physiology is the question of how this traveling wave is generated. We found that a portion of the phase shifts observed across the MEC were related to differences in theta waveform. At dorsal sites, a sawtooth pattern was observed, characterized by a rapid rising phase and a gradual descending phase, whereas at ventral sites, a more sinusoidal pattern was observed. Oscillation waveforms reflect the properties of their underlying physiological generators (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cole and Voytek, 2017</xref>). The waveform changes that we observed across the MEC indicates that the underlying generators vary along the dorsal-ventral axis.</p><p>We hypothesize that the rapid rise of the sawtooth theta pattern observed at dorsal sites reflects an active local current source generated by the recruitment of local fast-spiking feedback inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>). The same feedback inhibition may functionally support the formation of grid cell attractor networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, a prominent type of fast spiking feedback inhibitory neuron, parvalbumin expressing (PV+) interneurons, are distributed across the MEC in a gradient with high densities at dorsal sites and low densities at ventral sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beed et al., 2013</xref>). This distribution matches the anatomical distribution of the saw-tooth waveform pattern observed here and could account for the observed waveform changes.</p><p>Alternatively, the waveform shifts could be related h-channels, which underlie theta generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kocsis and Li, 2004</xref>) in the medial septum and have graded strength along the dorsal-ventral axis of the MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giocomo and Hasselmo, 2009</xref>). H-currents, too, are associated with the generation of grid tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giocomo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giocomo et al., 2011</xref>). Whether inhibitory tone or h-currents, the fact that the same mechanism may underlie generation of the MEC traveling wave and grid cell attractor networks implies a deep functional connection between the traveling wave and spatial processing in the MEC.</p><p>In summary, our data demonstrate the existence of theta traveling waves in the medial entorhinal cortex that are matched to the traveling waves known to exist in hippocampus proper. The existence of matched traveling waves in interacting cortical areas supports the hypothesis that traveling waves are a basic organizing mechanism for coordinating cortical information processing. With regard to the underlying mechanism, our findings that theta waveform varied in a graded fashion across the axis indicate that the traveling wave is not generated by a propagating wave front but rather by varying physiological generators across the axis, constraining mechanistic models of theta generation and function in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institute of Health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals (NIH Publications No. 80–23) and were approved by the Bloomington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Recordings were made in six male Long-Evans rats.

The positions of individual electrodes were fixed with respect to all other electrodes in the array. To build the electro array, 15–16 silica tubes (150 μm in diameter) were arranged and glued together in the horizontal plane. Individual shanks were created by loading stereotrodes or tetrodes (polytrodes) into single silica tubes or by merging the polytrodes loaded into adjacent silica tubes. Polytrodes were constructed by twisting two or four 12 μm or 25 μm diameter nichrome wires (A-M Systems) together. In one array, each shank was comprised of a single polytrode. Four arrays were built to have two polytrodes per shank so as to have a vertical offset between the recording tips of the polytrodes within a shank of ~280 μm. This design permitted us to use the deeper of the two as a scout electrode, seeking out the phase reversal that exists between layers II and I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mitchell and Ranck, 1980</xref>). With this tip in layer I, the relatively shallow electrode was reliably positioned in layers II–III.

The first used the Hilbert transform method, matching the approach used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang and Jacobs, 2015</xref>). That is, raw traces were filtered to the 6–12 Hz band using a zero phase-lag fourth-order bandpass Butterworth filter. The Hilbert transform was then used to convert the filtered signals into the complex plane and the angle from the real axis was taken as an estimate of the theta phase. The second approach uses the ‘waveform method’ previously established to estimate the phase of non-sinusoidal signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cole and Voytek, 2017</xref>). That is, raw traces were filtered to the 1–25 Hz range using a zero phase-lag fourth-order bandpass Butterworth filter, local maxima and minima separated by at least 83 ms and no more than 250 ms were identified and marked as the 0° and 180° phases, respectively. For analyses requiring localization of the 90 ° and 270 ° phases, these were localized to the time point at which the filtered voltage was closest to the mean of the nearest minima and maxima.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-4"><title>Cycle-triggered averages theta waves</title><p>To establish a picture of the average alignment of theta across the dorsal-ventral axis, we computed event related averages of the raw LFP triggered on the peak of theta on the dorsal-most channel. Importantly, this procedure did not use filtered signals, thereby avoiding the possibility that variations in theta waveform were altered. The peak of theta on the dorsal-most channel was accomplished using the waveform-based estimation of theta phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cole and Voytek, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-5"><title>Phase locking</title><p>To estimate the reliability of the phase offset between electrodes, we estimated the theta phase using the Hilbert transform method and then calculated the mean resultant length of the phase differences between electrodes. The phase differences themselves were computed as the circular difference between the instantaneous theta phase estimates from each of the channels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-6"><title>Theta band coherence</title><p>Theta band coherence was calculated as the average coherence across the 6–12 Hz frequency band (1 Hz increments). The coherence values themselves were derived by pass the artefact-free data to the Matlab function cohere.m. Importantly, this analysis was not restricted to epochs of high theta amplitude.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-7"><title>Conduction delays of specific theta phases</title><p>Conduction delay refers here to the time lag for a signal to appear on a relatively ventral site after appearing on the dorsal-most site. The label conduction delay is not intended to imply literal movement or propagation and is intended to be agnostic about mechanism. Conduction delays were computed separately for each of four distinct phases of the theta signal. These were the troughs, rising phases, peaks, and falling phases as identified with the waveform-based phase estimation approach. For a given phase (e.g., peak), all timepoints at which the phase of the dorsal-most channel was in that phase were taken as individual cycles. For each of those cycles, the timepoints when the remaining channels were also in that same phase that were most proximal (either forward or backward in time) to the timestamp of the dorsal-most site were identified. Importantly, this did not introduce bias with respect to propagation direction. For each cycle, we then performed a robust regression (via Matlab function robustfit.m) between the estimated anatomical position of each channel along the dorsal-ventral axis and the temporal offset of each timestamp relative to the reference timestamp on the dorsal-most channel. The resulting slope (ms/mm) was taken as an estimate of the conduction delay for that cycle. Cycles for which the regression failed to converge were dropped from the analysis. Between 3500 to 5000 individual theta cycles were analyzed for each phase in each rat. The median over all of these cycles was taken as the conduction delay for that phase for a given rat.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-8"><title>Analysis of multiunit spiking activity</title><p>To test whether neuronal activity also exhibited traveling waves, the electrodes were pushed deeper into layer II, as indicated by strong trough-locked multi-unit activity. Multi-unit activity was isolated from the broadband signal by bandpass filtering the raw LFP (zero phase-lag fourth-order Butterworth bandpass filter with 600 and 3000 Hz cutoff frequencies). Then, to extract the theta-timescale modulations of this spiking band, we bandpass filtered the amplitude envelope of the resulting spiking-band activity to the 4–12 Hz band (zero phase-lag third-order Butterworth filter). To test for systematic lags in the change of this theta modulated multi-unit activity, we computed the temporal cross-correlogram between each channel and the dorsal-most channel and, for each, extracted the lag to the maxima within a window of +/– 120 ms. Finally, we performed a regression between the extracted lags to the electrode positions to determine the average conduction delay in ms/mm. To compare the obtained multi-unit conduction delay to that expected from the field potential, we compared the multi-unit regression slope to the one derived from analyzing the LFP theta from same subset of three rats from which the multi-unit activity was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-9"><title>Asymmetry analysis</title><p>To test for changes in the shape of the theta waveform, we used the asymmetry index described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cole and Voytek (2019)</xref>. Briefly, theta peaks and trough were identified using the waveform-based method described above. The waveform asymmetry was evaluated on the basis of the rise-decay symmetry bases, the ratio of the rising phase duration to the decaying (falling) phase duration. The log<sub>10</sub> transform of this ratio was then taken to create the index. This asymmetry index was computed for each theta cycle. The median across all theta cycles was then used to reflect the waveform asymmetry for that channel for that recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-10"><title>Asymmetry-corrected data</title><p>Because asymmetry differences across electrodes alone would generate apparent conduction delays, we derived cycle-by-cycle conduction delay ‘corrections’ on the basis of the observed asymmetries. To apply this correction, we first calculated the conduction delay that could be expected by the asymmetry alone (i.e., the asymmetry-related delay) for every theta cycle. The asymmetry-related delay for each cycle was computed according to the following formula:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where D<sub>falling</sub> and D<sub>rising</sub> were the durations of the falling and rising phases, respectively. This formula yields the difference in the asymmetry between two electrodes on a given theta cycle in milliseconds. The asymmetry-corrected conduction delays were computed by subtracting this asymmetry-related delay from the delays derived from analyzing the theta phases. The peak phases were used as the key reference phase, in particular because this was the phase at which the greatest total conduction delays were observed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-11"><title>Comparison to coupled-oscillators and fixed-delay models of traveling waves</title><p>To test whether the traveling waves that remained after accounting for variable waveform asymmetries were most consistent with a model of traveling wave generation based on weakly coupled oscillators or fixed-delay based mechanisms (e.g., propagating excitation or variable delays of a single oscillator), we compared how cycle-by-cycle changes in theta frequency were related to cycle-by-cycle changes in <italic>absolute</italic> conduction delay versus cycle-by-cycle changes in <italic>relative</italic> conduction delay. Absolute conduction delay was computed as described above using theta peaks as the key reference phase after the asymmetry related component was subtracted (see above). Relative conduction delay is the absolute conduction delay for a given cycle divided by the period length of that cycle. For both, we asked whether there was a reliable correlation with variance in the cycle-by-cycle theta frequency (computed as the inverse of the period). Traveling waves generated by weakly coupled oscillators should have no significant correlation between theta frequency and relative conduction delay but should have a negative correlation between theta frequency and absolute conduction delay. Traveling waves generated by fixed-delay mechanisms should have a positive correlation between theta frequency and relative conduction delay but no significant correlation between theta frequency and absolute conduction delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ermentrout and Kleinfeld, 2001</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>Because the changes were reproduced in each animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), a sample size of six animals was chosen. This is consistent with previous electrophysiological studies of LFP using similar sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>). Summary statistics are reported as medians with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals, based on 500 permutations, in square brackets. Nonparametric statistical testing of differences was done throughout. In the case of nonpaired tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed, In the case of paired tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed. The only parametric testing done was when analyzing correlation, using Pearson correlation, so as to assess the goodness of fit of coincidently performed linear regressions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Whitehall Foundation, CONACYT (232364), and Indiana University for their generous support of this project.

the dorso-ventral direction. This is evidenced in local field potential and single unit activity, resembling the traveling wave reported in hippocampus proper and with important implications for the communication between both regions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Medial entorhinal cortex activates in a traveling wave&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports for the first time the propagation of theta waves along the dorso-ventral axis of the MEC. Using electrode arrays to sample a range of dorso-ventral and laminar positions of MEC, the authors observe a gradual phase shift along the dorso-ventral axis for theta oscillations on a rate and scale similar to the septo-temporal phase shifts reported in the hippocampus. The theta phase shifts are observed on both theta range-filtered LFP and multiunit activity, and do not originate from differences in electrode laminar position. In addition, the authors analyze the mechanisms underlying the theta wave propagation. One contributing factor is a change in the shape of theta waves from more asymmetric in dorsal MEC to more symmetric in ventral MEC. After subtracting this effect, the remaining phase shifts scale with the size of the theta waves, consistent with the prediction of weakly-coupled oscillator models and at odd with models stipulating fixed delays.</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that this paper represents a potentially interesting and important finding, but there are also some potentially significant issues to address, as listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The key methodological problem here is to separate the phase and waveform shifts between Superficial-Deep layers from those between equivalent Dorso-Ventral locations. In one animal there are multiple shanks with contacts at multiple depths along them in which both the S-D phase shifts and D-V phase shifts can be measured and the authors can try to control for the potentially confounding effect of one on the other (Figure 3).</p><p>In another approach the array is moved to record multi-unit activity in layer II (please clarify if this is a single animal or all 6, and whether the array is moved in each from the previous location near layer III) and the analysis performed on the total spiking rather than the LFP.</p><p>For the animals used in the standard LFP recording protocol (5 animals?) this cannot be done.

In one animal there are multiple shanks with contacts at multiple depths along them in which both the S-D phase shifts and D-V phase shifts can be measured and the authors can try to control for the potentially confounding effect of one on the other (Figure 3).</p><p>In another approach the array is moved to record multi-unit activity in layer II (please clarify if this is a single animal or all 6, and whether the array is moved in each from the previous location near layer III) and the analysis performed on the total spiking rather than the LFP.</p><p>For the animals used in the standard LFP recording protocol (5 animals?) this cannot be done.

This is important to rule out. A number of lines of evidence rule this out as a major contributor to our results.</p><p>1) The strongest line of evidence comes from the extensive body of literature that describes theta phase distributions across the MEC layers (Mitchell and Ranck, 1980; Alonso and García-Austt, 1987; Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1998; Mizuseki et al., 2009; Quilichini et al., 2010). This literature has consistently demonstrated that 1) theta phase is the same across MEC layers III-V, and 2) that theta phase reverses between layers III and I with a zone of null theta amplitude between them. We acknowledge that there is some phase instability as electrodes approach the phase reversal between EC3 and EC1. Critically, however, this instability is accompanied by a drop and eventual loss of theta power. Analysis of theta power across our electrodes revealed no systematic differences in power as a function of position along the MEC layers (D-V axis). The results of this analysis have been added to manuscript Figure 2 as panel G. The lack of systematic differences in theta power across recording sites indicates that our electrodes do not vary in their positioning relative to the phase reversal zone. Based on this, it is safe to conclude that the systematic phase shifts that we do observe are not driven by phase instabilities near the phase reversal. Because there are no other phase shifts across MEC layers, it is also safe to conclude that no across layer phase differences confounded our results.</p><p>2) The second line of evidence is our data examining the distribution of phase shifts across and along the MEC layers simultaneously in one animal, shown in Figure 3. This analysis replicates the reported lack of phase shifts across MEC layers (~S-D axis) in the five published works cited in point 1 but also extends the existing work by simultaneously showing the existence of phase shifts along the MEC layers (~D-V axis). We acknowledge that this is but one animal and thus no statistical testing is possible. As noted in the previous point, prior published reports rule out the ‘across layer’/S-D axis phase shift confound. The reason we none-the-less include Figure 3 and the associated description in the results is two-fold: 1) It enables us to share data that we have illustrating the phase gradients across and along the layers which we believe helps make the overall understanding of our main result clearer; and 2) We believe it is more compelling to see some direct empirical evidence of the lack of contribution of across layer placements rather than none in the case that we relinquished our handling of this point to a string of citations in the Introduction and Discussion.</p><p>3) The third line of evidence, as recognized by the reviewers, is the multiunit activity which shows the qualitatively similar pattern of sequential activation along the length of the MEC.</p><p>These three points should leave no doubt that the phase shifts reported here can be safely attributed to electrode positioning alongthe MEC layers and not <italic>across</italic> the MEC layers.</p><p>We were appreciative for the reviewers’ suggested approach to estimating and handling variability in the precise placement of electrodes relative to the cell layers. Indeed, our conviction that this analysis would be valuable analytical tool in pursuing this line work, we dedicated considerable effort to implementing the suggest analysis. Ultimately, however, between the granularity of the movements of the electrodes (typically 50-100 μm) and the graded nature of the physiological shifts across layers (e.g., theta power and multi-unit activity), we were not able to improve our estimates of the S-D positioning of the electrodes over the approximations we had from knowing the probe design. Never the less, for the sake of satisfying the curiosity of the reviewers, we include <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> with the results we obtained when applying the approach and analysis to the 5 animals that had any variability in the across-layer dimension as well as the along-layer dimension. Please note, though the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> are consistent with the data shown in the current Figure 3, these results should not be included in the manuscript or supplemental materials because the limited sampling across layers in at least the bottom three of the rats restricted the variability in that dimension and thereby generated highly unreliable phase gradient estimates. The lack of variability is visible in the figure in that the values along the x-axis are highly clustered in the right-most column of panels.</p><p>Regarding the reviewers’ questions about the number of animals included in the analysis of traveling waves of multi-unit activity (Figure 4): We have ensured that the figure caption and the corresponding portion of the results clearly state that three animals were included in this analysis and that the electrodes were moved from layer III to enable this analysis.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Phase shifts are reliably positive and strongly associated with electrode position along the MEC layers and unreliably / not related to positioning across the MEC layers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Reconstructed electrode positioning in the MEC based on analysis of physiological markers observed at the time of recording and by comparing the changes in physiological markers and electrode movements over days.

It was not our intention to say that the areas would have different phase shifts over comparable% of the DV axis. We are in full agreement that this would indeed be troubling / consequential if it were the case. We considered trying to clarify the discussion text to better communicate what meant. However, this would have risked further confusion about what is ultimately a minor point. Given that our goal was simply to argue against the risk of volume conduction, we decided it was easier to replace this argument with reference to the unit activity as suggested by the reviewers. We are grateful that the reviewers identified the risk of misunderstanding of this part of the manuscript so that we could remove it.</p></body></sub-article></article>
