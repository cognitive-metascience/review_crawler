Exploiting in vitro reconstitution and in vivo analysis of INM targeting, we establish that Atlastins, membrane-bound GTPases of the ER, sustain the efficient targeting of proteins to the INM by their continued activity in preserving ER topology. When ER topology is altered, the long-range diffusional exchange of proteins in the ER network and targeting efficiency to the INM are diminished.

The most elaborate cellular membrane system forms the boundary of a complex organelle - the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER serves as a central hub for protein entry into the secretory pathway and plays a vital role in lipid synthesis and calcium homeostasis. Although the ER is a continuous membrane system that is spread throughout the cytoplasm, it possesses structurally distinct domains such as the mostly perinuclear, ribosome-studded ER sheets or the dense reticular network of peripheral ER tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedman and Voeltz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McNew et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shibata et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Westrate et al., 2015</xref>). The characteristic morphology of these ER domains is generated and maintained by proteins that partition into them; exemplified by the enrichment of the luminal ER spacing protein CLIMP63 in ER sheets and of the membrane curvature-inducing proteins of the reticulon and DP1/Yop1p families in ER tubules and at the edges of ER sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shibata et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Voeltz et al., 2006</xref>). The formation of the peripheral, tubular ER network relies on homotypic membrane fusion mediated by GTPases of the Atlastin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Orso et al., 2009</xref>). Atlastins weave membranes together, establishing the polygonal ER that expands all the way towards the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In vitro, Atlastins and membrane-tubule stabilizing factors are sufficient for the formation and maintenance of the tubular ER network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Powers et al., 2017</xref>). In living cells, ER network formation is further supported by microtubules and RabGTPase-dependent growth of new membrane tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audhya et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">English and Voeltz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerondopoulos et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The boundary of the nuclear compartment - the nuclear envelope (NE) - is formed by a specialized ER membrane sheet that surrounds and protects chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson and Hetzer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ungricht and Kutay, 2015</xref>). Reflecting functional specialization of the two NE lipid bilayers, the inner and outer nuclear membranes (INM and ONM) possess a distinct protein composition, even though both membranes are joined at numerous sites to form membranous pores. Compared to the ONM and the ER, the INM contains a unique set of membrane proteins that interact with nuclear lamins and chromatin, thereby playing a critical role in nuclear organization and genome regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Las Heras et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wong et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Targeting of newly synthesized integral membrane proteins from the ER to the INM occurs within a system of continuous membranes. To reach the INM, membrane proteins must pass through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), which control nucleo-cytoplasmic exchange. How newly synthesized integral membrane proteins traverse NPCs and are enriched at the INM has been a focus of intensive research, resulting in several models that explain protein targeting to the INM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ungricht and Kutay, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zuleger et al., 2011</xref>). The initially proposed âdiffusion-retention modelâ posits that proteins diffuse from the ER to the INM, where they accumulate due to interactions with nuclear retention partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Powell and Burke, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Soullam and Worman, 1995</xref>). However, both the energy-dependent enrichment of a reporter protein at the INM in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohba et al., 2004</xref>) and the description of transport receptor-mediated import of the yeast proteins Heh1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">King et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meinema et al., 2011</xref>) challenged this model, suggesting that INM targeting of the studied proteins may occur by an active process. Yet, recent kinetic analyses and mathematical modeling of protein sorting to the INM affirmed that diffusion and retention sufficiently explain the targeting of several INM proteins in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ungricht et al., 2015</xref>). Biochemical reconstitution further revealed that INM targeting of the investigated INM proteins is independent of the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ungricht et al., 2015</xref>). Still, depletion of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) affected the efficiency of INM protein targeting, which seems, at first glance, to contradict a diffusion-retention based mechanism. At the same time, however, energy depletion also induced changes in ER network topology and reduced the long-range diffusional exchange of proteins in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ungricht et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A causal connection between ER network topology and the energy requirement of INM targeting has so far not been established. Here, we show that INM protein targeting depends on GTP hydrolysis. We link this need for GTP hydrolysis to the maintenance of ER dynamics and connectivity, which in turn influence the apparent diffusional mobility of proteins within the ER network. Further, we demonstrate that the function of Atlastin GTPases in establishing and preserving ER structure is critical to sustain the efficient targeting of proteins to the INM. Our work explains why diffusion-retention-based protein sorting is energy-dependent and emphasizes the importance of ER network topology for cellular functionality.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Efficient INM targeting is dependent on GTP hydrolysis</title><p>To study the molecular requirements and kinetics of protein targeting to the INM, we had previously established an in vitro system that uncouples integration of membrane proteins into the ER from their translocation to the INM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ungricht et al., 2015</xref>). In this assay, initial trapping of GFP-tagged, INM-destined reporter proteins in the ER of HeLa cells is achieved by enlargement of their extralumenal, nucleoplasmic domains (ND) by two RFP moieties that can be cleaved off by TEV protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Addition of TEV protease to the semi-permeabilized cells allows for a fast cleavage of the tandem RFPs, thereby enabling NPC passage of the reporters. Targeting to the INM is then reconstituted by supplementing HeLa cell lysate and an energy regenerating system (ATP, GTP, creatine phosphate and creatine kinase; later referred to as energy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ungricht et al., 2016</xref>). Accumulation of the GFP-tagged reporter proteins at the NE over time can be followed by time-lapse microscopy allowing for a quantitative description of the INM targeting process. Note that NE accumulation of the reporter proteins majorly reflects INM localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ungricht et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zuleger et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28202.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Targeting of membrane proteins to the INM in vitro is dependent on GTP hydrolysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the in vitro transport assay for INM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ungricht et al., 2015</xref>).

After incubation of cells at 37Â°C for 45 min, cells were fixed and imaged by confocal microscopy.

Based on this data, we now aimed at identifying the cellular factors that utilize NTPs to promote INM protein targeting. We first investigated whether relocalization of LBR and SUN2-derived reporters from the ER to the NE can be challenged by addition of non-hydrolysable ATP or GTP analogs. Targeting of LBR(1-245)-GFP and SUN2-GFP was reconstituted in semi-permeabilized HeLa cells for 45 min, followed by fixation and analysis of targeting levels. As previously reported, in presence of HeLa cell lysate and energy, LBR and SUN2 accumulated at the NE efficiently, but to different levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ungricht et al., 2015</xref>). Strikingly, NE enrichment of both LBR and SUN2 was severely compromised upon addition of 0.3 mM GTPÎ³S, comparable to the levels attained upon depletion of NTPs by apyrase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A subtle defect was also observed with increasing concentrations of ATPÎ³S (data not shown). This reduction was, however, weaker than that observed with GTPÎ³S.</p><p>To test whether NTPs were sufficient for INM targeting, we performed reconstitution experiments exclusively in the presence of single nucleotides in buffer, thatÂ is, without addition of cell extract. Note that semi-permeabilization of cells results in a wash out of soluble cytosolic components. Remarkably, NE enrichment of LBR(1-245)-GFP could be fully reconstituted by the mere addition of GTP to semi-permeabilized cells, comparable to the levels obtained in presence of a complete energy regenerating system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, addition of ATP did not suffice to support NE accumulation of LBR(1-245)-GFP beyond levels achieved by addition of buffer alone. Together, these results suggest that efficient enrichment of membrane proteins at the INM requires the enzymatic contribution of a GTPase present in the semi-permeabilized cells, indicating that the GTPase in question may reside in the ER or nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>GTPÎ³S affects diffusion of membrane and soluble ER proteins</title><p>Exploiting kinetic analyses and mathematical modeling, we had previously attributed the energy requirement of INM targeting to the maintenance of ER organization and its influence on the diffusional exchange of proteins within the ER network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ungricht et al., 2015</xref>). To analyze the effect of GTPÎ³S on the diffusional properties of our INM targeting reporters in the ER, we measured their mobility by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). As we were interested in changes in long-range exchange of molecules, we performed FRAP on a relatively large area of the ER (~20 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>). Thus, the âapparentâ diffusion coefficients and mobile fractions that will be referred to in our study report on a combination of the diffusional properties of proteins in the 2D membrane plane and the influence of 3D geometry of the ER network on long-range exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sbalzarini et al., 2005</xref>) (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In line with the INM targeting defects, ER mobility of 2xRFP-tev-LBR(1-245)-GFP in semi-permeabilized cells supplemented with HeLa cell extract and energy was drastically compromised in the presence of GTPÎ³S, but was unaffected by ATPÎ³S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar to INM-destined reporters, the diffusional mobility of the ER-resident membrane protein Sec61Î²-GFP was also strongly reduced upon treatment with 0.3 mM GTPÎ³S, and was insensitive to the same concentration of ATPÎ³S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28202.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ER protein mobility is reduced in the presence of GTPÎ³S.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model illustrating the hypothetical differences in ER organization of cells with either a highly interconnected polygonal ER (left) or a more sparsely connected network of polygons and tubules (right).

A circular spot was repeatedly photobleached and the loss of fluorescence in the surrounding area as well as in a region on the opposite side of the nucleus was monitored. Rapid exchange of bleached fluorophores with unbleached molecules led to a simultaneous loss of fluorescence in the area surrounding the bleaching spot, but to a slightly delayed decrease in the distant region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, upper panels and graph). In the presence of GTPÎ³S, loss of fluorescence in the surrounding area was significantly delayed and the fluorescence intensity on the opposite side of the nucleus even remained stable throughout the 12 min time course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, lower panels and graph). Taken together, the observed defects on diffusional exchange of ER lumenal and membrane proteins suggest that GTPÎ³S alters ER organization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Continuous GTP hydrolysis is essential to maintain ER dynamics and mobility of proteins within the ER network</title><p>Our data so far indicate that GTP hydrolysis is required to sustain the diffusional mobility of soluble and membrane proteins in the ER, thereby contributing to the efficient protein trafficking towards the NE. However, our in vitro reconstitution experiments begin with semi-permeabilization of cells; a procedure that might affect ER topology. Therefore, we introduced a recovery time of 30 min in presence of HeLa lysate and energy after semi-permeabilization. Only after this recovery phase, nucleotide analogs were added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Mobility of the reporters in the ER was monitored by FRAP, starting at 15 min of recovery, when 2xRFP-tev-LBR(1-245)-GFP already exhibited a high mobility with a mobile fraction ofÂ ~84%. Strikingly, when GTPÎ³S was added after 30 min, the mobile fraction rapidly dropped below 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), comparable to the reduction in reporter mobility observed without recovery phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Addition of ATPÎ³S did not alter the mobility of the reporter initially. However, after about 40 min, the mobility of the reporter started to decrease. When combining GTPÎ³S and ATPÎ³S, the drop in mobility was comparable to the addition of GTPÎ³S alone. Thus, GTP hydrolysis is not merely required to repair the ER network post semi-permeabilization, but is necessary to maintain the diffusional mobility of ER membrane proteins.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28202.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of GTP hydrolysis affects ER morphology.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of experimental set-up in B.

The characteristic polygon structure of the peripheral ER began to disappear within a few minutes, giving rise to sparsely connected bright membrane spots, potentially ER vesicles, and elongated tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-28202-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28202.005</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>ER remodeling in cells injected with GTP.</title><p>ER dynamics in U2OS cells expressing GFP-KDEL microinjected with a solution containing 10 mM GTP and fluorescent dextran.

In agreement with the RNAi experiments (Figure S1), targeting of LBR(1-245)-GFP to the NE was efficient in ATL3 KO cells.

One process that is accompanied by the nearly synchronous enrichment of a larger pool of membrane proteins at the INM is NE reformation and growth after mitosis. Therefore, we also analyzed steady state localization of INM proteins in synchronized cells 12 hr after release from a thymidine block, thereby enriching the population for cells that just completed mitosis.

One such process might be the delivery of cargo to ER exit sites for transport to the Golgi apparatus. To test whether changes in ER topology affect the kinetics of secretory trafficking from the ER to the Golgi, we used the RUSH system to study the trafficking of a well-characterized cargo protein â the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mezzacasa and Helenius, 2002</xref>). We expressed VSVG fused to SBP and GFP as a trafficking reporter and the invariant chain of MHC class II molecules (Ii) fused to core streptavidin as its hook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boncompain et al., 2012</xref>) in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Addition of biotin induced the rapid and synchronous transport of the VSVG reporter from the ER to the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Kinetic measurements of VSVG trafficking from the ER to the Golgi showed that VSVG rapidly enriched at bright puncta within 1 min in control cells (see bright puncta in siCtr., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), consistent with VSVG accumulation at ER exit sites. VSVG then accumulated in the Golgi complex within 5 min. At 15 min, VSVG already started to be visible at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Strikingly, the enrichment of the reporter in the Golgi complex was delayed to a similar extent in cells depleted of ATL2 or both ATL2 and 3 but less so in ATL3-depleted cells. This retardation correlated with a delayed arrival of VSVG at ER exit sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Note that we only observed a kinetic delay in VSVG transport from the ER to the Golgi but not a block in trafficking, explaining why ER exit of a temperature-sensitive mutant of VSVG studied at longer time intervals seemed unaffected by depletion or deletion of Atlastins in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rismanchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>).

Using non-hydrolysable nucleotide analogs, we demonstrate that INM targeting is GTP-dependent. GTP hydrolysis is essential to maintain ER network topology and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Powers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), which, if perturbed, diminish the diffusional exchange of membrane proteins in the ER. In vitro and in vivo perturbation experiments link the observed dependence of INM targeting on GTP hydrolysis to the functionality of Atlastins. Loss of Atlastin function mimics the effect of GTPÎ³S on both ER topology and long-range diffusion within the ER, which in turn influences the kinetics of membrane protein delivery to the INM.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>GTP-dependence of INM targeting</title><p>Our reconstitution of INM targeting revealed that NE accumulation of the LBR and SUN2 reporter proteins was severely compromised in the presence of GTPÎ³S. At first glance, this seems similar to the inhibition of nuclear import of soluble transport cargo in semi-permeabilized cells by non-hydrolysable GTP analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Melchior et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moore and Blobel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Palacios et al., 1996</xref>). Despite this analogy, however, the underlying mechanisms differ. Nuclear import of soluble cargo depends on the RanGTPase system that generates a high concentration of RanGTP in the nucleus. Nuclear RanGTP is needed for the dissociation of import substrates from shuttling nuclear transport receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">GÃ¶rlich and Kutay, 1999</xref>). If cytosolic Ran is bound to non-hydrolysable GTP analogs, the productive formation of importin-cargo complexes is perturbed. In contrast to import of soluble cargo, transport of SUN2 and LBR to the INM is not directly dependent on the RanGTPase system and the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport machinery for soluble cargo and not affected by addition of RanQ69L â a GTPase-deficient mutant of Ran that efficiently prevents importin-cargo interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ungricht et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the effect of GTPÎ³S on INM targeting must have a distinct molecular cause.</p><p>Previous analysis had demonstrated that depletion of NTPs affects the diffusional mobility of INM-destined reporter proteins in the ER network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ungricht et al., 2015</xref>). Similar to NTP depletion, we now observed that GTPÎ³S leads to a severe reduction in the apparent diffusional mobility of membrane proteins in the ER. The reduction in diffusional exchange does not only concern INM-destined proteins, but also bona fide ER membrane proteins and even a soluble GFP within the ER lumen, consistent with changes in general ER topology induced by GTPÎ³S.</p><p>Originally, it has been demonstrated that de novo ER network formation in vitro using <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts requires GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dreier and Rapoport, 2000</xref>). Recent observations revealed that an in vitro reconstituted ER network disassembles upon addition of GTPÎ³S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Powers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Extending the latter finding, we demonstrate that GTP hydrolysis is needed to maintain ER network topology in semi-permeabilized and living human somatic cells. In striking correlation with these phenotypic defects, we measured a marked reduction in the mobility of membrane proteins in the ER of semi-permeabilized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) within a few minutes after addition of GTPÎ³S. Thus, a requirement of GTP hydrolysis for the efficient targeting of proteins to the INM arises from its need for the generation and maintenance of ER network topology.</p><p>Atlastin GTPases have emerged as key players in the formation and maintenance of the tubular ER network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Powers et al., 2017</xref>). Similar to energy depletion and addition of GTPÎ³S, depletion of Atlastins as well as treatment with dominant-negative Atlastin fragments impaired ER structure, membrane protein mobility in the ER and INM targeting, identifying an important role of the Atlastin GTPases and ER network topology for the efficient accumulation of membrane proteins at the INM. These observations also support the conclusions derived from our previous mathematical modeling approach, in which ER topology emerged as a key parameter influencing the diffusion-based distribution of membrane proteins in the ER network and thereby INM targeting kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ungricht et al., 2015</xref>). In an ER with reduced connectivity, as upon interference with Atlastin function, sorting of membrane proteins to the INM is delayed since proteins take longer to find their way to the INM. In the most extreme scenario of ER fragmentation, membrane proteins may even get stuck in disconnected parts of the ER, thereby leading to a reduced steady-state accumulation at the INM. Thus, GTP hydrolysis by Atlastins and ER network maintenance can explain why targeting of membrane proteins to the INM is energy-dependent.</p><p>Interestingly, we observed differences in phenotypic defects upon depletion of Atlastins. ATL2 depletion affected ER topology, membrane protein mobility and targeting to the INM, while the sole depletion of ATL3 did not. It is possible that ATL2 is a more potent fusogen than ATL3 as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2015</xref>) and/or that ATL3 is less abundant than ATL2 in HeLa cells. The aggravated defects in ER morphology that we observed upon co-depletion of ATL2 and ATL3 suggest that ATL3 function may become critical in the absence of ATL2. Whether Atlastins function redundantly and can compensate for the loss of each other, or whether the two Atlastins potentially mediate fusion at spatially distinct locations in the ER remains to be investigated. The potent impairment of INM targeting by cytATL3 may, however, suggest that Atlastins form mixed dimers under those conditions using excess recombinant protein, similar to what has been observed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rismanchi et al., 2008</xref>). Intriguingly, ER exit of VSVG was not only perturbed upon depletion of ATL2 but also slightly affected by loss of ATL3. As ATL3 depletion did not visibly affect the long-range diffusional exchange in the ER network, there might be a different cause for its influence on ER to Golgi transport. Although both Atlastins are known to be widely distributed within the ER network, there are notable differences in their localization. Compared to ATL2, ATL3 was found to be less aligned with microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rismanchi et al., 2008</xref>). It is thus conceivable that ATL3 depletion might more specifically affect the organization of ER membrane domains relevant for timely ER exit. Notably, all Atlastins have also been found associated with vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) and the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi. This may simply reflect ER escape of Atlastins accompanying the flux of membranes to the Golgi. Alternatively, it could also hint at a more specific role of Atlastins in maintaining the topology of the transitional ER.</p><p>Currently, we cannot exclude the involvement of additional GTPases in INM targeting. A contribution may for instance arise from other GTPases involved in structuring the ER network, like RabGTPases and the microtubule cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">English and Voeltz, 2013</xref>). However, neither microtubule depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ungricht et al., 2015</xref>) nor the extraction of Rabs did affect INM targeting in vitro (although not all Rabs may have been depleted with equal efficiency). Thus, if there is a contribution of these GTPases to INM targeting, it is not obvious in the in vitro system. Notably, Atlastin-mediated maintenance of the ER network is required early in the targeting pathway to the INM, upstream of other critical processes such as NPC translocation. Therefore, we cannot dismiss the possibility of other GTP-dependent steps in the targeting process. To address whether GTP hydrolysis by Altlastins is sufficient for INM targeting, we expressed Atlastin mutants with supposedly altered nucleotide specificity (from GTP to xanthosine 5' triphosphate, data not shown). However, the respective mutants behaved as dominant-negatives, hampering the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Membrane connectivity and ER functionality</title><p>Despite its dynamic behavior and separation into structurally distinct domains, the continuity and interconnectivity of the ER network is preserved by frequent homotypic membrane fusion events. In general, in physiological settings, the ER is a continuous membrane system. Why is membrane continuity so important? For one, it may assure rapid flux of proteins and lipids from their site of synthesis to the site of function. Our study emphasizes that the continuity of the ER aids the timely delivery of proteins to the INM, thereby promoting the generation of a specific ER subdomain. A well-connected ER assures an unhindered diffusion of newly synthesized INM proteins to accompany the nuclear growth and NE expansion during interphase. The interconnected topology of the ER network is also important for the timely exit of newly synthesized cargo into the secretory pathway, as exemplified by the delayed trafficking of the model protein VSVG from the ER to the Golgi upon Atlastin depletion. Additionally, it may regulate interactions of the ER with several organelles by facilitating rapid exchange of proteins towards and away from contact sites.</p><p>Even during mitosis, the ER remains intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ellenberg et al., 1997</xref>), despite the large-scale reorganization of the NE-ER network. Interestingly, interference with Atlastin function early during in vitro nuclear assembly abrogates NE formation, whereas Atlastin inhibition at a later phase impairs NE expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), indicating that ER connectivity is important for nuclear reformation after mitosis. We observed that a large fraction of NPCs is mislocalized to annulate lamellae upon depletion of Atlastins, which may reflect a function of Atlastins in post-mitotic NE reformation. During nuclear reassembly, INM proteins need to be recruited back to chromatin during a very short time window in late ana- and telophase, not only to support chromatin enclosure by membranes but also to promote post-mitotic NPC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mansfeld et al., 2006</xref>). It is conceivable that this phase of the cell cycle is especially vulnerable to defects in ER network organization because the timely delivery of INM proteins from the ER to the reforming NE is crucial, leading to ectopic NPC assembly if perturbed. Alternatively, however, it is also possible that the altered connectivity in the ER may delay the recruitment of transmembrane proteins required for NPC formation from the ER to the NE during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dawson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doucet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Talamas and Hetzer, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Finally, ER continuity and complexity seem of special importance in large and polarized cells like neurons. A group of inherited diseases, collectively termed hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs), arise due to mutations in ER shaping proteins and affect specifically neuronal cells with long axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">HÃ¼bner and Kurth, 2014</xref>). Neurons demand for an intricate ER topology, with a network of tubular projections and irregularly spaced cisternae reaching down all along the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">GonzÃ¡lez and Couve, 2014</xref>). The dimensions of the ER in neuronal cells might explain their vulnerability for mutations in ER shaping proteins and their demand for a potent fusogen as ATL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rismanchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Summerville et al., 2016</xref>). Our study emphasizes how changes in ER network topology already influence trafficking of membrane proteins in small, non-neuronal cells. Such perturbations in ER morphology that cause subtle defects in protein trafficking are likely enhanced applied to neurons due to the long axonal extensions. We may thus propose that studying the diffusional status of membrane proteins in the ER and their trafficking towards destined organelles could help providing insights into mechanisms underlying ER morphology-associated diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>The following commercial antibodies were used in this study: anti-ATL2 (rabbit; Abcam, ab 103084; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10711796">AB_10711796</ext-link>), anti-ATL3 (rabbit; Proteintech, 16921â1-AP; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2290228">AB_2290228</ext-link>), anti-Î²-actin (mouse; Sigma, A1978; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_476692">AB_476692</ext-link>), mAB414 (mouse; Abcam, ab 24609; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_448181">AB_448181</ext-link>), anti-LBR (rabbit; Abnova, PAB15583; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10696691">AB_10696691</ext-link>), anti-LAP2Î²(mouse; BD transduction laboratories, 611000; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_398313">AB_398313</ext-link>), anti-Lamin A/C (mouse; BD transduction laboratories, 612162; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_399533">AB_399533</ext-link>), anti-Lamin B1 (rabbit; Abcam, ab 16048; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_443298">AB_443298</ext-link>), anti-emerin (rabbit; Abcam, ab 40688; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2100059">AB_2100059</ext-link>) and anti-Giantin (rabbit; Abcam, ab 24586; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_448163">AB_448163</ext-link>).

For analysis of ER exit, HeLa K cells were transiently transfected with 0.25 Î¼g of the Str-Ii_VSVGwt-SBP-EGFP vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boncompain et al., 2012</xref>) 24 hr before the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Generation of ATL3 KO cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9</title><p>ATL3 knockout (KO) cell lines were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. CRISPR target sites in ATL3 were chosen within exon 2, which is found in all predicted splice variants of ATL3. Target sequences for guide RNAs (gRNAs) were predicted using a CRISPR design web tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.mit.edu">http://crispr.mit.edu</ext-link>). To clone the ATL3-Exon2 gRNA, the DNA oligonucleotides (5â²-CACCGCATGTTGTCCCCTCAGCGAG-3â²) and (5â²-AAACCTCGCTGAGGGGACAACATGC-3â²) were annealed and ligated into the pC2P vector, also encoding for hCas9 and a puromycin resistance cassette (kind gift from Dr. M.

RNA was extracted from control and siRNA treated HeLa cells using the RNeasy minikit (QIAGEN). Contaminating genomic DNA was digested with RNAse-free DNase I (Fermentas). 100 ng of DNase-treated RNA was then used per reverse transcription (RT) reaction. RNA was incubated with oligo dT18 primer (Fermentas), random hexamer primer (Fermentas), and RNase-free dNTPs at 65Â°C for 5 min. Reverse transcription was performed by adding SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), 0.01 M DTT and RiboLock RNase inhibitor (Fermentas) followed by incubation at 42Â°C for 2 min, 25Â°C for 10 min, and 42Â°C for 1 hr. 2.5 ng cDNA was used for quantitative PCR.

In brief, reporter cells were semi-permeabilized with permeabilization buffer (PB: 20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 110 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 0.5 mM EGTA, 250 mM sucrose) containing 0.0025% digitonin for 10 min at 4Â°C, followed by three washes with PB for 2, 5, and 10 min, respectively. Targeting of reporter proteins towards the INM was initiated by proteolytic cleavage of their N-terminal 2xRFP moieties by addition of NusA-Tev protease to the semi-permeabilized cells for 10 min at room temperature. Targeting reactions were performed in presence of HeLa cell lysate and energy mix (10 mM creatine phosphate, 0.5 mM ATP, 0.5 mM GTP, 0.05 mg creatine kinase, 5 mM HEPES pH 7.5, and 12.5 mM sucrose), unless indicated otherwise. For competitive reactions, nucleotide analogs were added to a concentration of 0.3 mM. For energy depletion, 50 units of apyrase (New England Biolabs, Inc.) were added per reaction.</p><p>For experiments with dominant-negative Atlastins and Rab GDI, reporter cells were semi-permeabilized and pre-incubated for 20 min with 5 Î¼M of dominant-negative Atlastins, 20 Î¼M of Rab-GDI or both in PB at 37Â°C. Then, cells were exposed to NusA-Tev protease for 10 min. INM targeting reactions were carried out with HeLa cell lysate and energy mix in the presence of 5 Î¼M dominant-negative Atlastins, 20 Î¼M of Rab GDI or both. After 45 min, the coverslips were washed once in PB and immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Nuclei were stained with DAPI.

An ImageJ plugin was used to detect nuclear contours of DAPI-stained nuclei and the ER border by thresholding on the eGFP channel. The fluorescence intensity in a region defined as NE was integrated, comprising an area reaching 230 nm outwards from the nuclear contour towards the ER and 920 nm inwards into the nucleus. The fraction of total fluorescence intensity at the NE was calculated by dividing the fluorescence intensity at the NE by the sum of the integrated fluorescence intensities at the NE and the ER. Fluorescence intensities were normalized relative to the fraction at the NE before release by TEV cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ungricht et al., 2015</xref>). These normalized fluorescence intensities were then converted to the percentage of signal at NE.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis of INM targeting in living cells</title><p>For kinetic measurement of INM targeting in living cells, reporter cells were grown in Lab-Tek chambers.

For FRAP experiments, reporter cells were seeded in 8-well Lab-Tek II chambers. Expression of the reporter proteins was induced for 16 hr. Then, cells were semi-permeabilized at 4Â°C, followed by addition of the indicated supplements and incubation at 37Â°C. To measure the diffusional mobility of the reporters in the ER, FRAP was performed on the uncleaved reporters. A 2 Ã 10.4 Î¼m (area: 20.8 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>) region of interest (ROI) was defined. Three pre-bleach images were acquired, followed by bleaching with 100% laser power and 20 scanning iterations. The effective time for bleaching was 2.05 s. Pre- and post-bleach images were acquired every 4 s. Fluorescence intensities was also measured in equivalent areas inside and outside the cell for bleaching and background corrections. For quantitative analysis of FRAP experiments, fluorescence intensity values were imported to the easyFRAP tool in MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rapsomaniki et al., 2012</xref>). FRAP recovery curves were obtained using full-scale normalization. Mobile fractions and t<sub>1/2</sub> values were determined using a double exponential curve fit.

Two pre-bleach images were acquired, followed by repeated photo-bleaching of a spot (rÂ =Â 3.16 Î¼m, 50 iterations, 4.5 s). Fluorescence loss was measured within this spot, in a ring of 3.16 Î¼m width surrounding the spot (defined as âdonutâ) and in a distant region on the opposite side of the nucleus. Fluorescence intensities within a neighboring cell and a background area were also measured to correct for bleaching while acquisition and background, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Immunofluorescence assays</title><p>Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Randy Schekman as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: James A McNew (Reviewer #2) and Brian Burke (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary</p><p>How membrane proteins that reside in the inner nuclear membrane (INM) move to this location from their sites of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is unclear, and various mechanisms have been suggested. The authors of this study have previously proposed a diffusion-retention-based mechanism of INM targeting that is energy-dependent (Ungricht et al., 2015). They also proposed that transport from the ER to the INM occurs through the pore membrane and is regulated by nuclear pore complex proteins. Importantly, they showed that these targeting events do not require RanGTP, and they conclude that the nature of this energy-dependent step remains to be determined.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors further examine the functional basis for energy-dependent membrane protein targeting to the INM. To do this, they use a previously published reporter protein assay to assess the inducible movement of INM reporters from the ER to the INM in semi-permeabilized cells. They show using this assay that GTP is required for efficient movement of INM reporters to the INM. They further show that treatment with a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP reduces the mobility of the reporters in the ER membrane and alters ER morphology. In addition, the authors show that conditions that inhibit the function of a member of a family of proteins termed atlastins delays recruitment of the INM reporter to the INM and alters the diffusion properties of the reporter within ER membranes. Based on these data and previously proposed functions of atlastins in homotypic ER membrane fusion, the authors conclude that atlastins contribute to INM protein targeting, in part, through their role in dictating ER topology.</p><p>This is a very solid piece of work. The experiments are well performed and the data are of excellent quality.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to clearly state that the requirement for GTP in INM protein targeting may not be limited to its use by atlastins. I think this is important as the role of NTPs in this process has been a debated point in the field, and more needs to be done to clarify this issue. Second, I am concerned that the effects of altering atlastin function are pleiotropic, and the consequences of atlastin loss of function to targeting of endogenous INM protein targeting is not clearly established. However, I don't have a seminal experiment to suggest. Perhaps the authors could at least state that more studies are needed to clearly define the function of atlastins in the targeting of endogenous INM proteins.</p><p>2) For the non-expert, it may be useful for the authors to make a clearer distinction between nuclear envelope accumulation and INM targeting. These terms seem to be used interchangeably.</p><p>3) Additionally, given that the majority of results in this work rely on nuclear envelope accumulation as an endpoint, it would be very useful if the authors demonstrated that NE accumulation faithfully recapitulated INM sorting in the context of atlastin 2 knockdown using the differential permabilization experiment with triton and digitonin. This may be partly the purpose of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, but it is unclear if the immunolabelling was done following Triton X-100 or digitonin permeabilization.</p><p>4) With respect to the Atlastin results, I have only a single query. INM protein localization appears insensitive to ATL3 knockdown but is inhibited by cytATL3 expression. My first thought was that this might simply reflect lower expression levels of ATL3 versus ATL2. However, export of VSV G protein appears to be inhibited by both ATL2 and ATL3 knockdown. Why might this be the case? Is it possible that accessing ER exit sites in the peripheral ER is more sensitive to even small changes in ER topology than accessing the ONM and associated ER cisternae? Perhaps the authors could address this in an amended discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28202.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors need to clearly state that the requirement for GTP in INM protein targeting may not be limited to its use by atlastins.

Further, depletion of both atlastins leads to defects in the biogenesis of NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), which are the bottleneck for transport of proteins to the INM (Ungricht et al., 2015; Boni et al., 2015). To address the concern that the effects of altering Atlastin function are pleiotropic, we performed experiments in which we acutely inhibited Atlastin function by the use of dominant-negatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In this experimental setting, we did not observe any effects on NPCs, as expected, but INM targeting was impaired. We have also analyzed the effects on targeting of endogenous INM proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with the notion that Atlastin depletion kinetically delays INM targeting but does not block it, one does not necessarily expect to see changes in the steadystate localization of INM proteins. In the manuscript, we point at the fact that ânewly synthesized INM proteins present only a minor fraction of the total pool at a given time.â Thus, it will be difficult to observe striking differences in the steady-state localization of endogenous INM proteins. And indeed, as we demonstrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>), defects in INM targeting are only observed in post-mitotic cells in early G1, when a large pool of membrane proteins needs to be synchronously targeted back to the INM.</p><p><italic>2) For the non-expert, it may be useful for the authors to make a clearer distinction between nuclear envelope accumulation and INM targeting. These terms seem to be used interchangeably.</italic> </p><p>Yes, we had used these terms interchangeably, as the NE accumulation seen in our assays majorly reflects INM localization as demonstrated previously (Ungricht et al., 2015). To avoid confusion, we now use the term NE accumulation when referring to the data derived from our measurements. Further, we have added an additional experiment using antibody accessibility upon differential detergent permeabilization to demonstrate INM localization of the LBR reporter in control cells and the targeting defects observed upon Atlastin depletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Additionally, given that the majority of results in this work rely on nuclear envelope accumulation as an endpoint, it would be very useful if the authors demonstrated that NE accumulation faithfully recapitulated INM sorting in the context of atlastin 2 knockdown using the differential permabilization experiment with triton and digitonin. This may be partly the purpose of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, but it is unclear if the immunolabelling was done following Triton X-100 or digitonin permeabilization.</italic> </p><p>As stated above, we now included this important control as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref> in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) With respect to the Atlastin results, I have only a single query. INM protein localization appears insensitive to ATL3 knockdown but is inhibited by cytATL3 expression. My first thought was that this might simply reflect lower expression levels of ATL3 versus ATL2.</italic> </p><p>These are very valid comments. With respect to retardation of INM targeting upon cytATL3 addition, we reason that this may be due to the formation of mixed dimers between exogenously added cytATL3 and endogenous Atlastin 2 (as well as homodimers with ATL3), as has been previously observed for over-expressed proteins by Rismanchi et al., 2008. We had already stated this in our Discussion:</p><p>âThe potent impairment of INM targeting by cytATL3 may, however, suggest that Atlastins form mixed dimers under those conditions using excess recombinant protein, similar to what has been observed before (Rismanchi et al., 2008).â</p><p>The clear difference in phenotypic defects upon loss of ATL2 or 3 is indeed intriguing. Like the reviewers assumed, we also initially thought that this could be due to higher levels of ATL2 compared to ATL3 in HeLa cells. However, we have tried to estimate Atlastin levels by quantitative immunoblotting of HeLa cell extracts. These preliminary experiments suggested that ATL3 might be more abundant in HeLa cells than ATL2. As quantitative immunoblotting can sometimes lead to artifacts, we conclude that future work must use adequate assays like quantitative mass spectrometry to measure the relative abundance of Atlastins in different cell lines and tissues.</p><p><italic>However, export of VSV G protein appears to be inhibited by both ATL2 and ATL3 knockdown. Why might this be the case? Is it possible that accessing ER exit sites in the peripheral ER is more sensitive to even small changes in ER topology than accessing the ONM and associated ER cisternae? Perhaps the authors could address this in an amended Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We would like to note that the defects in enrichment of the VSVG reporter at the Golgi upon loss of ATL3 are mild as compared to those observed upon loss of ATL2. Still, as noted by the reviewers, ATL3 depletion affects ER exit, and we currently do not have a molecular explanation for this observation. It could be that ER to Golgi transport is more sensitive to ATL3 depletion because ATL3 depletion specifically affects membrane organization of domains relevant for ER to Golgi transport. Interestingly, the Blackstone laboratory has observed differences in the localization of ATL2 and ATL3 (Rismanchi et al., 2008). We now comment on this issue in the Discussion, to read:</p><p>âIntriguingly, ER exit of VSVG was not only perturbed upon depletion of ATL2 but also slightly affected by loss of ATL3. [â¦] This may simply reflect ER escape of Atlastins accompanying the flux of membranes to the Golgi. Alternatively, it could also hint at a more specific role of Atlastins in maintaining the topology of the transitional ER.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
