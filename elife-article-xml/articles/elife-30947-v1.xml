Infective L3 stage larvae take 3–6 days to migrate from the skin to the pleural cavity, where they remain for the duration of infection. In susceptible BALB/c mice parasites mature, mate and produce microfilariae that circulate in the bloodstream from ~day 55 post infection (pi). In contrast to BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice are considered resistant because the number of adult nematodes recoverable from the pleural cavity declines from ~day 22–55 and parasites do not reach sexual maturity or produce microfilariae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoffmann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graham et al., 2005</xref>).

F4/80<sup>hi</sup> resMΦ of the serous cavities are initially derived from F4/80<sup>hi</sup> yolk-sac and foetal liver MΦ, prior to the establishment of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) which give rise to F4/80<sup>lo </sup>bone marrow derived MΦ (bmMΦ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yona et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schulz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ginhoux et al., 2010</xref>). F4/80<sup>hi</sup> resMΦ and recently recruited F4/80<sup>lo</sup> bmMΦ possess distinct M(IL-4) activation profiles upon stimulation with IL-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gundra et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>MΦ are one of the most abundant cell populations within the pleural cavity during <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> infection, yet the composition of the myeloid compartment over the course of infection in resistant and susceptible strains remains unexplored. Consequently, we decided to compare the dynamics of MΦ accumulation during <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> infection between C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. We specifically asked whether differences in MΦ origin, accumulation and activation phenotype correlate with functional consequences regarding parasite clearance and whether these differences could resolve dichotomous functions associated with M(IL-4). We demonstrate striking differences in myeloid cell dynamics between resistant C57BL/6 mice and susceptible BALB/c mice. In particular, the F4/80<sup>hi</sup> resMΦ population in both naïve and infected C57BL/6 mice was steadily replenished by bmMΦ that assume residency markers GATA6 and CD102. Infection of C57BL/6 mice led to proliferative expansion of the F4/80<sup>hi</sup> resMΦ population, regardless of origin. In contrast, in BALB/c mice, recently recruited bmMΦ failed to successfully integrate into the resident niche and assumed an PD-L2<sup>+</sup> M(IL-4) phenotype that contribute to host susceptibility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Resistant C57BL/6 mice show enhanced F4/80<sup>hi </sup>MΦ accumulation</title><p>Our first objective was to compare the cellular infiltrate in resistant C57BL/6 versus susceptible BALB/c strains across the infection time course. We therefore examined the pleural compartment of infected animals at day 11, 28, 35 and 50 pi. These time points reflected known F4/80<sup>hi</sup> MΦ proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jenkins et al., 2011</xref>), L4-adult worm moulting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoffmann et al., 2000</xref>), the peak of cellular accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babayan et al., 2003</xref>) and a final time point prior to microfilarial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoffmann et al., 2000</xref>), respectively. As early as day 11 pi there were significantly more cells isolated from the pleural cavity of resistant C57BL/6 mice as compared to susceptible BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This greater cellularity was due predominantly to significantly higher MΦ numbers along with more B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The remaining infiltrate consisted of neutrophils, T cells and eosinophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Neutrophil numbers were significantly higher in infected C57BL/6 mice at day 28 and 35 pi but represented less than 1% of the total cells. Only eosinophils and T cells were significantly higher in BALB/c mice and only at day 50, a difference likely due to the presence of parasites in BALB/c but not C57BL/6 mice at the later time point. We next assessed the contribution of F4/80<sup>hi</sup> and F4/80<sup>lo</sup> MΦ to the increase in total MΦ number. Due to the emergence of a Ly6C<sup>+</sup> population within the pleural cavity of infected mice, cells expressing lower levels of F4/80 were further subdivided into F4/80<sup>lo</sup>MHC<sup>hi</sup>Ly6C<sup>-</sup> monocyte-derived macrophages (F4/80<sup>lo</sup>) and recently recruited F4/80<sup>lo</sup>MHC<sup>lo-hi</sup>Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, the monocyte gate contained Lin<sup>-</sup>(CD19, Ly6G, SiglecF, TCRβ), CSF-1R<sup>+</sup>, F4/80<sup>lo</sup>, Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells. This gating strategy revealed that the enhanced MΦ number observed in C57BL/6 mice as compared to BALB/c mice was reflective of an expanded F4/80<sup>hi</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). There were also more F4/80<sup>lo</sup> MΦ in the C57BL/6 strain but only at day 11 pi. F4/80<sup>lo</sup> MΦ numbers did not differ significantly between strains throughout the remainder of the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, although C57BL/6 mice displayed increased numbers of monocytes throughout the infection as compared to their naïve controls, BALB/c mice were marked by a significant influx of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes first observed at day 35 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, the immune response to the parasite in C57BL/6 mice was characterised by increased numbers of F4/80<sup>hi</sup> MΦ and B cells from day 11 pi. In contrast, susceptible BALB/c mice showed significantly less F4/80<sup>hi</sup> cell expansion and an influx of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes from day 35 pi.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30947.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Enhanced F4/80<sup>hi</sup> MΦ and B cell numbers are associated with resistance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Difference in total exudate cell, MΦ and B cell number between naïve and <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> infected C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice at day 11, 28, 35 and 50 pi.

In naïve C57BL/6 mice, the percentage of MΦ expressing GATA6 was significantly reduced by 15 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) reflective of the age-related decline in the proportion of F4/80<sup>hi</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, there was no decline in GATA6 within the MΦ compartment of infected C57BL/6 mice and CD102 expression was sustained at a higher level in infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent with maintenance of the F4/80<sup>hi</sup> phenotype at 90% of the total MΦ pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>The MΦ dynamics of the BALB/c strain were distinct from the outset, with the F4/80<sup>hi</sup> population representing 70–80% of the MΦ compartment at 8 weeks of age/day 11 pi, slightly lower than what was observed in the C57BL/6 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). A more pronounced decline in the proportion of F4/80<sup>hi</sup> cells contributing to the total MΦ compartment was observed in both naïve and infected BALB/c mice over the time course.

In contrast to C57BL/6 mice, <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> infection in the BALB/c strain did not prevent the age-related decrease in the proportion of F4/80<sup>hi</sup> cells.

The stark differences between the two strains in both naïve animals and at day 35 pi was highlighted using dimensionality reduction analysis of multi-parametric flow cytometry in combination with traditional population gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Resistant C57BL/6 mice maintain the F4/80<sup>hi</sup> resMΦ population through proliferative expansion</title><p>We have previously demonstrated a peak of F4/80<sup>hi</sup> proliferation in the pleural cavity at day 10 pi with <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jenkins et al., 2013</xref>). To address whether the enhanced F4/80<sup>hi</sup> resMΦ numbers at day 35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is a result of continued proliferation after d10 pi, we assessed Ki67 expression levels over the infection time course. Cells that exhibit a high level of Ki67 expression after staining with the BD clone B56 have been shown to be actively dividing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jenkins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davies et al., 2011</xref>). Of the time points measured, F4/80<sup>hi</sup> resMΦ proliferation peaked above naive levels at day 11 pi only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and was significantly greater in the C57BL/6 strain compared to BALB/c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Although we only observed Ki67<sup>hi</sup> staining above background at day 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), the F4/80<sup>hi</sup> MΦ population continued to increase between day 28 and day 35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Experiments in <italic>Ccr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> C57BL/6 mice demonstrated that F4/80<sup>hi</sup> MΦ expansion at d28 pi was not significantly altered making it unlikely that bone marrow derived cells were contributing to the increased numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). We thus hypothesised that additional proliferative bursts between day 11–35 pi would account for this, perhaps in combination with reduced cell death. Measuring proliferation every day would be challenging due to infective larval availability, we therefore decided to use shielded bone marrow chimeras to firmly establish whether the increased F4/80<sup>hi</sup> population at day 35 and 50 pi was the result of local F4/80<sup>hi</sup> expansion or recruitment and conversion of monocytes into the F4/80<sup>hi</sup> pool. Shielding the upper body including the pleural space of CD45.1<sup>+/+</sup> C57BL/6 mice from radiation, allows the generation of chimeric mice in which the degree of bone marrow contribution to cells in protected tissues can be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jenkins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Murphy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baratin et al., 2017</xref>). The proportion of a particular cell population that is bone marrow derived can be calculated by dividing the percentage of donor CD45.2<sup>+</sup> cells in the tissue of interest with that observed in blood Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes. Full bone marrow replacement will show equivalent chimerism with the blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Over the next two weeks chimerism increased further to ~80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Critically, despite near identical chimerism between infected and naïve mice at both day 35 and day 50, infected mice possessed a MΦ population size that was 27-fold larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus the increased contribution of bmMΦ to the F4/80<sup>hi</sup> pool was an age related phenomena, the rate of which was not accelerated by nematode infection. This data is supported by the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bain et al., 2016</xref> showing a gradual replenishment of the pleural F4/80<sup>hi</sup> population by bmMΦ with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bain et al., 2016</xref>). In that study, the level of bone marrow cell contribution to the pleural MΦ compartment is ~50% by 19 weeks of age. In our experiments, experimental mice were approximately 18 weeks of age at the time of infection. Thus by the time the mice were infected with <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic>, a substantial proportion of the F4/80<sup>hi</sup> population had already been replenished from the bone marrow. Because the ratio of recruited to resident is identical in naïve vs infected animals, throughout the infection time course, the far greater resMΦ numbers in C57BL/6 mice are not due to infection-driven recruitment of bone-marrow derived cells. Instead, higher F4/80<sup>hi</sup> numbers presumably result from in situ proliferation of the resMΦ population in infected mice regardless of origin.</p><p>All of F4/80<sup>hi</sup> MΦ were positive for residency markers GATA6 and CD102 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Comparison of GATA6 and CD102 expression by donor- and host-derived F4/80<sup>hi</sup> MΦ within naïve and infected C57BL/6 mice revealed that donor-derived cells were equally capable of expressing these residency markers as host-derived cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). Thus successful integration of bmMΦ cells into the resMΦ niche is exemplified by expression of GATA6 and CD102, a process that is not altered by infection. The situation was different for Tim4, also considered a marker of resident F4/80<sup>hi</sup> MΦ within the pleural space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davies et al., 2011</xref>). Unlike GATA6 and CD102, which uniformly marked the F4/80<sup>hi</sup> population, only 46 ± 1.6% of the F4/80<sup>hi</sup> population was TIM4<sup>+</sup> in naïve animals aged 23–25 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In naïve controls at 25 weeks of age, an equal proportion of donor and host F4/80<sup>hi</sup> cells were negative for Tim-4. This data is consistent with the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bain et al., 2016</xref> that even long-lived bone marrow derived cells do not universally take on Tim4 expression in the steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bain et al., 2016</xref>). The striking result here was that <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> infection induced TIM4 expression on the F4/80<sup>hi</sup> population, with 76 ± 4% staining TIM4 positive at day 35 and 50 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), and by day 50 Tim4 expression more closely resembled that of GATA6 and CD102 with the majority of both donor and host F4/80<sup>hi</sup> cells expressing Tim4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F&amp;G</xref>). The data suggest that Tim4, both in the steady state but particularly during infection is not a reliable marker of MΦ origin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Macrophages from BALB/c mice exhibit enhanced PD-L2 expression, which associates with reduced worm killing</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bain et al., 2016</xref> have recently highlighted that in naïve mice RELMα is expressed by bone marrow precursors (F4/80<sup>lo</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup>CSF1R<sup>+</sup>) to the F4/80<sup>hi</sup> resMΦ pool and that RELMα transiently marks cells of monocytic origin. Consistent with this finding, we observed ~60 and~80% of the F4/80<sup>lo</sup> MΦ were RELMα positive in naïve C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice respectively, while ~10% and ~50% were RELMα positive in the respective F4/80<sup>hi</sup> populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This data along with dimensionality reduction analysis of multi-parametric flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) illustrated fundamental differences in the dynamics of incoming cells between the strains. Downregulation of RELMα may be part of the process by which F4/80<sup>lo</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup>CSF1R<sup>+</sup>MΦ convert to F4/80<sup>hi</sup> resMΦ in naïve animals. If so, the higher RELMα positivity within the F4/80<sup>hi</sup> population of BALB/c mice may reflect a relatively poor ability of BALB/c mice to promote bmMΦ integration into the resMΦ niche.

Anti-CCR2 was administered daily from day 31–34-post infection and PLEC were examined at day 35 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Antibody treatment in this time frame successfully prevented the influx of monocytes into the pleural cavity, resulting in the F4/80<sup>hi</sup> population representing ~80% of the total MΦ compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Inhibiting monocyte infiltration resulted in significantly increased worm killing in the normally susceptible BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

We also highlight striking differences in the dynamics of serous cavity MΦs between two commonly used laboratory mouse strains. Resistance against <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> in C57BL/6 mice was associated with the predominance of an M(IL-4) F4/80<sup>hi</sup>GATA6<sup>+</sup>CD102<sup>+</sup> resMΦ population that accumulated through proliferation of the existing population. The resMΦ phenotype within the serous cavities is in part determined by the retinoic acid-dependent master transcription factor GATA6 and additional retinoic acid independent genes such as CD102 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Okabe and Medzhitov, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rosas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bain et al., 2016</xref>). Here we show that bmMΦ successfully integrated into the resMΦ niche, as defined by GATA6 and CD102 expression in both naïve and infected animals. This data re-enforces the finding that resMΦ of the serous cavity are replenished from the bone marrow in an age-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bain et al., 2016</xref>). We further show that despite a dramatic increase in MΦ number within the cavity as well as infection-dependent changes in phenotype, helminth infection does not alter the homeostatic rate of age-dependent replenishment. The data suggests that regardless of the size of the macrophage pool inherent differences in proliferation, survival and death between long-term and recent entrants into the resident pool can maintain the ratio of bone-marrow to embryonically-derived cells in the pleural cavity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Resistance was also associated with a greater degree of pleural B cell accumulation. B cells and their antibody products play a central role in anti-nematode immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Esser-von Bieren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rajan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carter et al., 2007</xref>) and we recently reported that during primary <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> infection, pleural cavity B cells proliferate and produce antigen-specific IgM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jackson-Jones et al., 2016</xref>). Collaboration between MΦ and antibodies to trap and kill invading larvae has been demonstrated during secondary <italic>H. polygurus</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Esser-von Bieren et al., 2013</xref>). Experiments in a related model of filarial nematode infection in the peritoneal cavity demonstrate that resident MΦ actively contribute to larval death (unpublished data). Consequently, we hypothesise that local IgM and MΦ together function in granuloma formation, eventually leading to death of the <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> worm in resistant C57BL/6 mice.</p><p>Susceptibility in the BALB/c strain was marked by significantly less F4/80<sup>hi</sup> macrophage proliferation. Additionally, the F4/80<sup>hi</sup>GATA6<sup>+</sup>CD102<sup>+</sup> resMΦ population within both naïve and infected BALB/c mice diminished with age while the percentage of bmMΦ contributing to the MΦ compartment increased. Such dynamics are suggestive of an inability of influxing bmMΦ to integrate into the resMΦ niche of BALB/c mice and could reflect a deficit in local retinoic acid. Indeed a recent study has highlighted the inability bmMΦ to integrate into the resMΦ niche of C57BL/6 mice on a Vitamin A deficient diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gundra et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively bmMΦ in BALB/c mice may be transcriptionally silenced at the GATA6 locus as has been noted for thioglycollate elicited MΦ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Okabe and Medzhitov, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Infection in the BALB/c strain was also marked by an influx of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes by day 35 pi. resulting in a large proportion of the myeloid compartment possessing a recently recruited F4/80<sup>lo</sup>MHCII<sup>hi</sup> phenotype by day 50 pi. Because these cells preferentially express PD-L2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gundra et al., 2014</xref>), there was also a greater degree of PD-L2 expression upon M(IL-4) activation. Monocyte depletion prior to day 35 pi revealed an immunosuppressive role for monocytes and F4/80<sup>lo</sup> M(IL-4) during <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> infection, with an enhanced T<sub>H</sub>2 profile.</p><p>While our data demonstrate a role for the incoming monocytes in the susceptibility of BALB/c mice, we are not asserting that differences in monocyte recruitment are the sole reason for differences in strain susceptibility. We hypothesise that susceptibility in the BALB/c strain arises from a combination of factors, beginning with a failure to generate resMΦ and B cell numbers equivalent to that seen in the resistant strain. Secondarily, we hypothesize that this deficit in resMΦ and B cells is confounded by an influx of bone-marrow derived macrophages which assume an immunosuppressive PD-L2+ phenotype which fail to integrate into the resident niche, thereby affecting the ability of MΦ to function in an anti-helminthic manner. A role for PD-L2 expressing cells in mediating susceptibility in BALB/c mice during <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> infection has already been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van der Werf et al., 2013</xref>) and the immunosuppressive monocytes we observe likely contribute to the T regulatory response that is important for susceptibility to <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Taylor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Taylor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Taylor et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, the effects of Treg depletion while significant are similarly modest to the effects seen here with monocyte depletion further suggesting that Treg expansion and immunosuppressive monocytes are not alone responsible for susceptibility.</p><p>It is notable that a similar influx of monocytes that mature into PD-L2<sup>+</sup> bmMΦ is seen in the liver of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pearce and MacDonald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nascimento et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gundra et al., 2014</xref>). While depletion of this immunosuppressive bmMΦ population during <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection results in an enhanced T<sub>H</sub>2 immune response it is also marked by reduced granuloma formation and severely exacerbated disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nascimento et al., 2014</xref>). A direct host-protective role of these cells is illustrated in a study whereby PD-L2<sup>+</sup> bmMΦ isolated from <italic>T. crassiceps</italic> infected mice reduce the disease burden during experimental autoimmune encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Terrazas et al., 2017a</xref>). In both studies the immunosuppressive impact of PD-L2<sup>+</sup> bmMΦ were observed late in infection. Although PD-L2 inhibits protective immunity to <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van der Werf et al., 2013</xref>), we were unable to demonstrate that the immunosuppressive capacity of bone-marrow derived M(IL-4) at this time point was due to PD-L2, and suspect that day 35 is too early to see a PD-L2 dependent effect.</p><p>Whether eventual parasite death within the BALB/c strain results because of a decline in immunosuppressive bmM(IL-4) or successful integration of these cells into the resMΦ niche remains to be explored. Indeed, as <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection progresses, PD-L2<sup>+</sup> bmMΦ integrate into the resident niche enabling disease resolution. In the absence of vitamin A, integration into the resident niche is inhibited and enhanced mortality pursues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gundra et al., 2017</xref>). Together with our data these studies suggest that monocyte-derived macrophages are critical regulators of host immunity, which can tip the fine balance between infection control and host damage. As such we hypothesise that bmMΦ upon infiltration into an inflammatory milieu containing IL-4 take on an immunosuppressive phenotype, to prevent self-damage associated with more classical inflammatory pathways. Of note, similar differences in monocyte recruitment might contribute to susceptibility and resistance between BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice to <italic>Leishmania donovani.</italic> A recent publication by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Terrazas et al., 2017b</xref>) demonstrated that CCR2 dependent monocytes contributed to host susceptibility in BALB/c mice. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sato et al., 1999</xref> found no role for CCR2 in mediating resistance in C57BL/6 mice, suggesting that the difference we observed here may be a fundamental difference between these strains that goes beyond helminth infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and experimental grouping</title><p>Female BALB/c mice, congenic CD45.1<sup>+/+</sup> / CD45.2<sup>+/+</sup> C57BL/6 mice, and C<italic>cr2</italic>-/-mice were bred in house and maintained in specific pathogen free (SPF) facility at the University of Edinburgh. <italic>Ccr2</italic>-/-mice were originally sourced from Jackson Laboratories (C57BL/6 <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>tm1lfc</sup>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michel Nussenzweig as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Steffen Jung (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, killing of filarial nematodes the pleural space in dependence of IL-4 activated macrophages (MΦ) was investigated in two mouse strains with graded susceptibility. The investigators show that MΦ proliferation in situ was a dominant cause of MΦ expansion in infected resistant B6 mice. In contrast, BALB/c mice showed a reduced population of resident MΦ, but an increased influx of immunosuppressive PD-L2<sup>+</sup> monocytes, which inhibited parasite killing. Overall, this is very interesting work providing in vivo evidence that the myeloid cell composition in the pleural space is essential for parasite killing, and that incoming monocytes impair resistance. It is particularly interesting that BALB/c mice fail to integrate bone-marrow derived MΦ into the residency pool.</p><p>The presented experiments are convincing and scientifically sound.</p><p>The paper does not provide a clear-cut mechanism by which the differential representation of the two macrophage populations (F4/80 high vs. low) mediates resistance and susceptibility to infection, respectively. The study remains correlative and does not offer any data on effector functions of the two macrophage populations. Also, the work does not exclude the possibility that the differential outcome of infection is related to indirect/secondary effects of the macrophage populations. The putative direct impact of the macrophage populations on the protective Th2 response remained rather weak and is unlikely to fully explain the differential clinical phenotype of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. These alternative options should be discussed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The phenotypic differences between B6 and BALB/c mice are complex due to the different development of the parasites in these mice. As outlined in the Introduction, in susceptible BALB/c mice, microfilariae are produced and circulate in the bloodstream of B/c mice starting at 55 days post infection. In contrast to BALB/c mice, microfilariae are not produced in B6 mice. The differences between the mouse strains in the pleural macrophage dynamics are striking. Yet, I am not fully convinced that the late monocyte influx in BALB/c mice is the major difference between the mouse strains, since the effect of the CCR2 mAb is rather modest.</p><p>Furthermore, the paper would be stronger, if effects were always shown site by site between the strains.</p><p>2) The dynamics in total pleural cell numbers in infected mice can only partially be explained by changes in the myeloid cells and B cells. As an example at day 28, macrophages, monocytes and B-cells sum up to around 7 x 106 out of 20 x 106 cells. What are the other cells?</p><p>3) I am missing monocyte subset definition. Are all monocytes Ly6Chi?</p><p>4) Please show neutrophil influx during infection: less than 1% of cells correspond to the monocyte influx early in infection.</p><p>5) The expression of CD102 and GATA6 is hard to grasp from the provided data. Please provide original dot blots of day 50 mice with and without infection (supplementary data).</p><p>6) The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are incomplete, i.e. not conclusive in the current form. The kinetics of Ki67 staining does not follow that of the cellular expansion. Please provide additional data, in particular BrDU staining.</p><p>7) The half-life of pleural MΦ in the bone marrow chimeras is not plausible. The half-life is around 13 weeks at day 35 (8 weeks resting plus 5 weeks experiment), but 2 weeks between day 35 and day 50. How is that?</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>: Please show original dot blots in the supplement.</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.: Whereas the data on PD-L2<sup>+</sup> monocytes are intriguing, the interpretation of the T-cell data is not acceptable. Please remove the statement on a “slight trend&quot;, there is no difference in T-cells, IL5<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> cells and GATA3<sup>+</sup> CD4 cells between the strains.</p><p>10) The numbers of mice from the same condition differ between the panels, e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4: 5</xref> or 6 infected BALB/c mice? Why is this? Please explain in detail.</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Please eliminate the statement on a trend (see above).</p><p>12) Statistics: Please prove normal distribution of values or use a non-parametric test. In this regard I am particularly doubtful about <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>! In the same panel: If the authors wish to show that more mice with intervention than with the control cleared the infection – as elaborated in the text – a completely different analysis is required. Otherwise, please remove the statement and adjust the statistics.</p><p>13) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: The authors state that the presented data are pooled from two separate time course experiments (day 11 + 28 and day 35 + 50). However, the data are presented as continuous line graphs, which should only be used if all data points are from one time course experiment. Please change into bar graph and explicitly label column 1 + 2 as &quot;experiment 1&quot; and column 3 + 4 as &quot;experiment 2&quot;.</p><p>14) It remains unclear from the text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>, why the authors chose a partial irradiation of the mice, in which not only the chest and abdomen, but also the upper extremities were protected against irradiation. Essentially, this means that the recipient mouse has quite significant residual bone marrow activity, as hematopoiesis is not restricted to long bones of the lower extremities and also take places in the upper extremities, sternum, pelvis etc. In order to calculate the contribution of bone derived-macrophages vs. resident tissue macrophages to the cellular exudates in the pleural cavity, it would have been sufficient to shield the chest alone in order to minimize bone marrow activity derived from the recipient; the donor (BM-derived) and recipient (tissue-resident) macrophages can be distinguished just by the congenic CD45 alleles. As it stands, the authors need to better specify and explain the contribution of CD45.2<sup>+</sup> (derived from donor bone marrow) and CD45.1<sup>+</sup> macrophages (derived from residual recipient bone marrow) to the macrophage pool in the pleural space. Most importantly, the authors wanted to establish, whether the increased F4/80high population at day 35 and 50 post infection was the result of local F4/80high proliferation or of a recruitment and conversion of monocytes into the F4/80high pool (subsection “Resistant C57BL/6 mice maintain the F4/80<sup>hi</sup> resMΦ population”, first paragraph). There is no clear answer to this question in this subsection, and probably also not possible due to the fact that recipient bone-marrow-derived macrophages expressing high amounts of F4/80 cannot be distinguished from F4/80high macrophages derived from the resident tissue macrophage population.</p><p>15) Has it ever been tested whether the resident tissue macrophages in the pleural space are radiosusceptible or radioresistant?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30947.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The phenotypic differences between B6 and BALB/c mice are complex due to the different development of the parasites in these mice.

This is a highly complex chronic infection with a metazoan parasite. It is certain that multiple factors contribute to resistance or susceptibility and we do not believe a single cellular population can explain susceptibility. Indeed, previous papers demonstrating a significant role for Treg cells in susceptibility to <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> similarly do not show dramatic changes – nonetheless they are significant and consistent effects [1-3]. We hypothesize that susceptibility in the BALB/c strain arises from a combination of factors, beginning with a failure to generate resMΦ and B cell numbers equivalent to that seen in the resistant strain. Secondarily, we hypothesize that this deficit in resMΦ and B cells is confounded by an influx of bone-marrow derived macrophages which assume an immunosuppressive PD-L2<sup>+</sup> phenotype and fail to integrate into the resident niche, thereby affecting the ability of MΦ to function in an anti-helminthic manner. A clear role for PD-L2 expressing cells in mediating susceptibility in BALB/c mice during <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> infection has already been demonstrated [4]. Critically, we are not asserting that differences in monocyte recruitment are the most important or sole reason for differences in strain susceptibility. We have worked to clarify the text in the Discussion to make this distinction clear and highlight the concept that multiple cell types must be contributing to resistance vs. susceptibility. Nonetheless, the manuscript does highlight real differences between resident and monocyte-derived cells in a relevant infection model. We further believe the great strength of the manuscript is in demonstrating that different genotypes exhibit very different myeloid recruitment/proliferation dynamics with an impact on infection outcome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the paper would be stronger, if effects were always shown site by site between the strains.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not certain what is being requested here. The only site in the paper is the pleural cavity. If the referee meant side by side, we believe that we have done this. We have made it clearer in the text and figure legend that each figure is referring to the pleural cavity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The dynamics in total pleural cell numbers in infected mice can only partially be explained by changes in the myeloid cells and B cells. As an example at day 28, macrophages, monocytes and B-cells sum up to around 7 x 106 out of 20 x 106 cells. What are the other cells?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very relevant question and we apologise that we did not make this clearer. All of the populations contributing to total cell number are now represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. We had originally stated ‘Neutrophils were also significantly higher in C57BL/6 mice at d28 and d35 but represented less than 1% of the total population, while T cells and eosinophils did not differ significantly between strains (data not shown)’. However, we appreciate it was not clear that eosinophils, T cells and neutrophils constitute the remainder of the total cell number. Consequently, along with the new supplemental figure, we have edited the text to more clearly convey the contribution of different cell types to the total pleural cell numbers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I am missing monocyte subset definition. Are all monocytes Ly6Chi?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the confusion. Due to imprecision of our wording in the sentence below, we may have misled the referee into thinking that we had subdivided the monocyte population. We stated:</p><p>‘To further characterise the MΦ dynamics, we profiled the percentage contribution of F4/80<sup>hi</sup>, F4/80<sup>lo</sup> and monocyte sub-populations to the MΦ compartment as a whole within each strain of naïve and infected animals’</p><p>The use of ‘sub-populations’ in this setting referred to total MΦ population; i.e. F4/80<sup>hi</sup>, F4/80<sup>lo</sup> and monocytes. We have altered the text as follows:</p><p>‘To further characterise the MΦ dynamics within the pleural cavity, we profiled the percentage contribution of F4/80<sup>hi</sup>, F4/80<sup>lo</sup> and monocyte populations to the MΦ compartment as a whole within each strain of naïve and infected animals.’</p><p>The following sentence was also added to more accurately convey the monocyte classification: ‘Thus the monocyte gate contained Lin-(CD19,Ly6G,SiglecF,TCRβ), CSF-1R<sup>+</sup>,F4/80lo,Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells.’</p><p>To further clarify the cell populations including Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> expression, we are including multi-parameter flow cytometric data from a recent repeat of <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> infection at Day 35. The Allen lab has moved from Edinburgh to Manchester and despite the change in animal unit and experimenter, the data has been highly repeatable. Indeed, the consistency of the findings is remarkable. We include the data as supplemental because the experiment was only performed once. Dimensionality reduction analysis of the flow cytometry data further illustrates the dramatic differences between the two strains, both in the steady state and at each infection time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please show neutrophil influx during infection: less than 1% of cells correspond to the monocyte influx early in infection.</p></disp-quote><p>The neutrophil data can now be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The expression of CD102 and GATA6 is hard to grasp from the provided data.

The kinetics of Ki67 staining does not follow that of the cellular expansion. Please provide additional data, in particular BrDU staining.</p></disp-quote><p>We presume the referee is suggesting that we are missing proliferation by using ki67<sup>hi+</sup> staining rather than BrDU. We do not believe this is the case. We have extensively verified that gating on Ki67<sup>hi</sup> cells using BD clone BV56 (and only this clone), specifically marks cells actively in cell cycle, overlapping with BrDU staining following a 3 hour pulse. This was shown in our original J. Exp. Med and Science papers describing proliferation in this nematode model [5,6] and subsequently in our more recent Science paper where it can be clearly seen that all BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells are contained within the Ki67hi population. Please see Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>: www.sciencemag.org/content/356/6342/1076/suppl/DC1. The validity of using Ki67hi has been further confirmed independently by Phil Taylor [7] using pHH3 staining, which provides a definitive marker of proliferative events.</p><p>Of course, this does not resolve the concern of the referee about the apparent disconnect between the proliferation we observe and cellular expansion, as the increased number of F4/80<sup>hi</sup> cells at day 28 and 35 could not be explained by Ki67<sup>hi</sup> staining at these time points. Based on our experience with this model in which we have observed small proliferative resurgences, we assumed that proliferation occurred outside the time points examined. However, a detailed time course to identify transient proliferative peaks between day 11 and 35 post infection is not practical in terms of parasite availability or cost. It was exactly for this reason that we generated shielded bone marrow chimeras.</p><p>The use of the bone marrow chimeras allowed us to establish definitively whether the increase in number was due to local expansion or recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells. This is a well-established technique for this purpose [5,8-10].</p><p>We have now included data from CCR2 deficient mice(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which was a major reason for our decision to proceed with chimeras. The increased F4/80<sup>hi</sup> cell numbers within the pleural cavity of C57BL/6 mice at day 28 post <italic>L. sigmodontis</italic> infection, was unchanged in the CCR2 deficient animals supporting our hypothesis of local expansion.</p><p>An additional possibility, which may partially contribute to increased cell numbers is that in the context of infection fewer macrophages may be dying between d11 and later time points. In other words, even if proliferation is not higher than steady state levels at many time points, if IL-4 provides a survival signal and fewer cells die in that time frame, cell numbers would increase.</p><p>We have made an effort to clarify these points in the text and data from CCR2-/- C57BL/6 mice has been included in the form of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The half-life of pleural MΦ in the bone marrow chimeras is not plausible. The half-life is around 13 weeks at day 35 (8 weeks resting plus 5 weeks experiment), but 2 weeks between day 35 and day 50. How is that?</p></disp-quote><p>We too were surprised by the increased in BMD macrophage contribution between 23-25 weeks of age / 35-50 days pi.</p><p>We don’t believe the difference is due to some artifact of the system because there was no significant difference between the two time points in the blood chimerism on which the data is calculated.</p><p>The data instead suggests that during aging there is a point at which the contribution of monocyte derived cells increases sharply rather than being a steady accumulation over time. Bain et al. (2016) showed that replacement of pleural macrophages in naive B/6 mice is 25% at 12 weeks and 85% at 36 weeks, while we observe 45% at 23 weeks and 75% at 25 weeks. We hypothesise that there is a sigmoidal curve in which in the early time points there is a slow replacement of the resident cells with bone marrow derived cells and that this process increases sharply for a period in adulthood (e.g. 23-25 weeks) before leveling off near maximum.</p><p>Consistent with this finding is unpublished data from Stephen Jenkin’s lab in which bone marrow from young mice were transferred into young (8w red) and old (37 wk blue) mice.

The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> has now been re-analysed using ANOVA with experiment and treatment as independent variables. We verified that the residuals followed a normal distribution confirming that the models assumptions were met. We tested for interactions between experiment and treatment to confirm that treatment effects were not dependent upon experimental repeat (i.e. all repeats showed the same effect). – The significant treatment effect on worm recovery, F4/80lo, monocytes and% GATA3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> expressing IL-4 were maintained with this analysis.</p><p>To give specific details for the data behind <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>.

However, there was no significant interaction between experiment and treatment (p&lt;0.3216). This indicates that the different repeats showed significantly different baseline infection levels, but that MC-21 had the same treatment effect in each repeat (interaction was non-significant). Variation in infection levels between experiments is normal. Thus, there is a significant effect of MC-21 treatment on parasite burden.</p><p>On reanalysis of the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we found the data failed to meet the conditions for a parametric test, thus non-parametric Kruskal wallis test was carried out, followed by Mann-Whitney.

Outside of this, all previously noted difference held true.

Essentially, this means that the recipient mouse has quite significant residual bone marrow activity, as hematopoiesis is not restricted to long bones of the lower extremities and also take places in the upper extremities, sternum, pelvis etc. In order to calculate the contribution of bone derived-macrophages vs. resident tissue macrophages to the cellular exudates in the pleural cavity, it would have been sufficient to shield the chest alone in order to minimize bone marrow activity derived from the recipient; the donor (BM-derived) and recipient (tissue-resident) macrophages can be distinguished just by the congenic CD45 alleles.</p></disp-quote><p>We were restricted by the shield we had available. However, we fail to fully understand the reviewers concern. The level of shielding would not change the interpretation of the experiment. There will still be recipient bone marrow left in head and leg-irradiated mice, so instead of 30% chimerism one might get 70% chimerism. Although this may offer some additional sensitivity, the method of analysis would not change. Please note that an almost identical approach and level of shielding was used recently to identify the turnover of resident macrophages in skin draining lymph nodes [8].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As it stands, the authors need to better specify and explain the contribution of CD45.2<sup>+</sup> (derived from donor bone marrow) and CD45.1<sup>+</sup> macrophages (derived from residual recipient bone marrow) to the macrophage pool in the pleural space. Most importantly, the authors wanted to establish, whether the increased F4/80high population at day 35 and 50 post infection was the result of local F4/80high proliferation or of a recruitment and conversion of monocytes into the F4/80high pool (subsection “Resistant C57BL/6 mice maintain the F4/80<sup>hi</sup> resMΦ population”, first paragraph). There is no clear answer to this question in this subsection, and probably also not possible due to the fact that recipient bone-marrow-derived macrophages expressing high amounts of F4/80 cannot be distinguished from F4/80high macrophages derived from the resident tissue macrophage population.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe there must be some misunderstanding here. The use of shielded chimeras is necessary because pleural cavity resident macrophage are radiosusceptible (question below) and so would be replaced by bone marrow derived cells. By calculating the ratio of chimerism in the blood to that in the pleural cavity, we can calculate the bone marrow contribution to the resident macrophage pool in the steady state and during infection. Because the chimerism of F4/80<sup>hi+</sup> macrophages in the pleural cavity does not change on infection (low BM contribution relative to the blood), the increase in F4/80<sup>hi</sup> cell numbers in the infected animals cannot be explained by enhanced cell recruitment (which would be indicated by higher levels of chimerism in cells from infected vs naïve mice), and therefore must be due to local expansion. We have added text to further explain why the shielded chimeras were necessary and included references to demonstrate that this is a well-established technique for this purpose [5,8-10]. We may have relied too much on published data rather than explaining this procedure in sufficient detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Has it ever been tested whether the resident tissue macrophages in the pleural space are radiosusceptible or radioresistant?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, it was already well established that peritoneal macrophages are replaced from the bone marrow on full body irradiation [11] but Stephen Jenkins has firmly established this is also true for the pleural cavity. In fully irradiated mice the chimerism of F4/80<sup>hi</sup> cells in the pleural cavity is identical to that of blood monocytes.</p><p>Literature Cited:</p><p>1) Taylor MD, LeGoff L, Harris A, Malone E, Allen JE, Maizels RM.
