Recent studies have suggested cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition could represent a novel treatment approach or augmentation strategy for affective disorders including anxiety disorders and major depression. We show that traditional COX-2 inhibitors and a newly developed substrate-selective COX-2 inhibitor (SSCI) reduce a variety of stress-induced behavioral pathologies in mice. We found that these behavioral effects were associated with a dampening of neuronal excitability in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) ex vivo and in vivo, and were mediated by small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channel and CB1 cannabinoid receptor activation. Taken together, these data provide further support for the potential utility of SSCIs, as well as traditional COX-2 inhibitors, as novel treatment approaches for stress-related psychiatric disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14137.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14137.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14137.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>People may experience a stressful or traumatic event that can cause anxiety in their day-to-day lives. For some people, this anxiety can persist and develop into a disorder, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or acute stress disorder. Millions of people worldwide suffer from these disorders, but there are few classes of drug treatments currently available. Some preliminary studies in mice have suggested that anti-inflammatory drugs called cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors may relieve symptoms of anxiety.</p><p>COX-2 inhibitors target an enzyme called cyclooxygenase-2, which is produced in many tissues throughout the body and brain. Some COX-2 inhibitors, such as Celebrex, are already widely used to treat arthritis. Studies in people have also suggested these drugs given in combination with antidepressants might also help people with depression, while a recently developed COX-2 inhibitor, called LM-4131, stops the breakdown of chemicals produced in the brain that interact with the same brain receptors that marijuana does. In animal studies, this new drug reduced anxious behaviors. However, scientists didnât know if the drug would also reduce anxious behaviors after animals were exposed to a traumatic or stressful experience.</p><p>Now, Gamble-George et al. â including some of the same scientists that created LM-4131 â show this drug does reduce anxious behavior in mice after a traumatic or stressful experience. In the experiments, mice were stressed with an electric shock to their feet and then treated with LM-4131, Celebrex, another COX-2 inhibitor sometimes used in humans, or an inactive control. The mice were then placed in new environments or mazes high off the ground that usually trigger anxious behavior. The mice treated with any of the three COX-2 inhibitors were less likely to act like they were anxious than the mice treated with the control solution.</p><p>Gamble-George et al. then showed that LM-4131 changes how cells in the brain become excited in both isolated mouse brain cells and live mice. Short-term stress in humans is known to excite cells in an area of the brain called the amygdala, which controls how we respond to stress or trauma. The experiments showed that LM-4131 decreases this activity and decreases anxiety in stressed mice. Future animal and human studies are needed to confirm that COX-2 inhibitors are a useful treatment for stress disorders, and learn more about how they work.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14137.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14137.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>COX-2</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>cannabinoid</kwd><kwd>PTSD</kwd><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH100096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>Sachin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM15431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marnett</surname><given-names>Lawrence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mechanistically distinct COX-2 inhibitors reduce stress-induced behavioral pathology via unique multimodal molecular mechanisms, and could be used to treat mood disorders.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mood and anxiety disorders including major depression, generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder are the most common psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2012</xref>).

A number of preliminary studies also suggest that inhibition of COX-2 could have anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like behavioral effects in animal models. Specifically, chronic Celecoxib treatment prevents the development of anhedonia after chronic unpredictable stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2009</xref>), and chronic COX-2 inhibition reduces immobilization stress-induced hypoactivity, memory deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumari et al., 2007</xref>), and anxiety-like behavior in the mirror chamber test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dhir et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, in addition to generating PGs, COX-2 also metabolizes endogenous cannabinoids (eCBs; anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kozak et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2001</xref>), and several eCB augmentation strategies, including inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), have been found to attenuate anxiety- and depression-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Griebel and Holmes, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunduz-Cinar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruehle et al., 2012</xref>). However, little is currently understood about the possible contribution of eCB signaling to the behavioral and therapeutic actions of COX-2 inhibitors in mood and anxiety disorders.</p><p>We have recently developed a class of COX-2 inhibitors that differentially inhibit COX-2 enzymatic activity based on the substrate: arachidonic acid or eCBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duggan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hermanson et al., 2013</xref>). Specifically, these âsubstrate-selective COX-2 inhibitorsâ (SSCIs) inhibit COX-2 activity when eCBs are used as substrates, without affecting the ability of COX-2 to generate PGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hermanson et al., 2013</xref>). The development of these SSCIs provides a powerful tool for dissecting the mechanisms by which pharmacological COX-2 inhibition can modulate a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hermanson et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we performed a comparative analysis between the prototypic SSCI, LM-4131, and two traditional COX-2 inhibitors currently or previously approved for pain and arthritis, Lumiracoxib (LMX) and Celecoxib, in a variety of measures of mouse anxiety-, fear- and depression-related behavior. We show that all three COX-2 inhibitors attenuate stress-induced anxiety-like states, with minimal effects on basal anxiety-like, despair-like, and locomotor behaviors. The anxiolytic-like effects of LM-4131 were paralleled by a reduction in anxiety-related BLA neuronal activity ex vivo and in vivo. Collectively, these data support the therapeutic potential of COX-2 inhibition for the treatment of stress-related neuropsychiatric conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>COX-2 inhibition reduces stress-induced anxiety in the novelty-induced hypophagia assay</title><p>We sought to determine the efficacy of pharmacological COX-2 inhibition in preclinical models of affective disorders. Since stress is the major environmental risk factor for the development of mood and anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caspi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kessler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McEwen, 2003</xref>), we evaluated the behavioral effects of COX-2 inhibition after stress exposure. The novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) assay is a well-validated ethologically relevant measure of both anxiety and depressive-related behaviors,Â encompassing both conflict anxiety and hedonic motivational processes, and is responsive to chronic (but not acute) SSRI treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cryan and Holmes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dulawa and Hen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Merali et al., 2003</xref>). We utilized this assay to test the efficacy of a newly developed SSCI, LM-4131, relative to two clinically effective COX-2 inhibitors, LMX and Celecoxib, to reduce basal and stress-induced anxiety-like behavior in mice. Results showed that systemic administration of either LM-4131 or LMX reduced mean feeding latency in (5â7 week old) mice that had been subjected to foot-shock stress 8 or 24, but not 4 or 72, hours earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâE</xref>). Celecoxib, tested at the 8-hr post-stress time point, also reduced mean feeding latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, only LM-4131, and not LMX or Celecoxib, produced a small reduction in mean feeding latency in non-stressed controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It is interesting to note that the anxiety-like effect of foot-shock stress peaked at ~8âhr after foot-shock, and resolved by 72âhr. The delayed onset of the anxiety-like response to foot-shock may be related to time-dependent neuronal plasticity mechanism induced by the foot-shock exposure. Together, these data show that stress causes an increase in feeding latency between 8 and 24âhr, which was abrogated by the acute SSCI and the traditional COX-2 inhibitor treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14137.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of COX-2 inhibition in the NIH assay.</title><p>Effects of vehicle, LM-4131, Lumiracoxib, and Celecoxib administered 2âhr prior to behavioral testing on feeding latency under non-stressed (control conditions) (<bold>A</bold>), and 4âhr (<bold>B</bold>), 8âhr (<bold>C</bold>), 24âhr (<bold>D</bold>), and 72âhr (<bold>E</bold>) after foot-shock stress (experimental design shown above).

Additionally, LM-4131 also reduced mean feeding latency 8-hr post-stress in female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, to examine whether the SSCI, LM-4131, retained anxiolytic-like efficacy following a more chronic, severe stressor, male mice were exposed to foot-shock stress for 5 consecutive days. Under these conditions, LM-4131 administered 2âhr prior to testing was still able to reduce mean feeding latency in stressed mice, but not non-stressed controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

This subchronic treatment regimen reduced feeding latency 8âhr after stress, with no effects in non-stressed controls, thereby mimicking the effects of acute treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>). There were no effects of this subchronic LMX treatment on body weight in either group (Figure S4). Also of note, neither acute LM-4131 nor LMX treatment affected overall locomotor activity in the open-field assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>), indicating drug-induced reductions in feeding latency were not an artifact of hyperactivity.

Moreover, LM-4131 exerts preferential effects on anandamide over 2-AG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hermanson et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore tested whether blocking these alternate anandamide targets affected the anxiolytic-like effects of LM-4131 after stress. Neither co-treatment with the CBR2 antagonist, SR144528 (3 mg/kg), nor the TRPV1 antagonist, Capsazepine (10 mg/kg), blocked LM-4131-induced reductions in feeding latency 8âhr after stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, co-administration of the SK channel inhibitor, Apamin (0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg), blocked the ability of LM-4131, as well as LMX or Celecoxib, to reduce stress-induced anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To further substantiate a role for SK channels in the effects of LM-4131 after foot-shock stress, we tested whether direct activation of SK channels was sufficient to mimic the anxiolytic-like effects of LM-4131. Consistent with earlier data, LM-4131 reduced feeding latency in mice stressed 8âhr earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The SK channel activator 1-EBIO also reduced feeding latency, and the combined administration of 1-EBIO and LM-4131 did not produce a further decrease in feeding latency relative to either drug alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Apamin and 1-EBIO had minimal effect on locomotor activity when administered alone at doses used above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>), showing these drug effects on feeding latency were not artifacts of locomotor disturbances.</p><p>We have previously shown that eCB signaling effects on food consumption and feeding latency in the assay are dissociable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gamble-George et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we extended our analyses to measure drug effects on total food consumption in the NIH assay to clarify whether COX-2 inhibition affects feeding via a CB1R-dependent or independent mechanism. We found that reductions in food consumption produced by testing in a novel cage (relative to the home cage) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) were partially reversed by LM-4131 in mice with prior foot-shock stress exposure, albeit not in all experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7BâF</xref>). In addition, examination of feeding behavior in our CB1R antagonist studies indicated that, in contrast to the negative effects of CB1R blockade on feeding latency after stress exposure, the ability of LM-4131 and LMX to normalize stress-induced deficits in food consumption was completely blocked by either 2 or 5 mg/kg Rimonabant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7GâH</xref>).

Indeed, incubation of brain slices from both control and stressed mice with the FAAH inhibitor, PF-3845 (10âÎ¼M), resulted in a decrease in cellular excitability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

We employed the EPM for this experiment because preliminary work indicated robust behavioral profiles and drug effects under the chronic recording conditions. That is, during recordings, mice treated with LM-4131 and tested 8âhr after stress showed increased open arm time and entries and reduced open arm latency, as compared to vehicle treated controls, consistent with an anxiolytic-like effect in this test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9AâB</xref>). It is interesting to note that under these recording conditions mice exhibited high levels of anxiety with open arm time ~10 s, and LM-4131 was able to increase open arm time and decrease latency to open arm entry. In contrast, in previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), LM-4131 only affected open arm latency. Given that open arm time in these studies was ~25â40 s, these data suggest that the openÂ arm latency measure is more sensitive to LM-4131 treatment, but as anxiety levels increase, LM-4131 can affect more conventional measures of anxiety in the EPM including open arm time.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14137.021</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Effects of COX-2 inhibition on in vivo activity of BLA neuronal activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) LM-4131 decreases latency to enter and increases entries into and time spent in the open arms of the EPM 8âhr following stress exposure.

Firing rates of each unit were analyzed during exit from the safety of the closed arms, and were classified as being excitatory (at least 1 of 10 100-ms time bins following closed arm exit had an average Z-score of &gt;2, relative to a 1 sec pre-exit âbaselineâ), inhibitory (converse of excitatory), or unaltered (no significant increase or decrease). The proportion of units falling into each of these 3 categories was no different between vehicle and LM-4131 treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). However, the magnitude of the increase in excitatory unit activity on exiting the closed arm was significantly lower in LM-4131 treated mice than vehicle controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9DâE</xref>). Furthermore, the effect of the drug was specific to excitatory activity, with no change evident for units exhibiting inhibitory activity on closed arm exits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). The finding that COX-2 inhibition blunted BLA unit excitation inÂ vivo fits well with our ex vivo slice results and, taken together, suggest a neurophysiological correlate of the anxiolytic-like actions of LM-4131.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we show that acute treatment with the novel SSCI, LM-4131, as well as two traditional COX-2-selective inhibitors, LMX and Celecoxib, acutely reduces stress-induced behavioral dysregulation in two separate assays (the NIH and EPM), and reduces expression of conditioned fear, without affecting locomotor activity, sucrose preference, or despair-like behaviors. These effects generalized to male mice of different ages, female mice, and were evident even after repeated stress exposure. Moreover, the behavioral effects of COX-2 inhibition were maintained after subchronic treatment indicating a lack of drug tolerance. Together, these results suggest that SSCIs and traditional COX-2 inhibitors could represent viable therapeutic approaches for stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Muller, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The three COX-2 inhibitors used in the present study represent different chemical scaffolds: LM-4131 is a morpholinoamide of indomethacin, while LMX is an arylacetic acid, and Celecoxib is a diarylheterocycle. LM-4131 is also a weak antagonist of CB2R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaetani et al., 2003</xref>); however, CB2R activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bahi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garcia-Gutierrez and Manzanares, 2011</xref>), but not inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gamble-George et al., 2013</xref>), has been shown to have anxiolytic-like effects, and we have previously shown that CB2R blockade does not affect anxiety-like behavior in the NIH assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gamble-George et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, we were unable to prevent the anxiolytic-like effects of LM-4131 with a CB2R antagonist. The similar anxiolytic-like profile of the two other chemically distinct COX-2 inhibitors, which have no known activity at cannabinoid receptors, also argues against a CB2R contribution to the anxiolytic effects of LM-4131.</p><p>In principle, COX-2 inhibition could produce anxiolytic and antidepressant actions via one or more mechanisms of action: 1) preventing PG synthesis, 2) increasing eCB levels, and 3) concomitantly reducing levels of prostamides and prostaglandin-glycerol esters (COX-2 eCB oxygenation products). On the one hand, the prior observation that COX-2 inhibition is associated with reduced stress-induced PG levels, cytokine levels, and other markers of neuroinflammation supports the first mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dhir et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Munhoz et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, the current results provide some support for the alternate mechanisms. For example, the SSCI, LM-4131, does not affect production of pro-inflammatory PGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hermanson et al., 2013</xref>), yet is as effective as traditional COX-2 inhibitors in reducing stress-induced anxiety-like behavior. In addition, SK channel blockade and to a lesser extent, CB1R antagonism, both of which are molecular targets of the eCB anandamide, block some behavioral effects of LM-4131, LMX, and Celecoxib. Consistent with our data, systemic and intra-BLA SK channel activation has been shown to reduce stress-induced anxiety and expression of conditioned-fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atchley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rau et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, it is also possible that reductions in prostamides or prostaglandin-glycerols contribute to the anxiolytic-like actions of traditional COX-2 inhibitors and especially SSCIs. However, very little is currently known regarding the physiological role of these metabolites in the regulation of stress responses or behavior in general. Future studies will thus be aimed at determining the differential contributions of these three potential mechanisms of action of COX-2 inhibitors to reduce stress-related pathology.</p><p>At a cellular level, LM-4131 decreased amygdala neuron excitability in stressed, but not control, mice. This effect was mimicked by the FAAH inhibitor, PF-3843, which causes robust increases in anandamide levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, these findings support the notion that LM-4131 affects amygdala cellular physiology indirectly via enhancing anandamide signaling. We also found the decrease in BLA neuron excitability induced by LM-4131Â exÂ vivo was blocked by the SK channel antagonist Apamin, but not the CB1 or TRPV1 antagonists, mirroring our behavioral studies. It is unlikely that that the cellular effects of LM-4131 are mediated via decreases in PG signaling since our inÂ vitroÂ data indicate that LM-4131 is a very weak inhibitor of AA oxygenation by COX-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hermanson et al., 2013</xref>). However, it is remains possible that the neurophysiological effects of LM-4131 are mediated in part via inhibition of prostamide signaling; a hypothesis that will require further testing.</p><p>We also investigated the in vivo neurophysiological correlates of LM-4131-induced anxiolytic-like effects. Consistent with our ex vivo electrophysiological results, in vivo single-unit recordings revealed that the anxiolytic effects of LM-4131 were associated with a significantly attenuated increase in BLA neuronal excitability that was evident when mice left a relatively safe location. Given the strong link between amygdala neuron activity and generation of anxiety and fear states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>), these data suggest that LM-4131 could reduce anxiety-like behavior by modulating encoding of negative valence by BLA neurons; though further studies will be required to substantiate this idea. Similarly, whether LM-4131 induced AEA augmentation, and subsequent SK channel activation, contributes to the reduction in BLA neuron activity in vivo remains to be determined.</p><p>Several clinical trials and meta-analyses of trials have now confirmed the efficacy of COX-2 inhibition as an effective augmentation strategy to SSRIs in MDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdallah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akhondzadeh and Jafari, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhondzadeh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faridhosseini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fond et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Muller et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, COX-2 mRNA is increased in the circulation of patients with MDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galecki et al., 2012</xref>). These findings are generally consistent with the known role of COX-2 as an immediate-early gene up-regulated by neurons in response to various types of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaufmann et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kulmacz and Lands, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yamagata et al., 1993</xref>). On this basis, it has been proposed that stress exposure could increase susceptibility to depression via generation of inflammatory PGs generated by COX-2; a contention in line with the neuroimmune hypothesis of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Felger and Miller, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haroon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raison and Miller, 2013</xref>) and the aforementioned clinical efficacy of COX-2 inhibition in MDD.</p><p>The current study extends this model by supporting additional mechanisms by which COX-2 could exert therapeutic effects; specifically, via eCB augmentation and possibly reductions in COX-2 eCB oxidative metabolites, which are known to have actions opposing eCBs in some systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ligresti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sang et al., 2006</xref>). This alternate hypothesis is consistent with data suggesting eCB deficiencies could contribute to the pathogenesis of some anxiety disorders, including PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hill and Patel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jenniches et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shonesy et al., 2014</xref>). Our preclinical data support robust effects of COX-2 inhibition in fear and anxiety-domain behaviors, but preliminary analysis of anhedonia and despair-like behavior were negative. Therefore, although anxiety symptoms are highly reported in patients with MDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fava et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fried et al., 2015</xref>), and anxiety disorders and MDD are highly co-morbid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>), our data suggest clinical trials of COX-2 inhibitors in anxiety and trauma- and stressor-related disorders may also be warranted, and that SSCIs could represent a potentially attractive class of novel therapeutics for mood and anxiety disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Male or female ICR (CD-1) mice between 5â7 weeks of age or ~4 months of age were used for all experiments (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA).

It would be useful if authors provided some explanation for why it takes more than 4 hrs after foot shock for the drug to become effective and why it dissipates by 72 hr.</p><p>Indeed, all measurements are in the novel cage, and it is interesting that it takes several hours to see the anxiety-like effect of stress, although we have not examined mice immediately after the foot-shock. We speculate that synaptic plasticity mechanisms triggered by the stress experience require some time to become established, and then normalize after 72 hours. We have added this hypothesis to the text (subsection âLM-4131 reduces intrinsic excitability of amygdala neurons ex vivoâ).</p><p>3) In the EPM experiments, it is usually the case that latency to enter open arm and total time spend in open arm are both affected. In this case, only the latency is affected, suggesting that the mice get over their anxiety once they enter the open arm the first time. That is quite unusual and deserves some discussion.</p><p>It is noteworthy that in the in vivo electrophysiological studies, open arm time is also increased, in addition to latency. In these experiments open arm time is very low due to the anxiogenic conditions of being tethered and having electrophysiological headpieces attached to the mouse. We hypothesize that the latency measure is the most sensitive to COX-2 inhibition, but that under very high anxiety states (such as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), open arm time can also be affected. We have noted this hypothesis in the subsection âLM-4131 dampens anxiety-related amygdala neuronal activity in vivoâ.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, I</xref> think it would be useful to sum the time spent freezing for only the first 4 min rather than the entire 10 min test as freezing has essentially stopped by 4 min.</p><p>We have re-analyzed the data in 4D to include only the first 4 minutes, however, the effects are less substantial, indicating that even though freezing is quite low after 4 minutes, it is in fact still lower in the drug treated groups relative to vehicle during the last 6 minutes. Therefore, we prefer to keep the summary data analysis to the entire duration of the experiment.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This research provides exciting results that LM-4131 produces selective anxiolytic behavioral responses that were blocked by SK channel inhibitor, but not by CB1R, CB2R or TRPV1R antagonist. Therefore, I feel that this research is suitable for the publication in eLife. However, I have two minor concerns. First, do LMX and Celecoxib also produce anxiolytic effects through SK channel? Second, can LM-4131-elicited electrophysiological effects on brain slices and in vivo animals be blocked by SK channel inhibitor, but not by CB1R or TRPV1R antagonist?</p><p>In addressing the reviewerâs first point, we have added data showing that the excitability reducing effect of LM-4131 is present upon CB1 and TRPV1 blockade, but absent upon incubation with SK channel inhibitor Apamin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, we show that anxiolytic effects of LMX and Celecoxib are also blocked by Apamin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), similarly to LM-4131.</p><p>While we agree the second point will be interesting to pursue, due to the low throughout in vivo electrophysiological experiments, it was simply not feasible to repeat all the slice work in vivo within the 2-month time frame. However, we have now indicated in the Discussion that the question of whether the same mechanisms which are also operative in the brain slice are operative in vivo, will require further investigation to be conclusive.</p><p>Lastly, please note we have removed the sEPSC data form the manuscript for several reasons. Upon repeating these experiments to determine the receptor mechanisms subserving these effects, the results were difficult to interpret. Specifically, it appeared that LM-4131 was not able to reduce sEPSC frequency in the presence of Apamin, Rimonabant, or Capsazepine. However, close inspection of the data revealed that in some cases basal eEPSC frequency was quite low, which could prevent observation of the LM-4131 effect due to floor effects. We feel we need to more thoroughly investigate the reproducibility and mechanistic basis for the sEPSC effect of LM-4131; however, this investigation may go beyond the scope and time limitations of the current revision. We also feel the neuronal excitability data are quite robust (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> and supplements), and clearer in terms of its mechanistic basis â providing a compelling cellular correlate of our behavioral findings even if the sEPSC data are not included.</p></body></sub-article></article>
