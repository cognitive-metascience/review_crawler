Using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, glutamate uncaging, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and transgenic mice expressing labeled PSD-95, we comparatively analyzed electrical and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in spines and shaft synapses of dopamine neurons. Dendritic spines were present on dopaminergic neurons at low densities in live and fixed tissue. Uncaging-evoked potential amplitudes correlated inversely with spine length but positively with the presence of PSD-95. Spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were less sensitive to hyperpolarization than shaft synapses, suggesting amplification of spine head voltages. Lastly, activating spines during pacemaking, we observed an unexpected enhancement of spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> midway throughout the spike cycle, likely involving recruitment of NMDA receptors and voltage-gated conductances. These results demonstrate functionality of spines in dopamine neurons and reveal a novel modulation of spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling during pacemaking.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13905.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13905.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13905.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a nerve cell is viewed under the microscope, its structure looks a little like that of a tree. Each nerve cell, or neuron, has an array of ‘branches’ known as dendrites, which receive chemical messages from other cells. These messages are converted into electrical signals in the cell body and then travel down the main nerve fiber, which is the output of the cell. At the end of the nerve fiber, the signals are converted into chemical messages again and passed on to the dendrites of the next neuron.</p><p>The dendrites of most neurons are covered with spines that resemble thorns on a stem. These are the sites that typically connect neurons with other cells. However, neurons that release a chemical messenger called dopamine have largely smooth dendrites. These neurons still belong to extensive neural circuits that are involved in movement and reward processing. As such, it is not clear whether dopamine neurons receive connections that form onto dendritic spines, or whether all of their connections are formed directly onto dendrites.</p><p>By studying slices of mouse brain, Hage et al. now show that inputs onto dopamine neurons in fact establish both types of connections. The connections formed directly onto dendrites usually have more influence on the neuron than those on spines. However, the size and shape of spines determines their properties. Most spines are attached to dendrites via a narrow neck, and spines with long necks have less influence on the electrical signaling of the cell than short-necked spines. This is because the neck limits the movement of electrical charges. Long-necked spines also possess fewer receptors for the chemical messenger glutamate, which reduces their ability to transmit signals arriving from other cells.</p><p>Dopamine neurons receive input from many different areas of the brain. A key next step is to determine whether neurons from specific brain regions are more likely to form connections with spines as opposed to directly on dendrites. Given that these inputs often arrive at the same time, another question is whether there is crosstalk between these two types of connections.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13905.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13905.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>spines</kwd><kwd>dopaminergic</kwd><kwd>imaging</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>dendrites</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS003135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hage</surname><given-names>Travis A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Yujie</given-names></name><name><surname>Khaliq</surname><given-names>Zayd M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dopaminergic cells uniquely receive input from a roughly equal mixture of synapses on dendritic spines and synapses formed directly on dendrites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The function of dendritic spines, sites of synaptic input for neurons in the central nervous system, is linked intimately to their unique geometry. For example, the thin spine neck limits diffusion of signaling molecules from the spine head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Svoboda et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tonnesen et al., 2014</xref>), a feature critical for synapse specificity during plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harvey and Svoboda, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yuste and Denk, 1995</xref>). Furthermore, theoretical studies hypothesize that the resistance of the spine neck, if high relative to the impedance of the dendrite, may electrically compartmentalize synaptic potentials in the spine head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jack et al., 1975</xref>). As a result, the high neck resistance of spines can lead to passive amplification the voltage in the spine head, but also attenuation of signals as they travel across the spine neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araya, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sala and Segal, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yuste, 2013</xref>). Accordingly, long-necked spines may be expected to have higher neck resistances, producing strong attenuation of synaptic potentials. However, experimental evidence for this hypothesis has been less conclusive. Studies of cortical pyramidal cells show a clear negative correlation between neck length and EPSP amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2014</xref>), while studies in hippocampal pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takasaki and Sabatini, 2014</xref>) and olfactory granule neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bywalez et al., 2015</xref>) observe either a weak relationship or none at all. Therefore, better knowledge of the relationship between spine geometry and synaptic function will forward our understanding of how synaptic input shapes neuronal excitability.</p><p>Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (SNc) are commonly categorized as aspiny neurons, however early anatomical studies are less definitive regarding this view. Spine-like appendages have been reported on dopamine neurons in a variety of species including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grace and Onn, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kline and Felten, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Phelps et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Preston et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rinvik and Grofova, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sarti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schwyn and Fox, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yung et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cruz-Sanchez et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patt et al., 1991</xref>). In other studies, spines were encountered only rarely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Juraska et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tepper et al., 1987</xref>). While many of these studies provide important descriptions of spine density, quantitative analyses of the density of spines in SNc dopamine neurons have seldom been performed. Likewise, the function of spines on dopamine neurons is unclear. For example, high densities of vesicular monoamine transporters, dopamine transporters and dopamine D2-autoreceptors have been localized to spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nirenberg et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">1996b</xref>), which are associated with the reuptake and storage of dopamine. However, these observations raise the question of whether spines on dopamine neurons also function as typical sites of excitatory synaptic input.</p><p>Using two-photon laser scanning microscopy, we examined the density and morphology of dendritic spines on dopamine neurons in live and fixed tissue preparations from juvenile (P6–P25) and adult mice (up to 7 months old). During preparation of this study, a separate study was published that reports a mixture of spine and shaft synapses on dopamine neurons and tests glutamate receptors on spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jang et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the functionality, chemical and electrical compartmentalization as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in short spines (&lt;2 µm), long spines (2–5 µm) and shaft synapses. In addition, we tested the influence of subthreshold voltage changes on spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> during slow pacemaking, a characteristic firing pattern of dopamine neurons. We demonstrate the presence of functional dendritic spines on SNc dopaminergic neurons and provide evidence that activation of spines during pacemaking leads to novel enhancement of spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> that occurs periodically in a window starting at the middle phase and lasts throughout remainder of the spike cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Density and morphology of dendritic spines in live and fixed SNc dopaminergic neurons</title><p>We analyzed the density and morphology of dendritic spines on dopaminergic neurons in live brain slices obtained from juvenile (P6–25) mice. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows a typical example of an Alexa-594-filled dopamine neuron.

In addition, we observed many spines that exhibited strikingly long necks, characteristic of dendritic filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In young mice (P6–P11), the average spine length was 1.97 ± 0.06 µm (range, 0.18–4.85 μm) with 142 of 355 spines (40%) measuring &gt;2 µm in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In older juveniles (P14–P25), spines were somewhat shorter at an average length of 1.74 ± 0.05 µm (range, 0.06–4.95 µm) with 166 of 518 spines (32%) measuring &gt;2 µm. Therefore, we observe a significant shift in the density of spines during development away from long spines toward shorter spines, consistent with the notion that longer, filopodial-like spines may be immature structures.</p><p>In separate experiments, we analyzed the density of spines across the entire visible dendritic tree in individual cells (age P14–P18). In the ‘whole cell’ images, the average spine density was 1.86 ± 0.02 spines/10 µm (n = 20; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows the positions of individual spines within a continuous stretch of dendrite for 20 neurons. In some cells, spines were evenly distributed throughout the dendrites while in others, we observed stretches of dendrites that were only sparsely populated with spines. This fits with the large variability in spine density that we observe between individual dendritic segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), as well as observations in primates that spines can occur in patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schwyn and Fox, 1974</xref>). On average, the density of spines decreased modestly with distance from 2.33 ± 0.30 spines/10 µm (n = 20) in the proximal dendrite (0–100 µm) to 1.52 ± 0.22 spines/10 µm (n = 12) in the most distal dendrites (300–545 µm) (p=0.037, student’s unpaired). This is also consistent with results in guinea pig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yung et al., 1991</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cruz-Sanchez et al., 1995</xref>) that describe a higher density of spines in proximal versus distal dendrites.</p><p>To test the possibility that the dendritic spines identified in live SNc dopamine neurons may be an artifact of the slicing procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirov et al., 1999</xref>), we imaged dopamine neurons in both Golgi-stained tissue and fast-perfusion fixed tissue. In Golgi-stained tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), SNc dopamine neurons exhibited dendritic spines consistent with past experiments analyzing Golgi-stained SNc cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Juraska et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Phelps and Adinolfi, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rinvik and Grofova, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schwyn and Fox, 1974</xref>). To visualize dopamine neurons in tissue from fast transcardially-perfused mice, we used transgenic mice in which GFP is driven by the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter and visualized their morphology using juxtacellular labeling with Alexa-594. Spines in fixed tissue were observed along the dendrites of SNc dopamine neurons, though at somewhat lower densities than in live tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This raises the possibility that some spine growth in dopamine neurons may result from acute slicing. Alternatively, it has been suggested that tissue fixation may limit diffusion of fluorescent dye and visualization of spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). Comparing cells from young (P15–P25) and mature (P75–P119) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), we found no significant difference in the density of spines (young, 0.90 ± 0.15 spines/10 µm, n = 16; mature, 0.75 ± 0.13 spines/10 µm, n = 13; p=0.47). Therefore, we demonstrate that dendritic spines are present in live and fixed tissue preparations from both juvenile and adult mice, suggesting that dendritic spines are a common feature of mammalian SNc dopamine neurons.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13905.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dendritic spines on SNc dopamine neurons visualized in perfusion-fixed slices.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Golgi stained sagittal slice from P24 mouse.

Chemical compartmentalization by the spine, due to slower diffusion through the narrow spine neck, could result in greater spatial-specificity of cell signaling pathways in the spine head. Similarly, spine and shaft synapses could differ in synaptic strength due to attenuation of the EPSP by the resistance of the spine neck.

Therefore, we tested electrical signaling in single spines of different lengths using glutamate uncaging. Much like the experiments examining synaptically-evoked responses, glutamate uncaging resulted in uncaging-evoked EPSPs (uEPSPs), clear Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the spine head, and a smaller, slowly rising Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in the parent dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4— figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows an example of two neighboring spines of different lengths and their uncaging-evoked responses.

However, we found clear differences in the amplitudes of uEPSPs. Glutamate uncaging generated a uEPSP of 0.91 mV in the shorter spine (1.55 µm) versus a uEPSP of 0.32 mV in the longer spine (4.15 µm). In collected experiments, we observed no correlation between the amplitude of the spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and spine length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; Pearson’s R = 0.074; p=0.54, n = 71). However, comparing uEPSP amplitudes for neighboring spines, uEPSPs from short spines (&lt;2 µm) were significantly larger than uEPSPs generated in nearby longer spines (&gt;2 µm) (short: 1.46 ± 0.16 mV versus long: 0.98 ± 0.19 mV; p=9.8e-3, paired, n = 14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

We measured the rate of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in spines of varying lengths (0.88–4.54 µm). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, fluorescence intensity of Alexa-594 in the spine head was measured by linescans across the spine, while a second two-photon laser was used to partially bleach the dye within the spine (0.5 ms pulse, 725 nm). Traces were corrected for a small amount of photobleaching (~3.5%) which occurred as a result of scanning by the imaging laser alone (see <italic>Materials and methods</italic>). We then fit the recovery of spine fluorescence intensity with a double-exponential function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <italic>purple line,</italic> weighted tau = 66.5 ms) and plotted the weighted time constant of FRAP against spine length for 33 spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We observed a significant correlation in which the time course of FRAP slowed with increased spine lengths (slope = 46.1 ms/µm; Pearson’s R = 0.52; p=0.0020). The range of FRAP time courses observed (8.1–299 ms, mean = 115 ms, median = 103 ms) were similar to analogous experiments conducted in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grunditz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takasaki and Sabatini, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tonnesen et al., 2014</xref>).

Therefore, we estimated the volume of the spine head based on the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of Alexa-594 signal intensity across the spine head. Assuming that the spine head is a sphere with the FWHM as the diameter, we estimated that spine head volumes cover a range from 0.016 to 0.64 μm<sup>3</sup>. We found no correlation between the FRAP time constants and spine head volume (Pearson’s R = 0.193, p=0.28). We next used estimates of the spine volume and FRAP measurements to calculate the resistance of the spine neck with Fick’s law: R<sub>neck</sub>=tau<sub>FRAP</sub>D<sub>Alexa</sub>R<sub>axial</sub>/V<sub>head</sub>. In this equation, R<sub>neck</sub> is the neck resistance, tau<sub>FRAP</sub> is the time constant from FRAP measurements, D<sub>Alexa</sub> is the free diffusion time constant for Alexa-594 (120 μm<sup>2</sup>/s), R<sub>axial</sub> is the axial resistance (150 Ω*cm), and V<sub>head</sub> is the volume of the spine head. Using these values, the estimated spine neck resistance ranged from 8.4 MΩ–1.3 GΩ, with a median of 72 MΩ. These estimates assume a spherical spine head as well as an intermediate value of cytoplasmic R<sub>axial</sub> of 150 Ω*cm, while values can range from 50–250 Ω*cm. Despite the assumptions, however, our neck resistance values fall roughly in line with estimates from studies in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tonnesen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Given the estimates of R<sub>neck</sub> that we obtained using the spine morphology and FRAP measurements, we compared these measurements with the size of evoked synaptic potentials. Therefore, we uncaged glutamate onto the same spines from which FRAP analysis was performed and measured the uEPSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Plotting the uEPSP amplitude against the R<sub>neck</sub>, we found a moderate inverse correlation between uEPSP amplitude and R<sub>neck</sub> (Pearson’s R = -0.503, p=0.0046) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Intriguingly, the 2 spines which produced the smallest amplitude uEPSPs also had estimated neck resistances that were dramatically greater than the other spines assayed. A significant correlation is still observed if these data points are excluded from analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> <italic>dashed line</italic>; R = -0.488, p=0.0085). In summary, these findings are consistent with the idea that the higher resistance of longer spines may result in stronger attenuation of the EPSP across the spine neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>NMDA and AMPA-receptor mediated conductances in dopamine neuron spines</title><p>In addition to spine geometry, synaptic receptor composition such as the density of spine AMPA receptors can be an effective determinant of synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsuzaki et al., 2001</xref>). Comparisons of uEPSPs kinetics in long and short spines indirectly support this idea. We found significantly faster rise times in short spines than in longer spines (10–90% uEPSP rise time; short &lt;2 µm spines: 42.8 ± 6.5 ms, long ≥ 2 µm spines: 71.9 ± 10.4 ms; n = 45 and 26; p=0.023 student’s unpaired t-test). Therefore, we hypothesized that the variability in the uEPSP amplitudes may result from distinct compositions of synaptic glutamate receptors in the short and long spines. To test this, we recorded glutamate uncaging-evoked AMPA or NMDA receptor-mediated currents from short and long-necked spines by voltage clamping neurons to either −70 mV or +40 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). To maximize space clamp, we analyzed spines located within 50 µm of the soma and recorded using Cs<sup>+</sup> -based internal solutions and bath applied TTX (500 nM).

In addition to spine neck resistance, these findings suggest that the negative correlation between uEPSP amplitude and spine length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) also involves a differential glutamate receptor expression and composition, with a weaker AMPA-receptor component present in long-necked spines.</p><p>The spine neck imparts an electrical resistance, and therefore may attenuate synaptic current entering the dendrite. The extent of this attenuation will depend on the relative values of the synaptic conductance and spine neck resistance. Faster currents (such as those mediated by AMPARs) will likely display greater attenuation than slower NMDAR-mediated currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnston and Wu, 1995</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the observed difference in AMPA to NMDA ratio is due to greater filtering of AMPAR currents by the spine neck resistance of long spines. Measurements of synaptic charge transfer are less distorted by the cable properties of the neuron and spine neck than are measurements of current amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnston and Wu, 1995</xref>).Therefore, we examined the relationship between the AMPAR-mediated charge transfer (measured as the integral of the uncaging-evoked current at −70 mV) and the length of the spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We observed a moderate and highly significant correlation between these values (R = −0.56, p=1.8e-5, n = 52 spines), further supporting the hypothesis that long spines are of weaker strength due in part to a smaller contribution of AMPARs.</p><p>To further disambiguate whether the relationship between AMPAR current amplitude and spine length was due to differences in receptor expression or differences in spine neck resistance, we examined the relationship between isolated AMPAR-currents (NMDARs were blocked with 50 µM D-AP5) and spine length in the presence of cyclothiazide (CTZ, 100 µM) to inhibit AMPAR desensitization. CTZ increased the maximum synaptic conductance and slowed the time course of the AMPAR-mediated conductance changes. Both effects will minimize the impact of the spine neck resistance on measurement of the synaptic current. Examples of uncaging-evoked AMPAR currents at positive and negative potentials in the presence of CTZ are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>. We observed a significant correlation between AMPAR current amplitude and spine length in the presence of CTZ at both positive and negative voltages (at -70 mV R = 0.92, p=2.5e-5; at +40 mV R = 0.95, p&lt;1e-5; n = 6 spines, 3 shafts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). We also observed a significant correlation between AMPAR-mediated charge transfer and spine length in the presence of CTZ (R = 0.66, p=0.02, n = 6 spines, 3 shafts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) further supporting the hypothesis that long spines display lower AMPAR density.</p><p>Finally, we confirmed that the spine neck acts as an ohmic resistor. If the spine neck was non-ohmic (i.e. voltage-dependent) it could differentially affect measurement of the AMPA/NMDA ratio in spines with different neck resistances. Measuring isolated AMPAR currents at different voltages allowed us to test the ohmic nature of the spine neck resistance because changes in synaptic conductance will be due the presence of the ligand alone. To measure the synaptic conductance in the absence of any spine neck resistance, we uncaged glutamate directly near the dendritic shaft. When holding the cell at −70 mV and targeting the dendritic shaft, uncaging-evoked synaptic currents were 1.60 ± 0.05 times larger than the current measured at +40 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). If the spine neck resistance changed with membrane potential, one would predict that the ratio between AMPAR currents measured at −70 mV and +40 mV would differ according to spine neck resistance. However, when uncaging onto spines the ratio of AMPAR current amplitudes measured at −70 and +40 mV was 1.56 ± 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>) - similar to trials targeting dendritic shafts. Furthermore, we observe no correlation between spine length and the ratio of AMPAR currents measured at −70 and +40 mV (R = -0.010, p=0.97,n = 3 shafts, 6 spines) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Therefore, it appears that the resistance of the spine neck does not change with membrane potential under our experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Comparison of uncaging responses in spines and PSD95-positive shaft synapses</title><p>Glutamatergic excitation of SNc dopamine neurons has long been recognized to occur via input to synapses located on the dendritic shaft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatha et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henny et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paquet et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rinvik and Grofova, 1970</xref>).

We again categorized spines as mVenus positive if pixel intensity was more than 2 standard deviations greater than the background signal. 75% of spines with lengths &lt;2 µm (179 of 240) were scored mVenus positive whereas only 40% of spines longer than 2 µm (33 of 83) displayed detectable mVenus expression. This observation is consistent with the conclusion from our voltage-clamp analyses, that longer spines display smaller AMPAR currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), likely contributing to the smaller uEPSPs observed in current clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In total, our data support the hypothesis that the long spines are immature synaptic structures that have few AMPARs.</p><p>Lastly, we compared the relative densities of spines and shaft synapses on individual dendritic segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In most cases, mVenus-positive shaft synapses outnumbered spines (average density shaft synapses: 2.53 ± 0.14 puncta/10 µm; average density spine synapses: 2.01 ± 0.19 spines/10 µm). However, there were several instances (9/23 dendritic segments) in which shaft synapses and spines were observed in equal numbers, or spines outnumbered shaft synapses (data were measured from 23 dendritic segments consisting of total of 1525 µm of dendrite, 317 spines and 392 shaft synapses). Altogether, these data reveal that excitatory synaptic inputs of both structural classes, spines and shaft synapses, coexist and must act together in the integration of synaptic inputs on SNc dopamine neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Comparison of voltage-dependence of spines and shaft synapses</title><p>Dopamine neurons are spontaneously active and therefore, synaptic inputs will be received on an ever changing membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hage and Khaliq, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Puopolo et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we first examined how steady-state changes in subthreshold potential (−75 to −45 mV) influence glutamate-evoked signals from spines as compared to shaft synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

While the sub-cellular distribution T-type channels has not been examined in dopamine neurons, differential expression in the spines and dendrites could influence the relationship between glutamate-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and membrane potential. Therefore, in a subset of experiments, T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels were blocked with TTA-P2 (1 µM). Results in the two conditions were similar, and therefore data was pooled (16 spines and 16 shaft synapses recorded with TTA-P2, 15 spines and 10 shaft synapses recorded without TTA-P2). Because of the large spine-to-spine variability in absolute Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), we normalized the amplitude of glutamate-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to those recorded at −45 mV within the same spine or shaft.

Therefore, spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were less sensitive to hyperpolarization than shafts signals. We also measured the impact of steady-state voltage changes on the amplitudes of uEPSPs for shaft versus spine synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Here, we normalized the amplitudes of all uEPSPs to the amplitude measured at −75 mV, where the driving force of the synaptic current is largest. Between −55 to −50 mV, the average normalized amplitude of shaft uEPSPs was 0.71 ± 0.03 (n = 49 measurements from 26 shafts). By contrast, the average normalized amplitude of spine uEPSPs was 1.06 ± 0.11 (significantly larger than normalized shaft uEPSPs, p=0.004, n = 57 measurements from 31 spines), indicating that there was strikingly little effect of depolarization on the amplitude of spine uEPSPs. This suggests that at hyperpolarized membrane potentials, NMDA receptors are more effectively recruited in spines relative to shaft synapses which we reason may occur through boosting of the voltage in the spine head.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Glutamate-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in spines during slow tonic firing</title><p>Firing in dopamine neurons is shaped by an interaction between synaptic inputs and active subthreshold conductances that drive pacemaking.

In PSD-95 mVenus mice, spines were present at densities only slightly lower than shaft synapses. Importantly, electrical stimulation of presynaptic inputs resulted in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the spine head demonstrating that spines are innervated by terminals and act as functional sites of synaptic transmission. Testing individual spines with glutamate uncaging, we show that activation of long-necked spines results in small amplitude uEPSPs due in part to a lower AMPA/NMDA ratio and higher spine neck resistance. We demonstrate that stronger electrical compartmentalization in spines results in boosting of the spine voltage. Lastly, activating spines during tonic firing, we found that spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are dramatically enhanced during the middle phase of the interspike interval, independent of action potentials. This enhancement of spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> results from strong recruitment of NMDA receptors and voltage-gated channels, likely due to boosting of the spine voltage.

We estimated spine densities from dendritic segments and whole-cell reconstructions and found that dendritic spines are present at an average density of 2.08 spines/10 μm. These values are also in close agreement with a recent study of dopamine neurons spines in juvenile mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jang et al., 2015</xref>). Along with past work, therefore, our data provide clear evidence that synaptic excitation of dopamine neurons likely involves shaft synapses as well as input onto dendritic spines.</p><p>We examined dopamine neurons in both live slices as well as fast-perfusion fixed tissue and found a modest but consistent reduction in spine density with age. This finding is consistent with developmental studies that report fewer spines on dopamine neurons in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Phelps and Adinolfi, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Phelps et al., 1983</xref>). Humans, however, may be a notable exception to this rule according to two studies that characterized the morphology of dopamine neurons in substantia nigra from adult deceased patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cruz-Sanchez et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patt et al., 1991</xref>). Both studies report significant numbers of dendritic spines in normal, nondiseased adult patients (age range, 20–93 years old). Interestingly, one of these studies reported that the density of spines on putative SNc dopamine neurons in normal adults was 1–2 spines/10 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cruz-Sanchez et al., 1995</xref>), in striking agreement with the values that we report here in mice. In another study, the authors observed prominent pathological changes to dopamine neurons in Parkinson’s patients including reduction in dendritic branching and a loss in the number of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patt et al., 1991</xref>). In future work, it will be important to determine whether a causative relationship exists between the observed changes in dendritic morphology/spine density and selective death of substantia nigra dopamine neurons which occurs in Parkinson’s patients.</p><p>Comparing dopamine neurons to other well-studied spiny neurons reveals similarities but also important differences. For example, pyramidal neurons receive the vast majority (&gt;85%) of excitatory inputs onto spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kasthuri et al., 2015</xref>) while dopamine neurons are unusual in that they receive inputs onto a mixture of shaft and spine synapses. The density of spines on dopamine neurons is considerably lower than pyramidal neurons (typically &gt;10 spines/10 μm) but similar to some GABAergic interneurons neurons of the hippocampus and cortex that have spine densities of 2–4 spines/10 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kawaguchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scheuss and Bonhoeffer, 2014</xref>). It also must be noted that unlike cortical and hippocampal neurons that receive mostly excitatory input, substantia nigra dopamine neurons function within a largely inhibitory network. Up to 70% of synaptic inputs that are received by the SNc dopamine neurons are inhibitory while a much smaller fraction of the synaptic inputs arrive from excitatory sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolam and Smith, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henny et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith et al., 1996</xref>). This raises the possibility that the low density of dendritic spines on SNc dopamine neurons may simply reflect the low density of excitatory inputs overall. Consistent with this idea, we find that the ratio of spines to PSD95-mVenus positive shaft puncta is 4 to 5. Therefore, despite a low absolute density of spines on dopamine neurons, the relative density of shaft and spine synapses is comparable.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Spine morphology and electrical compartmentalization</title><p>Whether long-necked spines more strongly attenuate synaptic potentials is a matter of current debate.

Most studies of spine function have examined pyramidal neurons that rest at hyperpolarized membrane potentials near -70 mV. However, during pacemaking in dopamine neurons, the interspike membrane potential covers a narrow but relatively depolarized subthreshold voltage range with an average non-spike voltage of ~-55 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hage and Khaliq, 2015</xref>). At these depolarized voltages, the membrane potential is within the steepest region of the voltage-activation curve of sodium channels, where even a small amplification of the spine head EPSP may lead to significant sodium channel activation. In a clear demonstration of the relationship of EPSPs with voltage-gated sodium channels, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carter et al.

Slices were cut at 300 µm thickness using a vibrotome (DTK-1000; DSK, Dosaka) and incubated for 30 min at 34° C in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM) 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 3.5 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 glucose, bubbled with 95/5% O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub>. Slices were then stored at room temperature until time of use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Electrophysiological recording</title><p>Slices were placed into a recording chamber and perfused continuously with warm ACSF (32–34°C). Dopamine neurons were targeted primarily by their location within the SNc. Other criteria included the presence of slow pacemaking (&lt;5 Hz) during cell-attached or whole-cell recordings, broad APs (halfwidth &gt;1.35 ms) and prominent voltage sag in response to negative current injection—associated with hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I<sub>H</sub>). Current-clamp and voltage-clamp recordings were made with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier and digitized using a Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices). Low-resistance patch electrodes (2–4 MΩ) were pulled from filamented borosilicate glass. In voltage-clamp recordings, pipette series resistance was compensated by 70–80% and was monitored carefully throughout the experiment. Recordings were terminated if series resistance changed by &gt;20%. Current-clamp recordings were bridge balanced and monitored frequently throughout the experiment. For current-clamp recordings, internal recording solution contained (in mM) 122 K methanesulfonate, 9 NaCl, 1.8 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 14 phosphocreatine, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 0.1 CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.05 Alexa Fluor 594 hydrazide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) adjusted to 7.35 with NaOH. For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, EGTA and CaCl<sub>2</sub> were excluded from the internal solution and 300 µM Fluo-5F (K<sub>D </sub>= ~ 2.3 µM) was added. For voltage-clamp recordings internal solution contained (in mM) 135 CsCl, 10 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 EGTA and 0.1 CaCl<sub>2,</sub> except where specifically indicated. In some cases, recordings were made using QX-314 (1 mM) added to the internal solution as well as bath applied nifedipine (10 μM) to reduce spontaneous membrane oscillations when holding at depolarized potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Puopolo et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Two-photon laser scanning microscopy and glutamate uncaging</title><p>Imaging experiments were performed using a custom two-photon microscope from Prairie Technologies Ultima (Middleton WI) along with a Mai Tai ultrafast Ti:Sapphire laser (Spectra-Physics, Mountain View CA) tuned to 810 nm for Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. For experiments using the PSD-95-ENABLED mice the excitation laser was tuned to 960 nm to visualize the mVenus signal. Cells were imaged using a 40x, 0.8 NA objective (Olympus, Melville NY). Fluorescence was split into red and green channels using a 575 nm dichroic longpass mirror and passed through 607/45 nm and 525/70 nm barrier filters before being detected by multi-alkali photomultiplier tubes (Hamamatsu). Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging was initiated 15–20 min after whole-cell break in to allow diffusion of fluorescent indicators. Linescan imaging of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> was performed at 30 s intervals. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data are presented as ΔG/G<sub>S</sub> and were quantified as changes in green fluorescence divided by red fluorescence (ΔG/R), normalized to G<sub>S</sub>/R * 100%. G<sub>S</sub>/R was measured by imaging a pipette filled with internal recording solution plus saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup> (2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) placed directly above the slice at the end of experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yasuda et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Simultaneous glutamate uncaging experiments were performed using a second Mai Tai laser tuned to 725 nm with an uncaging pulse width of 500 µs. Uncaging laser power measured at the back of the objective was between 35 and 45 mW. Synapses assayed by glutamate uncaging were 30–40 µm below the surface of the slice. The same parameters were used to bleach the spine head in FRAP recordings. The extent of bleaching by the uncaging laser was consistent from spine to spine (fluorescence reduced by 34 ± 2%), suggesting effective uncaging power was similar across experiments. External solutions for glutamate uncaging experiments contained 3 mM 4-Methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl-caged-L-glutamate (MNI-glutamate) (Tocris bioscience) and 10 µM D-serine to prevent NMDAR desensitization. Solutions were recirculated to conserve MNI-glutamate (volume = 10 mL).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Local extracellular stimulation</title><p>Local stimulation of dendritically-located synapses was performed using bipolar electrodes placed in theta glass pipettes filled with ACSF (tip diameter ~ 5 µm). Electrodes were placed within 10 µm of an Alexa-594 labeled dendrite. Stimulus intensity was set to 15–45 V with 0.5 ms pulse duration using an Iso-Flex stimulus isolator (A.M.P.I.). Picrotoxin (50 µM), CGP 55,845 hydrochloride (1 µM), sulpiride (1 µM), SCH 39,166 hydrobromide (1 µM) and LY 341495 (1 µM) were added to ACSF to block activity of GABA<sub>A</sub>, GABA<sub>B</sub>, D<sub>2</sub> dopamine, D<sub>1</sub> dopamine and group II metabotropic glutamate receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Morphological examination and analyses</title><p>Golgi-Cox staining of Swiss Webster mouse brain tissue was performed using FD Rapid GolgiStain Kit (FD NeuroTechnologies, Inc., Columbia MD) according to manufacturer instructions. Juxtacellular labelling of SNc dopamine neurons was performed using Tg(TH-EGFP)1Gsat GENSAT line mice which express enhanced GFP under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter. Mice were transcardially perfused with cold 1.5% PFA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) after which brains were dissected and postfixed for 1 hr in 1.5% PFA. Brains were sectioned at 300 µm. Fixed brain slices containing the SNc were transferred to a microscope stage and dopaminergic neurons were identified by green fluorescence. A high resistance sharp electrode containing 0.5 mM Alexa-594 was then placed against the soma of an identified dopamine neuron and large, brief (500 µs) current pulses were applied once every 30 s for 5–10 min until the soma was clearly filled with Alexa-594. Afterwards, the slice was mounted on a glass slide with VectaShield mounting medium (Vecta) and imaged on a two photon microscope (described above).</p><p>Images used for measurements of spine length and density along dendritic segments were performed using z-stacks of 64 nm<sup>2</sup><italic>xy-</italic>resolution. Images used to measure spine distribution along entire dendrites had a resolution of 146 nm<sup>2</sup>. Planes of z-stacks were separated by either 0.8 or 1.0 µm. When dendritic regions examined extended beyond the borders of a single z-stack, images were integrated using the Volume Integration and Alignment System (VIAS) software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rodriguez et al., 2003</xref>). The combined data set was then loaded into Neuron Studio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wearne et al., 2005</xref>) where dendrites were semi-automatically reconstructed and dendritic spines were manually identified.</p><p>Spine morphology was measured in ImageJ. The spine length was measured from the base of the dendrite to the tip of the spine head. Spine head diameter was estimated by measuring full-width at half maximum of the pixel intensity across a 3 pixel wide line drawn orthogonal to the spine neck. The spine head diameter was then used to estimate the spine head volume by V<sub>head</sub> = 4/3*π*r<sup>3</sup>, where r is the radius of the spine head.</p><p>The pixel intensity of mVenus signal in PSD-95-ENABLED mice was measured by drawing an ROI around the dendritic shaft or spine of interest and measuring the pixel intensity throughout the z-stack. After background subtraction, green and red pixel intensities were measured as the integral of 3 consecutive z-slices, with the middle slice corresponding to the highest red intensity. Bleedthrough of Alexa-594 signal into the green channel was measured in regions of the dendritic shaft with no apparent mVenus signal (average bleedthrough = 3.3%). mVenus pixel intensities for dendritic shafts and spines were therefore corrected by subtracting the product of the corresponding red pixel intensity and the bleedthrough measured for that dendrite.</p><p>Electrophysiological data were analyzed using custom routines written in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics). Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and FRAP data were quantified using ImageJ to measure fluorescence intensities and further analyzed using Igor.</p><p>FRAP data were corrected for slight and gradual acquisition- related bleaching due to scanning by the imaging laser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishikawa-Ankerhold et al., 2012</xref>). To isolate the extent of acquisition-related bleaching, we measured the Alexa-594 fluorescence intensity during linescans in which the uncaging laser was not targeted to the spine head. On average, the baseline fluorescence was reduced by 3.5 ± 0.7% (n=33) over the course of imaging. These acquisition-only signals were fit with a straight line and FRAP traces were normalized to these functions. Corrected FRAP traces were then fit with a double-exponential function constrained to return to baseline fluorescence levels. The weighted time constant was calculated as:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We thank Rebekah Evans and Rahilla Tarfa and other members of the Khaliq laboratory for helpful comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript examines an interesting and somewhat understudied topic – the role of dendritic spines on dopamine neurons, which are outnumbered by shaft synapses by about 4-fold. Both reviewers were supportive and ask for revisions that should be addressable primarily with analysis of existing data and a more thorough description of methods. The comments to be addressed are included below. Some of reviewer 2's comments may require some additional experiments (e.g. points 2,4,5,7) if the data are not available.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>1) This is a comprehensive examination of the sites involved in glutamate dependent transmission on dopamine neurons. Functional synapses on the spines dendritic shafts of dopamine neurons have not been compared. The differences between the two types of synapses is novel and important. The results of this study may explain multiple observations surrounding the expression of different forms of synaptic plasticity on dopamine neurons.</p><p>2) The section on electrical and chemical compartmentalization needs an explanation of the significance of these experiments linked to the functional difference between spine and shaft synapses. It seems obvious but without a better discussion of this issue it is just a lot of work to confirm what has been reported in other places.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> is a bit confusing when considering the increase in calcium that results from the action potentials. It would be less confusing if the action potential dependent rise in calcium was also illustrated. Presumably that is the point of the open triangle in Part B? It would be helpful to see it in parts A and C. Previous work in this lab reported similar calcium boosting and an increase in transmission in dendrites during pacemaking. The significance of the present results is that the calcium boosting is statistically larger in the spines (compare F&amp;G with I&amp;J).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Hage and colleagues use a combination of electrophysiology and 2photon glutamate uncaging/Ca imaging to study the role of spines on substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons. Evaluating the functional role of spines on various neuron subtypes, including sparsely spiny neurons, is of general importance, will deepen our understanding of spine biology and essential for understanding the specific synaptic computations performed by a given neuronal subtype. That said, there are a few significant issues with the execution of the experiments, the analysis, and interpretation of the results.</p><p>1) The authors standardize laser power at the back focal plane of the objective but laser power delivery to the spine/dendrite will decrease significantly with depth into the slice. Experiments should be done either within a relatively tight range of depths or effective laser power should be normalized at the depth of the spine. Overall the power delivery should be more clearly described with respect to the depth of the spine in the slice.</p><p>2) Spines with long necks are described as having immature (weak) synapses and high resistance necks that would filter EPSPs. It's not possible to attribute the small EPSPs recorded at the soma to spine neck resistance without knowing if there are AMPARs in the spine head and, if there are AMPARs, how the receptor number compares to that of shorter neck spines. Experiments should be conducted to measure/estimate AMPAR and NMDAR numbers for spines of varying lengths. Fluor intensity of PSD-95-venus puncta might be a suitable proxy.</p><p>3) FRAP analysis needs to be revisited with fits constrained to baseline fluorescence. The authors use FRAP measurements (proxy for chemical compartmentalization) to estimate spine neck resistance. In the FRAP example shown, 15-20% of the fluorescence signal does not recover, yet the authors fit this trace with a monoexponential function, that is not constrained to baseline fluorescence and report a tau of 30 ms. (This trace is better described with a double exponential, with the first time constant possibly reflecting diffusion of fluorophore within the spine and the second reflecting diffusion between the spine and dendrite.). If the fluorescence of an untethered molecule doesn't recover, there is a stronger barrier to diffusion than reported. How many of the data points are affected by this? Additionally, spine neck resistance is proportional to the length <italic>cross sectional area</italic> axial resistance. The spine neck diameter is going to have a much larger impact on resistance than length. Finally, the relationship that is most relevant, and least subject to assumptions based on unmeasurable physical features (at least with 2P) would be the FRAP versus uEPSP amplitude. A better experiment altogether would be to uncage (in a standardized way) on either side of the neck and measure a voltage dependent process in the spine head. This has been done by the Sabatini and Magee labs to good effect.</p><p>4) The authors report there is an increase AMPA to NMDA ratio in shorter spines. The data presented in 6C indicate that on average the ratio is ~ equivalent. Moreover, the authors need to distinguish between 1) differences in receptor number at synapses on long versus short spines, 2) differential filtering of fast AMPA versus slow NMDAR mediated potentials, and 3) over all compartmentalization of electrical and biochemical signals within the spine, via the spine neck. Specifically, are AMPA and NMDA electrical signals equally attenuated by the spine neck?</p><p>5) Experiments testing the ohmic nature of spine neck resistance should be shown as well as described in text.</p><p>6) If PSD-95-venus fluorescence correlates with uEPSP amplitude (and presumably AMPAR number) how does venus intensity correlate with spine length? This may provide a strong paradigm for disambiguating the issues in points (3) and (4) The authors might have these experiments done already but only need to analyze them. If the long spines have no PSD-95 puncta, they might not have AMPARs, so stating the spine neck filters these currents is inaccurate.</p><p>7) The authors uncage on the spine and dendrite while the cell is at different membrane potentials. They observe the spine Ca signal is larger at more negative membrane potentials and attribute this to increase relief of Mg block at spine synapses due to the larger depolarization of the spine head. Although this is a possible interpretation, it is also possible that there are T-type VGCCs in the spine head that are not present in the adjacent shaft. Experiments should be done to determine if the spine and dendrite have the same NMDAR and VGCC mediated Ca signals. If the Ca sources are different the measurements they've made might not be correctly interpreted.</p><p>8) What does the Ca signal in the spine and dendrite look like during tonic firing without uncaging? The authors should show Ca transients from spikes alone.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13905.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) This is a comprehensive examination of the sites involved in glutamate dependent transmission on dopamine neurons.

We now illustrate isolated AP-evoked and uncaging-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals measured in the spine and dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). We have conducted further analyses in which we made linear predictions of spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during pacemaking by summing the two isolated signals according to the timing of glutamate uncaging and action potential firing. These “linear sums” are now shown with the recorded spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals for measurements made during 3 different phases of pacemaking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,D</xref>). Examining the relationship between the expected linear sums and the phase of the spike cycle predicted a small enhancement of spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in late phases due to the additional AP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). The measured enhancement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was significantly larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>) and could be observed even if when we limited our analyses to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx occurring before the AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>). We indicated in the figure legend that the open and closed triangles are illustrating peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals measured before and after the AP.</p><p>We have made <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9E-–J</xref> examining the effect of TTX and DAP5 on glutamate-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the spine and dendrite a separate figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). These experiments were not performed in tonically active cells. We originally included these data with experiments examining pacemaking as we believe VGSCs and NMDARs contribute to the observed phase-dependence of spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx as described in the Results and Discussion.</p><p>We agree that the findings shown here share some important similarities and differences to the findings reported in Hage and Khaliq, 2015. The previous study reported that increases in the rate of tonic firing could influence retrograde Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and synaptically-evoked bursts. This was due to a fairly small, but fairly steady depolarization of the average interspike membrane potential. This depolarization promoted activation of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and NMDARs.</p><p>In this study, we examined the influence of tonic firing on synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in individual spines and on a much finer time scale. Similar to the changes observed with long-lasting increases in tonic firing rate reported in Hage and Khaliq 2015, the enhancement of spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> at late phases of the spike cycle that we observe here is due to a more depolarized membrane potential – promoting activation of NMDARs and voltage-gated channels. While our previous study predicted a possible phase dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhancement also through depolarization, we were surprised both by the magnitude and timing of the enhancement in the present experiments. In addition, we believe that a key contributor to the enhancement of spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> in this study is passive amplification that occurs as a result of the spine neck resistance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors standardize laser power at the back focal plane of the objective but laser power delivery to the spine/dendrite will decrease significantly with depth into the slice. Experiments should be done either within a relatively tight range of depths or effective laser power should be normalized at the depth of the spine. Overall the power delivery should be more clearly described with respect to the depth of the spine in the slice.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer raises an important methodological point. Throughout this study, we targeted spines 30-40 µm below the surface of the slice and have now included this statement in the methods. Consistency in laser power delivered to the spine was confirmed in FRAP experiments. For these experiments, we used the same uncaging protocol that was used to measure the EPSP and spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The extent of bleaching for a 0.5 ms pulse (35-45 mW at the back aperture) was largely consistent at 34 ± 2% (n=33 spines).</p><p>The issue raised by the reviewer also highlights the importance of our paired comparisons of short versus long spines, or spines versus shaft synapses. Neighboring postsynaptic structures at the same depth in slice and the same distance from the soma were assayed using identical uncaging pulses (summarized if <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7D</xref>). Furthermore, pooling data across all spines, we did not observe differences in spine length with respect to depth in the slice. Therefore, given precautions that we have taken as described above, we are confident that any systematic biases in the effective uncaging power are minimal under our experimental conditions.</p><p><italic>2) Spines with long necks are described as having immature (weak) synapses and high resistance necks that would filter EPSPs. It's not possible to attribute the small EPSPs recorded at the soma to spine neck resistance without knowing if there are AMPARs in the spine head and, if there are AMPARs, how the receptor number compares to that of shorter neck spines. Experiments should be conducted to measure/estimate AMPAR and NMDAR numbers for spines of varying lengths. Fluor intensity of PSD-95-venus puncta might be a suitable proxy.</italic></p><p>As the reviewer suggested, we measured PSD-95-venus fluorescence in spines of varying lengths. We reanalyzed the z-stacks we used to measure spine and shaft synapse densities. We observe a weak, though highly significant correlation between mVenus intensity and spine length. These new data have been added to the paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Notably, a significant number of long spines displayed mVenus fluorescence that was significantly higher than the average background mVenus intensities measured in the dendrite. Therefore, using PSD-95 fluorescence intensity as a proxy for AMPAR density, our new analysis of the mVenus fluorescence shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref> support the idea that AMPAR are indeed present on longer spines albeit at lower densities than on shorter spines.</p><p>In addition, we have performed an analogous set of voltage-clamp experiments (described in our response to Point #5) in which we recorded AMPAR-mediated uEPSCs from long and short spines in the presence of cyclothiazide to limit AMPAR desensitization. Similarly, we find that longer spines exhibit smaller amplitude uEPSCs, suggesting that AMPARs are present on long spines but at lower densities relative to short spines.</p><p><italic>3) FRAP analysis needs to be revisited with fits constrained to baseline fluorescence. The authors use FRAP measurements (proxy for chemical compartmentalization) to estimate spine neck resistance. In the FRAP example shown, 15-20% of the fluorescence signal does not recover, yet the authors fit this trace with a monoexponential function, that is not constrained to baseline fluorescence and report a tau of 30 ms. (This trace is better described with a double exponential, with the first time constant possibly reflecting diffusion of fluorophore within the spine and the second reflecting diffusion between the spine and dendrite.). If the fluorescence of an untethered molecule doesn't recover, there is a stronger barrier to diffusion than reported. How many of the data points are affected by this?</italic></p><p>To address this point, we will first discuss data fits to single exponentials. Without constraining the exponential fits to baseline fluorescence values, we found that the average steady-state value approached by the exponential fit (y<sub>0</sub>)was ~95% of the baseline fluorescence signal. A histogram of the original values is provided below. In the example shown in the original manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) the unconstrained y<sub>0</sub> was 92% of the baseline signal.</p><p>After reexamining these data, it appears that some spine fluorescent signals do not make a complete return to baseline due to gradual bleaching of the Alexa-594 dye by the imaging laser. Acquisition-related bleaching and different means of correction have been described in a variety of FRAP experiments (Ishikawa-Ankerhold et al., 2012). We were able to estimate the extent of acquisition-related bleaching for each spine using scans in which we did not target the uncaging laser to the spine head. These data were routinely collected when we uncaged glutamate near the spines to measure uEPSP amplitude and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The extent of this acquisition-bleaching was roughly proportional to the incompleteness of recovery in FRAP experiments (on average 3.5 ± 0.7% over 33 spines). Alexa 594 signals from the “acquisition-only” scans were fit with a straight line. FRAP data were then normalized to these fits.</p><p>After performing this correction we reanalyzed our data by constraining double exponential fits to return to the baseline fluorescence as the reviewer suggested. Consistent with the reviewer’s expectation, constraining fits to baseline fluorescence generally increased the measured time constant, suggesting a higher barrier to diffusion than we previously reported. Correspondingly, the estimated spine neck resistances are larger.</p><p>We also considered the reviewer’s suggestion that the fast time constant of double-exponential fits could reflect diffusion of Alexa within the spine head. We found no correlation between spine head volume and the rate of the fast time constant (R=0.03) or the relative weight of the fast time constant to the overall fit (R=0.01). Therefore, we used a weighted time constant from the double-exponential fits to describe the diffusional coupling between the spine and dendrite. Similar to our original analysis with mono-exponential fits, we see a significant correlation between the time course of FRAP and spine length (R=0.52; p=0.002) as well as between the uEPSP amplitude and estimated spine neck resistance (R=-0.50, p=0.0046). A new example FRAP trace is provided. The trace was normalized to baseline fluorescence to aid readers in observing the extent of initial bleaching and recovery.</p><p><italic>Additionally, spine neck resistance is proportional to the length cross sectional area axial resistance. The spine neck diameter is going to have a much larger impact on resistance than length. Finally, the relationship that is most relevant, and least subject to assumptions based on unmeasurable physical features (at least with 2P) would be the FRAP versus uEPSP amplitude. A better experiment altogether would be to uncage (in a standardized way) on either side of the neck and measure a voltage dependent process in the spine head. This has been done by the Sabatini and Magee labs to good effect.</italic></p><p>We agree that the cross sectional area of the spine will largely determine chemical diffusion and the spine neck resistance, but is not adequately measurable with 2P imaging. As suggested by the reviewer, the FRAP vs. uEPSP amplitude is probably the most suitable for two-photon. When considering the FRAP data, however, it is important to note that the time course of FRAP will depend on both the morphology of the spine neck as well as the volume of the spine head. As described in the studies by Tonnenson et al., and Takasaki and Sabatini, τ = (head volume*neck length)/(diffusion constant*neck cross sectional area).</p><p>Based on the equations above, the FRAP time course is not only dependent on the spine neck resistance, but also on the spine head volume. Therefore, a measure that incorporates both the FRAP time course and the spine head volume (such as the estimates of R<sub>neck</sub>) will be a better indicator of the electrical/diffusive barrier of the spine neck than FRAP alone. Consistent with this, measuring the relationship between uEPSP amplitude and FRAP time course indicates a weak correlation that nears statistical significance (R=-0.34, p=0.065). However, there is a moderate and highly significant correlation between uEPSP amplitude and the estimated neck resistance (R=-0.50, p=0.0046). These estimates of neck resistance are not based on morphological measurements of neck diameter or neck length, but only the spine head volume.</p><p>Estimating spine head volume with 2P has been used by multiple labs to measure relative differences between spines or changes in spine volume with time, though admittedly these estimates of are not as accurate as those made using super resolution light microscopy or EM. Despite these differences, we point out here, as we do in the manuscript, that the estimates of spine neck resistance from our data are similar to those utilizing higher resolution STED imaging to measure spine head volume (Tonnenson et al., 2014).</p><p><italic>4) The authors report there is an increase AMPA to NMDA ratio in shorter spines. The data presented in 6C indicate that on average the ratio is ~ equivalent.</italic> </p><p>In the text of the original manuscript, we point out that the amplitude of both AMPAR and NMDAR mediated currents in longer spines. Importantly, however, we also find that the relative decrease in the AMPAR mediate current amplitude with spine length is more dramatic, resulting in the reduction in AMPA/NMDA ratio with increasing spine length reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>.</p><p>In the revised version of this manuscript, we provide a new pair of currents from example spines to better illustrate the summary data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> has been redrawn with the AMPA and NMDA data plotted on neighboring plots to make the subtle differences in the relationship between current amplitude and spine length more clear.</p><p><italic>Moreover, the authors need to distinguish between 1) differences in receptor number at synapses on long versus short spines, 2) differential filtering of fast AMPA versus slow NMDAR mediated potentials, and 3) over all compartmentalization of electrical and biochemical signals within the spine, via the spine neck. Specifically, are AMPA and NMDA electrical signals equally attenuated by the spine neck?</italic></p><p>As the reviewer points out, the spine neck could perhaps more dramatically attenuate AMPA signals than NMDA signals due to differences in receptor kinetics. To address this concern, we performed additional analysis of existing data by measuring the relationship between spine length and the AMPAR-mediated charge transfer (the integral of the currents measured at -70 mV). The spine neck resistance is predicted to have a much smaller effect on total transfer of charge to the dendrite than on current amplitude. These data have been added to the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we conducted additional experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F-–J</xref>) in which we isolated AMPAR currents and blocked desensitization of the AMPARs with cyclothiazide. This treatment has the effect of increasing the total synaptic conductance and slowing the kinetics of the AMPAR ~2.5 fold. By increasing the synaptic conductance, we minimize the effect of the neck resistance on the measurements of current and charge transfer. Furthermore, by slowing the kinetics of the receptor we can mitigate the low pass filtering that the spine neck may produce. In these conditions, we observe a significant correlation between spine length and AMPA current amplitude as well as spine length and charge transfer.</p><p>Combined with our additional analysis of the PSD-95 ENABLED mouse (described in Point #2) we have significant evidence to suggest that a lower AMPAR density contributes to the small uEPSPs produced by long spines.</p><p><italic>5) Experiments testing the ohmic nature of spine neck resistance should be shown as well as described in text.</italic></p><p>In the original manuscript, we stated that the spine neck resistance was predicted to be ohmic as we believe it to be primarily dependent on the morphology of the spine neck and the axial resistance of the cytoplasm (as described by the reviewer in point 3). We assumed that it was unlikely that these parameters would readily change with transmembrane voltage. To test this assumption, we measured isolated AMPAR currents in cyclothiazide (described above) at -70 mV and +40 mV (NMDA receptors were blocked in these experiments). If the spine neck resistance were non-ohmic, the relationship between neck length and the AMPAR-mediated current would differ between positive and negative voltages. To look at this, we plotted the ratio of AMPAR current amplitude at -70 and +40 mV against spine length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). We observe no correlation between this ratio and spine length, suggesting the spine neck resistance is indeed ohmic.</p><p><italic>6) If PSD-95-venus fluorescence correlates with uEPSP amplitude (and presumably AMPAR number) how does venus intensity correlate with spine length? This may provide a strong paradigm for disambiguating the issues in points (3) and (4) The authors might have these experiments done already but only need to analyze them. If the long spines have no PSD-95 puncta, they might not have AMPARs, so stating the spine neck filters these currents is inaccurate.</italic></p><p>See response provided in Point #2.</p><p><italic>7) The authors uncage on the spine and dendrite while the cell is at different membrane potentials. They observe the spine Ca signal is larger at more negative membrane potentials and attribute this to increase relief of Mg block at spine synapses due to the larger depolarization of the spine head. Although this is a possible interpretation, it is also possible that there are T-type VGCCs in the spine head that are not present in the adjacent shaft. Experiments should be done to determine if the spine and dendrite have the same NMDAR and VGCC mediated Ca signals. If the Ca sources are different the measurements they've made might not be correctly interpreted.</italic></p><p>To address the reviewer’s concern that T-type VGCCs are present in the spine head but not in the dendritic shaft, we repeated these experiments in the presence the specific T-type channel block TTA-P2 (n=16 spines and 16 shaft synapses) and obtained results similar to our original dataset (see comparison below). In the presence of TTA-P2 at voltages below -60 mV, normalized spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was significantly smaller than normalized shaft Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (p=0.004). Given the similarities of the data sets, they have been pooled in the resubmitted manuscript.</p><p><italic>8) What does the Ca signal in the spine and dendrite look like during tonic firing without uncaging? The authors should show Ca transients from spikes alone.</italic></p><p>We have performed additional experiments and analyses of these data as described in response to Reviewer 1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> has been updated to reflect this.</p></body></sub-article></article>
