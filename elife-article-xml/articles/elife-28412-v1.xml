channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1) and is highly dependent on the physical distance between Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 and synaptic vesicles (coupling). Although various active zone proteins are proposed to control coupling and abundance of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 through direct interactions with the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α1 subunit C-terminus at the active zone, the role of these interaction partners is controversial. To define the intrinsic motifs that regulate coupling, we expressed mutant Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunits on a Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 null background at the calyx of Held presynaptic terminal. Our results identified a region that directly controlled fast synaptic vesicle release and vesicle docking at the active zone independent of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 abundance. In addition, proposed individual direct interactions with active zone proteins are insufficient for Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 abundance and coupling. Therefore, our work advances our molecular understanding of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 regulation of neurotransmitter release in mammalian CNS synapses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28412.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28412.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28412.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The points of contact between nerve cells are called synapses, and nerve cells communicate across synapses via chemicals known as neurotransmitters. These chemical messengers are initially stored within bubble-like packages called synaptic vesicles that are released after they fuse with the membrane of the nerve cell at a specialized site referred to as the “active zone”.</p><p>Calcium ions are one of the major factors that lead to the release of synaptic vesicles. Ion channel proteins in the membrane of the nerve cell control the flow of calcium ions into the cell. There are often many different ion channels at a synapse, but one type called Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 most effectively triggers the release of synaptic vesicles when a nerve impulse reaches the synapse. Various proteins at the active zone can bind directly to parts of the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channel that are identified by a short sequence of amino acids – the building blocks of all proteins. Several researchers have proposed that the interactions with some of these short sequences, which are also known as motifs, control how much of this ion channel is in the synapse and how it interacts with synaptic vesicles to regulate the release of neurotransmitters. However, other researchers do not agree with this proposed explanation.</p><p>Lübbert, Goral et al. set out to determine which parts in a specific part of the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channel (called the “α1 subunit C-terminus”) are critical for its interaction with synaptic vesicles. The experiments revealed a new motif that regulates how many synaptic vesicles could be released in response to electrical impulses travelling along nerve cells from mice. The same motif also regulates the total number of synaptic vesicles at the active zone.</p><p>Lübbert, Goral et al. went on to show that binding to known active proteins at most played a minor role in controlling the abundance of the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels and how close they were to the synaptic vesicles. As such, these findings counter prevailing views of the roles of certain motifs in the α1 subunit of the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channel. Thus, it may be necessary to re-think how the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channel regulates the release of synaptic vesicles.</p><p>Ion channels are vital to the activity of all nerve cells, and working out how the numbers and organization of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 and related ion channels are regulated will be fundamental to understanding how information is encoded in brain. In addition, problems with these kinds of ion channel may result in disorders such as migraines and epilepsy. Therefore, the new findings may help to guide further studies investigating possible ways to treat these disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28412.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28412.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>calcium channels</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>presynapse</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC014093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Samuel M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Samuel M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel region in the CaV2.1 α1 subunit regulates coupling of synaptic vesicles to CaV2.1 calcium channels, synaptic vesicle release and docking, and the size of the fast and total releasable pools of synaptic vesicles.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A critical determinant in regulating synaptic vesicle (SV) release probability and kinetics is coupling, the physical distance of SVs and voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) at the presynaptic terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>). Differences in coupling distances between Ca<sub>V</sub>2 VGCCs subtypes underpin the differences in Ca<sub>V</sub>2 VGCC subtype effectiveness in eliciting AP evoked release and define the SV release mode in response to APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eggermann et al., 2011</xref>). They are: nanodomain, a few tightly coupled VGCCs (&lt;30 nm), and microdomain, many loosely coupled VGCCs (~100 nm) trigger SV release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eggermann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fedchyshyn and Wang, 2005</xref>). In the majority of central nervous system synapses, Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 VGCCs (Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1) are the principal Ca<sub>V</sub> subtype that supports AP mediated neurotransmitter release, and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels are thought to exist in closest proximity to SVs compared to other Ca<sub>V</sub> subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eggermann et al., 2011</xref>). The Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit cytoplasmic C-terminus is mutated in a class of Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channelopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pietrobon, 2010</xref>) and contains many motifs implicated to directly interact with key active zone (AZ) proteins to control Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 coupling and abundance in the presynaptic terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simms and Zamponi, 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, the necessity and mechanism of action of these motifs are highly controversial due to disparate results from different model systems and from knockout mouse models of AZ proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atasoy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Das, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davydova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaeser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wong and Stanley, 2010</xref>). In addition, it is unclear whether the mechanisms that control coupling and abundance are interrelated or separable.</p><p>To address these questions, we utilized the calyx of Held/Medial Nucleus of the Trapezoid Body (MNTB) synapse, a large glutamatergic axosomatic synapse, in which: (1) individual AZs ultrastructure and (2) Ca<sub>V</sub>2 subtype abundance and proximity to SVs controlling SV release at the calyx of Held is similar to many other synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borst and Soria van Hoeve, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, due to its unparalleled experimental accessibility, molecular manipulations can be made exclusively in the presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wimmer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Young and Neher, 2009</xref>), and presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents can be recorded and correlated with synaptic vesicle release rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neher and Sakaba, 2001b</xref>), which allows for well-controlled measurements not achievable in other model systems. By directly manipulating the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit in a native neuronal circuit, we were able to overcome the previous limitations in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atasoy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davydova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaeser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wong and Stanley, 2010</xref>). Thus, we were able to identify a novel intrinsic motif in the C-terminus that regulates coupling and demonstrate that coupling and abundance are separable. Finally, we found that this novel C-terminal region in the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit also regulates SV docking at the AZ. Therefore, our work provides new molecular insights into Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit regulation of SV release from presynaptic terminals in CNS synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genetic manipulation of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels at the calyx</title><p>To manipulate Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 at the calyx, Helper-Dependent Adenoviral vectors (HdAd) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palmer and Ng, 2005</xref>) were utilized in conjunction with a <italic>Cacna1a</italic> conditional knock-out (CKO) mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Todorov et al., 2006</xref>).

Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2016–2368 removes the complete CASK binding site, a proposed secondary Ca<sub>V</sub>β4 interaction site, and two remaining PXXP motifs in the α<sub>1</sub> subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Analysis of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> current as a function of voltage (I(V)) and tail currents revealed that expression of mutants lacking motifs located within the last 350 amino acids revealed no significant difference in Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes or voltage dependent activation compared to Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 FT rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Since the 3 ms peak EPSC amplitude directly correlates to those SVs that are tightly coupled to Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channels at the P9-11 calyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), we measured the peak 3 ms EPSC peak amplitudes in all our deletion mutants. Thus, if these intrinsic motifs were essential for SV to Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 coupling, we should see a dramatic reduction in the 3 ms peak EPSC amplitude, and if they were not essential there should be no change. Analysis of the 3 ms peak EPSC amplitudes revealed no change in the peak amplitudes with deletions from amino acid 2265 and beyond (Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2365–2368, Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2213–2368 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2061–2368), when compared to control (Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 FT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). However, we saw a dramatic reduction in the EPSC amplitudes with Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2042–2368 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2016–2368 (FT: 8.54 ± 0.9 nA; Δ2042–2368: 3.38 ± 0.89 nA (p&lt;0.01); Δ2016–2368: 2.47 ± 0.89 nA (p&lt;0.001); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In addition, only the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2042–2368 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2016–2368 mutants showed a significant slowdown in the 10–90 rise time compared to FT and a significant increases in the synaptic delay time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>In response to the 30 ms step pulse, we found no significant change in the 10–90 rise time or EPSC amplitudes with Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2365–2368, Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2213–2368 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2061–2368 compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). It is important to note that unlike the 3 ms peak EPSC amplitude, the 30 ms 10–90 peak EPSC rise time is an inaccurate measure of coupling of all SVs in the total releasable pool, as the 30 ms peak amplitude does not accurately measure the total releasable pool size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). We found a significant increase in the 10–90 rise time with Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2042–2368 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2016–2368 (FT: 1.41 ± 0.18 ms; Δ2042–2368: 4.67 ± 0.72 ms (p&lt;0.01); Δ2016–2368: 6.99 ± 1.45 ms (p&lt;0.0001)), with reduced EPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In all cases, there was no difference between Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2042–2368 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2016–2368 indicating that the further deletion did not lead to more severe reductions in the ESPC amplitude or 10–90 rise time. Although, there appeared to be a slight slowing in the 10–90 rise time with Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2365–2368, Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2213–2368 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2061–2368 compared to control in both the 3 ms and 30 ms EPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), this change was not statistically significant and was very minor compared to the dramatic deceleration in in the 10–90 rise times found in Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2042–2368 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2016–2368. Based on these results, we conclude that a novel C-terminal region including at least the amino acids 2042–2061 is critical for fast release.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A novel C-terminal region in Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit regulates the total releasable pool size</title><p>To understand how the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2042–2368 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2016–2368 truncations impacted the size and release kinetics of the fast pool (AP-evoked release) and the total releasable pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we used a deconvolution analysis routine to calculate release rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neher and Sakaba, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2001b</xref>). We found that both Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2042–2368 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2016–2368 lead to a dramatic reduction in peak vesicle release rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) with a significant increase in the delayed release (slow pool component) and slower time to peak EPSC release rates compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Integration of the release rates for both the 3 ms and 30 ms pulses revealed a dramatic reduction in both mutants of both the fast pool and the total releasable pool. (RRP: FT: 1505 ± 245 SVs;Δ2042–2368: 430 ± 116 SVs (p&lt;0.001); Δ2016–2368: 357 ± 134 SVs (p&lt;0.001); total releasable pool: FT: 2152 ± 263 SVs; Δ2042–2368: 1292 ± 221 SVs (p&lt;0.05); Δ2016–2368: 1061 ± 258 SVs (p&lt;0.01)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To test how the kinetics of release were affected by the fast component of release, the cumulative release rates were normalized to their respective total number of vesicles released during the 30 ms depolarizing pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This clearly demonstrates that both mutants had a significantly decreased fast component. In all cases, there were no differences between Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2042–2368 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2016–2368. Comparison of the ratio of the RPP size to the total releasable pool size revealed a significant reduction in the contribution of the RRP to the total releasable pool size in the mutants. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>)(<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Thus, based on our results we can conclude that the region between 2016 and 2042 is essential for both regulating the total number of releasable vesicles, as well as the relative contributions of fast and slow SV pool components.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A novel C-terminal region in Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit regulates SV Docking at the active zone</title><p>Since docked synaptic vesicles at the AZ are the morphological correlates of the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schikorski and Stevens, 2001</xref>), we next assessed how Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2042–2368 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2016–2368 affected presynaptic ultrastructure.

Although our results cannot rule out that Bassoon controls Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 abundance, our results do not support the model in which Bassoon regulates Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 abundance at the presynaptic terminal through direct RBP interaction with the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davydova et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>RIM proteins have been demonstrated to be important for regulating Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channel current density and abundance at both invertebrate and vertebrate presynaptic terminals, as knock out RIM proteins lead to dramatic reductions in Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Graf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaeser et al., 2011</xref>). However, deletion of the DDWC motif in the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit which interacts both with MINT1 and RIM1/2 did not lead to any changes in Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) indicating this motif is not necessary for Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 targeting to the presynaptic membrane. Although the RIM1/2 PDZ domain interaction with the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit DDWC is proposed to be critical for Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1/2.2 abundance and localization to the presynaptic terminal, the necessity of this interaction was not directly demonstrated in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaeser et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, other biochemical assays have failed to detect this direct interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wong et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wong and Stanley, 2010</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that the RIM PDZ domain interacts with the CAST/ELKS proteins with an affinity of 200 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2005</xref>), while the RIM PDZ domain interaction with the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1/2.2 α<sub>1</sub> subunit has an affinity of 20 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaeser et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, an alternative interpretation is that RIM1/2 PDZ interacts with CAST/ELKS proteins to form a macromolecular complex that controls Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1/2.2 abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hida and Ohtsuka, 2010</xref>).</p><p>What then could be the motifs that are essential for Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 localization/abundance at the presynaptic terminal? In addition to the C-terminal region, the synprint region which binds to SNARE proteins has been proposed to be an integral motif for Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 incorporation into the presynaptic terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Catterall, 2011</xref>). However, syntaxin 1A binding sites in Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 are dispensable for synaptic targeting and AP-evoked release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Szabo et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, synprint domains lacking syntaxin 1A binding sites have reduced levels of incorporation into the neuroendocrine cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rajapaksha et al., 2008</xref>). Another potential motif is the AID domain in the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit which interacts with the Ca<sub>V</sub>β subunit to regulate Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 localization to the presynaptic membrane via a RIM1/2-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kiyonaka et al., 2007</xref>). Since the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit is heavily spliced depending on the neuronal cell-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simms and Zamponi, 2014</xref>), it is possible that no single motif is responsible for Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 localization and incorporation in the presynaptic membrane, but that various motifs may act in concert or independently to ensure Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 abundance. In addition, the necessity of these motifs may also vary at different synapses and the developmental state of the neuronal circuit in which the synapses are embedded.</p><p>Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels are not randomly distributed in the presynaptic membrane but cluster within AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holderith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakamura et al., 2015</xref>). Since the calyx of Held is a large presynaptic terminal that contains many AZs, the conclusions based our presynaptic recordings are limited to Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 localization to the presynaptic terminal. Thus, we cannot rule out that the C-terminal domains contained within amino acids 2016–2368 which are not essential for localization to the presynaptic membrane, are critical for Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 clustering/organization within individual AZs. To determine if the mechanisms that control Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 clustering and presynaptic membrane localization are independently regulated, morphological studies will need to be carried out.</p><p>Although exons 44–47 of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 can impact voltage dependent activation and inactivation in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirano et al., 2017</xref>), our direct recordings did not detect differences in the overall biophysical parameters of these mutants compared to terminals rescued with full length Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunits or in a wild-type background. We did not block Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 or Ca<sub>V</sub>2.3 currents which are present in prehearing calyces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doughty et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iwasaki and Takahashi, 1998</xref>). Therefore, the presence of these currents could obscure possible changes in Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 current with our mutants. In addition, we did not test for these regions role in the regulation of Calcium-dependent activation or facilitation. Thus, depending on the synapse and its developmental state, it is possible that these regions are critical for modulation of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 function in response to high frequency stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 controls coupling to SVs, RRP and total releasable pool size</title><p>Although many proteins interact with the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channel complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2010</xref>), it is largely unknown whether they interact with the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit to regulate coupling in its native environment. Our paired recordings revealed a dramatic reduction in the 3 ms peak EPSC amplitude which measures the RRP, while release kinetics with both the 3 ms and 30 ms EPSCs were dramatically slowed down in the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2042-2368 mutant but not Δ2061-2368 mutant. Thus, our data demonstrates a motif or motif(s) in amino acids 2042–2061 in the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit regulates RRP size and coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Prior studies using step depolarizations at the prehearing calyx have shown that loss of RIM and RBPs resulted in a 2–3 fold slowdown in release kinetics respectively and indicating that these proteins are involved in pathways that regulate the RRP size, coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, we did not see any dramatic slowdown in release or changes in RRP size that mimicked these phenotypes previously seen with RIM or RBP KO animals when these direct binding motifs in the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit were deleted. Although we observed a slight slowing of the 10–90 rise times, ~20–30%, which was similar for the Δ2365–2368, Δ2213–2368, Δ2061–2368 mutants, this was not statistically significant. We did not directly measure AP-evoked release in this study, but it has been previously demonstrated that a Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 splice variants lacking RIM or RBP binding sites rescued AP-evoked release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao and Tsien, 2010</xref>). Finally, it has been demonstrated in PC12 cells that Ca<sub>V</sub>β interactions with RIM1/2 are critical for anchoring SVs to Ca<sub>V</sub>2 calcium channels to control coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Uriu et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, our results strongly support that proposed individual direct interactions in between the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit with RIM1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaeser et al., 2011</xref>) or RBP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hibino et al., 2002</xref>) at most play a minor role in regulating RRP size and coupling.</p><p>In addition to the reduction in RRP size, we observed a reduction in the total releasable pool size, indicating a loss in the number of fusion competent vesicles. Our morphological analysis revealed that this corresponded to a 50% reduction in the number of docked SVs compared to wild-type. Recent work proposed that SV docking corresponds to priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Imig et al., 2014</xref>), therefore we propose that this region in the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit is involved in priming. Close inspection of the amino acid sequence reveals little homology to Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.3 α<sub>1</sub> subunits (ClustalW-Gonnet series algorithm), however BLAST homology search reveals no known binding motifs (data not shown). It is possible that this region may bind to known or unknown AZ proteins that organize/cluster Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels in the AZ, which in turn couple to SVs and promote docking of SVs in the AZ. An alternative explanation is that removal of the 2061 to 2041 region results in a misfolding of this specific region so that Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels cannot interact with other proteins through other regions and cannot cluster Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels in the AZ. In both cases, SV docking would rely on Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 clustering through another protein to promote SV docking. However, to delineate the molecular mechanisms of how this motif regulates coupling, RRP and total releasable pool size, future experiments to identify potential binding partner(s) or solving of the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1α<sub>1</sub> subunit structure and these mutants will need to be performed.</p><p>Despite containing Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1, some presynaptic terminals transition from microdomain to nanodomain during maturation of neuronal circuits that encode temporal fidelity at high firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fedchyshyn and Wang, 2005</xref>). Therefore, these release states are not specific to individual Ca<sub>V</sub>2 subtypes, but instead the intrinsic motifs within the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit are differentially utilized based on the developmental state. Our results presented here focused solely on the regulation of fast release at the prehearing calyx P9-11 which utilizes microdomain release mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borst and Sakmann, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fedchyshyn and Wang, 2005</xref>). Since the calyx transitions from microdomain to nanodomain release after the onset of hearing it is highly possible that intrinsic motifs in the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit dispensable for microdomain release are necessary to support nanodomain release. Finally, since proteome composition at the AZ may vary in different various presynaptic terminals, different Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 motifs may or may not be essential to support coupling.</p><p>Taken together, these findings counter the prevailing views that (1) individual direct interactions between the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit and RIM1/2, MINT, RBP proteins are crucial for controlling Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 abundance and coupling to SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Südhof, 2013</xref>) and (2) that PXXP motifs are involved in capturing and coupling SVs to calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that the mechanisms of action by which known AZ proteins regulate SV coupling and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channel abundance involve indirect interactions with protein(s) that bind directly to the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal handling and stereotactic surgery</title><p>All procedures were performed in accordance with the animal welfare laws of the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience Institutional Animals Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

After trimming out the MNTB region, ultrathin sections were prepared with 40 nm-thickness using an ultramicrotome (EM UC7, Leica). Sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined in a Tecnai G2 Spirit BioTwin transmission electron microscope (FEI) at 100 kV acceleration voltage. Images were taken with a Veleta CCD camera (Olympus) operated by TIA software (FEI). Images used for quantification were taken at 60,000x magnification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>TEM data analysis</title><p>All TEM data were analyzed using Fiji imaging analysis software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fiji.sc/Fiji">http://fiji.sc/Fiji</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Positive calyces were identified by the existence of gold particles, and compared to contralateral nontransduced calyces. Each presynaptic AZ was defined as the membrane directly opposing postsynaptic density, and the length of each one was measured. Vesicles within 200 nm from each AZ were manually selected and their distances relative to the AZ were calculated using a 32-bit Euclidean distance map generated from the AZ. For data analysis, vesicle distances were binned every 5 nm and counted. Vesicles less than 5 nm from the AZ were considered ‘docked’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taschenberger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2010</xref>) and their numbers were averaged per animal. Three animals for each condition were analyzed. For both Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2016–2368 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1Δ2042–2368, at least 100 individual AZs were analyzed and compared with the same number of AZs of respective calyces from the contralateral MNTB (nontransduced in-slice control AZ).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical tests were conducted in Prism 6 (GraphPad Software). Sample sizes for all experiments were chosen based on assuming a population with a normal distribution, a sample size of seven is sufficient to invoke the Central Limit Theorem. All data were tested for normal distribution by performing a Shapiro-Wilk test for normality and variances of all data were estimated and compared using Bartlett’s test. Electrophysiological data were compared with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a <italic>post hoc</italic> Dunnett’s test, always using Full transcript rescue as control dataset. Patch clamp recordings lacking proper clamp quality and with high leak were excluded from data sets. EM-data were compared using an unpaired t-test. Statistical significance was accepted at *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.001; ****p&lt;0.0001. In Figures and Tables, data are reported as mean ± SEM, unless otherwise stated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Diane Lipscombe (Reviewer #3). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission..</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All three reviewers thought the work was on an important topic, that the experiments were a technical tour de force, and that the results will have an impact on the field. Specifically, the experiments could change how we think about the molecular function of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the synaptic vesicle release pathway in that the authors have defined a new region in CaV2.1 that appears to support vesicle release. However, there were concerns about how the new findings should be interpreted in molecular terms compared to prior work. It is very important that this be handled properly in the revision to provide honest assessment, but not overinterpretation, of the current work. In principle, rewriting/clarification should be sufficient to address the reviewers' concerns detailed below. To the extent that the authors think their work overturns dogma in the field, it is fair to state it, while acknowledging the limits of the experiments in this manuscript. Please attend to the issue with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have demonstrated that deletion of C-terminal region (2061–2368) of Cav2.1 channels, which interacts with active zone proteins (Rim, RBP and so on), did not impair fast transmitter release. Further deletion (2015–2060) was required to impair the coupling between Ca channels and transmitter release. In parallel, the EM analysis has shown that the number of docked vesicles was reduced. The study is interesting and may provide the evidence that single protein-protein interaction may be insufficient to explain coupling between Ca channels and readily-releasable synaptic vesicles (but see below). Also, the study is technically demanding, because they have combined paired pre- and postsynaptic recordings at the calyx of Held synapse and virus transfection in the KO mice background.</p><p>1) The authors provided no explanation about how deletion of new region in the C -terminal (2015–2060) yields loss of releasable synaptic vesicles. This region may bind to known or unknown active zone proteins to insert Ca channels in the proper place at the active zones, or else the Ca channel structure is disrupted. Without presenting alternative molecular explanations/mechanisms, the study is interesting but fails to &quot;challenge&quot; previous excellent studies as the authors claim at the end of ms, and confuse readers in the field. The authors should carefully discuss several possible interpretations.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, it seems that release time course (ten-ninety% rise time) gets gradually slower as deletion toward N terminal proceeds. This suggests that interaction between C-terminal and active zone proteins is indeed required for fast transmitter release (I do not know understand why statistically insignificant). Please carefully deal with this issue.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>At first I thought the authors were just doing some solid, but perhaps not exciting structure-function on Cav2.1, which would be useful as not enough has been done on this front (having a 7KB cDNA is part of the reason). But, I recognize that these experiments are very challenging (in vivo rescue using a virus encoding a massive cDNA, followed by very high quality e-phys and EM). In the end, this study turned out to be much more than I had expected: it is a much needed, clear, lucid, analysis of the C-terminal region of Cav2.1, and the findings are surprising and novel. Indeed, the results indicate that much of the dogma concerning the roles played by previously reported interaction motifs is likely to be incorrect. The authors then zero-in an a novel region that is important for function. Residues 2042–2061 play a role in vesicle docking (from nice EM experiments) and in determining the size of the fast and total releasable pools of SVs. This suggest interactions that have yet to be discovered, and is a major step in our molecular understanding of how these channels mediate excitation-secretion coupling. Technically, this work looks very sound.</p><p>1) I am not clear on is the issue of how this region regulates fast release independent of abundance. The authors are asking whether 'docking' motifs for SVs and other molecular players help recruit/stabilize VGCCs in the active zone. Option one is that they do – and if so, removing those interactions should also lower the number of VGCCs in the active zone/pre-synapse that responding to depolarization. Option two is that some other element localizes VGCCs to the pre-synapse and that other element is independent of the motifs driving interactions (direct or indirect) between VGCCs and SVs. The authors found that the raw pre-synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents from step depolarizations were the same for FL (they call it FT) and their truncation mutants – in subsection “Active zone protein binding sites in the CaV2.1 α1 subunit C-terminus are dispensable for CaV2.1 abundance in the presynaptic terminal” – so they conclude that the truncations did not effect pre-synaptic localization of CaV 2.1 (the Calyx had roughly the same # of VGCCs that responded to a depolarizing step to generate the same current amplitude). Of course, one caveat is that they cannot say that CaV 2.1 localization is not disrupted at the level of individual active zones – it could be possible to disrupt the localization/clustering/number of VGCCs in an active zone without effecting the overall # of VGCCs in the entire terminal (their functional measurement). I don't think they labelled CaV 2.1 in their EM images which is the experiment needed to really test this issue (and this could occur alongside or independent to the changes to SV docking that they did report). This issue should all clarified via rewriting parts of the text, and the caveat I raise above must be addressed.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Data presented support the conclusion that amino acids 2042–2061 in mouse CaV2.1 appear necessary to support normal vesicle release from calyx of Held terminals. This region has not been previously identified and, as noted by the authors, the findings should stimulate additional research to define the role of this domain more precisely. The experiments are indeed a technical tour de force. Other claims are less well supported (points 2 and 3 below) and the interpretations need to be scaled based on data presented.</p><p>1) Coupling is defined by the authors as the &quot;physical distance of SVs and voltage-gated calcium channels at the presynaptic terminal&quot; (Introduction) although this is not measured in the presented studies. It would help if the authors defined this term more explicitly. The presynaptic CaV current measured by whole cell recording is used as a proxy for the abundance of CaV channels at the active zone. Is there evidence that this is valid? Could domain 2042–2061 influence clustering of CaV2.1 channels at active zones without affecting total current?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and associated supplement.

By contrast, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the CaV2.1 current in presynaptic terminals is closer to eighty% of the total CaV current. Why the difference in the relative size of the CaV2.1 current between figures? Is it possible that the CKO is incomplete in experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>?

Specifically, the experiments could change how we think about the molecular function of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the synaptic vesicle release pathway in that the authors have defined a new region in CaV2.1 that appears to support vesicle release. However, there were concerns about how the new findings should be interpreted in molecular terms compared to prior work. It is very important that this be handled properly in the revision to provide honest assessment, but not overinterpretation, of the current work. In principle, rewriting/clarification should be sufficient to address the reviewers' concerns detailed below. To the extent that the authors think their work overturns dogma in the field, it is fair to state it, while acknowledging the limits of the experiments in this manuscript. Please attend to the issue with supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for their comments and criticisms. As outlined in our cover letter, <italic>i</italic>) We added new text to clarify how CaV2.1 localization in the presynaptic membrane could be distinct from CaV2.1 clustering in the individual active zone. <italic>ii)</italic> We added a new paragraph explaining how motifs that control voltage gated calcium channel to synaptic vesicle coupling may differ between synapses and developmental state of synapses in their respective neuronal circuit. <italic>iii)</italic> We modified text to provide a more nuanced assessment of the data rather than lead to over interpretation while acknowledging the limitations of our experiments. <italic>iv</italic>) We fixed supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">figure 3 and <italic>v</italic></xref>) We added absolute p values.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p> <italic>The authors have demonstrated that deletion of C-terminal region (2061–2368) of Cav2.1 channels, which interacts with active zone proteins (Rim, RBP and so on), did not impair fast transmitter release. Further deletion (2015–2060) was required to impair the coupling between Ca channels and transmitter release. In parallel, the EM analysis has shown that the number of docked vesicles was reduced. The study is interesting and may provide the evidence that single protein-protein interaction may be insufficient to explain coupling between Ca channels and readily-releasable synaptic vesicles (but see below). Also, the study is technically demanding, because they have combined paired pre- and postsynaptic recordings at the calyx of Held synapse and virus transfection in the KO mice background.</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The authors provided no explanation about how deletion of new region in the C -terminal (2015–2060) yields loss of releasable synaptic vesicles. This region may bind to known or unknown active zone proteins to insert Ca channels in the proper place at the active zones, or else the Ca channel structure is disrupted. Without presenting alternative molecular explanations/mechanisms, the study is interesting but fails to &quot;challenge&quot; previous excellent studies as the authors claim at the end of ms, and confuse readers in the field. The authors should carefully discuss several possible interpretations.</italic> </p><p>While there have been many excellent studies with genetic knock outs and biochemical data, many of these results presented in these studies are in conflict with one another. In some cases, some of these previous excellent previous studies conflict with one another are from the same group(s) as we have pointed out in our Introduction section. Therefore, we respectfully disagree that our data and results will confuse readers in the field and instead may help clarify disparate results from many different studies. Conversely, we understand the limitations of our study. Thus, we rewrote and added more text to our Discussion to present alternative molecular mechanisms for both Cav2.1 abundance and coupling that fit within the scope of a research manuscript and not a review of the field. In addition, we have toned down the conclusions as to avoid over interpretation of our results.</p><p> <italic>2) In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, it seems that release time course (ten-ninety% rise time) gets gradually slower as deletion toward N terminal proceeds. This suggests that interaction between C-terminal and active zone proteins is indeed required for fast transmitter release (I do not know understand why statistically insignificant). Please carefully deal with this issue.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to this point. Due to the multiple groups that we were comparing, we carried out an ANOVA one way test with a post hoc Dunnet’s test to compare multiple groups rather than a t-test. By carrying out the ANOVA one way test with post hoc Dunnet’s test we avoid Type I errors by carrying out multiple comparisons using a t-test. As the reviewer points out we do see a slight slowing of the rise times,~20-30%, which was similar for the Δ2365, Δ 2213, Δ 2061 mutants, while we severe slowing of the rise times with the Δ 2042 and Δ 2016 mutants compared to FT and uninjected CACNA1A flox animals. However due to the limitations of our data sample size, also brought up by reviewer#3, we don’t have the statistical power to draw a definitive conclusion that direct interactions between the regions between 2061-2368 do indeed play a role. As we pointed out in our Discussion, EPSC and SV release kinetics at the calyx of Held using step depolarizations in the RIM1/2 (Han et al. 2011) were significantly slowed down ~ 300% while in RBP knock out animals (Acuna et al. 2015) there was a slowing of~ 200% in tau fast. We would also like to point out that (Acuna et al. 2015) reported no change in AP evoked release rise times in the RBP KO background. To avoid over interpretation we have now modified our statements in the conclusions of our data in the Discussion to take into account.</p><p>We have added text in subsection”CaV2.1 controls coupling to SVs, RRP and total releasable pool size.”</p><p>“Prior studies using step depolarizations at the prehearing calyx have shown that loss of RIM and RBPs resulted in a 2-3 fold slowdown in release kinetics respectively and indicating that these proteins are involved in pathways that regulate the RRP size, coupling (Acuna et al., 2015; Han et al., 2011). In contrast, we did not see any dramatic slowdown in release or changes in RRP size that mimicked these phenotypes previously seen with RIM or RBP KO animals when these direct binding motifs in the CaV2.1 α1 subunit were deleted. Although we observed a slight slowing of the 10-90 rise times, ~20-30%, which was similar for the Δ2365-2368, Δ2213-2368, Δ2061-2368 mutants, however this was not statistically significant.. We did not directly measure AP-evoked release in this study, but it has been previously demonstrated that a CaV2.1 splice variants lacking RIM or RBP binding sites rescued AP-evoked release (Cao and Tsien, 2010). Finally, it has been demonstrated in PC12 cells that CaVβ interactions with RIM1/2 are critical for anchoring SVs to CaV2 calcium channels to control coupling (Uriu et al., 2010). Thus, our results strongly support that proposed individual direct interactions in between the CaV2.1 α1 subunit with RIM1/2 (Han et al., 2011; Kaeser et al., 2011) or RBP proteins (Acuna et al., 2015; Hibino et al., 2002) at most play a minor role in regulating RRP size and coupling.”</p><p>Also in subsection “CaV2.1 controls coupling to SVs, RRP and total releasable pool size.<bold>”</bold> we have removed the claim “are not essential” to now state “play at most a minor role”.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p> <italic>At first I thought the authors were just doing some solid, but perhaps not exciting structure-function on Cav2.1, which would be useful as not enough has been done on this front (having a 7KB cDNA is part of the reason). But, I recognize that these experiments are very challenging (in vivo rescue using a virus encoding a massive cDNA, followed by very high quality e-phys and EM). In the end, this study turned out to be much more than I had expected: it is a much needed, clear, lucid, analysis of the C-terminal region of Cav2.1, and the findings are surprising and novel. Indeed, the results indicate that much of the dogma concerning the roles played by previously reported interaction motifs is likely to be incorrect. The authors then zero-in an a novel region that is important for function. Residues 2042–2061 play a role in vesicle docking (from nice EM experiments) and in determining the size of the fast and total releasable pools of SVs. This suggest interactions that have yet to be discovered, and is a major step in our molecular understanding of how these channels mediate excitation-secretion coupling. Technically, this work looks very sound.</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) I am not clear on is the issue of how this region regulates fast release independent of abundance. The authors are asking whether 'docking' motifs for SVs and other molecular players help recruit/stabilize VGCCs in the active zone. Option one is that they do – and if so, removing those interactions should also lower the number of VGCCs in the active zone/pre-synapse that responding to depolarization. Option two is that some other element localizes VGCCs to the pre-synapse and that other element is independent of the motifs driving interactions (direct or indirect) between VGCCs and SVs. The authors found that the raw pre-synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents from step depolarizations were the same for FL (they call it FT) and their truncation mutants in subsection “Active zone protein binding sites in the CaV2.1 α1 subunit C-terminus are dispensable for CaV2.1 abundance in the presynaptic terminal” – so they conclude that the truncations did not effect pre-synaptic localization of CaV 2.1 (the Calyx had roughly the same # of VGCCs that responded to a depolarizing step to generate the same current amplitude). Of course, one caveat is that they cannot say that CaV 2.1 localization is not disrupted at the level of individual active zones – it could be possible to disrupt the localization/clustering/number of VGCCs in an active zone without effecting the overall # of VGCCs in the entire terminal (their functional measurement). I don't think they labelled CaV 2.1 in their EM images which is the experiment needed to really test this issue (and this could occur alongside or independent to the changes to SV docking that they did report). This issue should all clarified via rewriting parts of the text, and the caveat I raise above must be addressed.</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent point and we are in agreement as we did not label Calcium channels in the EM. We have now added a new paragraph in subsection “CaV2.1 localization to the presynaptic membrane<bold>”</bold></p><p>“CaV2.1 channels are not randomly distributed in the presynaptic membrane but cluster within active zones (Holderith et al., 2012; Nakamura et al., 2015). Since the calyx of Held is a large presynaptic terminal that contains many active zones, the conclusions with our presynaptic recordings is limited to CaV2.1 localization to the presynaptic terminal. Thus, we cannot rule out that the C-terminal domains contained within amino acids 2016-2368l which are not essential for localization to the presynaptic membrane, are critical for CaV2.1 clustering/organization within individual AZs. To determine if the mechanisms that control CaV2.1 clustering and presynaptic membrane localization are independently regulated, morphological studies will need to be carried out.”</p><p>We have also added a clarification in subsection “CaV2.1 controls coupling to SVs, RRP and total releasable pool size.<bold>”</bold></p><p>“….and cannot cluster Cav2.1 channels in the AZ. In both cases, SV docking would rely on Cav2.1 clustering through another protein to promote SV docking.”</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p> <italic>Data presented support the conclusion that amino acids 2042–2061 in mouse CaV2.1 appear necessary to support normal vesicle release from calyx of Held terminals. This region has not been previously identified and, as noted by the authors, the findings should stimulate additional research to define the role of this domain more precisely. The experiments are indeed a technical tour de force. Other claims are less well supported (points 2 and 3 below) and the interpretations need to be scaled based on data presented.</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) Coupling is defined by the authors as the &quot;physical distance of SVs and voltage-gated calcium channels at the presynaptic terminal&quot; (Introduction) although this is not measured in the presented studies. It would help if the authors defined this term more explicitly. The presynaptic CaV current measured by whole cell recording is used as a proxy for the abundance of CaV channels at the active zone. Is there evidence that this is valid? Could domain 2042–2061 influence clustering of CaV2.1 channels at active zones without affecting total current?</italic> </p><p>We have added a new paragraph in subsection”CaV2.1 controls coupling to SVs, RRP and total releasable pool size.” that explicitly defines coupling states and their impact on release modes. We have also added statements in this paragraph how the intrinsic motifs that support coupling may change at different synapses or at different developmental states.</p><p>“Despite containing Cav2.1, some presynaptic terminals transition from microdomain to nanodomain during maturation of neuronal circuits that encode temporal fidelity at high firing rates (Baur et al., 2015; Fedchyshyn and Wang, 2005). Therefore these release states are not specific to individual Cav2 subytpes, but instead the intrinsic motifs within the Cav2.1 α1 subunit are differentially utilized based on the developmental state. Our results presented here focused solely on the regulation of fast release at the prehearing calyx P9-11 which utilizes microdomain release mode (Borst and Sakmann, 1996; Fedchyshyn and Wang, 2005). Since the calyx transitions from microdomain to nanodomain release after the onset of hearing it is highly possible that intrinsic motifs in the Cav2.1 a1 subunit dispensable for microdomain release are necessary to support domain release. Finally, since proteome composition at the active zone may vary in different various presynaptic terminals, different Cav2.1 motifs may or may not be essential to support coupling.”</p><p>We explicitly defined coupling states in a new statement in the Introduction</p><p>“Differences in coupling distances between Cav2 VGCCs subtypes underpin the differences in Cav2 VGCC subtype effectiveness in eliciting AP evoked release and define the SV release mode in response to APs. (Eggermann et al., 2012). They are: nanodomain, a few tightly coupled VGCCs (&lt;30 nm), and microdomain, many loosely coupled VGCCs (~100nm) trigger SV release (Baur et al., 2015; Eggermann et al., 2012; Fedchyshyn and Wang, 2005)”</p><p>The presynaptic CaV current measured by whole cell recording is used as a proxy for the abundance of CaV channels at the active zone.

We did not block Cav2.2 or Cav2.3 currents which are present in prehearing calyces (Doughty et al., 1998; Iwasaki and Takahashi, 1998). Therefore, the presence of these currents could obscure possible changes in Cav2.1 current with our mutants. In addition we did not test for these regions role in the regulation of calcium dependent activation or facilitation. Thus, depending on the synapse and its developmental state, it is possible that these regions are critical for modulation of CaV2.1 function in response to high frequency stimulation.”</p><p><italic>3) The authors conclude that CaV2.1 constructs with deletions between 2365 and 2061 have no impact on Ca current density of vesicle release.
