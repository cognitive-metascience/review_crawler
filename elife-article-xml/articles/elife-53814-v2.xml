Herein, we demonstrate a key role for related factor FOXC1, in addition to FOXC2, in regulating cytoskeletal activity in lymphatic valves. FOXC1 is induced by laminar, but not oscillatory, shear and inducible, endothelial-specific deletion impaired postnatal lymphatic valve maturation in mice. However, deletion of <italic>Foxc2</italic> induced valve degeneration, which is exacerbated in <italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic> mutants. <italic>FOXC1</italic> knockdown (KD) in human lymphatic endothelial cells increased focal adhesions and actin stress fibers whereas <italic>FOXC2</italic>-KD increased focal adherens and disrupted cell junctions, mediated by increased ROCK activation. ROCK inhibition rescued cytoskeletal or junctional integrity changes induced by inactivation of FOXC1 and FOXC2 <italic>invitro</italic> and <italic>vivo</italic> respectively, but only ameliorated valve degeneration in <italic>Foxc2</italic> mutants. These results identify both FOXC1 and FOXC2 as mediators of mechanotransduction in the postnatal lymphatic vasculature and posit cytoskeletal signaling as a therapeutic target in lymphatic pathologies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lymphatic valve</kwd><kwd>mesentery</kwd><kwd>lymphatic endothelial cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL126920</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kume</surname><given-names>Tsutomu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL144129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kume</surname><given-names>Tsutomu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32HL094293</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Norden</surname><given-names>Pieter R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and molecular analyses show that FOXC1 and FOXC2 play a role in controlling lymphatic valve maintenance as key mediators of mechanotransduction to control cytoskeletal organization and RhoA/ROCK signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The lymphatic vasculature has a critical role in maintaining tissue homeostasis by returning interstitial fluid to the venous circulation, absorbing lipids from the digestive tract, and providing a network for immune surveillance and response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Alitalo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Norden and Kume, 2020</xref>). Mutations identified in genes involved in the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 signaling pathway are commonly associated with primary lymphedema and other lymphatic malformations, which include mutations in critical transcription factors such as GATA2 and FOXC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brouillard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ostergaard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kazenwadel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kazenwadel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Finegold et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dagenais et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">van Steensel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fauret et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Witte et al., 2009</xref>). During murine embryonic development at E15.5, the primitive lymphatic vascular plexus remodels and is reorganized into capillaries, pre-collectors and collecting vessels characterized by differential protein expression patterns, cell-cell junctions, and mural cell recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schulte-Merker et al., 2011</xref>). Coinciding with the remodeling of this plexus is the formation of intraluminal, bi-leaflet valves in the collecting vessels that function to prevent lymph backflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bazigou and Makinen, 2013</xref>). Critical to lymphatic valve formation, FOXC2 and GATA2 are upregulated in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in response to oscillatory shear stress (OSS) forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kazenwadel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sabine et al., 2012</xref>). In valve forming cells that express high levels of the master lymphatic regulator PROX1, FOXC2 cooperates with PROX1 to control intraluminal invagination of LECs and reorganization into valve forming leaflets that form mature structures by postnatal day (P)1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kazenwadel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>FOXC1 and FOXC2 are closely related members of the forkhead box (FOX) transcription factor family with nearly identical DNA binding domains, similar expression patterns in mesenchymal tissues during development, and essential roles in cardiovascular developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kume et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Seo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seo and Kume, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kume, 2009</xref>). Mutations in human <italic>FOXC1</italic> have primarily been dominantly associated with eye anterior segment defects, cerebellar malformation, and cerebral small vessel disease. In contrast, mutations in <italic>FOXC2</italic> have been dominantly associated with lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome characterized by failure of lymph drainage in limbs, venous valve failure, and the growth of an extra set of eyelashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tümer and Bach-Holm, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Micheal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldinger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">French et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Traboulsi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tavian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mellor et al., 2007</xref>). Work from our group has demonstrated that during lymphatic collecting vessel maturation and valve formation, FOXC2 regulates connexin 37 expression and activation of calcineurin/NFAT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Petrova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Norrmén et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sabine et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, FOXC2 was shown to be crucial for lymphatic valve maintenance by regulating LEC junctional integrity and cellular quiescence under reversing flow conditions via restriction of TAZ-mediated proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sabine et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, our group also demonstrated that FOXC1 and FOXC2 negatively regulate increased Ras/ERK signaling during embryonic lymphangiogenesis to suppress formation of hyperplastic lymphatic vessels, which are also observed in individuals with <italic>FOXC2</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fatima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brice et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mansour et al., 1993</xref>). However, while a critical role for FOXC2 has been established during postnatal valve formation and maturation, the role of FOXC1, and potentially cooperative role of both transcription factors, is poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we report an essential role for FOXC1 during lymphatic valve maturation and maintenance. Detailed comparison of FOXC1 and FOXC2 expression and roles in lymphatic valves suggests some overlap with a broader importance for FOXC2, but more subtle, key contribution for FOXC1. In mice, endothelial cell (EC)-specific deletion of <italic>Foxc1</italic> postnatally impairs valve maturation, while <italic>Foxc2</italic> deletion impairs maturation and induces valve degeneration, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sabine et al., 2015</xref>). However, combined deletion of <italic>Foxc1</italic> and <italic>Foxc2</italic> worsens the phenotype induced by single deletion of <italic>Foxc2</italic>. In mature lymphatic valves FOXC1 is expressed at high levels in a subset of LECs that also express high levels of FOXC2 at the rim of valve leaflets. This specific pattern of FOXC1 expression is likely due to its upregulation, like FOXC2, by unidirectional shear, while only FOXC2 is upregulated by OSS. <italic>In vitro</italic> loss of FOXC1 or FOXC2 induced hyper-activation of contractile stress fibers in LECs; however, a striking difference is their association with focal adhesions upon <italic>FOXC1</italic> knockdown <italic>vs</italic> focal adherens junctions upon <italic>FOXC2</italic> knockdown. This phenotype is rescued by inhibition of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) <italic>in vitro</italic>, which also improves LEC barrier integrity <italic>in vivo</italic>, while valve degeneration is partially rescued in only <italic>Foxc2</italic> mutants. Finally, via generation of transgenic mice that express <italic>Foxc2</italic> within the <italic>Foxc1</italic> locus, we show <italic>Foxc2</italic> is capable of functionally substituting for <italic>Foxc1</italic> in lymphatic development and maturation. Together, our data show a complementary role for FOXC1 in addition to FOXC2 as key mediators of mechanotransduction in the postnatal lymphatic valves and implicate new mechanistic targets for therapeutics in the treatment of lymphatic-associated diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FOXC1 and FOXC2 are required for postnatal lymphatic valve maturation and maintenance</title><p>Our group previously reported that FOXC1 and FOXC2 expression co-localizes with PROX1 in lymphatic valve-forming cells at E17 and later at P3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fatima et al., 2016</xref>). However, the expression pattern of FOXC1 in the mesenteric lymphatic collecting vessels and valves in adult mice remains unknown. We first characterized the expression pattern of FOXC1 and FOXC2 in mature valves of 4 week old adult mice to delineate possible differential or cooperative roles during valve maturation and maintenance. Immunostaining of mesentery tissue with FOXC1, FOXC2, and VEGFR3 antibodies identified colocalization of FOXC1 and FOXC2 within the nuclei of intraluminal valve leaflets while FOXC2 expression was more highly enriched in the valve sinuses and surrounding lymphangion compared to FOXC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

However, the temporal regulatory role of FOXC1 transcriptional activity during valve development, maturation, and maintenance is not well understood. To investigate FOXC1 function in the early postnatal lymphatic vasculature and valve regions, we crossed conditional null <italic>Foxc1<sup>fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sasman et al., 2012</xref>) with <italic>Chd5-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sörensen et al., 2009</xref>) to generate tamoxifen-inducible, EC-specific <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant (EC-<italic>Foxc1</italic>-KO) mice. Tamoxifen was administered from P1-P5 to induce <italic>Cre-</italic>mediated recombination and we confirmed deletion of <italic>Foxc1</italic> via qPCR analysis of isolated CD31-positive cells from hearts of P6 individuals and by immunostaining of the mesenteric lymphatic vasculature with antibodies against FOXC1, FOXC2, and VEGFR-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a,d,e</xref>). We next investigated whether lymphatic valve maturation and maintenance was affected in collecting vessels after induction of Cre-mediated recombination postnatally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–f,u,v</xref>). Quantification of regions with PROX1-high expression within lymphatic collecting vessels, indicative of valves, showed there was not a significant difference in total valve number in mice with inactivated <italic>Foxc1</italic> compared to littermate controls at P6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2u</xref>). As VE-Cadherin, coded by the <italic>Cdh5</italic> gene, is also expressed in the blood vasculature, we immunostained the mesenteric vasculature with CD31 antibody and found no obvious changes associated with loss of <italic>Foxc1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). Using EC-specific <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant mice generated from the <italic>Tek</italic>-Cre strain, our group previously reported that the proportion of lymphatic valves that had formed mature, v-shaped or semilunar bi-leaflet structures at P7 was significantly reduced in EC-specific <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant mice compared to littermate controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fatima et al., 2016</xref>). To investigate whether this result was recapitulated using the inducible <italic>Cdh5-Cre</italic> strain, we also performed immunostaining of mesentery tissue for expression of a marker of valve maturation, α9-integrin, which is a receptor that interacts with its extracellular matrix (ECM) protein ligand fibronectin-EIIIA to regulate the formation of the ECM core of valve leaflets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bazigou et al., 2009</xref>) in addition to PROX1/CD31 immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c – f</xref>). Quantification of the proportion of lymphatic valves that had formed mature, v-shaped or semilunar bi-leaflet structures showed a significant reduction in EC-<italic>Foxc1</italic>-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2v</xref>), thus recapitulating our previously reported results using the <italic>Tek-Cre</italic> strain. To verify that the phenotype we observed was not mediated by inactivation of <italic>Foxc1</italic> within the blood vasculature, we next crossed conditional null <italic>Foxc1<sup>fl</sup></italic> mice with <italic>Prox1-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Srinivasan et al., 2007</xref>) to generate inducible LEC-specific <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant (LEC-<italic>Foxc1</italic>-KO) mice and administered tamoxifen postnatally. PROX1 immunostaining showed no significant differences in total valve number of LEC-<italic>Foxc1</italic>-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a,b,e</xref>). Additionally, immunostaining of PROX1 and FOXC1 showed enrichment of FOXC1 expression in intraluminal valve leaflets of littermate control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>) whereas mature lymphatic valves were still observed in LEC-<italic>Foxc1</italic>-KO mice with reduced FOXC1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2d</xref>). However, quantification of mature lymphatic valve structures demonstrated that LEC-<italic>Foxc1</italic>-KO mice had significantly less mature valves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2f</xref>), recapitulating the phenotype observed utilizing the <italic>Cdh5-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). While similar phenotypes were observed between both <italic>Cdh5-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic>- and <italic>Tek-Cre- Foxc1</italic> mutants, these data demonstrate that FOXC1 function is maintained during postnatal lymphatic valve maturation and maintenance as <italic>Tek-Cre</italic> is expressed embryonically as early as E7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Braren et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Compound endothelial-specific <italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic> mutants present severe chylous ascites and are nearly absent of PROX1-high expressing lymphatic valves.</title><p>(<bold>a, b, g, h, m, n</bold>) Representative images of PROX1 and CD31 immunostained lymphatic collecting vessels in P6 littermate control (<bold>a, g, m</bold>) and EC-<italic>Foxc1</italic>-KO (<bold>b</bold>), EC-<italic>Foxc2</italic>-KO (<bold>h</bold>), and EC-<italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic>-DKO (<bold>n</bold>) individuals.

To compare the roles of FOXC1 and FOXC2 in our model, we crossed <italic>Cdh5-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic> mice with conditional null <italic>Foxc2<sup>fl</sup></italic> mice to generate EC-specific <italic>Foxc2</italic> mutant (EC-<italic>Foxc2</italic>-KO) mice and administered tamoxifen from P1-P5 with inactivation confirmed by qPCR in ECs isolated from P6 hearts and by immunostaining of the mesenteric lymphatic vasculature with antibodies against FOXC1, FOXC2, and VEGFR-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b,f,g</xref>). Interestingly, while FOXC2 was strongly reduced in collecting vessels of EC-<italic>Foxc2</italic>-KO mice, we also observed a reduction in FOXC1 expression in collecting vessels, and particularly valve regions, compared to littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f and g</xref>). Although chylous effusion was occasionally observed in mutant individuals at P6 (4/30; 13%), inactivation of <italic>Foxc2</italic> beginning at P1 significantly reduced the total number of valves in mesenteric lymphatic collecting vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g – l, q, r, w, x</xref>). However, no obvious changes were observed in the mesenteric blood vasculature of <italic>Foxc2</italic> mutants by CD31 immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g,h</xref>). Quantitative analysis also determined that the percentage of the total lymphatic valves with mature, intraluminal bi-leaflet structures was significantly reduced with inactivation of <italic>Foxc2</italic> and many valve regions were characterized by collecting vessel constriction, indicative of regression of these structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i – l, x</xref>). Several of these valve regions were characterized by intraluminal leaflets shortened in length compared to littermate controls, yet a majority of valve regions were characterized by near complete degeneration of intraluminal valves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i – l</xref>), similar to our group’s observations previously reported in LEC-<italic>Foxc2</italic>-KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sabine et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, expression of α9−integrin was reduced in EC-<italic>Foxc2</italic>-KO mice compared to littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j – l</xref>), indicating that the phenotype observed in EC-<italic>Foxc2</italic>-KO mice is also associated with impaired valve maturation processes. Thus, our results using a different endothelial-specific <italic>Cre</italic> strain further support the previously reported role for FOXC2 in postnatal lymphatic vascular function and highlight a more prominent role than FOXC1 in valve maintenance.</p><p>Our group previously reported overlapping expression patterns of <italic>Foxc1</italic> and <italic>Foxc2</italic> in the embryonic murine cardiovascular system and key, cooperative functional roles during embryonic lymphangiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kume et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Winnier et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kume et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Seo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fatima et al., 2016</xref>). To assess the requirement and potential cooperative role of both transcription factors in postnatal lymphatic vascular function, we crossed conditional null <italic>Foxc1<sup>fl</sup>; Foxc2<sup>fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sasman et al., 2012</xref>) with <italic>Cdh5-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic> mice to generate EC-specific <italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic> mutant (EC-<italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic>-DKO) mice and administered tamoxifen from P1 to P5 with inactivation in compound mutant individuals verified by qPCR and immunostaining of the mesenteric lymphatic vasculature with antibodies against FOXC1, FOXC2, and VEGFR-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c,h,i</xref>). At P6, a majority of compound EC-<italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic> mutant mice (48/78, 61.5%) developed severe chylous ascites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2o,p</xref>) and chylothorax (data not shown). PROX1 immunostaining showed that PROX1-high expressing valve regions were nearly absent in compound mutants whereas CD31 immunostaining determined that the blood vasculature appeared normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2m,n,y</xref>). Compared to littermate controls, lymphatic collecting vessel hierarchy of EC-<italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic>-DKO mutants was markedly abnormal, characterized by high numbers of interconnecting and inter-looping branches resembling a primitive lymphatic vascular plexus prior to valve differentiation, maturation, and remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2s,t</xref>). Furthermore, direct comparison of lymphatic collecting vessel hierarchy of EC-<italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic>-DKO mice with EC-<italic>Foxc2</italic>-KO mice shows that combined deletion of <italic>Foxc1</italic> and <italic>Foxc2</italic> results in a synergistic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2q–t</xref>). Our group previously reported that ectopic sprouting from degenerating valves was observed in LEC-<italic>Foxc2</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sabine et al., 2015</xref>), thus the markedly abnormal branching pattern observed in EC-<italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic>-DKO mice is likely a result of accelerated valve regression and ectopic sprouting from these regions to compensate drainage from areas of perturbed flow due to the near complete regression of valves. To verify that <italic>Foxc1</italic> and <italic>Foxc2</italic> inactivation did not simply reduce PROX1 expression in valve regions, we performed additional immunostaining of mesentery tissue for α9-integrin expression. Modest α9-integrin expression was detected in regressing valve leaflets of EC-specific <italic>Foxc2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a,b,e,f</xref>), however expression was absent in collecting vessel branches of EC-<italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic>-KO mutant where valves are typically present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3c,d,g,h</xref>). Collectively, we demonstrate that both FOXC1 and FOXC2 are required for postnatal lymphatic vascular function. FOXC2 has a predominant role in maintaining LEC valve identity, however FOXC1 functions in a cooperative manner with FOXC2 to refine valve maturation processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cell elongation and junctional integrity is markedly impaired in compound EC-specific <italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic> mutants and is accompanied by increased apoptosis throughout lymphatic collecting vessels</title><p>Collecting vessels of LEC-specific <italic>Foxc2</italic> mutants were previously characterized by the presence of rounded LECs with discontinuous, ‘zig-zag’ like junctions as opposed to elongated cells with linear, ‘zipper-like’ junctions aligned with flow.

Linearized LEC junctions in collecting vessels help to minimize loss of lymph during its transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baluk et al., 2007</xref>) and disruption of LEC barrier integrity in LEC-<italic>Foxc2</italic>-KO mice contributed to leakage of lymph and the development of chylous ascites and chylothorax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sabine et al., 2015</xref>). To first determine how inactivation of both <italic>Foxc1</italic> and <italic>Foxc2</italic> affects collecting vessel LEC junctional integrity, we immunostained mesenteric lymphatic vessels for PROX1 and VE-Cadherin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4a–h</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>). As previously reported, LECs in wild-type mice were elongated, organized and aligned with the direction of flow, and had continuous cell-cell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4a,c,e,g</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>) whereas EC-specific inactivation of <italic>Foxc2</italic> resulted in a more rounded shape with disrupted endothelial junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4b,f</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). However, inactivation of both <italic>Foxc1</italic> and <italic>Foxc2</italic> severely impaired LEC organization as cells appeared more spherical in shape and were poorly elongated in alignment with flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4d,h</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>).

To investigate how different shear stress stimuli affect FOXC1 and FOXC2 expression in LECs, we examined cells cultured under static, laminar, or oscillatory flow conditions. As previously observed, OSS strongly increased the expression of FOXC2 and the formation of overlapping cell-cell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sabine et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sabine et al., 2015</xref>). However, FOXC1 expression was slightly reduced compared to cells cultured under static conditions. In contrast, LSS upregulated both FOXC1 and FOXC2 expression as cells became aligned with unidirectional laminar flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). No correlation was observed between FOXC1 and FOXC2 expression under different shear stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>).

While recent advances have identified key genes associated with the development of lymphedema, the underlying genetic causes contributing to a majority of cases remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mendola et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we identify a critical role for FOXC1 during postnatal lymphatic development to regulate cytoskeletal organization in the lymphatic vasculature via regulation of RhoA/ROCK activation and focal adhesion formation. Importantly, we found that high FOXC1 expression is limited to LECs located at the free-edge of the luminal side of valve leaflets, which are exposed to laminar pulsatile shear, as opposed to FOXC2, which is strongly expressed throughout the valve sinuses exposed to reciprocating shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sabine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sabine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zawieja, 2009</xref>).

This reduction in FOXC1 expression is likely a result of perturbed flow in EC-<italic>Foxc2</italic>-KO mutants due to the degeneration of lymphatic valves, but the maintained expression of FOXC2 in lymphatic valves of EC-<italic>Foxc1</italic>-KO mice may partly explain the differences in severity of the phenotypes observed in <italic>Foxc2</italic> mutants compared to <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutants. However, loss of both <italic>Foxc1</italic> and <italic>Foxc2 in vivo</italic> induces accelerated valve degeneration and vascular remodeling in lymphatic collecting vessels compared to loss of <italic>Foxc2</italic> alone, leading to a rapid onset of chylous effusion from collecting vessels. <italic>In vitro</italic>, both <italic>FOXC1</italic> and <italic>FOXC2</italic> knockdown in LECs resulted in increased actomyosin contractility, which was potentiated by shear stress. However, increased contractility was associated with increased focal adhesion number in <italic>FOXC1</italic>-KD LECs but increased focal adherens junctions in <italic>FOXC2-</italic>KD LECs.

Although both FOXC1 and FOXC2 share cooperative roles in regulating development of several organ systems, our evidence demonstrates that response to differing mechanical stimuli is key for the induction of FOXC1 or FOXC2 expression in LECs to control their separate functions. The response of LECs within collecting vessels to differing shear stress forces may explain the differences we observe between our <italic>in vitro</italic> results where knockdown of <italic>FOXC1</italic> strongly induces actomyosin hypercontractility and increased focal adhesion number, yet inactivation of <italic>Foxc1 in vivo</italic> only results in a modest phenotype and we observe that FOXC2 can functionally substitute for FOXC1.

In regard to the lymphatic vasculature, loss of <italic>Pecam1</italic> or <italic>Sdc4</italic> and LEC-specific deletion of <italic>Cdh5 in vivo</italic> resulted in impaired valve morphogenesis phenotypes and poor orientation and elongation of LECs with the direction of flow in mesentery collecting vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Recently, an <italic>in vitro</italic> study utilizing microfluidic chambers implicated the role of E-selectin, an adhesion molecule highly expressed in ECs, in LEC response to shear stress gradients and their ability to reorganize perpendicularly to the direction of flow and increase expression and nuclear localization of FOXC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Michalaki et al., 2020</xref>). However, E-selectin knockout mice were not reported to have lymphatic dysfunction <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Frenette and Wagner, 1997</xref>), suggesting a possible functional redundancy with other cell-surface proteins during lymphatic development. Whether these cell-surface proteins are responsible for the differences in FOXC1 and FOXC2 induction in response to LSS and OSS is not known and further investigation into how shear stress regulates differential expression of downstream FOXC1 and FOXC2 targets will be of critical importance for the focus of future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings identify a key role for FOXC1, in addition to FOXC2, in controlling postnatal lymphatic valve maturation and maintenance processes as key mediators of mechanotransduction to control cytoskeletal organization and RhoA/ROCK signaling activity in valve LECs. Our results not only advance the current understanding of molecular mechanisms contributing to valve morphogenesis in the lymphatic vasculature, but also identifies RhoA/ROCK as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of hereditary forms of lymphedema.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal models</title><p><italic>Foxc1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, <italic>Foxc2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, <italic>Foxc1<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Foxc2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, <italic>Cdh5-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic>, and <italic>Prox1-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic> mice were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sasman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sörensen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Srinivasan et al., 2007</xref>).

id="s4-9"><title>Quantification</title><p>To identify lymphatic valves, mesentery tissue was stained with PROX1 antibody and areas of high expression were quantified as mature (visible leaflets) or immature (no visible leaflets) on four lymphatic collecting vessels per individual. Total number of valves were determined and percent of mature valves was normalized to the total counted per individual. For assessment of apoptosis in lymphatic collecting vessels, mesentery tissue was immunostained with PROX1 and active caspase-3 antibody and the percentage of PROX1/caspase 3-positive LECs was quantified from 20X high-power fields generated from confocal z-stacks using Fiji software to determine the total number of LECs per field using thresholded PROX1 immunostaining. Quantification was completed from three biological replicates.</p><p>For <italic>in vitro</italic> quantifications, relative nuclear intensity levels were measured using Fiji software. Nuclei were considered as regions of interest from thresholded Hoechst staining pictures. FOXC1 or FOXC2 intensity was then measured in each nuclei using RawIntDen function. For quantification of F-actin and p-MLC2 area per cell, LECs were fist manually segmented and defined as individual regions of interest, then F-actin (or p-MLC2) staining was thresholded using similar parameters for all pictures and F-actin<sup>+</sup> (or p-MLC2<sup>+</sup>) area was measured per each region of interest. Quantification was completed from three independent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analysis for <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments was performed using GraphPad Prism v5 or v8. <italic>P</italic> values were obtained by performing a 2-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic> test or one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation of representative experiments from at least three biological replicates. For quantification of apoptosis in LECs of compound <italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic> mutant mice, the ROUT method with Q set to 1% was used to identify outliers in the data set that were then excluded from statistical analysis using student’s t-test. <italic>P</italic> values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

provides new insight into the mechanically regulated activation of, and distinct roles for, FOXC1 and FOXC2 in lymphatic vessel valve development. The identification of unique roles for these closely related transcription factors is intriguing and will pave the way to a deeper understanding of the transcriptional mechanisms regulating their distinct activities. The study also implicates FOXC1 as a gene that may potentially underlie primary lymphoedema.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Shear stimulation of FOXC1 and FOXC2 differentially regulates cytoskeletal activity during lymphatic valve maturation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Natasha L Harvey as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #2, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mark Kahn (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Here, Norden, Sabine and colleagues dissect the roles of transcription factors FOXC1 and FOXC2 in lymphatic vessel valve development, revealing that FOXC1 primarily controls focal adhesions in lymphatic endothelial cells, while FOXC2 primarily controls adherens junction integrity. The work builds on previous studies by the authors that have demonstrated (1) the importance of FOXC2 and shear stress for lymphatic vessel valve development and (Sabine et al., 2012, Sabine et al., 2015), (2) important roles for both FOXC1 and FOXC2 in embryonic lymphangiogenesis via regulation of RAS/ERK signalling (Fatima et al., 2016). Aspects of this current study overlap with some of the authors' prior work and this should be clearly articulated in the manuscript where relevant. Distinctions and extensions of the work should also be clearly articulated. There are key novel and interesting findings described in this manuscript that address important questions regarding the distinct mechanisms by which FOXC1 and FOXC2 activity are regulated, together with the mechanisms via which these transcription factors regulate cytoskeletal architecture.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The phenotype caused by early postnatal deletion of <italic>Foxc1</italic> seems modest, and is characterized by a larger proportion of immature valves in mesenteric lymphatic vessels. It thus becomes important to know how the authors define immature valves. It is not obvious why those shown in Figure 2E, F are defined as immature, and not representing valves that are imaged from a different (90°) angle compared to valves that show the typical v-shape. Staining of the valve leaflets would demonstrate this more clearly. The inclusion of staining for markers of valve maturation such as α5-laminin and/or α9-integrin would help to demonstrate this point. To more convincingly demonstrate that <italic>Foxc1</italic> modulates the <italic>Foxc2</italic> KO phenotype, side-by-side comparison of <italic>Foxc2</italic> single and <italic>Foxc1</italic>;<italic>Foxc2</italic> double mutants should be shown. Of note, deletion of <italic>Foxc2</italic> seems to be incomplete (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Considering that the authors show that <italic>Foxc2</italic> can compensate for <italic>Foxc1</italic> function, <italic>Foxc1</italic> deletion in combination with the incomplete <italic>Foxc2</italic> deletion may just decrease total Foxc signaling sufficiently but not necessarily indicate distinct functions of the two genes as proposed. The question is whether <italic>Foxc1</italic> deletion would affect the phenotype of <italic>Foxc2</italic> mutants if <italic>Foxc2</italic> is efficiently deleted. Why is <italic>Foxc1</italic> staining apparent on the cell membrane and present in the <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant in Figure 3—figure supplement 1?</p><p>2) The conclusion 'Cell elongation and junctional integrity is markedly impaired in compound EC- specific <italic>Foxc1</italic>; <italic>Foxc2</italic> mutants resulting in increased apoptosis in lymphatic collecting vessels' requires more supporting evidence. We see one image (Figure 3—figure supplement 3) aiming to support the claim that cell elongation and junctional integrity is impaired but it is not clear how representative this image is. It is surprising that such a high number of apoptotic cells is detected in control vessels, drawing into question the specificity of the caspase-3 staining, and whether the signal is indeed detected in the LECs. No evidence is provided for cell elongation defects leading to increased apoptosis.

Ultrastructural analyses could be informative here.</p><p>3) Inconsistent quality of staining between different experiments and even panels in the same figure (as if staining and imaging is done at different time points and not using littermate mice) make assessment of the phenotypes difficult, especially when a single high magnification image is provided as a supporting evidence. For example – Figure 3—figure supplement 2 VE-cadherin staining, Figure 2E-F CD31 staining. Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3H show low PROX1 levels overall in <italic>Foxc1</italic>;<italic>Foxc2</italic> double mutants. Figure 3—figure supplement 3D shows instead extremely high PROX1 levels, along with 'discontinuous junctions', making it difficult to judge if this is a representative image. The junctional phenotype presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 3D is indeed dramatic (although the junctions do not seem to be 'discontinuous', but instead appear to have higher VE-cadherin levels), but the phenotype is seemingly different in Figure 3—figure supplement 2D where the phenotype is not obvious at all. 'Discontinuous junctions' in the <italic>Foxc1</italic>;<italic>Foxc2</italic> double mutants should be demonstrated more convincingly.</p><p>4) The authors should provide further evidence to demonstrate how relevant the described in vivo phenotypes are to those described in vitro. If <italic>Foxc1</italic> and <italic>Foxc2</italic> have distinct functions in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, it is not clear why <italic>Foxc2</italic> is capable of functionally substituting for <italic>Foxc1</italic> in vivo.</p><p>5) Previous studies have demonstrated that FOXC2 is regulated by oscillatory shear forces in LECs, and that such forces likely play a key role in valve development. In Figure 4 the authors use in vitro flow studies to conclude that FOXC1 expression is regulated primarily by laminar shear while FOXC2 primarily by oscillatory shear. However, the endothelial cells shown in Figure 4A do not appear aligned with flow as would be expected for laminar shear and the authors fail to identify a clear mechanism that would account for such a distinct regulation. This theory appears to rely primarily on antibody detection of nuclear FOXC1 which is not as robustly detected as FOXC2. In vivo studies, especially Figure 10, suggest that these transcription factors are functionally redundant at the protein level as replacement of FOXC1 with FOXC2 does not impair valve maturation. Much of the data shown are carefully analyzed, but these findings and their connection to where FOXC1 is best detected in vivo in the valve tip seems like an over-reach. More specific mechanistic data identifying how such remarkable distinctions in shear regulation are achieved should be provided.</p><p>6) Figure 1—figure supplement 1: What is the level of FOXC2 protein present in LEC of EC-<italic>Foxc2</italic>-KO compared to mRNA? <italic>Foxc2</italic> mRNA appears to be reduced by approximately 50% compared to control EC <italic>Foxc2</italic> levels.

Were they the only genes involved in RhoA/ROCK signalling that were changed in expression?

It thus becomes important to know how the authors define immature valves. It is not obvious why those shown in Figure 2E, F are defined as immature, and not representing valves that are imaged from a different (90 degrees) angle compared to valves that show the typical v-shape. Staining of the valve leaflets would demonstrate this more clearly. The inclusion of staining for markers of valve maturation such as α5-laminin and/or α9-integrin would help to demonstrate this point. To more convincingly demonstrate that Foxc1 modulates the Foxc2 KO phenotype, side-by-side comparison of Foxc2 single and Foxc1;Foxc2 double mutants should be shown. Of note, deletion of Foxc2 seems to be incomplete (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Considering that the authors show that Foxc2 can compensate for Foxc1 function, Foxc1 deletion in combination with the incomplete Foxc2 deletion may just decrease total Foxc signaling sufficiently but not necessarily indicate distinct functions of the two genes as proposed. The question is whether Foxc1 deletion would affect the phenotype of Foxc2 mutants if Foxc2 is efficiently deleted. Why is Foxc1 staining apparent on the cell membrane and present in the Foxc1 mutant in Figure 3—figure supplement 1?</p></disp-quote><p>The authors thank the reviewers for this comment and careful assessment of our described phenotypes in our <italic>Foxc1</italic>, <italic>Foxc2</italic>, and compound <italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic> mutant mice. To address the first part of this comment, we have included new representative images of α9-integrin/VE-Cadherin immunostaining of lymphatic valve regions side-by-side with PROX1/CD31 immunostained lymphatic valves in Figure 2. Inset images of only the α9-integrin channel more clearly show the presence of mature, intraluminal bi-leaflet valve structures in Control and EC-<italic>Foxc1</italic>-KO mice as well as valve regions that are considered immature that are not characterized by a distinct intraluminal leaflet structure by α9-integrin immunostaining. In EC-<italic>Foxc2</italic>-KO mice, we have observed that overall, α9-integrin expression is reduced compared to littermate control mice. However, there are regions characterized by the presence of intraluminal leaflets, as depicted by PROX1, CD31, and VE-Cadherin immunostaining, that are shortened in length. We describe these observations in the subsection “FOXC1 and FOXC2 are required for postnatal lymphatic valve maturation and maintenance”.</p><p>To address the second part of this comment, we have also updated Figure 2 to include representative images showing side-by-side comparison of EC-<italic>Foxc2</italic>-KO mice and EC-<italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic>-DKO mice. Figure 2H and N depict representative images of a mesentery collecting vessel immunostained with PROX1/CD31 and Figure 2R and T depict 10X power images of collecting vessels immunostained with PROX1 to show the difference in phenotypes more clearly.</p><p>To address the third part of this comment, we performed immunostaining of FOXC1, FOXC2, and VEGFR-3 in mesentery collecting vessels of EC-<italic>Foxc1</italic>-KO, EC-<italic>Foxc2</italic>-KO, EC-<italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic>-DKO mice and respective littermate controls and included representative images in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1G, we show that FOXC2 expression is markedly reduced in EC-<italic>Foxc2</italic>-KO mice and FOXC1 expression is reduced compared to littermate controls, likely as a result of perturbed flow contributing to the reduced induction of FOXC1 expression. In contrast, Figure 2—figure supplement 1E shows strong reduction of FOXC1 expression but no discernible difference in FOXC2 expression. Thus, the maintenance of FOXC2 expression in EC-<italic>Foxc1</italic>-KO mice may in part explain the differences in phenotype severity observed in <italic>Foxc2</italic> mutant mice compared to <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant mice. We have revised our Discussion section (second paragraph) to note this important difference. The difference between our qPCR data, depicted in Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, and our immunostaining evidence is likely attributable to the fact that CD31-positive cells were isolated from cardiac tissue to use for qPCR analysis. It is likely that FOXC2 expression levels are different between lymphatic endothelium in mesentery collecting vessels and the cardiac vasculature. Thus, this may explain the differences in deletion efficiency. The repeated immunostaining of collecting vessels with FOXC1, FOXC2, and VEGFR-3 antibodies also now shows clear expression of FOXC1 in the nucleus of both lymphatic endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of arterioles. As shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, G, and I, there is no membrane signal detected. We suspect that there may be some cross-reactivity with our secondary antibodies used for the immunostaining combination of FOXC1 and VE-Cadherin, thus warranting our use of VEGFR-3 antibody to address this issue and verify the reduction of FOXC1 expression in the endothelium of collecting vessels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The conclusion 'Cell elongation and junctional integrity is markedly impaired in compound EC- specific Foxc1; Foxc2 mutants resulting in increased apoptosis in lymphatic collecting vessels' requires more supporting evidence. We see one image (Figure 3—figure supplement 3) aiming to support the claim that cell elongation and junctional integrity is impaired but it is not clear how representative this image is. It is surprising that such a high number of apoptotic cells is detected in control vessels, drawing into question the specificity of the caspase-3 staining, and whether the signal is indeed detected in the LECs. No evidence is provided for cell elongation defects leading to increased apoptosis. This statement should also be demonstrated: &quot;Of note, apoptotic bodies were more frequently observed at branched areas of the lymphatic collecting vessels potentially indicating areas of valve degeneration.&quot; The authors should expand on the cellular mechanisms underlying the presumed rupture of lymphatic vessels and accumulation of chylous ascites in EC-Foxc1;Foxc2-DKO pups. Ultrastructural analyses could be informative here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this helpful comment and careful critique of our data. We have revised our conclusion to more accurately state, ‘Cell elongation and junctional integrity is markedly impaired in compound EC-specific <italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic> mutants and is accompanied by increased apoptosis throughout lymphatic collecting vessels’ as the previous statement was not accurate. Our group previously reported that valves of LEC-<italic>Foxc2-</italic>KO mutant mice were characterized by increased apoptosis and apoptotic cells were often arranged in doublets with symmetrically organized PROX1-high apoptotic bodies, suggesting that apoptosis may occur in dividing cells. Additional evidence identified that half of the dying cells in LEC-<italic>Foxc2</italic>-KO mice were PROX1/Ki67-positive, demonstrating that valves of LEC-<italic>Foxc2</italic>-KO mice were characterized by abnormal activation of cell proliferation and increased cell death. This phenotype was associated with improper activation of TAZ signaling in the absence of FOXC2 (Sabine et al., 2015). We have included a summary of this finding in the subsection “Cell elongation and junctional integrity is markedly impaired in compound EC-specific <italic>Foxc1</italic>; <italic>Foxc2</italic> mutants and is accompanied by increased apoptosis throughout lymphatic collecting vessels”. We then sought to characterize junctional integrity and apoptosis in compound <italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic> mutant mice to assess if there was a synergistic effect of inactivation of both <italic>Foxc1</italic> and <italic>Foxc2</italic> in the lymphatic endothelium.</p><p>To further address this reviewer comment, we carefully re-evaluated our caspase-3 immunostaining and repeated analysis to characterize the percent of PROX1/cleaved caspase-3 positive lymphatic endothelial cells in 20X high-power field images. Figure 2—figure supplement 4I-K has been updated to include new representative images and quantitative analysis. In addition to representative images of maximum intensity projections of PROX1/cleaved caspase-3 immunostained collecting vessels, we also show panels of z-sections from selected regions in higher magnification where PROX1/cleaved caspase-3 positive cells were identified. We also now show images from two compound <italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic> mutant littermates that show apoptotic bodies are in closer proximity to branched regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Inconsistent quality of staining between different experiments and even panels in the same figure (as if staining and imaging is done at different time points and not using littermate mice) make assessment of the phenotypes difficult, especially when a single high magnification image is provided as a supporting evidence. For example – Figure 3—figure supplement 2 VE-cadherin staining, Figure 2E-F CD31 staining. Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3H show low PROX1 levels overall in Foxc1;Foxc2 double mutants. Figure 3—figure supplement 3D shows instead extremely high PROX1 levels, along with 'discontinuous junctions', making it difficult to judge if this is a representative image. The junctional phenotype presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 3D is indeed dramatic (although the junctions do not seem to be 'discontinuous', but instead appear to have higher VE-cadherin levels), but the phenotype is seemingly different in Figure 3—figure supplement 2D where the phenotype is not obvious at all. 'Discontinuous junctions' in the Foxc1;Foxc2 double mutants should be demonstrated more convincingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this helpful comment and careful critique of our representative images. To address the first part of the reviewer comment, we have repeated immunostaining of tissues and re-evaluated the post-processing of our representative images for several figures to address issues with inconsistencies. This includes new images for PROX1/CD31 immunostaining in Figure 2C, E, I, and K and new images for PROX1/VE-Cadherin immunostaining in Figure 2—figure supplement 4A-H that now show consistent PROX1 expression levels with representative images in Figure 2. Additionally, our new representative images for Figure 2—figure supplement 3E-H and Figure 2—figure supplement 4A-H show consistent VE-Cadherin expression levels among different tissue samples. Furthermore, our new images of VE-Cadherin immunostaining in EC-<italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic>-DKO mice more clearly depict that collecting vessels in these mice are characterized not only by discontinuous junctions, but the increased presence of overlapping junctions as well. We have also generated videos of 3D reconstructions of the collecting vessels depicted in Figure 2—figure supplement 4A-H (Videos 1 – 4), characterizing this observation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should provide further evidence to demonstrate how relevant the described in vivo phenotypes are to those described in vitro.

In regard to the second part of the reviewer comment, although FOXC1 and FOXC2 are functionally similar, as characterized by their similar DNA-binding capacity, their transcriptional targets are likely to be different under oscillatory or laminar shear stress. For example, our group previously reported that loss of <italic>FOXC2</italic> leads to distinct phenotypes in lymphatic endothelial cells under oscillatory shear stress and laminar shear stress (Sabine et al., 2012, Supplementary Figure 5A). Thus, as FOXC1 is induced only by laminar shear, but FOXC2 is induced by both laminar and oscillatory shear, their downstream targets are likely different within the collecting vessels of lymphatic endothelial cells. We have also updated the fourth paragraph of the Discussion section to elaborate on these differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Previous studies have demonstrated that FOXC2 is regulated by oscillatory shear forces in LECs, and that such forces likely play a key role in valve development.

This shorter time – 24-hour flow instead of 48-hour flow presented in our previous publications (Sabine et al., 2012, and Sabine et al., 2015) – is not sufficient to drive an important cell elongation in the direction of flow. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we present to the reviewer a kinetic view of LSS-mediated cell elongation in the direction of flow (horizontal on the provided pictures) showing that, in our hands, at 24 hours cells are not much elongated in comparison to 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Kinetics of LEC elongation in the direction of flow under 4 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> laminar shear stress.</title><p>Confluent LECs were seeded and 24 hours later cultivated for 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours or 48 hours either under static conditions or oscillatory shear stress (4 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>, 1/4 Hz oscillations) or unidirectional laminar shear stress (4 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>).

To clarify this point, we have now indicated in the legend of Figure 3 as: “Representative images of cultured LECs under static, OSS, or LSS show increased expression of FOXC1 when subjected to 24 hours to LSS, whereas FOXC2 is induced by both OSS and LSS.”</p><p>The observation that FOXC1 and FOXC2 expression are already different in LECs after only 24 hours under laminar shear stress is interesting as it suggests that FOXC1 upregulation by laminar flow is an early response of LECs to directional flow. How expression levels of FOXC1 and FOXC2 are distinctly regulated by the directionality of flow is a very interesting question that addresses the more general one of how LECs sense flow direction and are able to respond differently to LSS and OSS. Answering such a question would require further investigation and, in our opinion, is beyond the scope of this paper in which the central message is that each factor is differentially regulated by flow and plays slightly distinct but complementary roles in regulating the cell cytoskeleton in response to shear stress.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Quantification of cell elongation in the direction of flow corresponding to Figure 3.</title><p>Graphs show individual cell measurement of cell shape (length:width ratio) and alignment to flow axis (horizontal) for each time point.

We also suggested that the differences observed in reduction of mRNA levels compared to what we observe in regard to protein expression may be attributable to the different vascular beds analyzed. The difference in the penetrance of the phenotype of chylous ascites in the current study may be attributable to both the timeline of experimental analysis as well as the differences in Cre-drivers used.

We have now updated Figure 5—figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript to include additional data from our RNA-seq analysis for LECs isolated from the dorsal skin of embryonic LEC-<italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic>-DKO mice and littermate controls in panel K. Figure 5—figure supplement 1K now shows the changes in expression for <italic>RhoA, Rock1,</italic> and <italic>Rock2</italic>, and several GTPase activating proteins associated with regulation of RhoA signaling and endothelial barrier function and lumen maintenance (van Buul, Geerts, and Huveneers, 2014, Barry et al., 2016). Here, we see that there is a modest, yet significant increase in <italic>Arhgap18</italic> expression and a significant reduction of <italic>Arghap20</italic>, although its expression was generally lower compared to other GAPs. Because of the previously reported evidence of the formation of a physical complex between Prickle1 and Arhgap21/23 (Zhang et al., 2016) and our observation that all three genes were significantly downregulated in our RNA-seq analysis, we focused our investigation on these putative downstream targets. In regard to changes in RAS/ERK signaling, we attempted to perform whole-mount immunostaining of pERK using the same antibody utilized in our group’s previous study (Cell Signaling #4370T) but we were not successful in identifying a positive signal in control or mutant lymphatic valves at P6, testing the antibody at various concentrations. While we are interested in characterizing whether RAS-ERK signaling may be affected in our mutants during postnatal development in other lymphatic vascular beds, the authors believe that this is not of focus for the mechanism described in this study and is beyond its scope.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 6D: Additional controls are required in which ChIP of both FOXC1 antibodies at a negative control region of the genome (e.g. an enhancer region demonstrated or predicted not to bind FOXC1) is assessed.
