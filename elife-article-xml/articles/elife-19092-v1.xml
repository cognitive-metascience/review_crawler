transposons and other sequences for repression by establishing chromatin modifications. A central element of this process are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), which in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> are produced by a specialized RNA polymerase known as Pol V. Here we show that non-coding transcription by Pol V is controlled by preexisting chromatin modifications located within the transcribed regions. Most Pol V transcripts are associated with AGO4 but are not sliced by AGO4. Pol V-dependent DNA methylation is established on both strands of DNA and is tightly restricted to Pol V-transcribed regions. This indicates that chromatin modifications are established in close proximity to Pol V. Finally, Pol V transcription is preferentially enriched on edges of silenced transposable elements, where Pol V transcribes into TEs. We propose that Pol V may play an important role in the determination of heterochromatin boundaries.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19092.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19092.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>lncRNA</kwd><kwd>RdDM</kwd><kwd>transposons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>J3199-B09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Böhmdorfer</surname><given-names>Gudrun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM07544</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rowley</surname><given-names>M Jordan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281</institution-id><institution>Narodowe Centrum Nauki</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UMO-2013/08/T/NZ1/00313</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krzyszton</surname><given-names>Michal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB 1120271</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wierzbicki</surname><given-names>Andrzej T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM108722</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wierzbicki</surname><given-names>Andrzej T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome-wide identification of long non-coding RNAs produced by RNA Polymerase V identifies their role in heterochromatin maintenance on the boundaries of repressed regions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing, in plants known as RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM), takes place in most eukaryotic organisms and results in heterochromatin formation by the deposition of DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holoch and Moazed, 2015</xref>). This process relies on small RNAs, which usually are generated by the activities of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and Dicer. Small RNAs are subsequently incorporated into Argonaute and direct repressive chromatin modifications to complementary genomic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holoch and Moazed, 2015</xref>). Recognition of target sequences by small RNAs requires ongoing non-coding transcription of the targets. This non-coding transcription gives rise to long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) which has been proposed to serve as a scaffold for Argonaute binding to chromatin, where incorporated small RNAs base pair with lncRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holoch and Moazed, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> this lncRNA is produced by a specialized DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, known as Pol V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haag and Pikaard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wierzbicki et al., 2008</xref>). Activity of Pol V is required for DNA methylation but not for the biosynthesis of the vast majority of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kanno et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lahmy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pontier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wierzbicki et al., 2008</xref>). This implicates lncRNAs produced by Pol V (referred to as Pol V transcripts) as a factor required for recognition of target loci by siRNAs. Pol V transcripts are believed to be capped or triphosphorylated on their 5’ ends and not polyadenylated on their 3’ ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wierzbicki et al., 2008</xref>). They associate with several RNA binding proteins, including ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wierzbicki et al., 2009</xref>). It has been proposed that siRNAs incorporated into AGO4 base pair with Pol V transcripts and recruit AGO4 to specific loci in the genome. Binding of AGO4 is followed by the binding of INVOLVED IN DE NOVO 2 (IDN2) which interacts with a subunit of the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Böhmdorfer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, Pol V transcripts, AGO4, and/or other associated factors recruit DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 (DRM2), which is a <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Böhmdorfer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>). DNA methylation is then responsible for repression of Pol II transcription on silenced loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lister et al., 2008</xref>). While Pol V is involved in the late stages of the RdDM pathway, siRNA biogenesis starts with the activity of another specialized RNA polymerase, Pol IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Onodera et al., 2005</xref>). Pol IV transcripts are substrates for RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 (RDR2) and DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL3), which produce 24nt siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haag et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2015b</xref>).</p><p>Despite being a central element of the RdDM pathway, Pol V transcripts are poorly understood. Unlike Pol IV transcripts, which are relatively abundant and have been characterized genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blevins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhai et al., 2015</xref>), Pol V transcripts accumulate at low levels. This makes them difficult to detect using high-through sequencing approaches like RNA-seq. Therefore, it remains unknown if Pol V produces any RNAs beyond the very limited number of loci tested so far. It is also unclear what defines a Pol V promoter beyond published work suggesting that both Pol IV and Pol V are recruited by preexisting repressive chromatin modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wierzbicki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhong et al., 2012</xref>). It is further unknown which proteins interact with Pol V transcripts throughout the genome and how these proteins affect the transcripts. Additionally, the role of Pol V transcripts in forming the RdDM effector complex remains mysterious with several key mechanistic aspects being mostly based on speculation. These include the distance between the progressing polymerase and proteins binding to lncRNAs and the identity of nucleic acids base pairing with siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dalakouras and Wassenegger, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matzke et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, it is unknown if and how the specificity of Pol V recruitment to chromatin targets RdDM to individual genomic regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide identification of transcripts associated with Pol V</title><p>Current knowledge of the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of Pol V and RNAs produced by this polymerase is based on a very limited number of loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wierzbicki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Böhmdorfer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wierzbicki et al., 2008</xref>). To overcome this limitation, we designed an experimental approach to identify Pol V transcripts throughout the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome. We first enriched Pol V-associated RNAs using RNA immunoprecipitation with an antibody against NRPE1, the largest subunit of Pol V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pontier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wierzbicki et al., 2009</xref>), and then subjected the samples to high-throughput sequencing (Pol V RIP-seq). We performed these experiments in Col-0 wild-type and in the <italic>nrpe1</italic> mutant. This assay allowed the identification of genomic regions, where sequencing reads accumulated in Col-0 wild-type but not in <italic>nrpe1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, these reads originate from RNAs which are specifically associated with Pol V. Given that Pol V is a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haag et al., 2012</xref>), these reads most likely stem from transcripts generated by Pol V. We also detected a considerable amount of signal over annotated genes, however, these remained unchanged in <italic>nrpe1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and are therefore unlikely to be associated with Pol V. This signal was mostly present on active genes and indicates transcription by Pol I, II, III, and/or IV.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19092.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genome-wide identification of RNA produced by Pol V (Pol V transcripts).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A genomic region giving rise to Pol V transcripts.

Transcript calling used data from two independent biological replicates of RIP-seq. Data from both repeats were first combined to determine the ends of Pol V-associated RNAs. Then, read counts from both repeats were considered separately to filter the transcript list applying a combination of arbitrary criteria and statistical testing using the negative binomial test. The filtering criteria included a minimum of 8 reads in Col-0, a minimum four-fold enrichment between Col-0 and <italic>nrpe1</italic>, a p value of 0.05 and an FDR of 0.05. Details of the transcript calling strategy are described in the Materials and methods.</p><p>To visualize Pol V-associated RNAs, we plotted the average Pol V-RIP (Col-0/<italic>nrpe1</italic>) signal combined from both biological repeats on identified RNAs and their flanking regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Individual transcripts were scaled to allow visualization over the entire lengths of the transcripts. We observed high levels of Pol V-associated transcription throughout the predicted transcripts in both replicates and only trace amounts of Pol V-associated transcription outside the annotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This was true for the vast majority of Pol V-associated transcripts as shown on the corresponding heatmap where every row represents an individual transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This was also true when we analyzed both biological repeats separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Reproducibility between biological repeats was further tested by comparing Pol V RIP-seq signal intensities on annotated Pol V-associated RNAs in both repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Signal strengths measured as differences between RPM normalized read counts in Col-0 and <italic>nrpe1</italic> were significantly correlated (Pearson correlation r = 0.719, p&lt;2.2*10<sup>–16</sup>), which further increases confidence in the quality of our transcript calling. Taken together, we developed a strategy which allows the sensitive and reproducible identification of Pol V-associated RNAs throughout the genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pol V-associated RNAs are produced by Pol V</title><p>Transcripts identified using RIP-seq are bound by Pol V and are expected to be the products of Pol V based on its DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haag et al., 2012</xref>). However, they could also be produced by another RNA polymerase and bind to Pol V posttranscriptionally. To distinguish between these possibilities, we first checked if accumulation of those transcripts required Pol V. We tested several newly identified Pol V-associated transcripts using locus-specific RT-qPCR and identified 20 loci which were suitable for primer design and had a strong reduction of RNA accumulation in <italic>nrpe1</italic> in RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, transcripts obtained by RIP-seq are not only associated with Pol V but their accumulation also depends on Pol V, which indicates that these transcripts are products of Pol V.</p><p>Next, we tested if Pol V-associated transcripts are produced from regions where Pol V is bound to DNA. We compared our RIP-seq with previously published Pol V ChIP-seq obtained using the same antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wierzbicki et al., 2012</xref>) and found that Pol V binds chromatin at regions where we detected Pol V-associated transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

To test if Pol V transcription overlaps CG methylation, we analyzed published whole genome bisulfite sequencing datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stroud et al., 2013</xref>). DNA methylation in the CG context was increased throughout the genomic regions transcribed by Pol V but not outside of those regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Even though most Pol V transcripts were enriched in MET1-dependent CG methylation, the levels of CG methylation were not sufficient to predict the levels of Pol V transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This observation shows that CG methylation and Pol V transcription overlap and provides support for preexisting CG methylation being an important factor in guiding Pol V to specific loci. However, it also indicates that CG methylation does not regulate the level of Pol V transcription and that CG methylation is not needed upstream of transcription initiation sites. Instead it may be required within the transcribed regions.</p><p>We also tested if Pol V transcription overlaps with various posttranslational histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moissiard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greenberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luo et al., 2013</xref>) and found that H3K9me2 overlapped Pol V-transcribed regions in a way similar to CG methylation, while H3K4me2 was depleted on Pol V-transcribed regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). H3K4me3, H3K36me3, and H3K9ac also appeared depleted but due to a higher noise level this depletion was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although it is unknown which histone modifications are controlling Pol V transcription and which are established in a Pol V-dependent manner, this is consistent with Pol V being guided to its genomic targets by repressive chromatin modifications present within the transcribed regions.</p><p>The overlap between CG methylation and Pol V transcription suggests that CG methylation may be required for Pol V transcription. To test this possibility, we assayed the accumulation of six individual Pol V transcripts in the <italic>met1</italic> mutant and <italic>suvh4/5/6</italic> triple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Five loci showed a significant reduction in the accumulation of Pol V transcripts in the <italic>met1</italic> mutant, which is consistent with a requirement of MET1 for Pol V transcription and with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>). The <italic>suvh4/5/6</italic> mutant had a reduced accumulation of Pol V transcripts at two loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), which indicates that SUVH4, 5, and 6 (and H3K9me2 they presumably establish) may have a more subtle or locus-specific effect on Pol V transcription. One of the tested loci showed a significant increase in RNA accumulation in both mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), which may be attributed to the loss of Pol II silencing. These results are consistent with CG methylation being required for Pol V transcription.</p><p>The requirement of CG methylation for Pol V binding to chromatin and transcription may be interpreted as evidence of CG methylation recruiting Pol V to specific loci in the genome. This would predict that CG methylation should be sufficient for Pol V transcription. Alternatively, CG methylation may be one of many factors working together to determine the specificity of Pol V. To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed protein-coding genes, which show gene body CG methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bewick et al., 2016</xref>). Pol V transcripts were significantly depleted on body-methylated genes, identified by high levels of CG methylation and low levels of CHH methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, Pol V transcripts were enriched on genes having high levels of CHH methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which are likely caused by intronic transposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saze et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that CG methylation is not sufficient for Pol V transcription and consequently, CG methylation is one of many factors involved in guiding Pol V to specific genomic loci.</p><p>The possibility that preexisting repressive chromatin modifications guide Pol V predicts that this polymerase should transcribe both strands of DNA. To test this prediction, we plotted forward and reverse Pol V-RIP signal on aligned and scaled Pol V transcripts. We found that, indeed, Pol V transcribed bidirectionally on annotated Pol V transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and that transcription levels on both strands were somewhat correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, transcription on both strands was shifted with annotated Pol V transcripts on the reverse strand starting ~51 bp before annotated transcripts on the forward strand end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results support the idea that internal chromatin modifications may be important for Pol V transcription. Furthermore, they also suggest that transcription on one strand and, possibly, subsequently deposited chromatin modifications may be important for the initiation of transcription on the other strand.</p><p>If internal repressive chromatin modifications control Pol V transcription, one might predict that Pol V could have multiple transcription initiation sites within one transcribed region. This would manifest itself in the presence of several shorter RNAs within most annotated Pol V transcripts. Alternatively, if Pol V had an external promoter, we would expect the presence of one predominant RNA with a transcription start site close to the beginning of the annotated transcript. Our RIP-seq protocol included sonication and random priming steps, which preclude us from directly capturing the ends of intact RNAs. However, we performed paired-end RNA sequencing, which provides an alternative way to distinguish between these two possibilities. To do so, we mapped the paired-end reads to all <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transcripts annotated in TAIR10 as well as to Pol V transcripts. We then plotted the relationship between the transcript length and the mean size of paired-end sequenced RNA fragments mapping to this transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). As the RIP-seq datasets include significant amounts of background reads originating from polymerases other than Pol V, we were able to determine the relationship between the size of each transcript known from TAIR10 annotations and the mean length of mapped read-pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Small Pol V transcripts also followed this relationship, however, longer Pol V transcripts did not produce longer sequenced fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This indicates that actual RNAs produced from annotated Pol V transcripts are shorter than the size of these annotations. If the relationship between transcript length and sequenced RNA fragments is the same or at least similar for Pol V as it is for other DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, we would predict an RNA length of 196 nt based on the median paired end fragment obtained from the first repeat of Pol V RIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). A similar analysis of the second biological repeat of Pol V RIP-seq predicts a median RNA length of 205 nt. Considering that the median length of annotated Pol V transcripts is 689 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), this indicates that annotated Pol V transcripts contain more than one transcription initiation and/or termination site. This is not only consistent with Pol V being controlled by internal promoters but also demonstrates that Pol V transcripts annotated in our study are not individual continuous transcriptional units but rather regions of Pol V transcriptional activity.</p><p>Overall, our analysis suggests that Pol V is controlled by internal promoters, similar to what has been reported for a subset of Pol III transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geiduschek and Tocchini-Valentini, 1988</xref>). Although any involvement of DNA sequence elements cannot be excluded at this time, our data are consistent with repressive chromatin modifications being at least important for Pol V recruitment and possibly working as a functional equivalent of a promoter.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>AGO4 binds most Pol V transcripts</title><p>Pol V is required for AGO4 binding to chromatin genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>), however, it is unknown if AGO4 associates with Pol V transcripts beyond the handful of loci tested so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wierzbicki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Böhmdorfer et al., 2014</xref>). To test if the association with Pol V transcripts is a general feature of AGO4, we performed RIP-seq using an antibody against AGO4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wierzbicki et al., 2009</xref>) in Col-0 wild type, <italic>ago4</italic>, and <italic>nrpe1</italic>. Because the library prep method we used does not efficiently amplify siRNAs, this approach should specifically detect long RNAs associated with AGO4. AGO4 RIP-seq signal was significantly enriched on Pol V transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>) and this binding was dependent on Pol V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The presence of AGO4 RIP-seq signal on most transcripts shown on the heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) indicates that AGO4 associates with most if not all Pol V transcripts. This is further supported by a significant correlation between Pol V and AGO4 RIP-seq signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, annotations based on AGO4 RIP-seq yielded transcripts with start and end sites similar to Pol V transcripts and overlapped regions with hallmarks of RdDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stroud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Although the biochemical function of IDN2 remains unknown, it could potentially affect the stability of Pol V transcripts.

This suggests that mutations in AGO4 and IDN2 could affect the stability of Pol V transcripts. Alternatively, these mutations could indirectly affect Pol V transcription by causing a general reduction in repressive chromatin modifications on Pol V transcribed regions, which, in turn, would reduce the rate of Pol V transcription.

Although this spatial separation between Pol V and downstream factors has not been addressed experimentally, it predicts that the DNA methylation machinery may have some level of spatial flexibility especially over densely packed chromatin relative to the progressing position of the core Pol V polymerase complex. This flexibility could result in DNA methylation being established outside of the regions transcribed by Pol V. To test this possibility, we plotted Pol V-dependent CHH methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stroud et al., 2013</xref>) on DNA sequences corresponding to Pol V transcripts.

It remains unknown, which interaction is more important for RdDM. To answer this question, we focused our analysis on heterochromatic domains where protein binding to DNA may be constrained by a high density of nucleosomes but Pol V can still transcribe. We identified heterochromatic domains with high density of H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moissiard et al., 2012</xref>) and plotted various features of RdDM over their edges. Both Pol V binding to chromatin reported by ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wierzbicki et al., 2012</xref>) and Pol V transcription observed by RIP-seq overlapped the heterochromatic domains, which is consistent with Pol V transcribing silenced genomic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

However, current mechanistic understanding of RdDM does not explain this preference towards the edges of transposons. One possibility is that Pol V preferentially transcribes the edges of transposons. Alternatively, Pol V could transcribe the entire lengths of transposons but siRNAs could only be produced on the edges. To distinguish between these possibilities, we plotted Pol V RIP-seq data on all transposons which overlap annotated Pol V transcripts. While short transposons were entirely transcribed by Pol V, longer TEs had a strong enrichment of Pol V transcription on their edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We further analyzed euchromatic transposons longer than 4 kb, similar to those studied by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zemach et al., 2013</xref>).

This is consistent with the tight physical and functional association of Pol IV with RDR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haag et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Law et al., 2011</xref>), which promptly converts Pol IV transcripts into double stranded RNA. Because accumulation of Pol IV transcripts requires RDR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blevins et al., 2015</xref>), the existence of strand preference of Pol IV transcription remains unknown.</p><p>These results indicate that Pol V preferentially transcribes into transposons. Therefore, we propose that Pol V may play a key role in determining the boundaries of heterochromatin by transcribing into silenced regions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Regulation of Pol V transcription</title><p>Pol V is one of the critical factors determining the specificity of RdDM. Therefore, the promoter of Pol V and mechanisms regulating Pol V transcription may determine which regions of the genome are targeted by RdDM. Previous studies using ChIP-seq failed to identify conserved sequence elements which could be the Pol V promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wierzbicki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhong et al., 2012</xref>). Despite much higher resolution of RIP-seq we also did not identify any conserved external or internal sequence elements. Although <italic>de novo</italic> discovery of promoter elements is difficult even on Pol II genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Molina and Grotewold, 2005</xref>) and requirement of short or variable sequence elements for Pol V transcription cannot be excluded, this is consistent with recent work showing the requirement of methyl-binding proteins SUVH2 and SUVH9 for Pol V binding to chromatin and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Since SUVH2 and SUVH9 bind methylated DNA through their SRA domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2014</xref>), this indicates that pre-existing DNA methylation may serve as an equivalent of the Pol V promoter. We provide additional support for that possibility by showing a strong overlap between CG methylation and Pol V transcription. At the same time the accumulation of Pol V transcripts is not correlated with the levels of CG methylation and CG methylation is not sufficient to recruit Pol V. Moreover, Pol V transcription is limited to the edges of transposons, while DNA methylation usually spans the entire lengths of the transposable elements. This indicates that other unknown factors are involved in the determination and regulation of Pol V transcription.</p><p>RNA polymerases I and II primarily use promoters located upstream of the transcription start sites, while Pol III mostly but not exclusively uses internal promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geiduschek and Tocchini-Valentini, 1988</xref>). Pol V seems to behave more like Pol III in being controlled by features present within the transcribed regions. This means that, although Pol V is derived from Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tucker et al., 2010</xref>), it possibly uses a different transcription initiation machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The RdDM effector complex</title><p>Our data also provide insights into the interplay between Pol V, Pol V transcripts, and associated proteins, which we refer to as the RdDM effector complex. First, our data demonstrate on a genome-wide scale that RdDM of endogenous loci is mostly restricted to regions transcribed by Pol V. This is consistent with data obtained in transgene- or virus-induced silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daxinger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pélissier and Wassenegger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sasaki et al., 2014</xref>) and could be interpreted as evidence that siRNAs base pair with DNA and that Pol V only facilitates this interaction. Although this possibility cannot be excluded based on currently available data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matzke et al., 2015</xref>), we provide additional indirect support of base pairing between siRNAs and nascent Pol V transcripts.</p><p>One reason why siRNAs-lncRNA base pairing seems to be a more likely scenario is lack of detectable strand preference between siRNAs, Pol V transcripts, and DNA methylation on Pol V-transcribed loci. Although such a preference has been reported on other categories of loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lister et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>), this discrepancy may be explained by the potential involvement of other RNA polymerases or other factors. Since we show that both strands of DNA are equally likely to be methylated even if siRNAs or Pol V transcripts show a strong strand preference, this could indicate that double stranded DNA is a substrate for DRM2. The simplest explanation for this observation would be base pairing between siRNAs and lncRNAs. Another result favoring siRNAs-RNA base pairing is our analysis of regions with high density of nucleosomes with H3K9me2. Although this analysis does not specifically take into account the activities of at least two putative ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes involved in RdDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kanno et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>), it indicates that CHH methylation more closely follows AGO4 interactions with RNA than with DNA.</p><p>The exact architecture of the RdDM effector complex remains mysterious mostly because formaldehyde crosslinking does not allow distinguishing direct from indirect interactions. Our data show that this effector complex includes AGO4 throughout the genome, however AGO4 does not slice Pol V transcripts. Previous work indicates the involvement of IDN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Böhmdorfer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>), which also seems to be involved in enhancing the accumulation of Pol V transcripts. If, as argued above, siRNAs incorporated into AGO4 base pair with Pol V transcripts, restriction of DNA methylation to Pol V-transcribed regions suggests that this base pairing is likely to occur in close physical proximity to the Pol V complex. This is consistent with observations that AGO4 physically interacts with the C-terminal domain of Pol V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El-Shami et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Another important question about the RdDM effector complex is the involvement of RNA polymerases other than Pol V, which has been suggested by genetic evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>). Our data do not provide evidence of Pol I, II or III functionally substituting for Pol IV in the <italic>nrpe1</italic> mutant. However, it remains possible that these other polymerases may be involved in the initiation of transcriptional silencing or work with Argonaute proteins other than AGO4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fultz et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Determination of heterochromatin boundaries</title><p>Although RdDM has been implicated in various biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matzke and Mosher, 2014</xref>), its functions remain to some extent mysterious. It is especially true for its presumably main role of silencing transposons. Transposons are stably silenced by the combined action of three silencing pathways. Two of them are maintenance pathways which rely on CG methylation maintained by MET1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lister et al., 2008</xref>) and non-CG methylation maintained by CMT2 and CMT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stroud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zemach et al., 2013</xref>). RdDM on the other hand is capable of establishing DNA methylation <italic>de novo</italic>. Recently, yet another pathway has been implicated in directing silencing to active transposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCue et al., 2015</xref>). Our data show that Pol IV and Pol V direct RdDM to edges of transposons. Moreover, Pol V preferentially transcribes into transposons, which indicates that Pol V may be involved in determining the boundaries of heterochromatin on transposable elements. This is reminiscent of the BORDERLINE lncRNA in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keller et al., 2013</xref>), however, unlike BORDERLINE, Pol V transcripts are more likely to maintain heterochromatin over the edges of transposons rather than to prevent the spreading of heterochromatin.</p><p>The role of RdDM in the determination of heterochromatin boundaries has been recently studied in maize, where mutations in RdDM components MOP1, MOP2, and MOP3 enhance spreading of euchromatin from genes into nearby transposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2015a</xref>). Although this supports a role for RdDM in heterochromatin boundaries, the causal role of Pol V transcription in this process remains to be directly demonstrated.</p><p>The mechanism responsible for preferential Pol V transcription into transposable elements remains unknown. One possibility is that the transition from euchromatin to heterochromatin facilitates Pol V transcription. This is however inconsistent with our data showing that Pol V transcription is controlled by multiple internal promoter-like features. Another explanation is the presence of more than one Pol V transcription initiation mechanism, with one mechanism responsible for unidirectional transcription on TE boundaries and the other mechanism mediating bidirectional transcription on all Pol V-transcribed loci.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material</title><p>Col-0 wild type, <italic>nrpe1</italic> (<italic>nrpd1b-11</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pontes et al., 2006</xref>]), <italic>ago4-1</italic> (introgressed into the Col-0 background, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wierzbicki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zilberman, 2003</xref>]), <italic>idn2-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ausin et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>met1-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saze et al., 2003</xref>), and <italic>suvh4R203/suvh5-2/suvh6-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ebbs and Bender, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pontvianne et al., 2012</xref>) plants were grown in soil in long-day conditions.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Rebecca Mosher (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Using RNA Immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing (RIP-seq), you have globally identified transcripts of RNA polymerase V (Pol V). You have further analyzed the correlations between Pol V transcription and Pol V binding, DNA methylation, siRNA accumulation and genomic features. Your analyses clarify several key questions regarding Pol V transcription and RNA-directed DNA methylation. You propose that Pol V transcription plays an important role in the determination of heterochromatin boundaries.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that such findings should in principle be published at the highest level. While the reviewers furthermore agreed that the data presented are clear, they also agreed that some conclusions went considerably beyond what the data showed directly. To bring the interpretation more in line with the data, they asked you to tone down your claims, and also to perform additional analyses to support your claims.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Analyze whether gene body methylation can direct Pol V transcription. This analysis can be easily done using the already available datasets and will address the question whether methylation alone is sufficient to direct Pol V.</p><p>2) The conclusion that AGO4 interacts with RNA exiting Pol V is not supported by sufficient data. Tone down this claim by rewording as reviewers #1 and #2 suggested or provide new data to strengthen it.</p><p>3) Examine the role of Pol IV in targeting RdDM to TE edges by performing analyses as done for Pol V. Alternatively, tone down the claim that Pol V is the main determinant for RdDM targeting and do not exclude the possibility that Pol IV also plays a similar role.</p><p>We have included the full reviews, which mention separate points for essential revisions. Reviewer #1 suggested web-lab experiments to validate some of your genome-wide analyses, but after discussion, we agree that these experiments are unnecessary. Meanwhile, we agree that other suggestions raised by reviewers #1 and #2 are valuable and most of them can be addressed by rewording. We ask you to take them into account as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway, Pol V transcripts have been proposed as scaffold RNAs that recruit AGO4/siRNA effector complexes through base-pairing between the transcripts and siRNAs. In this manuscript, the authors present a comprehensive study that provides new evidence supporting previously proposed model for the role of Pol V transcripts at the effector stage of RdDM. Some of the findings advance the current understanding of RdDM and should be of general interest as well. My major criticism is that many statements made by the authors are too bold and not supported by sufficient data. The author should be more careful with interpretation of their seq data analyses.</p><p>1) The first two sections of Results can be organized in a more concise way. The authors should note the difference between &quot;Pol V-associated RNA&quot; and &quot;Pol V transcript&quot;. For an example, in the first section, the authors mentioned that a considerable number of Pol V-associated RNAs were not Pol V-dependent, but in the second section, they concluded: &quot;Pol V-associated RNAs are produced by Pol V&quot;.</p><p>2) The authors have not successfully identified the promoters of Pol V, thus the use of &quot;The Pol V promoter&quot; as the subtitle of the third section of Results is inappropriate.</p><p>3) The authors analyzed Pol V transcripts in <italic>ago4</italic> mutant and found that 1) the levels of Pol V transcripts were reduced in <italic>ago4</italic> and 2) average length of Pol V transcripts in <italic>ago4</italic> was similar to that in Col-0. As the authors mentioned, the reduction in Pol V transcript level in <italic>ago4</italic> could be from an indirect effect of <italic>ago4</italic> mutation on Pol V transcription. Thus, the authors should not conclude that AGO4 and IDN2 stabilize Pol V transcripts and use it as the subtitle of the section. The authors also concluded that Pol V transcripts are not sliced by AGO4, solely based on the data showing that average length of Pol V transcripts in <italic>ago4</italic> was similar to that in Col-0. The authors should consider an alternative interpretation of the data: the cleavage products of AGO4/siRNA were small and not detected by Pol V RIP-seq in Col-0 as there are many siRNAs that cover the entire region of a Pol transcript.</p><p>4) The seq data described in the section &quot;siRNAs base pair with RNA exiting Pol V&quot; basically supported a correlation between AGO4 binding to Pol V transcripts and RdDM but cannot be used to exclude the possibility that AGO4 binds to DNA. The authors provided an explanation for how AGO4 is prevented from binding to heterochromatin but did not explain how AGO4 is guided to regions outside heterochromatin. It is a bit strange that AGO4 was not ChIPed to RdDM regions. If AGO4 binds to Pol V transcripts, one would also expect AGO4 to be ChIPed onto Pol V transcribed regions through its binding to Pol V transcripts. In my opinion, without more biochemical data, it is premature to conclude that AGO4- associated siRNAs base pair with RNA exiting Pol V.</p><p>5) The authors found enrichment of Pol V transcription on the edges of longer transposons and concluded that Pol V is the main determinant for RdDM targeting the edges of transposons. As matter of fact, as the authors noted, Pol IV-dependent siRNAs were also enriched on the edges. Thus, Pol IV could also be a determinant.</p><p>6) In the third section of Results, the authors indicated that Pol V transcribed both strands and the transcription levels on both strands were correlated. However, in the last section of Results, strand preferences were detected for 5'-ends and 3'-ends of transposons. This needs to be clarified.</p><p>7) Most of the conclusions were drawn from genome-wide data analyses. The authors should use alternative approaches to validate at least some of the key points. For instance, the lengths of transcripts generated by internal Pol V transcription at some representative loci should be examined by RT-PCR analysis. Strand preference of Pol V transcription at selected loci should be confirmed by qRT-PCR. AGO4 binding to Pol V transcripts or DNA should be validated by RIP-RTPCR or ChIP-qPCR.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript entitled &quot;Long Non-coding RNA Produced by RNA Polymerase V Determines the Boundaries of Heterochromatin&quot; submitted to <italic>eLife</italic>, Böhmdorfer et al. perform RIP-seq of Pol V interacting RNAs in wild-type and pol v mutants. This dataset thus defines the transcripts that Pol V produces. The authors perform several analyses connecting their dataset to ChIP, RNA-seq and sRNA-seq datasets either already published or that they have produced themselves. This analysis shows that their dataset of Pol V transcripts is higher-resolution compared to Pol V ChIP previously published. The authors also use their dataset and informatic prowess to address several key questions in the RdDM field. Overall, this manuscript is very carefully written. I have split my comments into major concerns and analyses to be performed.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) The production and analysis of the Pol V-RIP dataset represents a technical accomplishment. However, my major concern for this manuscript is what has been biologically learned that we did not already know? This higher resolution data has improved our detection, but what was learned about RdDM? I think it will be important for the authors to highlight the strong conclusions from their dataset in the Abstract, and remove the Abstract parts that focus on the production of the dataset.</p><p>2) I found certain sections of the Methods lacking in critical detail. Were mock-IPs of any sort performed? Was mRNA or rRNA depleted in any way before library production? Most importantly, how were multi-mapping reads handled? Much of Pol V RNA comes from repetitive DNA, and how this is informatically handled will have large consequences on the observed data. This is particularly important for the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p>3) One of the strongest conclusions that could be made is that there is absolutely no evidence from this dataset that Pol II can substitute for Pol V in a pol v mutant. I think the authors should make this strong agreement to improve the conclusions they are drawing in this manuscript compared to their Pol V ChIP publication.</p><p>Analyses to be performed:</p><p>1) Subsection “The Pol V Promoter”: “Pol V transcripts were enriched on transposable elements in gene-rich environments”. I do not see evidence of this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. First, the r2 value is very low. Second, the analysis performed does not look at gene-rich or poor environments, but rather at mRNA production (mRNA/TE), which is not the same thing. This analysis should be repeated in a more direct manner.</p><p>2) The evidence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> makes me think that all regions regulated by MET1 are transcribed by Pol V. Does this include CG-context methylated genes? I think the investigation of these genes is critical to understanding Pol V. If they are transcribed by Pol V, then methylation alone, and not histone modification / heterochromatin is responsible for directing Pol V. If CG methylated genes are not transcribed, then methylation alone is not sufficient to direct Pol V. Either way, these genes should be explicitly examined as they are methylated regions that should not be targeted for RdDM nor formed into heterochromatin.</p><p>3) Subsection “AGO4 Binds Most Pol V Transcripts”: “…suggesting that AGO4 associates with most if not all Pol V transcripts.” I am not convinced of this claim by the data presented. Could the authors use a Venn diagram to determine the overlap and support this claim?</p><p>4) I do not like the display of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. If the authors wish to compare the RIP data in the <italic>ago4</italic> mutant, I suggest creating a scatter plot of each of the Pol V transcripts they annotated as dots, and then plot their RPM RIP values for wt on the X-axis and <italic>ago4</italic> on the Y axis. This will display the dataset in a more useful way than the boxplots or metaplot. See the following reference for an example: Panoramix enforces piRNA-dependent cotranscriptional silencing.</p><p>5) In the subsection “siRNAs Base Pair with RNA Exiting Pol V” the authors investigate strand bias. This is a worthwhile analysis, but it only informs the siRNA base pairing with RNA due to the models proposed, and does not directly test the &quot;RNA exiting Pol V&quot; per se. I would write this section strongly from the strand-bias point of view, but then only suggest that this supports an RNA-RNA interaction at a distance from the polymerase.</p><p>6) In the section on edges of heterochromatin, it seems to me that the combined activity of both Pol IV and Pol V function to create this edge enrichment. I would be interested to see if the analysis performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C-D</xref> repeated with data from Pol IV would show the same thing of transcription in from transposable element ends. I think this is particularly important, as this is a major conclusion that could be newly drawn from this dataset, and the title reflects this discovery as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Böhmdorfer and colleagues address the important question of Pol V activity by describing transcripts produced by RNA Pol V in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. They identify these transcripts through Pol V RIP-seq and further assess them in various ways, including assessment via qRT-PCR in <italic>nrpe1</italic> mutants or RIP-seq in <italic>ago4</italic> and <italic>idn2</italic> mutants, comparison of sense/antisense transcripts, and correlations with Pol V ChIP, DNA methylation, siRNA accumulation, and genomic features (TEs, histone modifications). The authors make a number of conclusions regarding Pol V activity and the larger mechanisms of RdDM. While some of their conclusions are based on indirect evidence, they are always careful to state alternative hypotheses. The data in this manuscript are of the highest quality and will undoubtedly be highly influential. The authors should be commended on a really beautiful piece of science – meticulous experimentation, thoughtful analysis, careful interpretation, clear writing, and beautiful figures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19092.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] The reviewers agreed that such findings should in principle be published at the highest level.

It is now split into two independent subsections, one focused on strand bias and the other on AGO4 binding to Pol V transcripts. The new wording does not use the presented results as a way to test if AGO4 interacts with RNA exiting Pol V. Instead, we test smaller hypotheses and only finish the second subsection with the following statement: “(…) our data are consistent with a speculative model where downstream components of RdDM interact with Pol V transcripts in close proximity to the Pol V complex and siRNAs base pair with RNA exiting the Pol V complex”. We left a paragraph in the Discussion explaining how our results support this model but made it clear that we only provide additional indirect evidence.</p><p><italic>3) Examine the role of Pol IV in targeting RdDM to TE edges by performing analyses as done for Pol V. Alternatively, tone down the claim that Pol V is the main determinant for RdDM targeting and do not exclude the possibility that Pol IV also plays a similar role.</italic> </p><p>We performed the requested analysis using published datasets of Pol IV transcription and this new analysis is now described in the Results and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. Briefly, we found that Pol IV is also enriched on the edges of TEs. However, we found no evidence of strand specificity. These new results are explained in the Results and mentioned in the Discussion. For clarity we removed results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> panels C-E in the original manuscript.</p><p><italic>We have included the full reviews, which mention separate points for essential revisions. Reviewer #1 suggested web-lab experiments to validate some of your genome-wide analyses, but after discussion, we agree that these experiments are unnecessary. Meanwhile, we agree that other suggestions raised by reviewers #1 and #2 are valuable and most of them can be addressed by rewording. We ask you to take them into account as well.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>In the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway, Pol V transcripts have been proposed as scaffold RNAs that recruit AGO4/siRNA effector complexes through base-pairing between the transcripts and siRNAs. In this manuscript, the authors present a comprehensive study that provides new evidence supporting previously proposed model for the role of Pol V transcripts at the effector stage of RdDM. Some of the findings advance the current understanding of RdDM and should be of general interest as well. My major criticism is that many statements made by the authors are too bold and not supported by sufficient data. The author should be more careful with interpretation of their seq data analyses.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The first two sections of Results can be organized in a more concise way. The authors should note the difference between &quot;Pol V-associated RNA&quot; and &quot;Pol V transcript&quot;. For an example, in the first section, the authors mentioned that a considerable number of Pol V-associated RNAs were not Pol V-dependent, but in the second section, they concluded: &quot;Pol V-associated RNAs are produced by Pol V&quot;.</italic> </p><p>In the revised manuscript the term “Pol V transcripts” is only introduced after Pol V-associated transcripts are shown to depend on Pol V and to be produced from Pol V-bound loci. We clarified that transcripts, which are not dependent on Pol V “(…) are unlikely to be associated with Pol V”.</p><p>We considered ways to make the first two sections more concise. However, we thought that, even though specialists could consider some of the information provided in those sections as self-explanatory, the broad audience of <italic>eLife</italic> could benefit from a more detailed explanation of our experimental approaches that create the foundation for the rest of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) The authors have not successfully identified the promoters of Pol V, thus the use of &quot;The Pol V promoter&quot; as the subtitle of the third section of Results is inappropriate.</italic> </p><p>We changed the subtitle to “Pol V Regulatory Elements”.</p><p><italic>3) The authors analyzed Pol V transcripts in ago4 mutant and found that 1) the levels of Pol V transcripts were reduced in ago4 and 2) average length of Pol V transcripts in ago4 was similar to that in Col-0. As the authors mentioned, the reduction in Pol V transcript level in ago4 could be from an indirect effect of ago4 mutation on Pol V transcription. Thus, the authors should not conclude that AGO4 and IDN2 stabilize Pol V transcripts and use it as the subtitle of the section. The authors also concluded that Pol V transcripts are not sliced by AGO4, solely based on the data showing that average length of Pol V transcripts in ago4 was similar to that in Col-0. The authors should consider an alternative interpretation of the data: the cleavage products of AGO4/siRNA were small and not detected by Pol V RIP-seq in Col-0 as there are many siRNAs that cover the entire region of a Pol transcript.</italic> </p><p>We changed the title of the sub-section to “AGO4 and IDN2 Enhance the Accumulation of Pol V Transcripts”. We also added the suggested alternative interpretation by stating that “(…) AGO4 slicing products originating from Pol V transcripts could be undetectable in our assay due to their size or loss of association with the Pol V complex”.</p><p>Additional modifications to this subsection have been made in response to Reviewer #2 and are described below.</p><p><italic>4) The seq data described in the section &quot;siRNAs base pair with RNA exiting Pol V&quot; basically supported a correlation between AGO4 binding to Pol V transcripts and RdDM but cannot be used to exclude the possibility that AGO4 binds to DNA. The authors provided an explanation for how AGO4 is prevented from binding to heterochromatin but did not explain how AGO4 is guided to regions outside heterochromatin. It is a bit strange that AGO4 was not ChIPed to RdDM regions. If AGO4 binds to Pol V transcripts, one would also expect AGO4 to be ChIPed onto Pol V transcribed regions through its binding to Pol V transcripts. In my opinion, without more biochemical data, it is premature to conclude that AGO4- associated siRNAs base pair with RNA exiting Pol V.</italic> </p><p>As explained above in our response to Essential Revisions, this paragraph has been rewritten and toned down. We now do not make this conclusion, instead we mention in the Results that our data provide additional support for this speculative model and further expand on those speculations in the Discussion. We also directly state that AGO4/siRNA-DNA interaction remains possible.</p><p>It is important to point out that AGO4 does in fact generally ChIP to RdDM targets, which we published before and further confirm on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. The exclusion observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> is a local phenomenon, which we only observed on the edges of domains showing high levels of H3K9me2.</p><p><italic>5) The authors found enrichment of Pol V transcription on the edges of longer transposons and concluded that Pol V is the main determinant for RdDM targeting the edges of transposons. As matter of fact, as the authors noted, Pol IV-dependent siRNAs were also enriched on the edges. Thus, Pol IV could also be a determinant.</italic> </p><p>As explained in our response to Essential Revisions, we tested this possibility more directly by analyzing the presence of Pol IV transcripts on the edges of transposons and now show that both Pol IV and Pol V are involved in this process. These new data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) In the third section of Results, the authors indicated that Pol V transcribed both strands and the transcription levels on both strands were correlated. However, in the last section of Results, strand preferences were detected for 5'-ends and 3'-ends of transposons. This needs to be clarified.</italic> </p><p>We clarified this apparent inconsistency by adding the following sentence in the last subsection of Results: “Although Pol V tends to transcribe both strands of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), a subset of Pol V transcripts is enriched on one strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) indicating that limited strand preference of Pol V may be involved in determining boundaries of heterochromatin.”</p><p><italic>7) Most of the conclusions were drawn from genome-wide data analyses. The authors should use alternative approaches to validate at least some of the key points. For instance, the lengths of transcripts generated by internal Pol V transcription at some representative loci should be examined by RT-PCR analysis. Strand preference of Pol V transcription at selected loci should be confirmed by qRT-PCR. AGO4 binding to Pol V transcripts or DNA should be validated by RIP-RTPCR or ChIP-qPCR.</italic> </p><p>We followed the editorial decision letter and did not add these locus-specific validations. We should explain that we invested a substantial amount of time and resources into directly identifying ends of Pol V transcripts. Unfortunately, presence of Pol II transcripts introduced some level of ambiguity and we decided not to publish these results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>In the manuscript entitled &quot;Long Non-coding RNA Produced by RNA Polymerase V Determines the Boundaries of Heterochromatin&quot; submitted to eLife, Böhmdorfer et al. perform RIP-seq of Pol V interacting RNAs in wild-type and pol v mutants.

This will display the dataset in a more useful way than the boxplots or metaplot. See the following reference for an example: Panoramix enforces piRNA-dependent cotranscriptional silencing.</italic> </p><p>We generated the suggested scatterplots, which show the same trends as seen on the boxplots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.

I would be interested to see if the analysis performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C-D</xref> repeated with data from Pol IV would show the same thing of transcription in from transposable element ends. I think this is particularly important, as this is a major conclusion that could be newly drawn from this dataset, and the title reflects this discovery as well.</italic> </p><p>As explained in our responses to Essential Revisions and Reviewer #1, we performed the analysis of Pol IV transcripts and found that indeed both Pol IV and Pol V are preferentially present on the edges of transposons. Interestingly, only Pol V shows directionality, which we explain as an effect of RDR2 association with Pol IV. These new results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> and explained in the Results section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
