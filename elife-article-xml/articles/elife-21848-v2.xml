Previously, we reported a structure-function study of a soluble LapD•LapG complex, which established conformational changes in the receptor that lead to c-di-GMP-dependent protease recruitment (Chatterjee et al., 2014). This work also revealed a basal affinity of c-di-GMP-unbound receptor for LapG, the relevance of which remained enigmatic. Here, we elucidate the structural basis of coincidence detection that relies on both c-di-GMP and LapG binding to LapD for receptor activation. The data indicate that high-affinity for LapG relies on the formation of a receptor dimer-of-dimers, rather than a simple conformational change within dimeric LapD. The proposed mechanism provides a rationale of how external proteins can regulate receptor function and may also apply to c-di-GMP-metabolizing enzymes that are akin to LapD.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21848.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21848.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>biofilm formation</kwd><kwd>second messenger</kwd><kwd>membrane protein structure</kwd><kwd>membrane signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI097307</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sondermann</surname><given-names>Holger</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32-GM108440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooley</surname><given-names>Richard B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM008500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O’Donnell</surname><given-names>John P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Chatterjee et al., 2014), the mechanism of coincidence detection in bacterial second messenger signaling across membranes is revealed at a molecular level, providing insight into the regulation of a conserved transmembrane receptor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacteria exist either as free swimming, planktonic cells or as multi-cellular biofilms — aggregates adhered to biotic or abiotic surfaces, which are enveloped in a self-produced matrix composed of proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Teschler et al., 2015</xref>). This matrix protects bacteria from hostile environments, rendering them more resistant to insult and, in the context of pathogenic microbes, more tolerant to antibiotics and the immune system. The transition between planktonic and sessile lifestyles is tightly regulated, typically involving the second messenger c-di-GMP (or cyclic diguanylate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hengge, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hengge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Römling et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wolfe and Visick, 2008</xref>). The cellular c-di-GMP level is governed by two enzyme classes with opposing activities: GGDEF domain-containing diguanylate cyclases and EAL or HD-GYP domain-containing phosphodiesterases, which synthesize and degrade the dinucleotide, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schirmer and Jenal, 2009</xref>). A wide variety of specific, c-di-GMP-binding receptors translate the second messenger signal into physiological responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chou and Galperin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sondermann et al., 2012</xref>). Bacterial genomes can encode a large number of c-di-GMP-signaling proteins and this number scales roughly with the organism’s adaptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galperin, 2005</xref>). A particularly interesting observation is that, despite identical catalytic activities, c-di-GMP-metabolizing enzymes often confer distinct signaling outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dahlstrom et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kulasakara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lindenberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Newell et al., 2011a</xref>).

At its center, the inner membrane protein LapD functions as a receptor with degenerate GGDEF and EAL domains, which together relay intracellular c-di-GMP concentrations to the periplasm. At high c-di-GMP levels, LapD sequesters the adhesin protein-specific, periplasmic protease LapG at the inner membrane via the receptor’s periplasmic domain. This step ensures that large adhesin proteins whose transcription is activated by the dinucleotide remain stably associated with the outer cell membrane. When c-di-GMP levels drop and adhesin expression ceases, LapD undergoes a conformational change, adopting an autoinhibited state with low affinity for LapG; freed LapG, in turn, processes the adhesin proteolytically, weakening cell adhesion and ultimately contributing to biofilm dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Newell et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rybtke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borlee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martínez-Gil et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monds et al., 2007</xref>). Notably, our previous work identified a transient, yet detectable interaction of LapG with c-di-GMP-unbound LapD, suggesting that the protease may participate in an early event of LapD signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>). Curiously, saturation binding of LapG to LapD was markedly lower in the absence of c-di-GMP compared to levels when both ligands, c-di-GMP and LapG, were present. The functional relevance and mechanistic role of this interaction, however, remained poorly defined.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21848.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SEC-MALS reveals a switch of LapD dimers to dimer-of-dimers upon ligand binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Working model for c-di-GMP-dependent regulation of the periplasmic protease LapG via the inner membrane protein LapD.

At least one of these enzymes, GcbC, fulfills a distinct role in contributing an activation signal that relies on protein–protein interactions with LapD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dahlstrom et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Yet, our previous structural analysis of LapD indicated that a helical motif mediating pairwise interactions with GcbC was occluded in the autoinhibited state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, modeling LapD as a simple dimer also suggested global steric incompatibility between these two transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Here, we focus on the molecular basis of switching of the purified, full-length c-di-GMP receptor LapD. These follow-up studies reveal an unanticipated role for LapG, together with c-di-GMP, in establishing the signaling-competent conformation of LapD by inducing higher-order oligomerization of the receptor. On the basis of the results, significant modifications to our model include coincidence detection of dinucleotide and protease as well as bidirectional signaling across the membrane as integral steps in LapD activation, with implications for the origins of transmembrane c-di-GMP signaling and for the regulation of LapD via heterologous interactions with diguanylate cyclases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dahlstrom et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activation of full-length LapD results in quaternary structure changes</title><p>Previously, we showed that LapD has a reduced binding capacity for LapG in the absence of c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>). This observation was based on an equilibrium-binding assay at a fixed LapD concentration and with LapG as the titrant. To further confirm a quantitative difference between c-di-GMP-bound and -unbound LapD with regard to LapG affinity, we developed a fluorescence anisotropy-based assay, which relies on LapG that is fluorescently labeled at the sole cysteine residue in the protein’s active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Titration of purified, detergent-solubilized LapD to a fixed concentration of fluorescent LapG yielded saturation-binding data, revealing an approximately 6-fold increase in LapG’s apparent affinity for LapD when c-di-GMP is present. Interestingly, the LapD titrations used here reached comparable maximum binding with and without c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), in contrast to our previous assays in which LapG was the titrant which showed distinct maxima for LapD–LapG binding in the presence or absence of c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>). The difference in binding observed when the fixed and titrated proteins are swapped suggests that LapG displays a constant, saturable binding site, whereas LapD’s binding capacity, and not only its affinity for LapG, is regulated by the dinucleotide.</p><p>To begin investigating the structural underpinnings of LapD switching in the context of the intact receptor, we initially employed size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS). This approach enables assessment of the quaternary structure of detergent-solubilized, full-length LapD in response to c-di-GMP and LapG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). SEC-MALS is particularly advantageous for the study of membrane proteins because the respective scattering contributions of the protein and detergent components of the protein-detergent conjugate can be accurately deconvoluted to yield the molecular mass of the protein analyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gimpl et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). With this approach, purified apo-LapD was shown to be monodisperse and dimeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Pre-incubation with LapG in the absence of c-di-GMP did not alter LapD’s elution time nor oligomerization state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that the interactions between the c-di-GMP-unbound receptor and the protease observed in saturation-binding assays ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) are likely transient.</p><p>To probe how c-di-GMP influences LapD oligomerization, LapD was pre-incubated with dinucleotide and injected into the SEC-MALS system equilibrated with c-di-GMP in the mobile phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The LapD•c-di-GMP complex was predominantly dimeric, but a minor population of tetrameric LapD•c-di-GMP was also observed. Unexpectedly, when analyzed under identical conditions, the preformed LapG•LapD•c-di-GMP complex eluted predominantly as a higher-order species with a molecular weight corresponding to that of a LapD dimer-of-dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Omitting c-di-GMP in the mobile phase destabilized the complex, with LapD eluting as a dimeric species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and C</xref>). Together, these results provide compelling evidence that the LapG protease, together with c-di-GMP, plays a crucial role in the activation of LapD via induction of receptor oligomers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cysteine crosslinking reveals multiple activation states of LapD</title><p>The analysis described above suggests that native LapD can adopt at least three global states: (1) dimeric apo-LapD, (2) dimeric LapD•c-di-GMP, and (3) a LapD•c-di-GMP•LapG dimer-of-dimers complex. To characterize these states further, we turned to cysteine crosslinking, a time-honored approach to assess the conformation and dynamics of proteins with high spatial resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bass et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler and Falke, 1998</xref>). In this approach, a covalent crosslink forms upon mild oxidation, catalyzed by copper phenanthroline (Cu(Phen)<sub>2</sub>), only when two cysteine residues are in close spatial proximity (~2–3 Å). For visualization of crosslinked polypeptides in SDS-PAGE, we expressed LapD variants with a C-terminal monomeric superfolder-GFP (sfGFP) tag. Specific LapD–sfGFP detection in crude solubilized membrane fractions is based on in-gel fluorescence, with crosslinks introducing electrophoretic mobility shifts of the sfGFP-fusion protein. Furthermore, we mutated two native cysteine residues in the soluble domains of LapD (C<sup>304</sup> and C<sup>397</sup>) to alanine and serine, respectively, to eliminate non-specific crosslinks. This LapD variant (‘TMcys’) retained the two native cysteine residues in the transmembrane helices (C<sup>12</sup> and C<sup>158</sup>). Using a specific LapG photo-crosslinking assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>), we showed that LapD-TMcys was able to bind LapG in a c-di-GMP-dependent manner similar to wild-type LapD, as was a variant lacking all four native cysteine residues (‘cysless’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Site-directed cysteine mutations were introduced into the TMcys–sfGFP fusion background in order to analyze LapD conformational changes in different states of activation.

In the corresponding crystal structure, residues S<sup>229</sup> of the S helix and A<sup>602</sup> of the EAL domain of the same polypeptide chain are in close proximity.

Upon expressing LapD<sup>TMcys</sup>-S<sup>229</sup>C-A<sup>602</sup>C (fused to sfGFP), there is a low, but detectable level of spontaneous disulfide-bond formation in the absence of oxidant, which was sensitive to reducing agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; red arrow/asterisk). Short copper-catalyzed oxidation (~10 min) yields crosslinks of only about half of apo-LapD protomers.

Instead, new bands with slower electrophoretic mobility are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; blue and grey markings), which account for the entire LapD population (minus the spontaneously crosslinked fraction that is locked in the autoinhibited state prior to oxidation). One of these bands (blue marking) is rationalized as a homotypic crosslink between corresponding cysteine residues at position 602, as residue A<sup>602</sup> is also central to the canonical EAL domain dimerization interface observed in the LapD<sup>EAL</sup>•c-di-GMP complex structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, bottom) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>). This interpretation is supported by the presence of a crosslinking adduct with comparable electrophoretic mobility using LapD<sup>TMcys</sup>-A<sup>602</sup>C, which lacks the S<sup>229</sup>C mutation, and by the absence of such a band in LapD<sup>TMcys</sup>, which lacks both S<sup>229</sup>C and A<sup>602</sup>C, despite otherwise identical experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that the origin of two other predominant bands with slower mobility in the LapD<sup>TMcys</sup>-S<sup>229</sup>C-A<sup>602</sup>C•c-di-GMP sample stems from movements in the transmembrane helices upon activation, which may orient the native cysteine residues C<sup>12</sup> and/or C<sup>158</sup> into crosslinking-competent positions. Indeed, the exposure of c-di-GMP-activated LapD<sup>TMcys</sup> to oxidant gave rise to two crosslinking adducts with slower electrophoretic mobility (green and magenta markings, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This observation indicates that the transmembrane domain cysteine residues contribute to the disulfide-mediated banding pattern in the presence of c-di-GMP. To identify explicitly the relevant crosslinks involving the transmembrane helices, we mutated these two native cysteine residues individually to alanine and subjected them to oxidative crosslinking. No crosslinked bands were observed in the case of LapD<sup>TMcys</sup>-C<sup>158</sup>A, whereas LapD<sup>TMcys</sup>-C<sup>12</sup>A supported a single crosslinking adduct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom panel). Hence, the dominant adduct (green marking) pertains to covalent bonds between corresponding C<sup>158</sup> residues in a LapD dimer, whereas the lower, weaker band (magenta marking) stems from a crosslink between C<sup>12</sup> and C<sup>158</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, bottom panel).</p><p>Taken together, the shift to a LapD species with slower electrophoretic mobility upon incubation with c-di-GMP can, for the most part, be explained by cysteine crosslinking caused by movements in the transmembrane helices (green/magenta markings) and EAL domain dimerization (blue marking), as well as a subpopulation presumably containing multiple crosslinks (grey marking) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-3"><title>LapD•c-di-GMP•LapG: LapG contributes to LapD activation by inducing distinct conformational changes</title><p>Using A<sup>602</sup>C crosslinking as an analytical tool, we next probed the effect of LapG on the activation of LapD complexes. Notably, crosslinking via corresponding A<sup>602</sup>C residues in the LapD•c-di-GMP•LapG complex increases relative to the level observed in the absence of LapG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, top panel; blue markings). This apparent close proximity of A<sup>602</sup>C residues is indicative of the formation of canonical, c-di-GMP-dependent EAL domain dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barends et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Minasov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sundriyal et al., 2014</xref>).

Interestingly, only ~50% of the EAL domains appear to be engaged in dimers, suggesting that like LapD in the autoinhibited state, activated LapD is based on asymmetric LapD dimers as the minimal unit.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-4"><title>EAL domain dimerization mediates the formation of LapD dimer-of-dimers</title><p>Our previous model assumed that EAL domain dimerization occurs within a LapD dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>, left panel), a notion that needed to be revisited in light of the LapD dimer-of-dimers observed in the presence of LapG and c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). An alternative model consistent with the above and previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>) is one in which EAL domains bridge two LapD dimers rather than interacting within the same LapD dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel). To distinguish between these two possibilities, we mixed LapD variants with distinct molecular weight, LapD–sfGFP and non-fluorescent LapD, which separately form constitutive dimers in their respective apo-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As seen before (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), oxidation of LapD<sup>TMcys</sup>-A<sup>602</sup>C–sfGFP in the presence of c-di-GMP and LapG produced a crosslinking band that migrates just below the 250 kDa marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; dark blue arrow). Addition of LapD<sup>TMcys</sup> lacking sfGFP prior to oxidation decreases crosslinking efficiency, indicating a competitive effect between LapD<sup>TMcys</sup>-A<sup>602</sup>C–sfGFP and LapD<sup>TMcys</sup> dimers. To unambiguously demonstrate that this competition is due to the formation of a LapD dimer-of-dimers, we replaced non-fluorescent LapD<sup>TMcys</sup> with non-fluorescent LapD<sup>TMcys</sup>-A<sup>602</sup>C. Upon oxidation, we observe two crosslinking bands that correspond to LapD<sup>TMcys</sup>-A<sup>602</sup>C–sfGFP and LapD<sup>TMcys</sup>-A<sup>602</sup>C–sfGFP•LapD<sup>TMcys</sup>-A<sup>602</sup>C dimers-of-dimers (dark and light blue arrow, respectively), for which the difference in molecular weight after SDS denaturation is roughly a single sfGFP moiety. Importantly, these specific crosslinking events occur readily with detergent-solubilized LapD at low protein concentration (~1 μM). Qualitatively similar results were obtained when proteins are embedded in a lipid bilayer of fused membrane fractions from cells separately expressing LapD<sup>TMcys</sup>-A<sup>602</sup>C–sfGFP or non-fluorescent LapD<sup>TMcys</sup> variants (see Material and Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In summary, these data provide a structural and mechanistic basis for the dimer-of-dimers observed in the SEC-MALS data.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21848.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>LapD•c-di-GMP•LapG dimer-of-dimers also form in a membrane environment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two LapD constructs, one genetically fused to sfGFP and one non-fluorescent, both harboring the A<sup>602</sup>C mutation, were engineered and expressed separately. In previously proposed models, EAL domain dimerization was thought to occur within a single LapD dimer (left). Under this model, one would only expect a single band shift corresponding to c-di-GMP- and LapG-activated LapD–sfGFP dimers upon oxidation, even if the sfGFP-fused and non-fluorescent variants were present in the membrane. Alternatively, the EAL domains could dimerize across two LapD dimers (right) to form a dimer-of-dimers. Under the latter model, when the two constructs are mixed, activated with c-di-GMP and LapG, oxidized with a disulfide-promoting copper catalyst, denatured in SDS-PAGE, and imaged by in-gel fluorescence, a faster migrating covalent heterodimeric adduct consisting of LapD–sfGFP and LapD (dark) should be observed in addition to the slower migrating complex containing just LapD–sfGFP homodimeric adduct. (<bold>B</bold>) Complex formation is mediated by dimerization of EAL domains across two LapD dimers rather than within the same LapD dimer. The two LapD variants shown in (<bold>A</bold>) were expressed separately. Crosslinking via corresponding A<sup>602</sup>C residues was induced after incubation with c-di-GMP and LapG, either in detergent-solubilized samples (left panel) or upon fusing membrane fractions from the two cultures (right panel). In both detergent and membranes, SDS-PAGE analysis of this crosslinking experiment shows that a heterodimeric adduct containing both LapD–sfGFP and non-fluorescent LapD (lighter blue triangle; asterisk denotes residue from a non-fluorescent LapD) is observed in addition to a species containing only LapD–sfGFP (darker blue triangle). In detergent, non-fluorescent LapD lacking the A<sup>602</sup>C mutation serves as a competitor, reducing LapD-A<sup>602</sup>C–sfGFP crosslinking efficiency.

On the basis of recent findings that the diguanylate cyclase GcbC interacts with and specifically activates LapD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dahlstrom et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2016</xref>), we hypothesize that activated LapD dimer-of-dimers may be stabilized by GcbC (bottom right) to ensure prolonged, high-affinity sequestration of LapG in the periplasm.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21848.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21848.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21848-fig4-figsupp4-v2"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>Analysis of distance distribution functions suggests a slightly more compact structure of the trapped-inactive LapD with a measurably shorter <italic>D<sub>max</sub></italic> and smaller Porod volume compared to native apo-LapD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). These observations are reflected in <italic>ab initio</italic> three-dimensional envelopes in which the trapped-inactive LapD lacks the extended density toward the bottom of the molecule seen in native apo-LapD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, dotted circles). Manually docking individual LapD domains suggests that the trapped-inactive LapD envelope has dimensions consistent with both protomers' adopting the autoinhibited conformation that was observed in the crystal structure of this module. On the other hand, the native apo-LapD envelope is consistent with a heterogeneous state in which one protomer adopts the autoinhibited conformation while the other half-site of the dimer can be modeled as a mixture of autoinhibited and extended conformations. In this proposed extended conformation, the EAL domain dislodges from the S helix to expose the c-di-GMP binding site to solvent. This notion of a partially dislodged EAL domain in one protomer of native apo-LapD is consistent with the S helix–EAL domain cysteine crosslinking data discussed above, in which only ~50% of the protomers are engaged upon short exposure to the disulfide-promoting copper catalyst.</p><p>In accordance with this analysis, addition of c-di-GMP has a marginal effect on native LapD’s <italic>D<sub>max</sub></italic>, indicating that part of apo-LapD already adopts an extended conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, the shape of the distance distribution function confirms c-di-GMP-dependent conformational changes relative to apo-LapD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, right panel). The modeled envelope of c-di-GMP-bound LapD reveals a more pronounced density for a disengaged EAL domain and a lessening of features that would correspond to the EAL domain in its S helix-engaged, autoinhibited conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Notably, these global changes appear to be restricted to one half-site of a LapD dimer, consistent with our crosslinking data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and the lack of apparent symmetry in the SAXS data for the constitutive dimeric states discussed so far. Even the trapped-inactive LapD dimer could not be modeled with two-fold symmetry, indicating that crosslinking stabilizes or introduces some sort of a strained conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Alongside the trend of conformational changes in the cytosolic module of LapD from trapped-inactive to c-di-GMP-bound dimer, we noticed volume effects in the periplasmic domain (boxed area, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which we interpret as decreasing dynamics of this domain from the trapped-inactive, to the apo- and finally the c-di-GMP-bound state.</p><p>Lastly, the distance distribution function and envelopes generated from LapD•c-di-GMP•LapG SAXS profiles yielded dimensions and overall shapes consistent with two LapD•c-di-GMP dimers engaged via one of their EAL domains (and bound to LapG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). At the same time, this complex appears to be less well defined as the normalized spatial discrepancy (NSD) values, an assessment of the similarity of the individual models used to calculate the average envelope, are higher than those of the other three states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Another way to model SAXS data relies on simulated annealing-rigid-body fitting of individual domains on the basis of high-resolution structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Petoukhov and Svergun, 2005</xref>). This analysis yielded models that are compatible with the experimental data, and these models agreed well with the above interpretations based on envelope calculations for the trapped-inactive, the LapD•c-di-GMP complex, and the fully active LapD•c-di-GMP•LapG complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, the native apo-LapD was modeled as an intermediate between a half-open and a fully inhibited conformation, depicting a single average conformation.</p><p>The above structure-based, rigid-body modeling creates a single solution, even for more dynamic or heterogeneous states such as native apo-LapD. By contrast, the Ensemble Optimization Method (EOM) enables selection of an ensemble of conformations from a pool of random conformers based on fitting theoretical and experimental scattering profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernadó et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tria et al., 2015</xref>). For this approach, we generated two libraries of 10,000 structures each, one in which the linker connecting the GGDEF and EAL domains of one protomer of LapD was allowed to be flexible, and a second in which this linker was flexible for both protomers. Results from this EOM analysis are analogous to those discussed above in that the native apo-LapD adopts an extended conformation (based on the <italic>R<sub>g</sub></italic> and <italic>D<sub>max</sub></italic> of the selected ensemble models) more frequently than the trapped-inactive form. The LapD•c-di-GMP state is enriched in conformations that are more extended than both the trapped-inactive and the native apo-form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>In summary, results from the three independent approaches reporting on conformational changes upon LapD activation or inactivation – SEC-MALS, site-specific crosslinking, and SAXS-based modeling – are consistent with each other and allow us to distinguish four distinct states of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom panel). The structural transition from a low-to-high affinity state of LapD for the protease LapG appear to be driven by independent inputs via c-di-GMP binding to the cytosolic module and LapG binding to LapD’s periplasmic domain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cellular signaling systems must transmit information with high specificity and do so reversibly, avoiding high-affinity or excessively stable complexes that would result in unregulated signaling events. In the present study, we uncovered structural events that ensure exquisite control of a bacterial biofilm signaling switch, the conserved second messenger receptor LapD, based on the characterization of the intact membrane protein. LapD sequesters and thus regulates its cognate periplasmic protease LapG in response to rising c-di-GMP levels in the cytosol, a mechanism that has been described as inside-out signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Newell et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2011b</xref>). Yet, new evidence presented here indicates that both ligands, c-di-GMP and LapG on either side of the inner bacterial membrane, contribute to the conformational switch that establishes a signaling competent state. The distinct response as a result of two independent inputs is a hallmark of coincidence detection, achieved here through bi-directional signaling across the membrane.</p><p>The mechanistic implications of these new findings for LapD regulation are manifold. We show that a LapD dimer is already inherently asymmetric even in the absence of any ligands. One half-site of an apo-LapD dimer adopts a conformation akin to the crystal structure of the autoinhibited cytosolic module, characterized by an occluded c-di-GMP binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>). The other half-site appears to sample an open conformation, in which the EAL domain is disengaged from LapD’s regulatory S helix. Such a conformation would prime LapD for c-di-GMP binding, which, in turn, would shift the equilibrium to the more extended state, thus preventing autoinhibition. The reason why one protomer appears more dynamic than the other is not well understood, but could indicate anti-cooperative effects in oligomeric receptors analogous to mechanisms described for other bacterial receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maksay and Tőke, 2014</xref>). In support of this, we previously showed that only one equivalent of c-di-GMP is required per LapD dimer for maximal LapG binding, and that the high-affinity LapG-binding state of the periplasmic domain of LapD is asymmetric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>). Both of these features could manifest from the proposed anti-cooperative nature of activation.</p><p>In several other receptor systems, in particular those utilizing HAMP domains as an integral relay module, one model for signal transmission is based on an alternating static-to-dynamic transition in which tighter packing in one protein element drives other elements into a more loosely packed, dynamic state (known as the ‘yin-yang’ model) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Swain et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parkinson, 2010</xref>). Such a model of coupled dynamics is enticing for LapD, in which compact autoinhibited cytoplasmic domains give rise to a more dynamic output domain capable of only transiently binding LapG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>). By contrast, activation of the complex with c-di-GMP results in a disengaged EAL domain and in more compact output domains that are competent to bind LapG more tightly. This notion is supported by our modeling of the SAXS data, which indicates that the output domain becomes more well-defined upon LapD activation by c-di-GMP.</p><p>At the same time, we also demonstrate that c-di-GMP is only a partial activator and that c-di-GMP-bound LapD differs structurally from high-affinity complexes comprising the dinucleotide, receptor, and protease. This observation indicates a distinct signaling input into LapD via LapG. The simultaneous binding of c-di-GMP and LapG to LapD’s cytosolic and periplasmic domains, respectively, establishes a conformation in which the EAL domains dimerize through a canonical interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barends et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Minasov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sundriyal et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast to previous models, this interaction does not occur within a dimer, but across two LapD dimers. This change in quaternary structure, the formation of a LapD dimer-of-dimers, is apparent in all three, independent approaches reported on here. An exact molecular mechanism explaining this long-range allosteric regulation of LapD resulting in a higher oligomeric, high-affinity complex remains enigmatic, but it appears that the HAMP domain functions as an integrator of bilateral signaling across the membrane. In this model, the HAMP domain would prevent full LapD activation if the receptor were to engage with only one of the ligands, LapG or c-di-GMP, on either side of the membrane.</p><p>The periplasmic input — LapG binding to LapD’s output domain — is likely a vestigial feature derived from evolutionarily related, active enzymes that have domain architecture similar to that of LapD, which produce or degrade cellular c-di-GMP upon sensing environmental stimuli through an outside-in signaling mechanism. Some parallels can be drawn to the YfiBNR system in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malone et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2010</xref>). YfiN is a transmembrane, GGDEF-domain-containing diguanylate cyclase with a juxtamembrane HAMP domain and a periplasmic PAS domain. The cyclase-inactive state is stabilized through interactions of YfiN’s periplasmic domain with YfiR, a periplasmic protein. An environmental signaling cue, possibly cell wall or redox stress, leads to the dissociation of YfiR, which in turn increases YfiN’s cyclase activity and — as a result — cellular c-di-GMP levels. While YfiN regulation probably relies on its integral HAMP domain and periplasmic ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giardina et al., 2013</xref>), direct juxtaposition with LapD’s mechanism is hindered by a gap in our understanding regarding the structure of the full-length diguanylate cyclase.</p><p>Annotation of close to 2,000 proteins containing a triple HAMP-GGDEF-EAL domain unit akin to LapD, many of which are predicted to be active diguanylate cyclase or phosphodiesterases, highlights the prevalence of this module in c-di-GMP signaling networks. It is possible that the underlying molecular mechanisms for the regulation of these proteins follows the paradigm that we established here for LapD. Indeed, asymmetry, like that we described for the LapD output domain-LapG complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>), is common among outside-in signaling membrane proteins, including HAMP domain-containing chemotaxis receptors and histidine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maksay and Tőke, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Milburn et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Neiditch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yeh et al., 1996</xref>). For example, binding of the quorum-sensing signal AI-2 to the periplasmic domain of the histidine kinase complex LuxPQ induces asymmetry in its periplasmic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Neiditch et al., 2006</xref>). Likewise, ligand-induced asymmetry in Tsr/Tar chemosensory receptors promotes the oligomerization of three identical, but functionally non-equivalent, cytoplasmic core domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Briegel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). It will be interesting to investigate the conservation of the molecular mechanisms established for LapD in other c-di-GMP-signaling proteins. Such comparisons are currently hampered by limited structural insight for other HAMP-GGDEF-EAL domain-containing proteins and a lack of knowledge regarding the ligands that control their activity and cellular function.</p><p>One of the major open questions in the field pertains to mechanisms that explain signaling specificity, that is, the non-equivalent physiological outcome of diguanylate cyclases or phosphodiesterases despite identical catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dahlstrom et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kulasakara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Newell et al., 2011a</xref>). Consistently, protein–protein interactions between enzymes that make or break c-di-GMP and c-di-GMP-specific receptors have been implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lindenberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guzzo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ryan and Dow, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ryan et al., 2012</xref>), including the GcbC diguanylate cyclase and the LapD receptor pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dahlstrom et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2016</xref>). Nevertheless, it was not entirely clear how these two membrane proteins might interact, as the motifs identified as mediating the physical contacts are either buried or sterically not accessible in a simple LapD dimer model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our revised model, based on the observation of asymmetric LapD dimers in the apo- and c-di-GMP-bound states, as well as the symmetric LapD dimer-of-dimers, reconciles this conundrum. These dimers have in common an open configuration that could provide a signaling platform for heterologous interactions with other proteins such as GcbC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Since apo-LapD samples the extended state, this model is also consistent with the observation that GcbC interacts with both apo- and constitutively active variants of LapD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dahlstrom et al., 2015</xref>). The structural impact of the GcbC–LapD interaction on the c-di-GMP receptor remains to be assessed, but it is conceivable that GcbC could stabilize a LapD dimer-of-dimers and/or induce a conformation similar to that of the LapG–c-di-GMP-bound receptor. Regardless, the fact that LapD can adopt these many different conformations allows it to present unique interfaces for direct interaction with other proteins for proper regulation. Such a mechanism for imparting strict specificity to an otherwise ubiquitous second messenger molecule has significant implications. The concepts of an open signaling platform, asymmetry as a vital feature for regulation, and coincidence detection could also be relevant for diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases that require exquisite control and trigger specific signals in the background of a larger c-di-GMP signaling network. Conceivably, interventional strategies could be devised to target specific c-di-GMP cyclases, phosphodiesterases or receptors, despite these proteins all having similar folds or catalytic activity. Hence, revealing the language of these signaling networks will be crucial for controlling and treating chronic infections caused by biofilm-forming pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, expression and purification of <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> Pf0-1 LapD and LapG</title><p>Expression, membrane isolation and purification of non-fluorescent LapD and LapD fused C-terminally with monomeric superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP containing the V<sup>206</sup>K mutation that prevents sfGFP dimerization) were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>).

Each frame of scattering data was collected for two seconds, and 10–20 frames corresponding to a single protein peak were averaged and background corrected.</p><p>Buffer-subtracted scattering data were analyzed and scaled using the program Primus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Konarev et al., 2003</xref>). The program GNOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Svergun, 1992</xref>) was used to determine the distance distribution functions P(r), radius of gyration (<italic>R<sub>g</sub></italic>), and maximum diameter of the particle (<italic>D<sub>max</sub></italic>). <italic>D<sub>max</sub></italic> was adjusted so that distribution functions fell naturally to zero beyond <italic>D<sub>max</sub></italic> and the best goodness-of-fit parameter was obtained. SAXS-based shape reconstructions were carried out with the programs DAMMIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franke and Svergun, 2009</xref>) and DAMMIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Svergun, 1999</xref>). Briefly, 20 models were calculated by DAMMIF, and the program DAMAVER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Volkov and Svergun, 2003</xref>) was used to superimpose, filter and average these models. The resulting ‘damstart’ model from this DAMMIF analysis was used as an initial model for further refinement with DAMMIN to generate ten additional models. These ten DAMMIN models were superimposed, filtered and averaged using DAMAVER to produce the final model.</p><p>Simulated annealing and rigid-body fitting of individual structures of LapD domains to the scattering data were performed by the program SASREF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Petoukhov and Svergun, 2005</xref>) using an iterative protocol. This analysis was facilitated by the use of crystallographic models of individual soluble domains of LapD, including the periplasmic domain (PDB 4u64), the periplasmic domain bound to LapG (PDB 4u65), the autoinhibited S helix-GGDEF-EAL cytoplasmic module (PDB 3pjx) and the c-di-GMP-bound EAL domain dimer (PDB 3pju), as well as a homology model of LapD’s HAMP domain (template PDB 2y21; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferris et al., 2011</xref>)). The detergent corona was built and refined using the program MEMPROT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pérez and Koutsioubas, 2015</xref>). Structures were docked into the three-dimensional envelopes using SUPCOMB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kozin and Svergun, 2001</xref>). Theoretical scattering curves were created and comparisons with experimental data made with CRYSOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Svergun et al., 1995</xref>). To perform the SASREF analysis for the trapped-inactive form of LapD, models for the periplasmic, transmembrane, HAMP, and two autoinhibited domains were docked into the auto-inhibited LapD DAMMIN envelope, and a manually constructed micelle was placed around the transmembrane domain. SASREF was used to rotate and translate each individual domain to fit the scattering data, enforcing only restraints necessary to maintain contiguous peptide chains. The program MEMPROT was then used to generate and optimize a detergent micelle around the transmembrane domain of the resulting model. This model with the optimized MEMPROT-generated micelle was then re-run through SASREF in an identical manner to generate the final model for trapped-inactive LapD. For native, apo-LapD, the micelle generated from the trapped-inactive structure was used, and SASREF was run similarly except that the EAL domains of LapD were separated from their respective GGDEF domains to allow for flexibility. The identical procedure was performed for the LapD•c-di-GMP complex. For the LapD•c-di-GMP•LapG dimer-of-dimers, an additional restraint was enforced requiring close distance (3–6 Å) between the residues A<sup>602</sup> of the EAL domains, as experimentally determined and apparent in the c-di-GMP-bound EAL domain crystal structure.</p><p>For assessing EAL domain flexibility, the trapped-inactive LapD model generated by SASREF (described above) was used, and the residues connecting the EAL domain to the GGDEF domain of one LapD protomer were allowed to be remain flexible. The program Ensemble Optimization Method (EOM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernadó et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tria et al., 2015</xref>) was used to generate 10,000 models in which this EAL domain was allowed to adopt any random orientation around the rest of the fixed LapD molecule. A second pool was generated in which this linker was allowed to be flexible in both protomers of LapD. By applying EOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernadó et al., 2007</xref>), an ensemble of conformers was selected from each pool that best fit either the trapped-inactive, native, or LapD•c-di-GMP scattering data. Ensemble characteristics relative to the entire pool of models were assessed based on their respective <italic>R<sub>g</sub></italic> and <italic>D<sub>max</sub></italic>. Inspection of individual models from the selected ensembles revealed features that were consistent with the interpretation of the corresponding envelope and rigid-body models (data not shown).</p><p>Statistics associated with this and all other analyses are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>. For all dimeric complexes, P1 symmetry was used based on better modeling statistics compared to modeling with P2 symmetry applied. For the dimer-of-dimers complex, data fit was only marginally better using P2 symmetry.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank George O’Toole for feedback on the manuscript.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Coincidence detection and bi-directional transmembrane signaling control a bacterial second messenger receptor&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers uniformly felt that the manuscript built on the authors' previous report, contained interesting data, and proposed a very interesting and plausible model. They also felt that the presentation needs to be greatly improved and that while the multiple techniques employed – size exclusion chromatography-multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS), cysteine- and photo-crosslinking, and small angle X-ray scattering (SAX) – provided much interesting data that supported the model, they did not definitively demonstrate its correctness. In addition, while the multiple techniques contributed to the strength of the article, they also made the logical flow of the manuscript difficult to follow and that the figures and figure legends were overly detailed and difficult to follow.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The main technical issues are:</p><p>SEC-MALS: What is the origin of the dn/dc value of 0.14 for LMNG detergent? This value is critical for determining the molecular weight estimates that are reported for the studies.

Here the authors show utilizing three different methods: SEC-MALS, site-specific crosslinking, and SAXS-based modeling, several states of LapD in response to interactions with LapG on its periplasmic side, and cyclic-di-GMP on its cytoplasmic side. This work is very well conducted and the manuscript is clearly written. I really don't see any further experimentation that is required.

The manuscript is difficult to follow at places, and the figures in particular are crowded and overly complex. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for instance, the inclusion of SEC traces in which c-di-GMP is absent from the running buffer does not seem relevant, since the ligand may simply be dissociating from the receptor during the experiment.

It is based on observations of the oligomerization state of the full-length detergent-solubilized LapD in the presence/absence of c-di-GMP and LapG using three techniques: (1) SEC-MALS, (2) Cys-cross-linking and (3) SAXS. The authors provide strong evidence that in the presence of LapG and c-di-GMP, LapD forms asymmetric tetramers, in which tetramerization is mediated by two of the four EAL domains, one from each LapD dimer. This data is very exciting and intriguing, providing a new model regarding LapD activation. While the experimental work is largely sound, the current work would be enhanced by providing a more clear mechanism that explains how this asymmetric tetramer is stabilized by LapG/c-di-GMP, since this is not obvious from the data presented (nor discussed in detail).</p><p>Experimental work.</p><p>1) MS data to verify the Cys-crosslinks (cutting out the bands from the gel/tryptic digest) would enhance the manuscript (and also allow one to determine what the 'grey' species are).

Please use thinner lines for the figures/plots - the thick lines give the impression that the experimental and modeled data are more similar than they are.

Discussion about this discrepancy is warranted.</p><p>4) Major: The envelopes (or labels?) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> for the LapD (apo) and trapped-inactive LapD are switched and thus it is unclear which one is correct.</p><p>5) Major: The χ<sup>2</sup> values for the manual docking figures are very high (poor fit). In contrast, the fits are improved by using quantitative fitting of models to the envelope. The fits in 4-3 are what should be shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, not the manual, more poorly fitting models. This would also alleviate the question about why there is so much density in the tetramer model in 4C that is unaccounted for.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21848.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The main technical issues are:</italic> </p><p><italic>SEC-MALS: What is the origin of the dn/dc value of 0.14 for LMNG detergent? This value is critical for determining the molecular weight estimates that are reported for the studies. The full reviews also contain detailed comments on the need to include c-di-GMP data, improvements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, and the related discussion.</italic> </p><p>Initially, we used this value as an estimate based on the published dn/dc of CHAPS (0.132), which is the predominant detergent in this experiment, and a detergent closely related structurally to LMNG, DDM (0.143). LMNG has the same lipid and maltose head groups as DDM but contains a quaternary carbon that joins two DDM groups.</p><p>However, in the revised manuscript, we have now determined all relevant dn/dc values experimentally following the approach described by Strop and Brunger (Protein Sci 2005, PMID: 16046633) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In particular, we determined dn/dc values for CHAPS, LMNG, and the LMNG/CHAPS (1:8) mixture that was used in the gel filtration buffer. In the process, we encountered a difference between the reported and measured dn/dc for CHAPS (0.132 vs 0.177). We determined dn/dc values for two other detergents used in the study by Strop and Brunger (Strop and Brunger, Protein Sci 2005, PMID: 16046633), LDAO and DDM, and the published values agree with our experimental values for these detergents. Hence, we relied on our experimentally determined dn/dc values for LMNG/CHAPS in the re-analysis of the light scattering data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>), and adjusted all molecular weight estimates in the revised manuscript accordingly. The Material and methods section was revised accordingly. The new dn/dc values had marginal effects on the protein molecular weights and hence did not impact our interpretation of the results.</p><p><italic>Cysteine- and photo- crosslinking: These studies need MS data to verify the crosslinks and must be provided.</italic></p><p>We have determined photocrosslinking specificity in the original publication on which this Research Advance is based upon. While we did not conduct mass spectroscopic analysis, we introduced non-natural amino acid residues at sites in the crystallographic LapD-LapG interface and also at positions chosen as negative controls that did not support crosslinking (Figure 6, Chatterjee et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2014, PMID: 25182848). Furthermore, crosslinking relied on residue W<sup>125</sup> in LapD, establishing unequivocally that this strategy reported on the crystallographic (and physiologically relevant) binding interface (Figure 9, Chatterjee et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2014, PMID: 25182848 and also in this manuscript, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We agree that the crosslinking patterns in some samples are complex. However, we would like to point out that the main crosslinking products are specific and can be assigned unambiguously to specific cysteine positions based on available crystal structures and the numerous controls included in the experiment. For example, we demonstrated that cysteineless LapD-sfGFP shows no crosslinking bands under any conditions. Furthermore, we assigned specific crosslinking adducts to native transmembrane cysteine residues based on LapD variants with only a single cysteine residue. Based on the data presented, we can confidently and unambiguously assign bands marked with red, magenta, blue, and green symbols to the specific, indicated cysteine pairs, despite the complexity of the crosslinking patterns.</p><p>The only band/area in question for which we cannot assign the exact crosslinking position arises only from the combination of LapD<sup>TMcys</sup> and A<sup>602</sup>C (gray asterisks). We argue that this minor ambiguity regarding only one of the main crosslinking products does not take away from the central message of the experiment, which allowed us to distinguish between different states by analyses of the crosslinking patterns. The ambiguous band is discussed as such, so we feel we did not overstate the analytical power of this experiment.</p><p>For the above reasons, we would like to point out that the suggested MS experiments would contribute very little new information. With our current experimental setup, MS experiments are not as straightforward as mentioned in the reviews for the following reason: The experiments shown here are based on in-gel fluorescence of partially purified protein. We chose this approach due to its incredible sensitivity, allowing us to work at very low, more physiologically relevant concentrations. To make the MS experiments work, we would have to scale up the protein preparations enabling us to work with a pure system. Next we would have to rely on appropriate peptide recovery and coverage of the cysteine-containing motifs. Considering the number of mutants used here, logistically and financially this is not a trivial investment for an analysis that provides no guarantees to produce the required data and more importantly, likely adds little new to the analysis. Finally, while the MS-based analysis was labeled as an essential revision, we note that only one reviewer made mention of this, and in doing so suggested this analysis would only “enhance” the manuscript rather than be critical to support the proposed model.</p><p>Given that all crosslinking data presented here are consistent with results from the two other, main experimental approaches (as noted by the reviewers and editor) and with previously determined crystal structures, we do not think MS analysis would provide additional essential support for the proposed model of LapD activation. However, we have extended the crosslinking Results section to clarify the rational behind the controls that led to the unambiguous determination of sites supporting crosslinking in the various states.</p><p> <italic>In addition, the monomeric state of the GFP needs to be explicitly addressed.

Combined with our previously published structural data, the provided controls, the overall robustness of the crosslinking approach, and the consistency across the three independent methods of characterization presented here (SEC-MALS, crosslinking, and SAXS), it is very hard to envision a scenario in which the dominant crosslinking bands we discuss are due to rare or poorly populated conformations.

We considered isothermal titration calorimetry as an approach to measure these interactions but concluded that this technique is less than ideal for this system. There are simply too many molecular events to deconvolute that occur during activation of LapD (including c-di-GMP binding to LapD, LapG binding to both apo- and c-di-GMP bound LapD, EAL domain dimerization, and disengagement of the EAL domain from the S helix, all of which will contribute to the overall energetics of the system). This complexity renders a direct comparison by isothermal titration calorimetry of LapD binding to LapG in the absence and presence of c-di-GMP challenging.

We were careful in our Discussion not to overstate the accuracy of manual fits by stating explicitly the goodness of fits in the Figure Supplement. The manually docked models were compared to the envelope reconstructions predominantly with regard to their overall dimensions and shapes. Unlike the computationally fit models, which included more degrees of freedom, the manually docked models are based on published and functionally validated crystal structures.</p><p>Considering that we report comparisons accurately, it becomes a question of preference whether to show in the main figure models that preserve physiologically important conformations observed in crystal structures despite poorer fits due to the inherent constraints, or to show models with better fits but potentially disrupted interfaces due to the higher degrees of freedom allowed during the modeling. At the resolution of SAXS-based modeling and the fact that purified LapD is a multi-domain, micelle-containing protein, some ambiguity in the data can be expected. The unaccounted for density in the tetramer model coincides with the transmembrane/micelle region, which is likely the area of highest ambiguity with regard to the accuracy of the modeling process. As a result of these careful considerations, we decided to include several approaches and focus our discussion on the consensus interpretation emerging from this cross-validation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
