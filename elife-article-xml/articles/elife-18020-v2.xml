insufficient to inhibit CDKs. We show here that endogenous p21, instead of being residual, it is functional and necessary to preserve the genomic stability of unstressed cells. p21depletion slows down nascent DNA elongation, triggers permanent replication defects and promotes the instability of hard-to-replicate genomic regions, namely common fragile sites (CFS). The p21’s PCNA interacting region (PIR), and not its CDK binding domain, is needed to prevent the replication defects and the genomic instability caused by p21 depletion. The alternative polymerase kappa is accountable for such defects as they were not observed after simultaneous depletion of both p21 and polymerase kappa. Hence, in CDK-independent manner, endogenous p21 prevents a type of genomic instability which is not triggered by endogenous DNA lesions but by a dysregulation in the DNA polymerase choice during genomic DNA synthesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18020.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18020.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18020.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer develops when cells in the body mutate in ways that allow them to rapidly grow and divide. To protect cells from becoming cancerous, various molecules act like guardians to prevent cells from dividing when their DNA is damaged, or if they are short of energy. Other guardian molecules monitor the DNA copying process to ensure that the newly-made DNA is as identical as possible to the original DNA template.</p><p>A protein called p21 belongs to the first group of guardian molecules: DNA damage triggers the production of p21, which prevents the cell from copying its DNA. This role relies on a section of the protein called the CDK binding domain. Cells that have already started to copy their genetic material also have low levels of p21.</p><p>Mansilla et al. used human cells to investigate whether p21 is also involved in the process of copying DNA. The experiments show that the low levels of p21 act to increase the speed at which the DNA is copied. This activity helps to ensure that all of the cell’s DNA is copied within the time available, including sections of DNA that are harder to copy because they are more fragile and prone to damage. This newly identified role does not involve the CDK binding domain, but instead requires a different section of the p21 protein known as the PCNA interacting region.</p><p>Mansilla et al. propose that p21 plays a dual role in protecting us from developing cancer. The PCNA interacting region is also found in other proteins that are involved in copying DNA. Therefore, a future challenge is to find out how these proteins interact with each other to ensure that cells accurately copy their DNA in a timely fashion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18020.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18020.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>genomic stability</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>p21 CDKN1A</kwd><kwd>common fragile site</kwd><kwd>DNA elongation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R03 TW008924</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gottifredi</surname><given-names>Vanesa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003074</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICT-2012-1371</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gottifredi</surname><given-names>Vanesa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003074</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICT-2013-1049</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gottifredi</surname><given-names>Vanesa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000522</institution-id><institution>Company of Biologists</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Travel Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mansilla</surname><given-names>Sabrina F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Laboratoire d'Excellence Toulouse Cancer LABEX TOUCAN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoffmann</surname><given-names>Jean-Sébastien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>La Ligue Nationale contra le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoffmann</surname><given-names>Jean-Sébastien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new tumor suppressor function of p21, needed at each undamaged duplication cycle, ensures the adequate execution of the DNA replication program thereby protecting the genome integrity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The p21 protein (also known as p21<sup>CDKN1A</sup> and p21<sup>Cip1/Waf1</sup>), is a member of the family of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (CKIs) which has long been known for its ability to consolidate the G1 and G2 arrest after DNA damage caused by genotoxic agents, such as γ irradiation (γ IR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brugarolas et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bunz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deng et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dulic et al., 1998</xref>). As p21 has no enzymatic domain, it was not surprising to discover that a robust increase in p21 protein levels is required to achieve efficient CDK inhibition in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boulaireet al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cai and Dynlacht, 1998</xref>). Such observations have led to the widely-held assumption that the lower amounts of p21 in cycling cells are residual and insufficient to achieve any biological relevant function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertolin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Soria and Gottifredi, 2010</xref>).</p><p>However, p21 levels in cycling cells are not null. Albeit p21 does not efficiently inhibit CDK activity in cycling cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cai and Dynlacht, 1998</xref>) it could still regulate CDK-independent processes. CDK-independent functions of p21 could rely on its proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-interacting region (PIR) located on the C-terminus of p21, which binds the interdomain connecting loop (IDCL) of PCNA with high affinity ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prives and Gottifredi, 2008</xref>] and references there in).However, no role for the p21/PCNA complex formation has been yet described. On the contrary, research has focused only on the biological relevance of disrupting the p21/PCNA interaction.</p><p>As DNA polymerases (pols) also bind the IDCL of PCNA through PIR or PIP (PCNA interacting protein) boxes, p21 should be capable of negatively regulating all PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis processes in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moldovan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tsanov et al., 2014</xref>). In fact, in vitro experiments demonstrated that the large excess of p21´s PIR inhibits the interaction of PCNA with DNA replication and nucleotide excision repair (NER) factors (for original papers refer to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prives and Gottifredi, 2008</xref>]),impairing replication- and repair-associated DNA synthesis respectively (see examples in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cooper et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gottifredi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prives and Gottifredi, 2008</xref>]). However, the amount of p21 used in such experiments were much higher than the maximal p21 levels that can be accumulated in cells, even after genotoxic treatments (discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prives and Gottifredi, 2008</xref>]).The overexpression of p21 to levels in the range of those induced by genotoxins, inhibits neither replication- nor repair- associated DNA synthesis events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Soria et al., 2008</xref>) which are mostly dependent on replicative DNA pols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burgers, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Soria and Gottifredi, 2010</xref>). These data all together indicate that in cycling cells, physiological levels of p21 are not capable of inhibiting PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis by replicative DNA pols, even when p21 is induced by external stress.</p><p>However, PCNA-dependent synthesis by other DNA pols could be inhibited by endogenous p21. In fact, endogenous p21 levels drop dramatically after ultraviolet irradiation (UV) and Methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Soria et al., 2006</xref>). We have previously shown that p21 downregulation after UV facilitates nascent DNA elongation across UV-damaged DNA templates by enabling the recruitment of alternative (alt) DNA pols to replication factories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mansilla et al., 2013</xref>). Strikingly, UV irradiation couples translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) by alt DNA pols with the activation of the CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup> E3 ligase at replisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Havens and Walter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nishitani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Soria and Gottifredi, 2010</xref>). The CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup> E3 ligase binds and degrades p21 <italic>only</italic> when it is complexed with chromatin-associated PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Havens and Walter, 2011</xref>). The list of genotoxic treatments that triggers p21 proteolysis has expanded lately and includes UV, MMS, cisplatin, hypoxia, hypoxia mimicking factors, hydroxyurea (HU), aphidicolin (APH), hydrogen peroxide, and potassium bromide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Savio et al., 2009</xref>). In conclusion, the degradation of endogenous p21 at replication sites in S phase allows full TLS activation or fork-restart when required.</p><p>While the above mentioned reports demonstrate the relevance of disrupting p21-PCNA interaction in cells, no report has ever addressed the relevance of the PCNA-p21 complex in cells. Here we report that endogenous p21 localizes at replication factories through PCNA binding, thereby avoiding DNA polymerase κ (Pol κ) to be recruited at replication factories. Surprisingly, in contradiction with its function as a negative regulator of CDKs, p21 facilitates S phase progression; that is p21 promotes nascent DNA elongation.The DNA replication defects caused by p21-depletion caused accumulation of replication stress markers, such as γH2AX and 53BP1, instability of common fragile sites and micronuclei (MN) accumulation. Interestingly, all the replication defects observed in p21-depleted cells were eliminated when Pol κ was depleted, and were also complemented by a p21 mutant with an intact PCNA binding domain and a disrupted CDK binding site. Collectively, our data demonstrate that, although expressed at low levels in S phase, p21 fine-tunes the dynamics of DNA replication by regulating Pol κ loading to replisomes. Therefore, while the CDKs/p21 interaction is crucial to the cellular response to DNA damage, the PCNA/p21 interaction prevents the accumulation of DNA-damage independent genomic instability in unstressed cycling cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>p21 localizes to replication factories in cycling cells</title><p>The limited amounts of p21 in cycling cells allow CDK-dependent cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kreis et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, p21 levels in cycling cells are not null and can be detected on EdU positive cells with p21 specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) as reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coleman et al., 2015</xref>). Remarkably, while p21 levels are at the lowest in S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), they are sufficient to impair TLS-dependent DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mansilla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Soria and Gottifredi, 2010</xref>) if not degraded after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Notably, the function of p21 during unperturbed cell cycle progression remained unknown. A hint of such function was revealed by a Proximity ligation assay (PLA) which revealed a chromatin bound PCNA/p21 interaction in cycling cells. Such complexes resisted a mild extraction with CSK buffer which removes proteins unbound to chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Consistent with our previous findings, the percentage of cells with PLA spots was reduced by UV irradiation and PLA spots were not detected upon p21 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). In agreement, endogenous p21 colocalized with PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>) and EdU-labelled replication factories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The colocalization of p21 and GFP-PCNA became more evident following removal of proteins unbound to chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We next evaluated the requirement of the p21 PIR region for p21-PCNA colocalization. To this end, we transfected cells with either p21 or p21<sup>PIPMut*</sup>, bearing an intact or a disrupted PIR, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mansilla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Soria et al., 2008</xref>). The disruption of the CDK-binding site by point mutations in both constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mansilla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Soria et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">2008</xref>), prevented the arrest outside S phase expected after p21 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). Similar to endogenous p21, overexpressed p21 localized to replication factories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). However, p21<sup>PIPMut* </sup>lost its ability to form foci at replication factories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>), did not colocalize with PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>) and showed reduced chromatin retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D and E</xref>). Hence, the PIR of p21 is required for the localization of p21 to replication factories in cycling cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18020.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The PCNA interacting region of p21 facilitates the recruitment of p21 to replication factories in cycling cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of p21 in EdU positive and negative cells (left panel) and from U2OS cells transfected with control siRNA (siLuc) or sip21 (right panel).

To test this hypothesis, we used p21-depleted U2OS osteosarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The number of cells positive for EdU and with PCNA bound to chromatin increased after p21 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). An enrichment in PCNA focal distribution corresponding to mid-to-late S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Essers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rey et al., 2009</xref>), was found in p21-depleted samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) which suggested a defect intrinsic to S phase and independent from the G1/S transition.</p><p>Therefore, we evaluated DNA replication parameters specific to S phase in p21-depleted U2OS cells by means of the DNA spreading technology. Nascent DNA was labelled with a 10-min pulse of CldU (Chlorodeoxyuridine), followed by a 30-min pulse of IdU (Iododeoxyuridine). After denaturalization, stretching and labelling with specific antibodies, DNA track lengths were quantified. Surprisingly, p21 loss resulted in a reduced track length suggesting that p21 is required for a proper elongation of the replication forks (representative tracks and fields are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). These findings were confirmed in an additional cellular model, the HCT116 p21 null cells which were compared with the HCT116 p21+/+ counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Such findings were unexpected from the perspective of the prevalent notion of p21 as a negative regulator of the cell cycle. Since defective fork elongation is generally coupled with increased origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blow et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pillaire et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Techer et al., 2016</xref>), we measured the origin frequency as we did in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Vallerga et al., 2015</xref>) [number of red-green-red tracks + red tracks only/total fibers] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Results indicated that p21 depletion upregulated origin firing in the absence of stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Thus endogenous p21 is required for the optimal execution of the DNA replication program during unperturbed S phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>p21 low levels in cycling cells prevent replication stress in the absence of DNA damage</title><p>On the basis of the contribution of p21 to unperturbed DNA replication, we tested the effect of p21 depletion on the accumulation of markers of DNA replication stress.

Another marker of genomic instability that is highly sensitive to replication defects is the rearrangements of common fragile sites (CFS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Le Tallec et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Letessier et al., 2011</xref>).

Noteworthy, data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref> revealed that p21 depletion caused the accumulation of the FRA7H CFS instability to an extent similar to that caused by low doses of APH, a known inducer of CFS instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergoglio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sutherland et al., 1985</xref>). It follows that the depletion of p21 jeopardizes the duplication of hard-to-replicate genomic regions triggering replication-associated genomic instability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>p21 prevents the aberrant use of the alternative DNA polymerase κ during the replication of undamaged DNA</title><p>Besides p21, novel negative regulators of alt DNA pols have been recently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertolin et al., 2015</xref>). One of them, USP1, has the ability to remove the ubiquitin moiety from PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Niimi et al., 2008</xref>). Mono-ubiquitinated PCNA interacts with the UBM and UBZ domains of alternative DNA pols favouring their loading to the replisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bienko et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kannouche and Lehmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Plosky et al., 2006</xref>). During unperturbed replication, PCNA ubiquitination is limited by USP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Niimi et al., 2008</xref>), as evidenced by increased PCNA ubiquitination upon USP1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). In constrast, the level of PCNA ubiquitination was not modified when p21 was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Hence, p21 and USP1 regulate the recruitment of alt pols by distinct mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Intriguingly, despite such mechanistic differences, both p21 and USP1 depletion caused a similar effect (both in quality and extent) on nascent DNA elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), origin frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), the accumulation of cells with 53BP1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) and the number of binucleated cells with MN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). These results reinforce the function of p21 as a negative regulator of alt DNA pols. Moreover, mechanistically distinct regulators of alt DNA pols are equally required to preserve DNA replication and genomic stability during unperturbed replication.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18020.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mechanistically distinct regulators of alt DNA pols are required to facilitate unperturbed DNA replication.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) W.B. analysis revealing PCNA, ubi-PCNA and p21 levels in U2OS cells transfected with the indicated siRNAs.

Huang and colleagues have previously reported that MN accumulation induced by USP1 depletion depends on Pol κ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jones et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we set to explore the effect of p21 on Pol κ recruitment to DNA replication factories. First, we observed that Pol κ foci were formed only in a modest percentage of control cycling cells (siLuc in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). However, when p21 was depleted, the percentage of cells with Pol κ foci raised significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). Second, the interaction of PCNA and GFP-Pol κ in the chromatin fraction increased when p21 was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Third, using PLA an increase in the number of endogenous PCNA/Pol κ interacting foci was revealed in p21-depleted samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>). We hypothesized that an increased recruitment of Pol κ to the replication forks in p21-depleted cell may slow down DNA elongation, triggering fork collapse and/or the generation of under-replicated DNA. To test this hypothesis, Pol κ was down-regulated in p21-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and different DNA replication parameters were tested. Forty eight hours after siRNA transfection, Pol κ depletion alone had no effect on most parameters, except from a modest increase in RPA foci formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Such result may be in agreement with the role of Pol κ in the replication of non-B DNA regions such as G4 cuadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Betous et al., 2009</xref>). Notably however, the simultaneous elimination of Pol κ and p21 prevented all the phenotypes associated with p21 depletion. Specifically, Pol κ depletion rescued the defective nascent DNA elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), the origin frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), the percentage of EdU positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and the increased number of cells with chromatin bound-PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Similarly, markers of replication stress such as RPA foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), γH2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and 53BP1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) were downregulated after simultaneous depletion of p21 and Pol κ. Similar results were obtained when using a second siRNA specific for Pol κ in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>) and when employing a different cell line, HCT116 p21 −/− cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E–F</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18020.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The recruitment of pol κ to replication-associated structures increases in the absence of p21.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) U2OS cells were transfected with GFP-polκ.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>, transfection of p21 siRNA efficiently depleted p21 from both cell types. p21 elimination caused a reduction in the elongation of nascent DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–C</xref>), which was accompanied with an increase in origin firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>).

The results presented herein conclusively show that p21 is more often a positive rather than a negative regulator of the cell cycle, as its contribution is required at every S phase. Remarkably, such contribution relies exclusively on the p21/PCNA interaction.</p><p>Previous work indicates that p21 can displace alt DNA pols from replicating DNA. First, Z. Livneh and colleagues showed that p21 impairs TLS events on transfected plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avkin et al., 2006</xref>). Second, lower levels of p21 in cycling cells must be eliminated to promote nascent DNA elongation across UV damage templates by alt DNA pols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mansilla et al., 2013</xref>). Third, endogenous p21 delays the recruitment of alt DNA pols to UV-damaged replication factories in a manner that correlates with the extent of p21 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mansilla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Soria et al., 2008</xref>). Fourth, the PCNA-binding domain of p21 is required to inhibit TLS activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avkin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mansilla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Soria et al., 2008</xref>). It follows that alt DNA pols might be selectively sensitive to p21 levels which are insufficient to inhibit CDKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Soria and Gottifredi, 2010</xref>). Such a difference in the levels of p21 required to inhibit different cellular processes indicates that p21 is locally concentrated at, and/or has very high affinity for PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Soria and Gottifredi, 2010</xref>). Both replicative and alt DNA pols bind the IDCL of PCNA through PIR or PIP (PCNA interacting protein) regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertolin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moldovan et al., 2007</xref>). The PIR of p21 binds PCNA strongly, so that p21 is capable of disrupting the weaker interactions between PCNA and alt DNA pols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hishiki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mansilla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tsanov et al., 2014</xref>) without affecting replicative DNA pols which have multiple PIP domains(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Soria and Gottifredi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Soria et al., 2008</xref>). Such difference may relate to the fact that replicative DNA pols utilize multiple domains and different sites to interact with PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johansson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moldovan et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>There is a tight cross-regulation of PIP box-containing proteins at replication forks which is not yet completely understood. On the one hand, it has been demonstrated that proteins with strong PIP boxes such as p21 can remove alt pols such as Pol κ from replication factories (this report and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tsanov et al., 2014</xref>]). On the other hand, this and previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pillaire et al., 2007</xref>) suggest that the alt Pol κ can displace replicative pols from replisomes. Conversely however, p21-PCNA interaction in S phase does not impair genomic DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Soria et al., 2008</xref>) suggesting that p21 cannot displace replicative DNA pols from the replisome. Hence, some yet unknown factors/events need to be identified to understand the hierarchy of PCNA partners at forks. Moreover, variables such as the sequence of the DNA which is being replicated and the average retention time of a PCNA partner at different regions of the chromatin might have a role in such a puzzling cross-regulation among PCNA partners. We have shown that Pol κ is required for checkpoint activation at stalled forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Betous et al., 2013</xref>) and during the replication of repetitive sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hile et al., 2012</xref>) or naturally occurring non-B DNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Betous et al., 2009</xref>). In agreement, Pol κ depletion affected the CFS expression and RPA accumulation in our experimental settings. It is therefore possible that certain DNA regions may benefit from Pol κ-dependent DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Betous et al., 2009</xref>) while others it might require active displacement of Pol κ by p21. If that is the case, p21 may prevent Pol κ recruitment to specific regions of the genome while prompt p21 degradation by CLR4<sup>Cdt2</sup> might rapidly allow Pol κ binding to others. Such p21 function could be executed either by promoting the dissociation of Pol κ from replisomes or by preventing its recruitment to DNA regions that must be necessarily copied by replicative DNA pols (such as for example B-regions in the exonic DNA).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The complex regulation of Pol κ by p21</title><p>The PIR domain of p21 prevents the recruitment of Pol η, Pol ι, Pol κ and Rev1 to UV-damaged replication factories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertolin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mansilla et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, it is unlikely that during unperturbed replication p21 would act as a specific inhibitor of Pol κ. The same is valid for USP1 because the modulation of PCNA ubiquitination should regulate all alt DNA pols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang and D'Andrea, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jones et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, p21 and USP1 depletion may result in increased loading of all alt DNA pols to undamaged DNA. In fact, others have reported increased spontaneous mutation frequency in the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) locus of p21−/− cells, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McDonald et al., 1996</xref>). Such defects might depend on the unleashed activity of alt DNA pols other than Pol κ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang and Woodgate, 2007</xref>). Notwithstanding this, the phenotypes described herein are intimately associated with processive DNA synthesis events, and Pol κ is a very processive alt DNA pol (the most processive in the Y family) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ohashi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>). Because Polκ is less processive than replicative DNA pols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McCulloch and Kunkel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ohashi et al., 2000</xref>), the coupling of a replicative DNA pol and Pol κ at a single replisome may most likely generate asynchronic speed in both DNA strands. In turn, this may cause the transient accumulation of ssDNA in one strand (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In fact, low doses of APH, which are known to disrupt the DNA pol homeostasis during DNA replication, cause similar levels of CFS expression as p21 depletion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Hence, the local degradation of p21 by CLR4<sup>CDT2</sup> may maintain the most efficient DNA elongation speed by allowing the rapid and dynamic exchange of replicative DNA pols for Pol κ. In fact, a minor shift in the timing of CLR4<sup>CDT2</sup>-dependent p21 degradation is sufficient to accumulate cells in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coleman et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, the elimination of not only p21 but also USP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jones et al., 2012</xref>) increases the use of Pol κ during undamaged DNA replication, suggesting that the slightest modulation of Pol κ activity perturbs the DNA replication dynamics. In agreement, the expression of a Pol κ mutant with increased affinity for PCNA and the overexpression of Pol κ generate genomic instability and tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bavoux et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergoglio et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoffmann and Cazaux, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">O-Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jones et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The biological consequences of excessive genomic DNA synthesis by Pol κ</title><p>It is relevant to mention that the p21 knockout mice develop spontaneous tumors at 16 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martin-Caballero et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that modest but accumulative defects eventually trigger oncogenic transformation. Such observation highlights a role of p21 in the face of chronic, rather than acute stress and may correlate with the multiple defects in DNA replication revealed when depleting p21 from primary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). While p21 is a negative regulator of TLS, its role in undamaged DNA replication (revealed in this manuscript) is most possibly <italic>unrelated</italic> to TLS inhibition. In fact, if p21 depletion caused the accumulation of DNA lesions, the elimination of an alt polymerase should: (a) aggravate the defect (if the alt pol is essential to promote DNA replication across the replication barrier) or (b) not alter such defect (if the replication across such barrier is also achieved by another alt polymerase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertolin et al., 2015</xref>). As our data show that the elimination of Pol κ promotes DNA replication, it does not support a model in which p21 depletion generates substrates (DNA lesions) for alt pols. On the contrary, it suggests that undamaged DNA is being misused by the alternative polymerase pol κ as a replication template. Hence, the contribution of p21 to unperturbed-DNA replication is most probably related to the control of DNA synthesis events on undamaged templates. In such scenario, the colocalization of the p21-CLR4<sup>cdt2</sup> complex at replication forks may be crucial to control the composition of the active replisome, allowing the selection of the most adequate polymerase 'on the go'. Such dynamic regulation would favour the most effective DNA replication speed allowing the timely activation of late and hard-to-replicate genomic regions. The coupling of p21 with ongoing replisomes may also favor other p21 functions as homologous recombination (HR) events. While such p21 function has been linked to CDK inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mauro et al., 2012</xref>), it is still possible that the loading of p21 to PCNA serves to orchestrate multiple transactions at the elongating DNA. While more work is required to reveal yet hidden cross-regulations among members of the replisome, our work unveils a novel tumor suppressor function of p21 dependent on its ability to interact with PCNA. Such a role of p21 is central for genome maintenance in the absence of DNA damage at every S phase and which might be key to prevent spontaneous oncogenic events.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>All cell lines were received from reliable sources, either public repositories or directly, from the laboratory that generated them.

After pre-extraction and fixation, interaction between endogenous p21 and PCNA was detected following manufacturer’s instructions Duolink In Situ – Fluorescence (SIGMA). Briefly PLA’s principle is based on detecting proteins in close proximity (30–40 nm) by using different species of primary antibodies. A pair of oligonucleotide (PLA probes) detect the primary antibodies bound the proteins of interest and generates a signal only when the two PLA probes have bound in close proximity, meaning that the samples are localized in close proximity. The signal from each detected pair of PLA probes is visualized as an individual fluorescent spot. These PLA signals can be quantified (counted) and assigned to a specific subcellular location based on microscopic images. Images were obtained with a Zeiss Axioplan confocal microscope and PLA spots were counted using Image J software, cells were counted as positive when more than 3 PLA spots were detected. When analyzing pol κ/PCNA interaction a pol κ 'home made' monoclonal antibody from mice purified by Biotem (clone n°16A7-3A11) and PCNA rabbit polyclonal (Abcam ref ab18197) were used.

So I would like to recommend publication in <italic>eLife</italic> but feel that there are still some additional experiments that need to be done that will make the story more compelling. The key new concept here is that p21 has a basal function in non-stressed cells by interfering with a trans-lesion DNA polymerase κ. In the main system used, an established cell line, the data for a basal activity seems compelling. However, it is essential to show that similar phenotypes for the PIP mutant of PCNA are detected in primary cells or in any convincing way that would eliminate the suggestion that this role for p21 in fact arises because of the initial stress and adaption to cell culture. Technically the authors should also provide more data to show that their siRNA knock-downs are specific or use better still use a knock out PCNA strain (by CRISPR/CAS) with a replacement of the gene with a mutant p21.</p><p>Following up on the possibility of selection or adaption for the phenotype, it might be worthwhile for the authors to suggest or discuss how having an alternative polymerase working excessively at forks (without p21) might lead to more ori firing and shorter replication tracks in the first place. Clearly, and just one proposal would be that the &quot;alt polymerase&quot; leads to mistakes and damage stressing the daughter cells with replication pausing which in turn evolves to the need for more ori firing. But is that consistent with what we know about the effects of Pol Κ at the replisome? Might other polymerases be more effective in producing double strand breaks and stress? Or do the authors have a way to explain how it comes to be that more ori's are activated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Mansilla et al. describe a novel function of p21 in preventing genomic instability associated with DNA replication. The authors show that the WT p21, but not the PIP mutant p21 colocalizes with GFP-PCNA. They show that p21 depletion in U2OS and HCT116 cells results in shorter replication tracks without application of exogenous DNA damage and increased origin firing that presumably compensates for the shorter tracks. Cells with decreased levels of p21 also have increased genome instability. Many of the phenotypes were reversible by complementation with WT but not the PIP mutant of p21 or by concomitant depletion of Pol κ. This led the authors to propose that the low levels of p21 present in cells without any exogenous DNA damage and p53 induction are there to protect the PCNA from engaging Pol κ which would result in less processive replication and induction of genomic instability.</p><p>This is potentially an interesting set of observations. However, the study is largely done with one cell line, using one siRNA against p21 and Pol κ. Although complementation was performed with p21 cDNA, the key observations should be repeated in p21-/- MEFs or human primary p21-null cells. The most interesting aspect of the study is the rescue of the phenotypes of p21 depletion by Pol κ depletion, but in order for these to be convincing, additional data would be needed. The Pol κ depletion experiments were not done in HCT116 cells and even the efficiency of depletion of Pol Κ was shown only on the exogenously expressed GFP-tagged Pol κ. At least RT-PCR data for Pol κ should be included. In addition, it would be important to show that the levels of Pol κ are increased at the fork in cells lacking p21. This can be done using iPOND with and without p21 depletion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript presents evidence that the interaction of p21 with PCNA recruits p21 to replication factories, that in the absence of external DNA damage, deletion of p21 impairs normal replication and increases replication stress, that p21 prevents Pol κ (an &quot;alt&quot; or &quot;TLS: polymerase) from contributing to the replication of undamaged DNA, and that these effects depend on the PCNA interacting region domain of p21, but not its CDK-binding domain. These observations are consistent with the authors' hypothesis that p21 has a role in normal replication via an interaction with PCNA. This implies a novel role for p21. In my opinion, the manuscript is well written and should stimulate new studies, and I believe it is worth publishing.</p><p>That said, the results obtained here in U2OS and HCT116 cells lines have not yet been confirmed using primary cells, and the evidence for the role of pol κ as the major DNA polymerase involved does not yet exclude roles for several other &quot;alt&quot; polymerases not examined here. These two limitations should be acknowledged, and the language used to express the authors' main claims could be modified at several places (but three examples: Results: &quot;associated exclusively&quot;; &quot;Pol κ is the trigger&quot; – but what about others not examined here (e.g., ζ, ι, ν, θ); Discussion, &quot;Pol κ is the most processive&quot; – not so sure, e.g., what about ζ?)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18020.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] The reviewers all found the hypothesis that p21 has a basal role in unstressed cells at the replication fork to keep the Alt polymerases from functioning by direct interactions to be important, and the data showing that such a process is working in cells established for growth in cell culture to be compelling.

It is true that we have used only one siRNA for p21. However, we also obtained similar results in HCT116 cells in which p21 has been eliminated by homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, and thanks to the concerted reviewers´ request #2 (mentioned by the editor above), we also included experiments in which an infection with p21wt, but not a PIP defective p21, complements the replication defect of HCT116 p21-/- (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F-H</xref>). Hence, the specificity of the single p21 siRNA used is supported also by independent lines of evidences in the HCT116 cells.</p><p>We however believe that reviewer´s 1 concern should be addressed also for the pol κ siRNA. In this case we used a second siRNA for pol κ and observed similar results to those obtained with the first siRNA specific for pol κ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>). We also used the siRNA for pol κ in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6—figure supplement E–F</xref>).</p><p><italic>Following up on the possibility of selection or adaption for the phenotype, it might be worthwhile for the authors to suggest or discuss how having an alternative polymerase working excessively at forks (without p21) might lead to more ori firing and shorter replication tracks in the first place.

But is that consistent with what we know about the effects of Pol Κ at the replisome? Might other polymerases be more effective in producing double strand breaks and stress? Or do the authors have a way to explain how it comes to be that more ori's are activated.</italic> </p><p>While the tight association between increased origin firing and reduction in fiber length is well documented in many reports, it is yet unclear which of these two events precede and triggers the other replication defect (e.g. Anglana et al., &amp; Debatisse, Mol Cell 2003 and Pillaire et al. &amp; Hoffmann, Cell Cyle 2007). For example, in the case of Chk1 depletion, the mechanism may involve an initial dysregulation of origin firing which causes a depletion of dNTPs available for nascent DNA elongation (Petterman et al. &amp; Helleday, PNAS, 2010). In contrast, we postulate that the trigger for replication defects in cells depleted from p21 is not origin firing. We propose so because pol κ depletion fully complements the replication defects caused by p21 depletion. Given that the function of pol κ is tightly associated with the elongation of nascent DNA (and not with origin firing), we believe that in the case of this report it is more likely that the primary defect in p21 depleted samples is the slow elongation of nascent DNA at replication forks which then triggers increased origin firing as an attempt to finalize DNA replication of DNA regions which are being duplicated with a slow rate. In fact, we also speculate that such increased origin firing may prevent genomic instability to a certain extent. While the number of slow elongating fibers is frequent (they would not be detected by the stretching assay otherwise), the accumulation of genomic instability events is much less frequent (fold increase in micronuclei 2.1 in p21 depleted cells with respect to p21 positive cells – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and more evident in regions poor in origins as common fragile sites (fold increase of 3.13-see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Hence, we believe that in the particular scenario of p21 depletion, the increased origin firing may be compensating replication defects caused by slow nascent DNA elongation.</p><p>We also postulate that the shorter fibers are the consequence of a slower DNA synthesis by pol κ, which may be much less processive when compared to replicative polymerases. Our data does not support, as stated in the Discussion, that p21 downregulation causes accumulation of DNA damage. First, in p21 depleted samples, nascent DNA elongation is very steady (but slow) supporting a global change in DNA replication speed rather that the random collision of replication forks with DNA damage. Second, we did not detect phospho-Chk1 accumulation (not shown in the manuscript), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 1</xref>) which indicates no signs of global activation of DNA damage response. Last, and more important, the replication defect caused by p21 depletion is eliminated by pol κ depletion. If the defect was caused by DNA lesions, the elimination of an alt polymerase should: a) aggravate the defect (if the alt pol is essential to promote DNA replication across the replication barrier) or b) not alter such defect (if the replication across such barrier could be achieved by another alt polymerase). Hence, our data does not support a model in which p21 depletion generates substrates (DNA lesions) for alt pols. On the contrary, it suggests that undamaged DNA is being misused by the alternative polymerase pol κ as a replication template. This discussion has been incorporated in the manuscript (subsection “The biological consequences of excessive genomic DNA synthesis by Pol κ”).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18020.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>U2OS cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and 48hs.</title><p>Later, a western blot was performed to analyse DNA damage markers such as p-Chk1, and p-Kap1.

The authors show that the WT p21, but not the PIP mutant p21 colocalizes with GFP-PCNA. They show that p21 depletion in U2OS and HCT116 cells results in shorter replication tracks without application of exogenous DNA damage and increased origin firing that presumably compensates for the shorter tracks. Cells with decreased levels of p21 also have increased genome instability. Many of the phenotypes were reversible by complementation with WT but not the PIP mutant of p21 or by concomitant depletion of Pol κ. This led the authors to propose that the low levels of p21 present in cells without any exogenous DNA damage and p53 induction are there to protect the PCNA from engaging Pol κ which would result in less processive replication and induction of genomic instability.</italic> </p><p><italic>This is potentially an interesting set of observations. However, the study is largely done with one cell line, using one siRNA against p21 and Pol κ. Although complementation was performed with p21 cDNA, the key observations should be repeated in p21-/- MEFs or human primary p21-null cells.</italic></p><p>Reviewer 2 is right and his/her request is in agreement with the rest of the reviewers and the editor. As discussed above these experiments were performed in two primary human cells and are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><p><italic>The most interesting aspect of the study is the rescue of the phenotypes of p21 depletion by Pol κ depletion, but in order for these to be convincing, additional data would be needed. The Pol κ depletion experiments were not done in HCT116 cells and even the efficiency of depletion of Pol Κ was shown only on the exogenously expressed GFP-tagged Pol κ. At least RT-PCR data for Pol κ should be included.</italic> </p><p>In the current version of our manuscript we have included an RT-PCR analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B and E</xref>). Also, we included the requested data in HCT116 cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E-F</xref>).</p><p><italic>In addition, it would be important to show that the levels of Pol κ are increased at the fork in cells lacking p21. This can be done using iPOND with and without p21 depletion.</italic> </p><p>We believe that this point of reviewer 2 is important. Hence we used two experimental approaches to answer this question. First, we evaluated the interaction of PCNA and GFP-pol κ in the chromatin fraction and found increased interaction of pol κ and PCNA in the absence of p21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Second, we evaluated the interaction of endogenous pol κ and PCNA in proximity ligation assays finding an increase in the number of PCNA/pol κ interacting foci in the absence of p21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Such results are also supported by the increased focal organization of GFP-pol κ reported in the original version of the manuscript (current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-B</xref>). Together, these results support that, in cells with reduced levels of p21, there is an increase in the interaction of PCNA and pol κ in localizations which were previously associated with replication factories.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>This manuscript presents evidence that the interaction of p21 with PCNA recruits p21 to replication factories, that in the absence of external DNA damage, deletion of p21 impairs normal replication and increases replication stress, that p21 prevents Pol κ (an &quot;alt&quot; or &quot;TLS: polymerase) from contributing to the replication of undamaged DNA, and that these effects depend on the PCNA interacting region domain of p21, but not its CDK-binding domain. These observations are consistent with the authors' hypothesis that p21 has a role in normal replication via an interaction with PCNA. This implies a novel role for p21. In my opinion, the manuscript is well written and should stimulate new studies, and I believe it is worth publishing.</italic> </p><p><italic>That said, the results obtained here in U2OS and HCT116 cells lines have not yet been confirmed using primary cells.</italic></p><p>As discussed before this particular point has been raised by the three reviewers and has been addressed using two primary cell lines: human foreskin fibroblast and mesenchymal cells from the umbilical cord (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p><italic>And the evidence for the role of pol κ as the major DNA polymerase involved does not yet exclude roles for several other &quot;alt&quot; polymerases not examined here. These two limitations should be acknowledged.</italic></p><p>Our point was that the replication stress and genomic instability outputs evaluated in this manuscript were all reverted (surprisingly) by the depletion of one single DNA polymerase, pol κ. We believe that it is possible that other replication associated defects caused by p21 depletion (not explored in this study) could depend on another alternative polymerase. In fact, when using methanol/acetone extraction to reveal alterative pols associated with replication factories (Kannouche et al., Genes &amp; Dev. 2001), we detected increased focal organization of pol κ, η, ι but not in Rev1 (see below). The difference between Rev1 and the other pols may depend on the lack of PIP box in Rev1 (Waters et al&amp; Walker G. Microbiol Mol Biol Rev, 2009). Notably, pol κ is the alt pol with the lowest recruitment to replication factories in control cells (grey bars), and the one with highest fold induction after p21 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 2</xref>). In any case as suggested by reviewer 3, it is possible that the dysregulated use of pol η, pol ι and others specialized polymerases could also contribute to the replication defects caused by p21 depletion. Our conclusions are limited to the phenotypes (DNA replication, DNA stress markers, micronuclei and CFS instability) used in this study. Such limitations were carefully stated in the Discussion of our manuscript (see subsection “The complex regulation of Pol κ by p21”).<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18020.022</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) U2OS cells were transfected with the indicated GFP-pols in siLuc and sip21 depleted cells.
