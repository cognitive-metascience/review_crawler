There are long-standing debates over whether alleles are common or rare, loci few or many, effects small or large, interactions additive or epistatic, and so on—questions of practical importance for agriculture and human health, and of fundamental importance for evolutionary biology. Lately, the discourse has been heavily influenced by the mass of human genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which have generally revealed a highly polygenic basis for complex traits, with numerous causative polymorphisms of small effect distributed across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Visscher et al., 2012</xref>). However, the relevance of these studies for understanding adaptive variation is not clear, as they have almost exclusively involved traits likely to have been under stabilizing or purifying selection. Indeed, among the few GWAS of adaptive variation that have been carried out, some have identified common alleles of major effect (including for human traits such as pigmentation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atwell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beleza et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here we consider seed dormancy, a complex life history trait that plays a major role in local adaptation for many plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Finch-Savage and Leubner-Metzger, 2006</xref>). For a weedy annual like <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, the subject of our study, germinating at the right time is crucial for early survival, and also influences other life history traits, such as flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Postma and Ågren, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Donohue et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Springthorpe and Penfield, 2015</xref>). Seed dormancy varies geographically, with high dormancy being associated with long, dry summers, and low dormancy being more prevalent where summers are short and wet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Debieu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kronholm et al., 2012</xref>). Analysis of a diallel cross between a highly dormant line from the Cape Verde Islands and a non-dormant line from Poland revealed several quantitative trait loci (QTL), one of which, <italic>DELAY OF GERMINATION1</italic> (<italic>DOG1</italic>), has been cloned and molecularly characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso-Blanco et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bentsink et al., 2006</xref>), although its function is poorly understood. It appears to be tightly regulated by a complex array of mechanisms that include alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, and a cis-acting antisense non-coding transcript (<italic>asDOG1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bentsink et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakabayashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cyrek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fedak et al., 2016</xref>), but, although <italic>DOG1</italic> mRNA and protein abundance generally correlate with seed dormancy, this relationship is not observed in all accessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bentsink et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakabayashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fedak et al., 2016</xref>). In these cases, epistatic interactions with the genetic background, or other mechanisms, such as the critical self-dimerization of the DOG1 protein, might come into play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakabayashi et al., 2015</xref>). The <italic>DOG1</italic> locus harbors a series of functionally distinct alleles segregating in wild populations, and exhibits a pattern of genetic differentiation suggestive of local adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kronholm et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, field experiments using a diallel cross between accessions from Sweden and Italy identified a major QTL associated with total fitness that spanned the <italic>DOG1</italic> region, and also demonstrated that genetic differences in seedling establishment—and most particularly in seed dormancy—are one of the main components of local adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Postma and Ågren, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Postma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2010a</xref>). Finally, extensive natural variation for seed dormancy is not unique to the <italic>DOG1</italic> locus and many other QTLs have been mapped in various populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso-Blanco et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bentsink et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amiguet-Vercher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xiang et al., 2016</xref>). The recent cloning of the <italic>DELAY OF GERMINATION18</italic> (<italic>DOG18</italic>)/<italic>IBO</italic> QTLs in two independent diallel crosses revealed the existence of numerous loss-of-function alleles—mainly caused by nonsense mutations and structural variants—at the <italic>REDUCED DORMANCY5</italic> (<italic>RDO5</italic>) locus in wild <italic>A. thaliana</italic> populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amiguet-Vercher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xiang et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To investigate the genetic basis for seed dormancy variation in a natural population, we carried out a GWAS using 161 lines from Sweden (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), where seeds are normally set in early summer and seedling establishment mostly occurs in fall. We focused on the germination rate of seeds after-ripened for 21 days (GR21), which showed dramatic variation with 46% of lines being dormant (GR21 &lt; 20%) and 35% being effectively non-dormant (GR21 &gt; 80%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We observed a strong correlation between GR21 and latitude (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.62) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), largely due to the fact that northern Swedish lines were mostly non-dormant whereas the majority of southern Swedish lines was dormant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and online: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://goo.gl/3HeqX5">https://goo.gl/3HeqX5</ext-link>).

The optimal model resulting from starting with SNP2 explained 57% of the variation and consisted of two markers in addition to SNP2: SNP3, also in the <italic>DOG1</italic> promoter; and SNP4, a rare allele [minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.018] in the first exon of <italic>DOG1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B and E</xref>). In contrast, the optimal model resulting from starting with SNP1 explained only 46% of the variation, and identified only one additional marker: SNP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A and D</xref>). Starting from SNP3, on the other hand, yielded the same model as starting from SNP2, and it is clear that the combined effect of SNP2 and SNP3 effectively eliminates the signal at SNP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–C and E–F</xref>), suggesting that it (and the small peak around it) is a synthetic association that serves as a proxy for SNP2 and SNP3 (or closely linked variants: SNP3 is in perfect LD with two other nearby SNPs that can explain the variation just as well; see Materials and methods). The rare SNP4, on the other hand, appears to be independent of the other SNPs. In line with these stepwise results, we found that SNP2 and SNP3 were the best pairwise predictors of the dormancy variation (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Taken together, these GWAS results strongly suggest that variants in the <italic>DOG1</italic> promoter region underlie dormancy variation in the Swedish population (but say nothing about the molecular mechanism, a fact to which we will return below).</p><p>To confirm the hypotheses generated by GWAS, we turned to transgenics and experimental crosses. Linkage analysis in six different F2 populations confirmed the importance of the <italic>DOG1</italic> region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Two of the crosses (TFÄ 07 x Stenk-3 and Eden-2 x ÖMö1-7) demonstrated that the dormant SNP2 allele does not require SNP1, as expected if the association observed at the latter is synthetic. However, due to the strong linkage disequilibrium between SNP3 and SNP1, no cross let us similarly demonstrate that the dormant SNP3 has an effect independently of SNP1. To overcome these limitations, we complemented the non-dormant <italic>dog1-2</italic> mutant with genomic fragments—promoter and gene—corresponding to different <italic>DOG1</italic> alleles. Lines transformed with predicted dormant alleles carrying either SNP2 or SNP3 (but not SNP1, which is not part of the transformed fragment) were significantly more dormant than those transformed with a predicted non-dormant allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). It is thus clear that <italic>DOG1</italic> alleles tagged by SNP2 and SNP3 are capable of producing a dormant phenotype independently of SNP1 (and other closely linked genes, like <italic>CIPK20</italic>). Finally, two additional F2 populations (TEDEN 03 x TÅL 07 and TAA 14 x TEDEN 03) supported the association between dormancy and SNP4, thus bringing the number of distinct dormant <italic>DOG1</italic> alleles to three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22502.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Functional validation and geographic distribution of <italic>DOG1</italic> alleles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Summary of QTL mapping for GR21 in six different F2 populations.

These SNPs may be causative, but we emphasize that SNP3 is in perfect LD with two other SNPs a few bp away that can explain the variation just as well (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>), and that there may also be structural variants not present in the data we used to carry out GWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, it is difficult to completely rule out that these SNPs are themselves tagging rare alleles, just like SNP1 is tagging them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Fully establishing causality would require extensive experiments using lines engineered to test all polymorphisms independently of each other, and would be almost impossible without techniques for <italic>in situ</italic> gene replacement given the variation in gene expression that results from transgene insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). It is also crucial to distinguish between causality in the genetic sense (the focus of this paper) and molecular mechanism: we emphasize that we do not know whether these SNPs affect dormancy by regulating <italic>DOG1</italic>, <italic>asDOG1</italic> or even <italic>CIPK20</italic>. Given the apparent complexity of <italic>DOG1</italic> regulation, elucidating the causative mechanism will be a non-trivial task. It should also be noted that further alleles that we do not have the power to detect, either because they are rare or have small effect, may exist. However, while it is impossible to exclude the possibility that there are alleles we did not detect, a variance-components analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>) estimated that 51% of the dormancy variation is due to genetic variation in the 4.8 kb surrounding <italic>DOG1</italic>, which suggests that most of the variation at <italic>DOG1</italic> has been accounted for by the identified haplotypes (see Materials and methods). The variation in dormancy between lines carrying the same <italic>DOG1</italic> haplotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) is probably due to variation at other loci (the existence of which is evident from GWAS and the F2 crosses, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and online: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://goo.gl/30EPt3">https://goo.gl/30EPt3</ext-link>). <italic>DOG18</italic>/<italic>RDO5</italic>/<italic>IBO</italic>, because of its recently characterized multiple natural alleles, was a good candidate to explain part of the remaining dormancy variation. However, no association was observed at this gene, presumably because the four distinct loss-of-function alleles (carried by Vår2-6, Löv-1, ÖMö2-1 and Hov3-2) segregating in our population appear to be singletons and thus cannot be detected using GWAS (and they do not segregate in our six F2 populations).</p><p>The geographic distribution of the four <italic>DOG1</italic> haplotypes mirrors the GR21 distribution strikingly well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref> and online: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://goo.gl/3HeqX5">https://goo.gl/3HeqX5</ext-link>). The majority of northern lines carry the non-dormant haplotype ND, with a small number carrying D4. Southern lines are much more diverse, with about half carrying ND, and the rest carrying either D2 or (much more rarely) D3.</p><p>To confirm that this striking variation is not an artifact of laboratory conditions, we performed field experiments in southern Sweden, utilizing two of our previous mapping populations: T880 (D2) x Grön 14 (ND) and Bar 1 (ND) x Ull2-5 (D3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Our goal was to track changes in <italic>DOG1</italic> haplotype frequency across time, from seed release to the end of the germination window. Because timing of germination partly depends on the interaction between genes and seed maturation environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Postma and Ågren, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donohue et al., 2005</xref>), we first grew a set of F2 individuals for each population in a common garden experiment, from germination to ripening. The progeny of these plants (F3 seeds) was then mixed and dispersed in experimental plots in early summer, using a two-block design for replication. We sampled all visible seedlings (destructive sampling) in September and November and also sampled soil shortly before winter in order to gain access to the live seeds present in newly-formed seed bank (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11-data">Supplementary file 3A</xref>).</p><p>The results were consistent across replicates, and demonstrated that the <italic>DOG1</italic> haplotypes can have a major effect on survival. For both populations, the frequency of the dormant haplotype increased over time (as expected given delayed germination), but the details varied greatly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11-data">Supplementary file 3B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). In the D2 x ND population, the frequency of D2 increased moderately between seed dispersal and September, and appeared to continue increasing throughout fall (it was slightly lower in the seed bank) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This is consistent with D2 delaying germination, and delayed germination increasing seedling survival. In contrast, the frequency of D3 in the ND x D3 population decreased dramatically between seed dispersal and September, but recovered rapidly by November, indicating a dramatic delay in germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, the D3 frequency in the seed bank was very high, demonstrating that this haplotype not only caused a delay in seed germination but also prevented seeds from germinating at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22502.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Changes in <italic>DOG1</italic> haplotype frequency in southern Sweden field experiments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>C</bold>) Frequencies in T880 (D2) x Grön 14 (ND), in which SNP2 segregates.

The implied selection strengths are enormous: the viability of homozygous non-dormant <italic>DOG1</italic> genotypes relative to homozygous dormant ones until winter was 50–60% depending on population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11-data">Supplementary file 3D</xref>). Of course there will be further mortality in the seed bank and not all established seedlings will survive and reproduce, but the results serve to illustrate that selection on <italic>DOG1</italic> could be very strong indeed, and lend credence to the notion that the observed distribution of dormancy and <italic>DOG1</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>) reflects local adaptation. Although our experiments have limitations and do not allow us to decompose total fitness, our results agree with those from previous studies, and it becomes very clear that germination timing is one of the main (if not the main) fitness components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Postma and Ågren, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2010a</xref>). To fully understand how selection acts will require multi-generational field experiments as selection pressures are likely to vary from year to year (and are unlikely to be at equilibrium, because of large-scale climate variations). Under the conditions of our experiment, D2 (the most common dormant haplotype) appears to have had a clear advantage over ND, whereas D3 may have been too dormant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, strong selection could also lead to adaptation on a very local scale. Generally speaking, deep dormancy may allow plants from the south to avoid periodic drought and high temperatures in summer, whereas northern populations may benefit from a shallower dormancy to cope with a short vegetative growth window. However, the fact that southern Sweden harbors large numbers of both dormant and non-dormant <italic>DOG1</italic> haplotypes demonstrates that variation for seed dormancy can be found at a very local scale, presumably due to microenvironmental variation, and the distribution of SNP4, which segregates in northern Sweden only, suggests that moderate levels of dormancy could also be beneficial at this latitude.</p><p>Finally, our results provide a dramatic illustration that the ‘holy grail’ of molecular ecology — finding ‘the genes that matter’—may sometimes actually be obtainable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mitchell-Olds, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rockman, 2012</xref>). That a single locus should explain most of the variation for a major life history trait is certainly surprising and arguably unprecedented. Of course we do not know how much of dormancy variation <italic>DOG1</italic> would explain under field conditions (and we certainly do not know how much of the variation for total fitness it would explain), but our data suggest that it is a major contributor. Although other loci also appeared to be under selection in our field experiments—as expected given that the F2 results show that other loci also contribute strongly to variation for dormancy—allele frequency changes at <italic>DOG1</italic> were among the strongest in both populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, GWAS in a global population also identifies <italic>DOG1</italic> as strongly associated with flowering time variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atwell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">1001 Genomes Consortium 2016</xref>), although it is not yet clear whether this association is real or spurious. If the latter, a likely explanation is that correlated selection pressures on two related life history traits—germination and flowering—has generated cross-trait genotype-phenotype correlations. If the former, <italic>DOG1</italic> emerges as an evolutionary ‘master switch’ for life history variation, perhaps similar in importance to the central flowering regulator <italic>FLC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed a recent study has demonstrated that <italic>DOG1</italic> may affect both dormancy and flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huo et al., 2016</xref>), and it is interesting to note that both genes appear to be regulated through similar mechanisms, with chromatin remodelling and antisense transcripts switching off sense transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swiezewski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Footitt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fedak et al., 2016</xref>). Perhaps such genes play general role in regulating and modulating environmentally dependent life history transitions?</p><p>In conclusion, the study of adaptive traits variation in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is starting to reveal a similar picture: multiple, often complex, alleles at a relatively small number of loci account for much of the variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poormohammad Kiani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Forsberg et al., 2015</xref>). The phenomenon is certainly not limited to <italic>A. thaliana</italic>—pigmentation often appears to behave similarly, for example, in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beleza et al., 2013</xref>) as well as <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rebeiz et al., 2009</xref>)—nor is it universal in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atwell et al., 2010</xref>). While it is straightforward to show that local adaptation may lead to such an architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yeaman and Whitlock, 2011</xref>), much more data—from a variety of organisms and phenotypes—are needed before we can draw general conclusions about when and why this happens.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>The Swedish accessions</title><p>All the inbred lines used in this study were collected from natural populations in Sweden. Climatic and environmental conditions show extensive variation across Sweden and these populations are likely to be locally adapted. Northern Sweden is characterized by long, cold winters, mild summers and rapidly declining temperatures and day length in fall. In the south, natural populations experience a wider range of conditions than in the north, but, in general, summer is longer, warmer and dryer, while winter is shorter.

For example, populations from the north are mainly located on eroded, south-facing rocky slopes, while the ones from the south occur in various types of habitats, such as meadows, agricultural fields, beaches and urban areas. Because of this environmental variation, the seasonal timing of key life history traits can differ between populations, although Swedish <italic>A. thaliana</italic> generally exhibit a winter annual life cycle. Flowering usually occurs one month later in the north (June) than in the south (May) whereas seedlings can usually be seen earlier in the north (August) than in the south (September–November) (personal observations).</p><p>All these features made the Swedish population highly suitable for studying the genetic basis of seed dormancy. The 161 lines that we used to carry out GWAS were recently sequenced and more than 4.5 millions SNPs were generated, allowing for high-resolution mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2013</xref>).

Temperature was then raised to 21°C (day) and 16°C (night) until seed harvest. Watering was individually monitored and stopped when about half of the siliques of a given plant had ripened. Seeds were harvested 10 days later. After-ripening was performed in the dark at 16°C with 30% relative humidity for 21 days. Seeds from the three biological replicates were pooled together to compensate for growth chamber heterogeneity. About 100 seeds per genotype were spread on wet filter paper in Petri dishes subsequently placed in moisture chambers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso-Blanco et al., 2003</xref>) that were located in a culture room set at 25°C with a long-day light regime.

It should be noted that the resolution of these climatic data is really too low to characterize accurately a small geographic area such as Sweden. Similarly to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hancock et al.

Our goal was to identify SNPs that, when combined, explained a substantial proportion of the GR21 variation. Because the GR21 phenotype has a bimodal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we assumed that variants potentially causing synthetic associations were mutually exclusive and would not cosegregate among the Swedish lines. From the SNP matrix used for GWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2013</xref>), we extracted 1805 SNPs that were located within the 50 kb associated region encompassing <italic>DOG1</italic>. To minimize the number of pairs to test, SNPs with a minor allele frequency lower than 5% were discarded. The remaining 1145 SNPs were paired (0 or 0 = 0, 1 or 0 = 1, 0 or 1 = 1, 1 or 1 = 1) to create pseudo SNPs (pSNPs) and the association between all 654,940 possible pSNPs and GR21 was tested with the GWA model used for the marginal analysis.

The first year was dedicated to the production of the seeds that were used the following year, which consisted in a selection experiment designed to assess the adaptive relevance of seed dormancy and <italic>DOG1</italic> genetic variation. We focused on two different mapping populations that were previously analysed under controlled conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We chose parents with contrasted origins, dormancy phenotypes and <italic>DOG1</italic> haplotypes. The first population (D2 x ND) was derived from the cross between T880 (southern Sweden, GR21 = 0%, haplotype D2, dormant allele at SNP2) and Grön 14 (northern Sweden, GR21 = 100%, haplotype ND, non-dormant allele at SNP2). The parents of the second population (ND x D3) were Bar 1 (northern Sweden, GR21 = 100%, haplotype ND, non-dormant allele at SNP3) and Ull2-5 (southern Sweden, GR21 = 0%, haplotype D3, dormant allele at SNP3).</p><p>Seed dormancy is heavily influenced by environmental conditions during seed maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Postma and Ågren, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donohue et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, it was necessary to use seeds produced in the field. For each population, we grew 248 F2 individuals in a common garden experiment at Ullstorp (56.066721, 13.944655), southern Sweden. Stratified seeds were sown on 6 × 11 planting trays filled with potting soil (‘Lantliv Plantjord’, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rolunda.se">www.rolunda.se</ext-link>) on 26th September 2013. Trays were watered and placed next to the planting site under a small greenhouse to maximise seed germination. Three weeks later, we transferred them into soil and extra seedlings were thinned out. Finally, trays were watered one last time to ensure a smooth transition between the greenhouse and the field. These plants grew under natural conditions during most of their life cycle and their progeny was therefore highly suitable to study seed dormancy. F3 seeds were harvested on 30th May 2014, which coincided with ripening in surrounding <italic>A. thaliana</italic> wild populations. Because some F2 individuals did not survive, we harvested seeds for 185 and 214 F3 families for D2 x ND and ND x D3 populations, respectively. After seed cleaning, we created pools of seeds by mixing together 5 (D2 x ND) and 4 (ND x D3) seeds from each F3 family. We prepared a total of eight pools per population, each of them consisting of 925 and 856 F3 seeds for D2 x ND and ND x D3, respectively.</p><p>The selection experiment was conducted at Rathckegården (55.905647, 14.260095), southern Sweden, about 30 km flying distance from the seed production site. This location had previously been used to perform common garden experiments involving several <italic>A. thaliana</italic> lines. Consequently, the already existing seed bank prevented us from dispersing seeds directly on natural soil. To circumvent this issue, we used a mixture of potting soil (‘Lantliv Plantjord’, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rolunda.se">www.rolunda.se</ext-link>) and fine sand (‘Sandlådsand’, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.weibulls.com">www.weibulls.com</ext-link>) to disperse the seeds on (ratio was 1 L of sand/10 L of soil). Two rectangular holes (220 × 100 × 5–10 cm) corresponding to both experimental blocks were dug next to each other. To avoid competition and contamination caused by other weeds growing in the vicinity of the experiment, we added a layer of landscape fabric at the bottom and on the sides of each block. This way, only gas and humidity exchanges were permitted between the ground and the artificial soil layer, excluding undesirable plant material from the experiment. Holes were then filled up with the soil mixture. Each experimental block was designed to accommodate eight 20 × 30 cm frames (four frames per population) Pools of seeds were dispersed homogeneously in their respective frames on 13th June 2014, less than 15 days after seed harvest.</p></sec><sec id="s3-12"><title>Seedlings and soil sampling</title><p>Germination usually occurs in a time window ranging from the beginning of September to mid November in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> populations from southern Sweden. Therefore, we harvested seedlings on 26th September 2014 (sampling point 1) and 25th November 2014 (sampling point 2) to cover the whole germination window. Because the number of seedlings was extremely low at both time points we decided to sample all visible seedlings (that were big enough to be seen, destructive sampling) instead of randomly harvesting a predefined number of plants. As a consequence, all seedlings collected in November had germinated later than those sampled in September. Additionally, a few seedlings found outside the frames—because of seed transportation—were also collected to partially compensate for the overall low number of samples.</p><p>We performed soil sampling on 26th November 2014 (sampling point 3). With the help of a little plastic scoop, we took 18 soil samples per frame, each sample covering approximately 1 of the frame surface. Therefore we covered 18 cm<sup>2</sup>, which was about 3% of the total surface of a frame (600 cm<sup>2</sup>). Soil samples were kept in paper envelopes placed in sealed freezing bags to make sure that soil did not dry during the transfer to Vienna. On 28th November 2014, soil samples were spread as a fine layer onto small plastic trays filled with potting soil and placed in a greenhouse under long-day conditions. The 16 trays (one for each experimental frame) were watered on regular basis and seedlings were harvested until no germinants were observed. At this point, watering was stopped and we let the trays dry out for about four weeks. After re-watering the trays, we noticed a new flush of germination that lasted for a few days. We then repeated the drought treatment two more times, until no more germination was observed. This treatment has presumably promoted the germination of most of the live seeds present in the soil samples. However, it is impossible to rule out the possibility that some live seeds did not germinate because of a too deep dormancy.</p><p>Overall, the number of samples collected at points 1, 2 and 3 was lower than expected (based on previous unpublished data).

The proportion of viable seeds was determined for each F3 family by measuring the germination rate of 50–100 stratified seeds (five days, 4°C, dark, 99% humidity) as described previously (See Materials and methods, GR21 estimation in Swedish accessions). Petri dishes used to determine viabilities were kept and seven-day-old seedlings as well as imbibed ungerminated seeds were pooled together to isolate DNA. These pools were genotyped by sequencing as described previously (See Materials and methods, Functional validation of <italic>DOG1</italic> alleles). This allowed us to reconstruct the genotype of the parental F2s and to determine the genome-wide genotype frequencies for both populations. We were then able to estimate the genotype and allele frequencies in the pools of dispersed F3 seeds, taking into account seed viability and assuming Mendelian inheritance between generations. These frequencies were used as a proxy for starting allele frequencies at dispersal (sampling point 0).</p><p>Intermediate genotype and allele frequencies were calculated using the genotype counts observed at each sampling point (1, 2, and 3). Ending frequencies were estimated by considering all the collected samples together (sampling points 1 + 2 + 3), as a pool, regardless of their original sampling point. It should be noted that we covered only 3% of the frames surface when soil sampling. Also, we noticed that some seeds had been transported outside the frames during the course of the experiment. Therefore, the contribution of soil samples to the ending frequencies had to be adjusted accordingly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11-data">Supplementary file 3A</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers appreciate your effort to verify the importance of a locus pinpointed through GWAS in the field. There are however a number of shortcomings in the paper that have to be addressed before it can be considered for publication. Please address the reviewers' concerns as outlined below, but pay particular attention to the following points:</p><p>1) Please embed your work in the wider context and acknowledge the prior work of others in the field more comprehensively. With regard to seed dormancy in local adaptation, it appears pertinent that the work of Postma et al. (also 2016, Ann. Bot.) and Kronholm et al. 2012 is discussed in more detail. Further, please expand your Introduction and Discussion of natural seed dormancy loci, notably with regard to <italic>DOG18/RDO5/IBO</italic>, for which extensive natural variation and QTL have been reported (Amiguet-Vercher et al., 2015, New Phyt; Xiang et al. 2016, Plant Phys).</p><p>2) With regard to the latter, please determine whether variation in <italic>DOG18/RDO5/IBO</italic> exists in your populations and if so, whether it could explain some of the variation.</p><p>3) One key issue: the dormancy assays that are presented for candidate genes in the mapping interval are somewhat obsolete, because the T-DNA lines that were tested are in the rather low dormant Col-0 background. Please provide a time course of germination with shorter after-ripening intervals to exclude that none of the other loci is responsible for the phenotype.</p><p>4) Another key issue: please demonstrate that there is indeed a correlation between dormancy and <italic>DOG1</italic> expression levels (or possibly with the expression level of particular alternative transcripts), and that the allelic <italic>DOG1</italic> variants you discovered influence these expression levels. You should also take into account the very recent work by Fedak et al., 2016, PNAS, with regard to <italic>DOG1</italic> antisense transcripts.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The case presented by Kerdaffrec et al. is very similar to that of Bentsink et al. 2006 reporting the cloning of the <italic>DOG1</italic> QTL. Both groups face the difficulty of identifying a gene (or several genes?) responsible to confer high dormancy in a genomic interval. It is worth therefore quickly reviewing the case of <italic>DOG1</italic>. Bentsink used the NILDOG17-1 line, which contains a Cvi introgression in Ler conferring a strong dormancy QTL. This Cvi introgression encompasses the same genomic interval identified by Kerdaffrec et al. Bentsink et al. mutagenized the NILDOG17-1 line with EMS to find mutants that are no longer dormant. The intrinsic assumption is that the NILDOG17-1 introgression confers high dormancy by virtue of the higher activity of a gene product. This is by no means guaranteed. It could be that one or several genes products in the NILDOG17-1 introgression have lower activity and this in turn is responsible for the higher NILDOG17-1 line dormancy. How will the EMS approach identify such gene(s)?</p><p>Instead, it seems more plausible that the EMS approach may generate mutations that lower NILDOG17-1 dormancy by disrupting the function of other dormancy genes unrelated to those truly responsible for the high dormancy conferred by NILDOG17-1. This point is illustrated by the fact that in their EMS screen Bentsink et al. reported mutations in ABA biosynthetic genes. These genes were discarded because the ABA biosynthetic genes were not in the NILDOG17-1 interval. Suppose anyway that these genes were located in the NILDOG17-1 interval. Would it necessarily mean that they are responsible for the higher dormancy conferred by the NILDOG17-1 introgression? Not necessarily.</p><p>It is therefore possible that, like ABA biosynthetic genes, <italic>DOG1</italic> is a gene regulating dormancy that happens to be in the NILDOG17-1 interval. Its disruption after the EMS mutagenesis would lower the dormancy of the NILDOG17-1 line without actually being the cause of the higher dormancy conferred by the non-mutagenized NILDOG17-1 line.</p><p>Besides this point I take the opportunity of this review to comment about what I perceive as peripheral problems concerning <italic>DOG1</italic>, which I think could also be relevant for this review. In Bentsink et al. the mutated NILDOG17-1 line was not complemented with the pBIB-<italic>DOG1</italic>-Cvi construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of Bentsink et al. 2006). Instead Bentsink et al. transformed Ler with pBIB-<italic>DOG1</italic>-Cvi. The resulting transgenic plants were more dormant but strictly speaking this experiment does not qualify as a complementation analysis. Furthermore, to my best knowledge mutations in <italic>DOG1</italic> were only reported in NILDOG17-1 (the original <italic>dog1</italic> mutation) and the Col ecotype. The Col ecotype is notoriously non-dormant so evaluating the function of a dormancy gene in a non-dormant ecotype is not ideal.</p><p>So far all the evidence supporting <italic>DOG1</italic> is regulating dormancy is rather circumstantial, mostly coming from transgenic plants expressing <italic>DOG1</italic>, which leads to higher dormancy. Whether this dormancy truly illustrates <italic>DOG1</italic>'s function in planta or whether it is a gain-of-function, neomorphic effect of <italic>DOG1</italic> expression remains to be determined. It would be highly informative to know for example whether mutating <italic>DOG1</italic> in a pure Cvi background (e.g. by CRISPR/CAS) does significantly lower dormancy. But even if this were the case it would still not show, as discussed above, that <italic>DOG1</italic> is the causative agent of the higher dormancy observed in NILDOG17-1.</p><p>With these preliminary comments, here is my review of the work by Kerdaffrec et al.</p><p>Kerdaffrec et al. perform a GWAS using 161 Arabidopsis inbred lines from Sweden. Authors focus on the trait of dormancy by measuring the germination percentage of seed populations after-ripened for 21 days (GR21).</p><p>GWAS for GR21 identified a single highly significant peak covering a 50kb interval in chromosome 5 containing <italic>DOG1</italic>, a known dormancy gene. None of the significantly associated SNPs were located within the coding sequence of <italic>DOG1</italic>. Authors could not exclude that genes in the interval other than <italic>DOG1</italic> are involved in dormancy. Thus, GR21 values of T-DNA insertion mutants for genes present in the 50kb associated region identified by GWAS were measured (MEE62, CIPK19, CIPK20). No dormancy phenotype was found.</p><p>Comment:</p><p>As discussed above, the interval might contain genes whose product activity is negatively or positively regulating dormancy. In the former case, the lower the activity conferred by the SNPs the higher the dormancy whereas in the latter case the higher the activity conferred by the SNPs the higher the dormancy. A T-DNA mutant in a negative and positive regulator of dormancy will increase and decrease dormancy, respectively. Therefore, a T-DNA mutant analysis must ensure that both cases can be found. Under the conditions used, Col-0 control seeds are no longer dormant after 21 days of after-ripening. This is illustrated by the fact that no difference in dormancy can be detected between <italic>dog1-2</italic> and Col.</p><p>With long after-ripening times only high dormancy phenotypes in the insertion lines can be potentially detected. Furthermore, there is even the risk of missing mild higher dormancy phenotypes.</p><p>Authors should shorten their after-ripening time in order to detect dormancy in the Col-0 control in order to see whether they can detect low or high dormancy in their insertion lines. Also, many other T-DNA insertions in other genes present in the interval should be tested.</p><p>Given the presence of <italic>DOG1</italic> in the interval authors propose that allelic heterogeneity at <italic>DOG1</italic> gives rise to synthetic or &quot;ghost&quot; associations. Authors note the presence of SNP2 in the promoter region of <italic>DOG1</italic>. Furthermore, authors reason that since <italic>DOG1</italic> expression strongly correlates with seed dormancy (Chiang et al. 2011; Nakabayashi et al. 2012), SNP2 could contribute to GR21 variation.</p><p>Comment:</p><p>One should exert caution about the claim that <italic>DOG1</italic> expression is strongly correlating with seed dormancy. Available literature shows that this correlation is sometimes observed (as in the case of Ler and Cvi, which was discussed in the original paper identifying <italic>DOG1</italic> (Bentsink et al. 2006) but also sometimes not observed. For example, in Figure 6 of Bentsink et al. one can see that <italic>DOG1</italic> expression in Col-0 (a notoriously non-dormant ecotype) is much higher than Ler and, critically, higher than that in Cvi (a notoriously dormant ecotype). Furthermore, the <italic>DOG1</italic> expression in Col-0 is comparable to that of NILDOG17-1 (the introgression line used in the paper to map <italic>DOG1</italic>). If I remember well, Bentsink et al. do not comment about this nor do they discuss whether the dormancy levels of the other ecotypes studied in Figure 6 correlate with <italic>DOG1</italic> expression levels.</p><p>Concerning the reference Chiang et al. 2011, authors establish a correlation in the expression of DOG1 among in Arabidopsis lines whose geographical distances and latitudes are much larger (southern Europe vs. northern Europe) than in this study. Unlike the present study, the Chiang et al. study also examines the particular case of the response of <italic>DOG1</italic> expression to changes in environmental factors, such as temperature, during seed development, which affect final seed dormancy levels.</p><p>The Chiang et al. study uses three Swedish lines, Lov-5 (Lv), Bil-7 (Bi) and Ull2-3 (Ul). Lv and Bi live in similar latitudes, which appear to be equivalent to those of the northern Swedish lines used by Kerdaffrec et al. The Ul line lives in a latitude equivalent to that of the southern Swedish lines used by Kerdaffrec et al. Nevertheless, these three lines belong to the northern group in Chiang et al. and they do not appear to report marked differences regarding DOG1 expression between these three accessions.</p><p>The Nakabayashi et al. study is mainly concerned with the Ler and Cvi ecotypes where a correlation between <italic>DOG1</italic> expression and dormancy levels takes place. However, in a more recent study Nakabayashi et al. take notice of the absence of correlation between DOG1 expression and dormancy levels in Col-0 (&quot;Surprisingly, a comparison of DOG1 transcript and dormancy levels in the low dormant accessions Ler and Col, and the dormant line NIL <italic>DOG1</italic> (which contains the Cvi allele of <italic>DOG1</italic>) showed that this correlation was absent in Col, which has relatively high <italic>DOG1</italic> transcript levels (Figure 5A and 5B)&quot;). Furthermore, in that study <italic>DOG1</italic> protein levels in Col, Ler and Cvi also correlate with <italic>DOG1</italic> mRNA levels. This clearly poses a challenge to the notion that <italic>DOG1</italic> expression and dormancy levels are correlated. This led Nakabayashi et al. to study <italic>DOG1</italic> protein self-binding ability, which could be associated with a change in its activity. Self-binding ability would vary according to the different <italic>DOG1</italic> isoforms produced by splicing variants of the <italic>DOG1</italic> gene (Nakabayashi et al. 2015). Finally, Nakabayashi et al. propose that <italic>DOG1</italic> self-binding ability can contribute to natural variation (Nakabayashi et al. 2015).</p><p>Because of the significant uncertainties regarding the link between <italic>DOG1</italic> expression and dormancy levels, authors must show that there is indeed a correlation between the GR21 values and the <italic>DOG1</italic> expression in the dormancy of the Swedish lines particularly those carrying SNP2 and SNP3.</p><p>After using different SNPs as starting points for a multi-locus GWAS, authors found that the optimal model with SNPS located in the promoter region of <italic>DOG1</italic> (SNP2 and SNP3) explains 57% of the variations in dormancy among the Swedish Arabidopsis inbred lines.</p><p>Comment:</p><p>This reviewer wonders about the contribution of the remaining SNPs. There are some SNPs in chromosomes 3 but also chromosome 4 nearly reaching the threshold of significance. Could they represent potential loci regulating dormancy?</p><p>Next authors use a transgenic approach to evaluate the contribution of the dormant alleles (SNP2 or SNP3) using the <italic>dog1-2</italic> mutant background. Transgenes containing SNP2 and SNP3 confer higher dormancy than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Comment:</p><p>In absence of quantification of <italic>DOG1</italic> mRNA levels, this approach is not really testing the hypothesis that SNP2 and SNP3 contribute to dormancy by virtue of their effect of <italic>DOG1</italic> gene expression.</p><p>As above, authors must show a correlation between <italic>DOG1</italic> mRNA levels and dormancy in the three transgenic lines of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript the authors use genome-wide association (GWA) mapping in a set of 161 accessions from Sweden to identify the genetic architecture underlying variation in seed dormancy in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. The reported GWA mapping results identify <italic>DOG1</italic> as a strong candidate locus accounting for 57% of the variation. This confirms the previous results that identify <italic>DOG1</italic> as the causal gene underlying a seed dormancy QTL in a diallelic synthetic population, correctly cited in this manuscript. Using 8 different diallelic synthetic F2 populations, and transgenic complementation, the authors go on to identify 4 <italic>DOG1</italic> haplotypes in this Swedish population (3 dormancy and 1 non-dormancy alleles). Interestingly, the distribution of these alleles on the landscape matches the distribution of the dormancy phenotype. The non-dormancy allele is mainly found in the northern plants where non-dormancy is prevalent. The 2 most prevalent dormancy alleles being found in the southern plants where dormancy is more common. This suggests that variation at <italic>DOG1</italic> is adaptive, and this supported previously published work, correctly cited in this manuscript. To obtain evidence that these various <italic>DOG1</italic> alleles are adaptive the authors performed a 1-year, single site common garden experiment in the field in Southern Sweden. At this site the authors evaluate the allele frequency of the non-dormant allele and the 2 most common dormancy alleles that are segregating in 2 diallelic synthetic F2 populations. By assessing the allele frequency at sowing in early spring and again in September, November and in the seed bank the authors reveal that the frequency of both <italic>DOG1</italic> dormancy alleles increases from sowing to seed back and that the frequency of the non-dormancy <italic>DOG1</italic> allele decreases. The authors conclude that this evidence 'lends credence to the notion that the observed distribution of dormancy and <italic>DOG1</italic> alleles reflects local adaptation'. I think this is a very reasonable statement. It is of cause a shame that the authors did not repeat this experiment over multiple years and also included a northern site where they could have tested the adaptive potential of the non-dormancy allele (early germination to avoid early killing frosts in the fall perhaps).</p><p>In conclusion, the authors make the statement 'the study of flowering and dormancy variation in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> are starting to reveal a similar picture: multiple, often complex, alleles at a relatively small number of loci account for much of the variation (Sasaki et al. 2015; Li et al. 2014)'. The authors could have also made a similar statement about variation in mineral uptake by plants (Chao et al., 2012; Forsberg et al., 2015).</p><p>Overall this is a nice GWAS which gets to the underlying alleles through a combination of association genetics, linkage genetics in F2 mapping populations and transgenic complementation. This in itself is not novel in the GWAS field. However, what makes this manuscript stand out for me is the field work component that starts to test in the field if the different alleles of <italic>DOG1</italic> are adaptive. These field experiments have limitations (only performed in 1 year and at one site) but I think these experiments still differentiate this work from the growing body of published GWAS, and as such raise the potential impact of this work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript provides interesting results on the genetic basis and fitness consequences of dormancy variation in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. A significant finding is that in Swedish material, one locus, <italic>DOG1</italic>, is highly important in governing variation in dormancy. Earlier authors have also shown that <italic>DOG1</italic> is likely important for local adaptation, but with different sampling and methods. Further, the authors have conducted field experiments to evaluate the fitness consequences of the variation, a valuable contribution. However, this part of the manuscript would benefit from clarification.</p><p>The genetics part provides interesting results. The complexities of mapping are nicely illustrated and resolved in this case study. Combining QTL mapping, association mapping, and transformations seems useful to characterize the effects of different haplotypes.</p><p>The data on correlations with climate variables do not seem so informative. With sampling heavily in the south and then in the north, with little in between, most variables are highly correlated with latitude. In fact, a more interesting question would be whether any climate variables can account for the considerable variation in GR21 in southern Sweden. For this reason, it would also be interesting to see on the map where the field experiment was located.</p><p>As mentioned, the field experiment is potentially very interesting. In the main text, the experiment is not sufficiently described. While the details should of course be in Materials and methods, it would be nice to have enough in the results to be able to follow the reasoning. For instance, the final sample sizes should be listed, and the origin of the materials, and the place of the field site should be on the map.</p><p>Also, it was not really clear what populations the allele frequencies that are shown were calculated for. Seeds were sown, they germinated, and were sampled in September and November and later. Reading details in Materials and methods shows that the allele frequencies are of seedlings available at the sampling date, and if I assume correctly, the seedlings were discarded after sampling. In this case, the allele frequencies are not for population data, but for germinating seeds. Any differences e.g. in post-germination survival are not included? So seeds that inherited for parents a late germinating haplotype also germinate later in the wild, and other fitness components were not studied. Now the non-dormant populations are all from the north – the poor success of the non-dormant seeds/seedlings could presumably be related to other linked loci in the F2 progenies. The delay of germination of the D2 and D3 haplotypes seemed pretty similar earlier (in the transformants). At least in some parts of southern Sweden nearly a third of the plants seem to be very early germinating, and the frequencies non-dormant haplotypes are very high. So, one could assume that in southern Sweden there are other important fitness components. If there is something I misunderstood, the writing could be clearer, if not, then it would be good to point out that only a part of the life cycle was studied and that there may be other fitness effects later. This part of the work could be much clarified. (Further, to demonstrate local adaptation, it would of course have been good to have another experiment in the north.)</p><p>Kronholm et al. (2012) did a thorough study on <italic>DOG1</italic> effects, in wider geographical area. It would seem that the present work could be more compared to those results. The key finding of multiple haplotypes was already presented. They also had extensive analysis of the phenotypic variation. Now the paper is just referenced a couple of times.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22502.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Overall, the reviewers appreciate your effort to verify the importance of a locus pinpointed through GWAS in the field. There are however a number of shortcomings in the paper that have to be addressed before it can be considered for publication. Please address the reviewers' concerns as outlined below, but pay particular attention to the following points:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Please embed your work in the wider context and acknowledge the prior work of others in the field more comprehensively. With regard to seed dormancy in local adaptation, it appears pertinent that the work of Postma et al. (also 2016, Ann. Bot.) and Kronholm et al. 2012 is discussed in more detail. Further, please expand your Introduction and Discussion of natural seed dormancy loci, notably with regard to DOG18/RDO5/IBO, for which extensive natural variation and QTL have been reported (Amiguet-Vercher et al., 2015, New Phyt; Xiang et al. 2016, Plant Phys).</italic> </p><p>We have expanded the Introduction to describe previous work better, and also added references throughout. We discuss the diverse mechanisms apparently at play in <italic>DOG1</italic> regulation and the existence of natural variation at other loci than <italic>DOG1</italic>. The work of Postma et al. 2016 is highlighted and discussed, and we emphasize the fact that allelic heterogeneity at the <italic>DOG1</italic> locus has already been extensively characterised by Kronholm et al. (2012).</p><p>However, because our manuscript aims at studying the genetic architecture of a complex trait rather than characterizing the molecular mechanisms involved, we keep the description of the molecular aspects of seed dormancy brief.</p><p><italic>2) With regard to the latter, please determine whether variation in DOG18/RDO5/IBO exists in your populations and if so, whether it could explain some of the variation.</italic> </p><p>Xiang et al. (2016) analysed genetic variation at the <italic>DOG18/RDO5/IBO</italic> locus in 855 accessions from the 1001 genomes project. They characterized 180 accessions from Sweden (161 of which form our GWAS panel) and predicted that 5 lines (Vår2-6, Hov3-2, Tny-04, Löv-1 and Omö2-1) carry private loss-of-function <italic>DOG18/RDO5/IBO</italic> alleles. We could not observe any association at this locus in our GWAS – as expected because the described loss-of-function alleles are singletons. Moreover, we did not find any QTLs overlapping the <italic>DOG18/RDO5/IBO</italic> locus in our linkage mapping analyses, which was again expected since none of the described alleles segregate in our six F2 populations. In conclusion, <italic>DOG18/RDO5/IBO</italic> alleles probably do not have a significant effect on dormancy in Sweden. This is now explicitly stated.</p><p><italic>3) One key issue: the dormancy assays that are presented for candidate genes in the mapping interval are somewhat obsolete, because the T-DNA lines that were tested are in the rather low dormant Col-0 background. Please provide a time course of germination with shorter after-ripening intervals to exclude that none of the other loci is responsible for the phenotype.</italic> </p><p>This is a very perceptive comment. We were aware of the problem and realized it might be a concern some time ago. For this reason, we have been performing the missing experiment over the course of the last several months. We measured the germination rate of the T-DNA lines after 0, 7 and 21 days of after-ripening. Interestingly, without after ripening, the <italic>cipk20</italic> mutant was less dormant than Col-0 but still more dormant than the <italic>dog1-2</italic> mutant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1</xref>). After 7 days, although <italic>cipk20</italic> had increased its germination rate, it remained more dormant than the other tested lines. Finally, no difference was observed after 21 days, as already reported in the submitted version of the manuscript. These results are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and mentioned in the text.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22502.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22502.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22502.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22502-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig></p><p>We have no idea what the mechanism behind these differences are. <italic>CIPK20</italic> may be directly involved in regulating dormancy, or it may simply be that the <italic>cipk20</italic> insertion affects <italic>DOG1</italic> regulation. Conversely, we cannot be sure that the SNPs we identify do not affect <italic>CIPK20</italic> (although if they do, the effect must be trans-acting, because of our transgenic results).</p><p>Crucially, none of this really affects our paper. Our transgenic complementation experiments unambiguously show that <italic>DOG1</italic> allelic variation explains part of the dormancy variation, and this fact strongly supports our GWAS results, which point towards a massive role for this allelic variation in explain the population variation for dormancy. We cannot – and do not – say anything about the molecular mechanisms by which this variation causes dormancy variation.</p><p>Elucidating these mechanisms is obviously very interesting, but is very much out of the scope of this paper. Indeed, as anyone who has followed the <italic>FLC</italic> story will know, it will likely require many years and many papers. We now explicitly state this in the paper.</p><p><italic>4) Another key issue: please demonstrate that there is indeed a correlation between dormancy and DOG1 expression levels (or possibly with the expression level of particular alternative transcripts), and that the allelic DOG1 variants you discovered influence these expression levels. You should also take into account the very recent work by Fedak et al., 2016, PNAS, with regard to DOG1 antisense transcripts.</italic> </p><p>As pointed out by the reviewers, the correlation between <italic>DOG1</italic> expression and seed dormancy is not always obvious and we have modified the manuscript accordingly. The only reason we mentioned this correlation is because it helped us clarify the GWAS results. We found that one of the associated SNPs (SNP2) was located in the promoter of <italic>DOG1</italic> and because <italic>DOG1</italic> expression can be a good predictor of dormancy, we reasoned that this SNP could contribute to dormancy variation. Later, the functional validation experiments confirmed that the allele tagged by SNP2 (and SNP3, also in the promoter) was indeed causative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It seems plausible that this causation does indeed somehow involve regulation of <italic>DOG1</italic> expression (and we now mention Fedak et al., 2016), but we make no such claims, and investigating this is beyond the scope of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The case presented by Kerdaffrec et al. is very similar to that of Bentsink et al. 2006 reporting the cloning of the DOG1 QTL. Both groups face the difficulty of identifying a gene (or several genes?) responsible to confer high dormancy in a genomic interval. It is worth therefore quickly reviewing the case of DOG1. Bentsink used the NILDOG17-1 line, which contains a Cvi introgression in Ler conferring a strong dormancy QTL. This Cvi introgression encompasses the same genomic interval identified by Kerdaffrec et al. Bentsink et al. mutagenized the NILDOG17-1 line with EMS to find mutants that are no longer dormant. The intrinsic assumption is that the NILDOG17-1 introgression confers high dormancy by virtue of the higher activity of a gene product. This is by no means guaranteed. It could be that one or several genes products in the NILDOG17-1 introgression have lower activity and this in turn is responsible for the higher NILDOG17-1 line dormancy. How will the EMS approach identify such gene(s)?</italic> </p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Comment:</italic> </p><p><italic>As discussed above, the interval might contain genes whose product activity is negatively or positively regulating dormancy. In the former case, the lower the activity conferred by the SNPs the higher the dormancy whereas in the latter case the higher the activity conferred by the SNPs the higher the dormancy. A T-DNA mutant in a negative and positive regulator of dormancy will increase and decrease dormancy, respectively. Therefore, a T-DNA mutant analysis must ensure that both cases can be found. Under the conditions used, Col-0 control seeds are no longer dormant after 21 days of after-ripening. This is illustrated by the fact that no difference in dormancy can be detected between dog1-2 and Col.</italic></p><p><italic>With long after-ripening times only high dormancy phenotypes in the insertion lines can be potentially detected. Furthermore, there is even the risk of missing mild higher dormancy phenotypes.</italic> </p><p><italic>Authors should shorten their after-ripening time in order to detect dormancy in the Col-0 control in order to see whether they can detect low or high dormancy in their insertion lines. Also, many other T-DNA insertions in other genes present in the interval should be tested.</italic> </p><p>We agree with this point. We have foreseen this potential issue and performed a much better experiment, the outcome of which is discussed above (as well as in the manuscript). Generally speaking, we do not think that strong conclusions can be drawn from t-DNA analysis, especially in the context of studying natural variation. Regarding our associated region, we note that Bentsink et al. (2006) have tested insertion lines for many of the genes present in the NILDOG17-1 Cvi introgression and only reported the effect of <italic>DOG1</italic>.</p><p><italic>Given the presence of DOG1 in the interval authors propose that allelic heterogeneity at DOG1 gives rise to synthetic or &quot;ghost&quot; associations. Authors note the presence of SNP2 in the promoter region of DOG1. Furthermore, authors reason that since DOG1 expression strongly correlates with seed dormancy (Chiang et al. 2011; Nakabayashi et al. 2012), SNP2 could contribute to GR21 variation.</italic> </p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Because of the significant uncertainties regarding the link between DOG1 expression and dormancy levels, authors must show that there is indeed a correlation between the GR21 values and the DOG1 expression in the dormancy of the Swedish lines particularly those carrying SNP2 and SNP3.</italic> </p><p>We respond to this comment above.</p><p><italic>After using different SNPs as starting points for a multi-locus GWAS, authors found that the optimal model with SNPS located in the promoter region of DOG1 (SNP2 and SNP3) explains 57% of the variations in dormancy among the Swedish Arabidopsis inbred lines.</italic> </p><p><italic>Comment:</italic> </p><p><italic>This reviewer wonders about the contribution of the remaining SNPs. There are some SNPs in chromosomes 3 but also chromosome 4 nearly reaching the threshold of significance. Could they represent potential loci regulating dormancy?</italic> </p><p>Three SNPs at the <italic>DOG1</italic> locus (SNP2-SNP4) explain about 57% of the variation. Most of the remaining 43% is likely due to other loci (the SNP-heritability is nearly 1), some of which could well be tagged by our non-significant association. Because we could not identify any obvious candidate genes in the vicinity of these, we chose to focus on the strong association at the <italic>DOG1</italic> locus only (the absence of any association at <italic>RDO5</italic> is now explicitly discussed). The results are freely browsable online for anyone interested in dormancy variation.</p><p><italic>Next authors use a transgenic approach to evaluate the contribution of the dormant alleles (SNP2 or SNP3) using the dog1-2 mutant background. Transgenes containing SNP2 and SNP3 confer higher dormancy than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</italic> </p><p><italic>Comment:</italic> </p><p><italic>In absence of quantification of DOG1 mRNA levels, this approach is not really testing the hypothesis that SNP2 and SNP3 contribute to dormancy by virtue of their effect of DOG1 gene expression.</italic> </p><p><italic>As above, authors must show a correlation between DOG1 mRNA levels and dormancy in the three transgenic lines of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</italic> </p><p>It is true that the transgenic approach does not test whether SNP2 and SNP3 regulate <italic>DOG1</italic> expression. However, as explained in the response to the main points above, this manuscript does not aim at testing this hypothesis. The transgenic experiment was solely designed to demonstrate that the distinct <italic>DOG1</italic> alleles tagged by SNP2 and SNP3 are functional without making any claims about the underlying mechanism.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>In this manuscript the authors use genome-wide association (GWA) mapping in a set of 161 accessions from Sweden to identify the genetic architecture underlying variation in seed dormancy in Arabidopsis thaliana. The reported GWA mapping results identify DOG1 as a strong candidate locus accounting for 57% of the variation. This confirms the previous results that identify DOG1 as the causal gene underlying a seed dormancy QTL in a diallelic synthetic population, correctly cited in this manuscript. Using 8 different diallelic synthetic F2 populations, and transgenic complementation, the authors go on to identify 4 DOG1 haplotypes in this Swedish population (3 dormancy and 1 non-dormancy alleles). Interestingly, the distribution of these alleles on the landscape matches the distribution of the dormancy phenotype. The non-dormancy allele is mainly found in the northern plants where non-dormancy is prevalent. The 2 most prevalent dormancy alleles being found in the southern plants where dormancy is more common. This suggests that variation at DOG1 is adaptive, and this supported previously published work, correctly cited in this manuscript. To obtain evidence that these various DOG1 alleles are adaptive the authors performed a 1-year, single site common garden experiment in the field in Southern Sweden. At this site the authors evaluate the allele frequency of the non-dormant allele and the 2 most common dormancy alleles that are segregating in 2 diallelic synthetic F2 populations. By assessing the allele frequency at sowing in early spring and again in September, November and in the seed bank the authors reveal that the frequency of both DOG1 dormancy alleles increases from sowing to seed back and that the frequency of the non-dormancy DOG1 allele decreases. The authors conclude that this evidence 'lends credence to the notion that the observed distribution of dormancy and DOG1 alleles reflects local adaptation'. I think this is a very reasonable statement. It is of cause a shame that the authors did not repeat this experiment over multiple years and also included a northern site where they could have tested the adaptive potential of the non-dormancy allele (early germination to avoid early killing frosts in the fall perhaps).</italic> </p><p>It is indeed pity that we could not perform a similar experiment in the north. It was originally planned, but cancelled for logistic reasons.</p><p><italic>In conclusion, the authors make the statement 'the study of flowering and dormancy variation in A. thaliana are starting to reveal a similar picture: multiple, often complex, alleles at a relatively small number of loci account for much of the variation (Sasaki et al. 2015; Li et al. 2014)'.

The resolution of the available climate data is not precise enough to characterize southern Sweden accurately. However, we also found that temperature is the best predictor of dormancy in southern Sweden. It could for example reflect the difference between urban / rural environments, as most of the lines sampled from densely inhabited locations are very dormant. However, because of the limited resolution, these observations should of course be taken with a grain of salt. The fact that we observe such an extensive dormancy variation in southern Sweden probably indicates that microenvironmental variation (soil properties, human or animal disturbance etc.) could play an important role. Unfortunately, we do not have good enough data to address this question.</p><p><italic>For this reason, it would also be interesting to see on the map where the field experiment was located.</italic> </p><p>We provide names and GPS coordinates of the field sites in the Methods section.
