vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane, followed by endocytosis and recycling of the membrane of synaptic vesicles. While many of the proteins governing these processes are known, their regulation is only beginning to be understood. Here we have applied quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify changes in phosphorylation status of presynaptic proteins in resting and stimulated nerve terminals isolated from the brains of Wistar rats. Using rigorous quantification, we identified 252 phosphosites that are either up- or downregulated upon triggering calcium-dependent exocytosis. Particularly pronounced were regulated changes of phosphosites within protein constituents of the presynaptic active zone, including bassoon, piccolo, and RIM1. Additionally, we have mapped kinases and phosphatases that are activated upon stimulation. Overall, our study provides a snapshot of phosphorylation changes associated with presynaptic activity and provides a foundation for further functional analysis of key phosphosites involved in presynaptic plasticity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14530.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14530.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14530.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human nervous system contains more than a hundred billion neurons that are connected with each other via junctions called synapses. When an electrical impulse travelling along a neuron arrives at a synapse, it triggers bubble-like packages called synaptic vesicles within the neuron to merge with the neuron’s surface membrane. The contents of these vesicles – chemical messengers called neurotransmitters – are then released into the synapse and carry the signal to the next neuron.</p><p>Complex molecular machines made from many different proteins control the release of neurotransmitters. Quite a few of these proteins are regulated by the addition of phosphate groups at specific sites. However, not all of the proteins involved in the release of neurotransmitters have been studied in detail and it is largely unclear how most of them are regulated.</p><p>Now, Kohansal-Nodehi et al. have used techniques involving mass spectrometry to find out which proteins have phosphate groups added or removed in neurons that are releasing neurotransmitters. The experiments used pinched-off synapses isolated from rat brains. These structures, referred to as “synaptosomes”, lend themselves to this kind of study because they can be induced to continuously release neurotransmitters for several minutes. Kohansal-Nodehi et al. identified over 250 specific sites on proteins in the synaptosomes where phosphate groups are attached, including many on the key proteins known to operate in neurotransmitter release. Moreover, some proteins were modified at multiple sites, especially the proteins that form a scaffold to capture synaptic vesicles close to the membrane and prepare them for release. The data also revealed important clues about the enzymes that either attach or remove the phosphate groups.</p><p>Together, these findings provide new insights into the regulatory networks that control many proteins at the same time. The next challenge is to sort out which of these modifications change the interactions between the proteins that control neurotransmitter release, and to understand how these changes influence the trafficking of synaptic vesicles.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14530.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14530.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>synaptosome</kwd><kwd>phosphoproteomics</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>active zone</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grant agreement number: 242167</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jahn</surname><given-names>Reinhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Molecular Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kohansal-Nodehi</surname><given-names>Mahdokht</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Global phosphoproteomic analysis in nerve terminal during exocytosis reveals 252 uniquely regulated phosphosites, highlighting complex regulation of active zone proteins at multiple sites and the role of specific kinases/phosphatases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In chemical synapses, neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles and released by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis upon stimulation. After exocytosis, the components of the synaptic vesicle membrane are retrieved, mainly by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and then used to regenerate synaptic vesicles for another round of exo-endocytotic recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sudhof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rizzoli, 2014</xref>).</p><p>During the past decades, the steps of the synaptic vesicle cycle have been studied in great detail. Before fusion, synaptic vesicles attach to specialized sites at the presynaptic plasma membrane (active zones), which is associated with activation (priming) of the exocytotic apparatus. Furthermore, functionally distinct pools of synaptic vesicles coexist in each nerve terminal, with only a small proportion of them participating in recycling under normal physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Denker et al., 2011</xref>). Major progress has also been made in our understanding of the underlying molecular events. Synaptic vesicles contain proteins mediating neurotransmitter uptake (vesicular neurotransmitter transporters and a vacuolar ATPase) as well as proteins involved in vesicle docking (Rab proteins), calcium sensing (synaptotagmins) and fusion (SNAREs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>). Active zones contain both scaffolding proteins such as piccolo, bassoon, liprins as well as proteins that mediate vesicle docking and priming (e.g. RIM and Munc13) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Südhof, 2012</xref>). Exocytotic fusion is executed by SNAREs, controlled by synaptotagmin, and regulated by additional proteins recruited from the cytoplasm such as Munc18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Toonen and Verhage, 2007</xref>) and complexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brose, 2008</xref>). Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis (CME) is mediated by a whole array of adaptor proteins, many of which containing curvature-sensing BAR and F-BAR domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McMahon and Boucrot, 2011</xref>) such as dynamin that is crucial for pinching off of coated pits. Actin dynamics plays a critical role in vesicle movement and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cingolani and Goda, 2008</xref>), and additional proteins are involved in other functions such as vesicle clustering synapsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cesca et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Much less is known about how the synaptic vesicle cycle is regulated. Chemical synapses display profound plasticity and adaptation, and they are known to rapidly respond to a multitude of signals by changing their release properties. A large body of evidence shows that many presynaptic proteins are reversibly phosphorylated, suggesting that protein phosphorylation plays a key role in output regulation. In fact, synapsin1 was the first presynaptic protein to be discovered because it undergoes rapid phosphorylation upon depolarization of the presynaptic nerve terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Ueda et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dolphin and Greengard, 1981</xref>). Additionally, the key protein in membrane fission, dynamin, is rapidly dephosphorylated by a calcium-dependent phosphatase (calcineurin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 1994</xref>). Dephosphorylation alters the affinity of dynamin for some of its binding partners involved in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Robinson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anggono et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clayton and Cousin, 2009</xref>). In addition to dynamin, several other proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, termed 'dephosphins' are dephosphorylated upon depolarization, in calcium-dependent manner, including the scaffold proteins amphiphysin1 and amphiphysin2, the PtdIns(4,5)P phosphatase synaptojanin, the adapter proteins epsin, eps15, and AP180 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cousin and Robinson, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Proteins mediating exocytosis also appear to be regulated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reactions. For example, phosphorylation of the SNARE SNAP-25 at Ser187 accelerates vesicle recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nagy et al., 2002</xref>), regulates formation of SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gao et al., 2016</xref>) and consequently promotes exocytosis in PC12 cells, and it is also induced by stress in affected brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yamamori et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, it was reported that phosphorylation of SNAP-25 at Thr138 interferes with assembly of SNARE complex and exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, phosphorylation of syntaxin1 at Ser14 and Ser188 regulates its interaction with Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rickman and Duncan, 2010</xref>). Dephosphorylation of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) at Tyr 83 and Thr645 was reported to promote secretory vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Huynh et al., 2004</xref>), probably by enhancing disassembly of SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belluzzi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Certain presynaptic proteins have multiple phosphorylation sites that can simultaneously undergo opposing changes in their phosphorylation states. Best characterized are the synapsins that are phosphorylated at multiple sites by several different kinases. For example, synapsin1 is phosphorylated at Ser9 by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI). It is also phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and CdK5 at both N and C termini (Ser62, Ser67, Ser549 and Ser551) and by CaMKII at its C terminus (Ser566 and 603) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cesca et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the tyrosine-kinase Src phosphorylates synapsin1 at Tyr301 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Onofri et al., 2007</xref>). Intriguingly, the functional consequences of synapsin phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at various phosphosites are different. While phosphorylation of Ser9, Ser566 and Ser603 upon stimulation decreases actin binding and increases exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, phosphorylation of Tyr301 has the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cesca et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, phosphorylation at Ser62, Ser67, Ser549 and Ser551 is downregulated upon stimulation of neurotransmitter release and decreases the binding of synapsin to actin filaments, leading to the suggestion that phosphorylation by Cdk5 at Ser549 and 551 defines the ratio between resting and recycling synaptic vesicle pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Verstegen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the past, synaptic phosphoproteins were mostly identified by <italic>in vitro</italic> assays using cell/tissue extracts or purified proteins. Based on this classical approach, we know that for example syntaxin1A, synaptobrevin (VAMP) and SNAP25 are phosphorylated by calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII); synaptobrevin and SNAP25 by protein kinase C (PKC), and synaptotagmin1 and syntaxin1A by casein kinase II (CK2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennett et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nielander et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hirling and Scheller, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shimazaki et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>While these classical approaches typically focus on individual proteins, modern screening methods have considerably enlarged the coverage of phosphoproteins. The introduction of chip arrays and synthetic peptides as substrates for kinases has allowed the mapping of consensus motifs for individual kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ptacek et al., 2005</xref>), which were later used to develop algorithms for predicting phosphosites <italic>in silico</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Linding et al., 2008</xref>). Commercially available kinase libraries combined with <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesis of peptides permit extended screening of predicted phosphorylation sites although it needs to be borne in mind that this method is prone to both false negatives and false positives. Most importantly, advanced mass spectrometry (MS) methodologies have completely changed the field as they permit the identification of phosphorylation sites in a robust, global and quantitative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huttlin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">de Graaf et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Giansanti et al., 2015</xref>). Over the last few years, progress in MS-based techniques for phosphopeptide identification and quantification has allowed global and in-depth analysis of thousands of phosphosites in a single analytical run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lemeer and Heck, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kelstrup et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ludwig et al., 2015</xref>). These novel techniques have triggered a rapid increase in studies dealing with global phosphoproteome maps of tissues and organs, resulting, for instance, in an atlas of mouse phosphorylations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huttlin et al., 2010</xref>) and quantitative maps of phosphorylations in rat organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lundby et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have dealt with global phosphoproteomics in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ballif et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Trinidad et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tweedie-Cullen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Palmisano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Goswami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Corradini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tagawa et al., 2015</xref>) or in isolated nerve terminals (synaptosomes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Munton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Collins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Filiou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Trinidad et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, we still do not have a systematic overview of phosphorylation changes in the presynaptic terminal that are associated with the triggering of neurotransmitter release.</p><p>To close this gap, we have investigated changes in the presynaptic phosphoproteome during stimulation of exocytosis by taking advantage of synaptosomes that constitute pinched off and resealed nerve terminals enriched from brain homogenate. Synaptosomes retain the ability to synthesize ATP, maintain the resting potential and respond to depolarization with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis of synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nicholls, 2003</xref>). Synaptosomes respond not only to external signals but also to activators and inhibitors of various steps of the synaptic vesicle cycle such as clostridial neurotoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blasi et al., 1994</xref>), black widow spider venom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nicholls et al., 1982</xref>), or dynamin inhibitors such as dynasore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Daniel et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, synaptosomes were used to monitor stimulation-dependent changes in the phosphorylation of individual proteins such as synapsin and dynamin. Here we have used synaptosomes as a tool for the study of the presynaptic phosphoproteome. We observed many hitherto unknown changes in the phosphorylation pattern of, in particular, active zone proteins that exhibit concurrent changes in phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at multiple locations/positions. Our results show that protein phosphorylation plays an even more important role than previously anticipated and appears to be critically involved in regulating active zone function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phosphoproteomics of isolated nerve terminals under different stimulation conditions</title><p>For the analysis of the presynaptic phosphoproteome, we prepared isolated nerve terminals (synaptosomes) from brain cortices of 5–6 weeks old rats using standard subcellular fractionation procedures (see Materials and methods). To examine whether the synaptosomes are responsive to stimulation, we performed two independent quality checks. First, we measured glutamate release upon depolarization by increasing the external potassium concentration. While this treatment clamp-depolarizes the membrane, calcium-overload is prevented by inactivation of the calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Simms and Zamponi, 2014</xref>).</p><p>As expected, addition of KCl led to a fast increase in glutamate release that persisted for several minutes after depolarization and that was reduced in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It has been shown that the difference between glutamate release in the presence and absence of calcium represents exocytotic release whereas the increase upon depolarization in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is due to non-exocytotic release caused by the reversal of glutamate transporters in the plasma membrane that depend on the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nicholls and Sirha, 1986</xref>). Second, we monitored the phosphorylation status of two well-characterized phosphosites in the nerve terminal, synapsin1 (Ser603) and dynamin1 (Ser774), using phosphospecific antibodies. These two sites are known to be regulated antagonistically by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx, with synapsin being phosphorylated and dynamin being dephosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jovanovic et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Graham et al., 2007</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, both sites changed their phosphorylation status as expected, confirming that the synaptosomes are functional. Both tests for glutamate release and alteration of marker phosphorylation sites were carried out for all preparations before mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis.</p><p>For phosphoproteomic analysis, we compared three different incubation conditions of synaptosomes: (i) depolarization with (K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>) or (ii) without calcium (K<sup>+</sup>, EGTA), and (iii) control (no depolarization, EGTA). Stimulation of all samples were stopped after 2 min by the addition of ice-cold lysis buffer and processed as described in Materials and methods. While rapid and reversible phosphorylation changes may not be detectable anymore at this time point, both exo- and endocytosis are at an activated steady-state level. Equal amounts of protein were digested by trypsin. For quantification, we used stable isotope dimethyl labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boersema et al., 2009</xref>). To elucidate the changes in phosphorylation status of phosphosites, we compared the phosphoproteome of depolarized synaptosomes in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> against depolarized synaptosomes in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and synaptosomes that were not depolarized. In each set of comparisons, one of the incubation conditions was labeled as heavy and the other one as light. The differentially labeled peptides from two conditions were then mixed, and fractionated by strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography. This step was introduced since it reduced sample complexity and resulted in higher recovery rates of phosphopeptides (data not shown). In the next step, each fraction obtained from the SCX-column was separately enriched for phosphopeptides, and analyzed by MS (see Materials and methods for details and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for an overview of the workflow). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref> shows exemplary MS spectra obtained for phosphopeptides of synapsin (Ser603) and dynamin (S774) after mixing heavy and light labeled samples, and the corresponding MS/MS spectra used for sequence determination.</p><p>In parallel, we determined the entire proteome of synaptosomes (three biological replicates) using standard procedures (see Materials and methods for details). We identified 4961 proteins (for list of identified proteins see Supplementary file 1, available at Dryad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kohansal-Nodehi et al., 2016</xref>]) in the proteome and 1257 phosphoproteins in the phosphoproteome. We compared the biological functions enriched in our proteome and phosphoproteome datasets using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com">http://www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>). The analysis revealed that most of the functions related to neurotransmission and synaptic vesicle recycling are enriched in both proteomes, with a higher enrichment being observed in the phosphoproteome compared to the proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Note that due to redundancies and multiple overlaps in the functional categories, this type of analysis constitutes only a rough estimate. However, it documents that even though synaptosomes are contaminated with many other organelles and post synaptic density proteins, the phosphorylation events occur predominantly, and perhaps exclusively, inside the presynaptic nerve terminal under our experimental conditions.</p><p>To quantify changes of phosphorylation sites under different incubation conditions, we performed pairwise comparisons of the phosphoproteome in the respective synaptosome samples. All data are based on three biological replicates. Phosphosites that were quantified in at least two out of three replicates were filtered and subjected to downstream data analysis to determine whether they are differentially (up or down) regulated (see Materials and methods). Due to the rigorous selection criteria, the coverage of phosphosites that were reliably quantified in the depolarization with Ca<sup>2+</sup> versus depolarization without Ca<sup>2+</sup> comparison and depolarization with Ca<sup>2+</sup> versus no depolarization comparison corresponded, respectively, to 67.9% and 62.5% of the total phosphosites that were initially identified. The complete list of quantified phosphosites in all three comparisons is reported in Supplementary file 2, available at Dryad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kohansal-Nodehi et al., 2016</xref>). To assess the reproducibility of the biological replicates, the Pearson correlation coefficients between dimethyl ratios and intensities of phosphosites in three biological replicates were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). High correlation between the replicates in both comparison were confirmed, with the coefficients greater than 0.72 for intensities and greater than 0.65 for dimethyl ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>).</p><p>The overall results of the comparative quantitative analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Several important conclusions can be drawn from this analysis. First, only a small fraction (12–15% ) of all quantified phosphosites show significant changes upon depolarization in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events are detectable, with phosphorylation events being slightly more prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The overlap among all quantified phosphosites is very high between the two comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). There is also substantial overlap in regulated phosphosites between the comparisons (37% in upregulated and 35% in downregulated phosphosites, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>) with identical tendency of regulation and similar fold changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Taken together, these data show that only a limited set of proteins undergo rapid phosphorylation changes that are specifically triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, most probably involving Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent kinases and phosphatases (see below). As expected, under stimulation conditions, synapsin1 (Ser603) and dynamin1 (Ser774) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) were identified as up- and downregulated phosphosites, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).

This is in agreement with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cousin and Robinson, 2001</xref>). Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of CME proteins was proposed to serve two related functions. First, phosphorylation regulates the interactions between different CME proteins. For example, phosphorylation of the adaptor protein AP180 weakens its interaction with the AP-2 adaptor complex, which is required for synaptic vesicle endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hao et al., 1999</xref>). In our dataset, three AP180 phosphosites (Ser600, Ser621 and Ser627) are dephosphorylated, one of which (Ser627) is located in the reported binding site. Second, phosphorylation generally weakens the affinity towards membranes containing acidic lipids and thus promotes dissociation of coat proteins. For instance, phosphorylation of dynamin1 by PKC at Ser795 prevents its association with phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Powell et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> also confirms and extends previous reports on the regulation of multiple phosphosites in synapsin1 and dynamin1. For synapsin1, regulation of some of the sites has been previously characterized extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jovanovic et al., 2001</xref>). Such as downregulation of Ser62 and upregulation of Ser556 and Ser603. However, no stimulus-dependent changes were observable at the phosphorylation sites of CdK5 (Ser549 and 551) that were suggested to regulate the size of the synaptic vesicle pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Verstegen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Components of the presynaptic active zone make up the most conspicuously phosphorylated proteins (e.g. bassoon, piccolo, RIM1, liprin-α3 and ERC1-2). The amino acid positions of phosphosites identified on these proteins are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, with the well characterized phosphoproteins synapsin1 and dynamin1 included for comparison. Similarly to synapsin and dynamin, we observed many sites of active zone proteins undergoing parallel changes in phosphorylation and dephosphorylation upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent stimulation. Active zone proteins regulate synaptic transmission speed, precision, and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kaeser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sudhof, 2012</xref>). Our results show that, the proteins bassoon and piccolo are massively phosphorylated, with 48 and 31 sites being quantified in our experiments, respectively. Intriguingly, with the exception of 6 phosphosites, most of the piccolo phosphosites remained unchanged following stimulation. In comparison, bassoon exhibited a dramatic decrease in phosphorylation at multiple sites in addition to increased phosphorylation at 5 other positions. While the role of these novel sites is still unclear, it is conceivable that downregulation of the bassoon phosphosites may serve to regulate the global properties of the protein (e.g. surface charge density) rather than specific protein-protein interactions. In previous studies it has been reported that in spite of having similar structural motifs, bassoon and piccolo have different protein interaction partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Takao-Rikitsu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schoch and Gundelfinger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).

Phosphosites upregulated during Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent stimulation were highly enriched for the RxxS sequence motif (7.36 fold, p=1.0 × 10<sup>–16</sup> compared to control and 5.98 fold, p=4.8 × 10<sup>–13</sup>, when compared to samples depolarized in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). RxxS is the consensus motif of calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) but also targeted by protein kinase A (PKA) and conventional isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC). This is in agreement with previous studies showing that these kinases are activated upon depolarization of nerve terminals in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Millán et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yamauchi, 2005</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14530.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Analysis of sequence motifs and experimental verification of specific kinase phosphorylation on selected phosphosites.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Sequence analysis of regulated phosphosites using the Motif-X tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schwartz and Gygi, 2005</xref>).

Here, SP sequence motif was enriched significantly (8.21 fold, p=1.0 × 10<sup>–16</sup> when compared to control and 8.03 fold, p=1.0 x 10<sup>-16</sup> when compared to samples depolarized in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figure 6C and D</xref>, respectively). Phosphatases are not known to have preferred substrate consensus motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kennelly and Krebs, 1991</xref>). However, the SP motif is preferred by proline-directed kinases such as ERK1/2, GSK-3 and Cdk5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guan et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Veeranna et al., 1998</xref>). Between the mentioned kinases, ERK1/2 is less likely to be inactivated upon stimulation, since we have quantified the upregulation of two activating phosphosites in the active loop of ERK1/2 (T183, Y185, Supplementary file 2, K<sup>+</sup>, EGTA vs K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>).</p><p>Overall, it is conceivable that phosphosites with SP motifs turnover more rapidly, with the decrease reflecting either reduced kinase activity or increased processing by the phosphatases. Net dephosphorylation of SP-sites may have functional consequences for presynaptic function. For instance, CdK5 is known to be major control point of neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim and Ryan, 2010</xref>). The balance between the activation of calcineurin (PP2B) and Cdk5 is reported to control the dynamics of resting and recycling pools as well as activity of voltage gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim and Ryan, 2013</xref>). Also the coordination of CdK5 activity and other proline directed kinases such GSK-3 and ERK1/2 can result in regulation of neurotransmitter release. For example, Cdk5 and GSK-3 phosphorylate P/Q- and N-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tomizawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>) whereas ERK1/2 phosphorylate L-type calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Subramanian and Morozov, 2011</xref>) and phosphorylation decreases the activity of both types of calcium channels. Thus, it is conceivable that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx increases the activity of calcium channels via dephosphorylation. However regulation of calcium channels via Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx seems to be more complex since they are also inactivated by calcium dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Simms and Zamponi, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Due to the lack of consensus motifs it is not possible to identify the phosphatases that are activated upon stimulation using sequence analysis. However, the increase in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration activates phosphatase PP2B (calcineurin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sun et al., 2010</xref>). Also, in our dataset we observe that the regulatory subunit delta (LOC100909464) of protein phosphatase 2A shows increased phosphorylation at Ser567 (Supplementary file 2, K<sup>+</sup>, EGTA vs K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kohansal-Nodehi et al., 2016</xref>), a site known to be phosphorylated by PKA, resulting in an increase of its enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2007</xref>). This suggests the activation of PP2A upon stimulation. We also observe phosphorylation changes in Neurabin-2 (S100), regulatory protein of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), (Supplementary file 2, K<sup>+</sup>, EGTA vs K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>). It has been shown previously that phosphorylation of S100 alters PP1 localization by the decrease of binding affinity to actin and the diffusion from the nerve terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colbran, 2004</xref>). In summary, our data suggest that upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx subset of kinases and phosphatases such as PKA, PKC, CaMKII, PP2A and PP2B are activated while PP1 is less active and the target sites of proline directed kinases show a decrease in phosphorylation, mediated either by decreased activity of the kinases or preferred targeting by the phosphatases.</p><p>To confirm that hitherto uncharacterized phosphosites containing the RxxS motif are indeed phosphorylated by one or more of the three kinases known to target these sites, five of these sites were selected for experimental verification: RIM1 (Ser413 and Ser1141), bassoon (Ser2844), piccolo (Ser3626) and liprin-α3 (Ser75). For each of these sites, 13-mer peptides were synthesized (containing 6 residues upstream and 6 residues downstream of the phosphoserine) and tested by a commercially available kinase assay against CaMKII, protein kinase A, and protein kinase C. As a control, corresponding peptides were synthesized, in which the phosphorylated serine was replaced by alanine. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, each of the peptides was recognized by at least one of the kinases. For instance, RIM1 Ser413 was phosphorylated only by PKA; consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lonart et al., 2003</xref>). RIM1 Ser1141 was phosphorylated mostly by CaMKII and with lower efficiency by PKA. Bassoon Ser2844 was phosphorylated only by CaMKII. Piccolo Ser3626 was phosphorylated by CaMKII and PKA albeit with low efficiency. Liprin-α3 Ser75 was the only phosphosite that was phosphorylated by all three kinases although PKC was less efficient. Together, these findings agree with the notion that activation of these three kinases during depolarization in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to the phosphorylation of the active zone proteins at their corresponding phosphosites. Furthermore, it reveals another layer of regulatory diversification since each of the three kinases exhibited selective phosphorylation of the different substrates despite sharing a common core motif.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study we have used quantitative phosphoproteomics to obtain a snapshot of changes that occur in protein phosphorylation during Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. A surprisingly complex pattern of both up- and downregulated sites was observed, frequently within the same protein, with the proteins of the active zone being most conspicuous.</p><p>Synaptosomes are uniquely suitable for the study of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events that are associated with synaptic vesicle cycling. Although even the most highly enriched fraction of nerve terminals still contains significant contamination from many other parts of the starting tissue (as confirmed by the composition of the proteome of this fraction), synaptosomes represent the only compartment in the extract that forms membrane enclosed structures retaining basic cellular properties. These include the ability of generating and maintaining a membrane potential and of synthesizing ATP from externally added glucose or ketone bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nicholls, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, physiological ATP-levels can only be maintained inside nerve terminals whereas residual external ATP is likely to be rapidly degraded by ATPases, in particular by uncoupled ion pumps. Consequently, protein kinases can only operate inside the nerve terminal during the experiment. Indeed, our comparison of the phosphoproteome versus the total proteome of the synaptosome fraction revealed a significant enrichment of proteins involved in presynaptic function while other proteins (including those of the postsynapse) were reduced or conspicuously absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Although our analysis of phosphosites is certainly not yet comprehensive, several important conclusions can be drawn from our data. First, only a limited number of phosphosites is regulated by stimulation whereas the majority of the quantified sites did not change. Second, almost an identical pattern of regulated sites was observed regardless of whether the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free control was depolarized or not. This agrees well with the observation that depolarization in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> resulted only in very limited changes of the phosphosite pattern. This is remarkable when considering that clamp-depolarization by potassium is nonphysiological and may have deleterious side effects (e.g. drop in ATP levels). Consequently, our data show that the phosphorylation changes observed after stimulation are dominated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent kinases (such as CaMKII, PKC) and phosphatases (such as calcineurin), all of which are implicated in regulating presynaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Scholz and Palfrey, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brager et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Leenders and Sheng, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In addition, our data hint at the activation of a network of kinases and phosphatases that operates downstream of the primary Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzymes. For instance, calcineurin upregulates adenylate cyclase in nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ferguson and Storm, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2005</xref>), increasing cAMP levels and activating protein kinase A. Also, we observed increased phosphorylation of Ser567 in the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is known to enhance its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, our motif enrichment analysis suggests that CdK5, ERK1/2 and GSK-3 are downregulated upon stimulation. Another example is contributed by the increased phosphorylation of protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit Neurabin-2 at S100 that decreases its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colbran, 2004</xref>). We conclude that the activity of kinases and phosphatases is precisely coordinated: upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, CaMKII, PKA, PKC as well as PP2A and PP2B are activated whereas proline directed kinases (e.g. CdK5 and GSK-3) as well as PP1 appear to be downregulated.</p><p>The panoply of phosphorylation sites and phosphorylation changes detected in many proteins of the presynaptic active zone was surprising. Active zone proteins are thought to structure the site for synaptic vesicle docking and fusion by forming dynamic scaffolds, and several of these proteins such as RIM and Munc13 have been shown to play a crucial role in vesicle docking and priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Südhof, 2012</xref>). Only a few of these phosphorylation sites have been previously studied, such as phosphorylation dependent binding of 14-3-3 adaptor protein to bassoon at Ser2844 or the cAMP-regulated site in RIM1 (Ser413) that plays a role in long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lonart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kaeser et al., 2008</xref>). Similar to the well-characterized and multiply phosphorylated synapsin1, active zone proteins contain sites that exhibit opposing changes in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>The functional significance of such multiple phosphorylation remains to be explored. There are many examples showing that within such proteins individual phosphosites can have specific functions, e.g. in regulating the activity of enzymes such as CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cohen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coultrap and Bayer, 2012</xref>) or channels such as Kv2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Park et al., 2006</xref>). At present, we do not yet know whether there are individual sites on a given active zone protein that are solely responsible for a functional change (e.g. in regulating binding to a specific protein) or whether multiple phosphosites cooperate in changing the overall properties of a protein. Multi-site phosphorylation may modulate the binding affinity of a protein to other proteins or block binding by increasing its overall negative charge leading to repulsion from other proteins and charged membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Powell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arbuzova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ferreon et al., 2009</xref>). Also, our data only represent a snapshot of phosphorylation changes 2 min after depolarization, i.e. when exo- and endocytosis are both at elevated steady-state levels. Thus it is conceivable that transient changes occurring in the first seconds after stimulations were missed.</p><p>Intriguingly, in our data no significant changes were observed in the phosphorylation status of SNARE and other proteins that are mediating exocytosis of synaptic vesicles (e.g syntaxin1A Thr10, Ser14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rickman and Duncan, 2010</xref>), Ser59, Ser64; VAMP-2 Ser75, Ser80; SNAP-25 Ser25; Munc18 Ser506, Ser507, Ser509, Ser593 and NSF Ser739) (Supplementary file 2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kohansal-Nodehi et al., 2016</xref>). Thus it appears that the rapid feedback loops governed by kinases and phosphatases, which are activated during stimulation, do not target the exocytotic machinery itself but rather upstream processes such as docking, priming, and endocytosis. Further detailed studies will be required to unravel the functional consequences of these changes at the molecular level.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals, reagents and buffers</title><p>Sucrose, glucose monohydrate, sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl<sub>2</sub>x6H<sub>2</sub>0), sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>), sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>x2H<sub>2</sub>0), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were purchased from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany).

The top 10 peaks from survey scan were selected for fragmentation with Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID) with 37.5 normalized collision energy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data processing and bioinformatics analysis</title><p>Acquired MS spectra were processed using the MaxQuant software package version 1.5.0.25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>). Spectra were searched using the Andromeda search engine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cox et al., 2011</xref>) against the proteome database of Rattus Norvegicus (Uniprot complete proteome updated at 2015-01-07, with 29,378 entries). MaxQuant search was configured as follows; the mass tolerance was set to 20 and 4.5 ppm for first and main peptide search, respectively. The multiplicity was set to two (DimethLys0 and DimethNter0 was for ‘light’ and DimethLys4 and DimethNter4 for ‘heavy’ samples). Trypsin/P was fixed as protease and maximum of 2 missed cleavages were allowed. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as fixed modification and methionine oxidation, acetylation (on N-terminal), phosphorylation on serine/threonine/tyrosine were specified as variable modifications. False discovery rate of 1% was applied and re-quantification was enabled. For proteomics analysis MaxQuant search was configured like phosphoproteomics search except that multiplicity was set to one with methionine oxidation and acetylation (on N-terminal) as variable modifications. The phospho (STY) output file from the MaxQuant was processed by ‘Perseus version 1.5.0.9’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>) for downstream data analysis. In each comparison phosphosites quantified in at least two out of three biological replicates were selected for further analysis. Perseus data processing was configured as follows; reverse hits were removed and minimum localization probability of 0.75 was set as criterion to accept phosphosites for further analysis. The normalized ratios and the intensities of phosphosites reported by MaxQuant were log<sub>2</sub> and log<sub>10</sub> transformed respectively, and were used to plot the distribution of quantified phosphosites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The significantly regulated phosphosites (significant outliers) were determined by two-tailed ‘Significant A’ test (<italic>p</italic>-value ≤ 0.05) using the Perseus software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cox et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The Motif-X tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schwartz and Gygi, 2005</xref>) was used remotely from motif-x.med.harvard.edu/motif-x.html for sequence motif analysis. Sequences of upregulated or downregulated phosphorylation sites in the comparisons were independently searched against the IPI Rat Proteome as background. The default suggested setting (occurrences = 20 and significance = 0.000001) were used for the analysis. Central character was set as 'S' and sequence length was specified as 31.</p><p>The Ingenuity Pathway Analyses software (IPA, build version 21901358, Qiagen, Redwood City, CA) was used to identify significantly enriched biological functions in the synaptosomal proteome and phosphoproteome data sets. The comparison analysis function of IPA was then used to further determine which functional clusters differ significantly between the two datasets. Only clusters having a p-value &lt; 0.01 were considered for the analysis. Right-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used to calculate a p‐value determining the probability that each biological function assigned to that data set is due to chance alone. Functionally redundant clusters were manually removed. The heat map was generated using Microsoft Excel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Kinase assay</title><p><italic>In vitro</italic> kinase assays were carried out using the ADP-Glo kinase assay kit (Promega, Meinheim, Germany) in three replicates. In all assays 0.2 µg/µl of each peptide were used. First, standard curves were obtained by making a series of ADP-ATP (provided together with kinase assay kit) dilutions based on the kit protocol, and the luminescence of each dilution was measured. Then, we optimized the concentration of each kinase and of the ATP concentration to achieve 100% conversion of ATP to ADP based on the standard curves, defined as 100% activity. Then the phosphorylation of each investigated phosphosite by the respective kinase was calculated and reported as percent of activity of the enzyme. For PKA (Promega, Meinheim, Germany) assay, Kemptide (provided with the enzyme) was used as positive control peptide, and 5 µM ATP and 0.7 U/µl enzyme were used. For CaMKII (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) we first activated the enzyme by addition of 5 µM ATP, 1.2 µM calmodulin (provided with the enzyme) and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 30 min incubation at 37°C. Then, for the kinase reactions we used 5 µM ATP and 12 U/µl of kinase. Autocamide (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) was used as positive control peptide. For PKC (Promega, Meinheim, Germany) assays, Neurogranin (Provided with enzyme) was used as positive control peptide, and the incubation was carried out with 25 µM ATP and 5 ng/µl enzyme. Peptides were purchased from commercial supplier (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Ulm, Germany). The sequences of the peptides are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>10 µg of synaptosomal extract was used for immunoblotting according to standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2014</xref>) after separation of samples by 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE gels. The following primary antibodies were used: synapsin1, dynamin1-3 and α-tubulin (Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany), phospho S774-dynamin1, phospho S603-synapsin1 (Rockland, Pottstow, PA). All primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1000. HRP-conjugated mouse, rat or sheep secondary antibodies were used for detection of the respective primary antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (SuperSignal West Pico kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL), and signals were detected with an LAS-1000 imaging system (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Quantification of immunoblots was performed using ImageJ, and Prism (version 5.04, GraphPad software) was used for the statistical analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Momchil Ninov and Ángel Pérez-Lara for help with the preparation of synaptosomes and with the strong cation exchange chromatography, respectively, and Uwe Pleßmann, Monika Raabe, and Annika Kühn for technical support in mass spectrometry.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Mary B. Kennedy, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Kohansal-Nodehi et al. couples classical methods of studying the biochemistry of nerve terminals with &quot;modern,&quot; mass-spec driven, proteomic studies. The presentation makes clear how proteomic studies can be analyzed to clarify and extend functional mechanistic studies carried out in more directed experiments. The study reveals two new interesting regulatory phenomena. The active zone proteins piccolo and bassoon are more extensively regulated by depolarization of synaptosomes in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> than predicted from earlier studies. The study also reveals that phosphosites that are up-regulated by depolarization plus Ca<sup>2+</sup> are dominated by sequence motifs that are recognized by CaMKII, PKA, and PKC, as might be predicted; however, phosphosites that are down-regulated are dominated by the SP motif recognized by ERK1/2, CdK5, or CdK5, suggesting that phosphatases activated by depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> act predominantly on sites regulated by the latter kinases, at least in the first few minutes after stimulation.</p><p>The authors analyzed the phosphoproteome of rat synaptosomes, comparing preparations that were depolarized with KCL (clamped depolarization) in the presence of calcium (&quot;stimulated&quot; condition) to preparations that were either not depolarized, or depolarized in the absence of calcium. The authors identify up- or down-regulation of the phosphorylation status of a total of 252 sites in (mostly) pre-synaptic proteins. They categorize the regulated phosphosites based on protein function and provide an overview of the changes in the phosphorylation status of a selection of active zone proteins, synaptic vesicle proteins, plasma membrane proteins, and proteins involved in Clathrin mediated exocytosis. The Authors used standard omics procedures to label proteins in the two conditions with H/D using dimethylation, they enriched phosphopeptides using a TiO<sub>2</sub> trap.</p><p>Overall, their analysis of presynaptic, stimulation-dependent phosphorylation changes provides a valuable overview that will be of interest to many researchers in the presynaptic field. The datasets should be extremely useful for more detailed analyses of the functional consequences and proximate causes of individual, activity-dependent phosphorylation or de-phosphorylation events. The study provides a more global context in which studies of the functions and regulation of individual proteins can be designed and interpreted. It paves the way for a new paradigm for studies of the dynamics of protein regulation that underlie control of transmitter release, and recovery of the terminal from a round of stimulated release.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One reviewer felt that the stimulated condition that the Authors have chosen is somewhat non-physiological, i.e. a clamped depolarization with the membrane potential close to zero. It is a situation in which the status of voltage-dependent ion channels and ion pumps is far from the normal electrical activity. A close-threshold depolarization with 4-aminopyridine would have been a more physiological condition to perform the study. This reviewer felt that the terminals would be subjected to a calcium overload. In contrast, another reviewer felt that this is not a problem because, with the K<sup>+</sup> stimulus, inactivation of voltage-dependent calcium channels would limit large calcium influx to the first few seconds, and that ATP driven calcium pumps and the sodium/calcium exchanger would not be strongly affected by the clamped depolarization as they are not largely voltage driven. It would be useful for the authors to comment on these points in the manuscript.</p><p>2) In the Discussion, the authors state that &quot;it appears that the rapid feedback loops governed by kinases and phosphatases, which are activated during stimulation, do not target the exocytotic machinery itself but rather upstream processes such as docking, priming and endocytosis.&quot; However, the authors have captured a snapshot at 2 min after stimulus. Since the turnover number of most protein kinases is around 1/sec, and the turnover numbers of protein phosphatases can be much faster, the authors could have missed even more rapid cycles that occur in the first 10, 30, or 60 s. It would be better to add the statement that regulatory cycles of the exocytotic machinery may be complete by 2 min after the stimulus, and thus more rapid quenching of the reactions before analysis might be required to capture them.</p><p>3). The authors should explain in more detail why the correlation of the ratios of the 3 biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>) is low for their two &quot;control&quot; conditions (K<sup>+</sup>, EGTA vs. EGTA), and state whether or not this affects the pairwise comparison to the stimulated condition (K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>).</p><p>4) Because <italic>eLife</italic> is a journal with a broad readership, it would be appropriate to include an example of the raw data from which the extent of phosphorylation of a site in each sample is determined. Perhaps the authors could include an additional <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> supplement that shows the light and heavy peaks for S603-synapsin1 and S744-dynamin1 from each sample, with an indication of which fraction of the SCX fractionation these peaks were found in.</p><p>5) The concepts behind the &quot;Data processing and bioinformatics analysis&quot; section, i.e. how the raw data were converted into the figure panels, should be explained in more detail – especially for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and its supplements.</p><p>6) The authors suggest that the kinases targeting the SP motif (CdK5, ERK1/2, GSK-3) are down-regulated in response to stimulation and/or that the turnover at these sites may be faster. This would indeed be very interesting, have the authors attempted to verify either of these possibilities? It seems more likely that calcium-stimulated phosphatases are stimulated to dephosphorylate these sites at a faster rate; whereas, the kinases are not stimulated by calcium. Therefore, dephosphorylation dominates after the calcium stimulus.

This, however, is inherent to the entire approach: synaptosomes (pinched-off nerve terminals) are not suitable for fine-tuning of synaptic excitation. On the other hand, synaptosomes have served since decades as a convenient and biochemically accessible model system for studying basic features of the exo- and endocytotic machinery. In fact, a lot of basic knowledge about the functioning of vesicle release was first obtained from studies on synaptosomes that were stimulated by KCl-depolarization (including phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of key proteins such as dynamin and synapsin). Many previous papers have shown that exocytotic release persists for several minutes after KCl depolarization (see e.g. [Nicholls and Sihra, 1986]), and that calcium influx ceases after an initial burst (McMahon and Nicholls, 1991), see also other papers by D.W. Nicholls and coworkers in the eighties and nineties of last century where this preparation was extensively characterized.</p><p>We acknowledge that potassium channel blockers were used previously to drive calcium-dependent exocytosis, triggering depolarization via firing of voltage-gated sodium channels. However, this type of activation is less reproducible and less well controlled experimentally. We have now acknowledged these inherent limitations more explicitly (see section “Phosphoproteomics of isolated nerve terminals under different stimulation conditions”, first, second and third paragraphs) but for the reasons summarized above we consider our experimental approach as conclusive despite its limitations.</p><p><italic>2) In the Discussion, the authors state that &quot;it appears that the rapid feedback loops governed by kinases and phosphatases, which are activated during stimulation, do not target the exocytotic machinery itself but rather upstream processes such as docking, priming and endocytosis.&quot; However, the authors have captured a snapshot at 2 min after stimulus.

It would be better to add the statement that regulatory cycles of the exocytotic machinery may be complete by 2 min after the stimulus, and thus more rapid quenching of the reactions before analysis might be required to capture them.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that we are certainly missing fast and reversible changes, and shorter time intervals after stimulation will need to be analyzed in the future. On the other hand, exocytotic release of glutamate continues for minutes (see above), and thus we are probably capturing an activated steady-state status of the exo- and endocytotic machinery. We have added a paragraph in the Discussion to clarify this point in more detail (sixth paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) The authors should explain in more detail why the correlation of the ratios of the 3 biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>) is low for their two &quot;control&quot; conditions (K<sup>+</sup>, EGTA vs. EGTA), and state whether or not this affects the pairwise comparison to the stimulated condition (K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>).</italic></p><p>Low correlation is observable only when correlating the ratios between the stimulated in the presence of EGTA (K<sup>+</sup>, EGTA) and non-stimulated phosphosites (EGTA). In contrast, an excellent correlation is observed when intensities (sum of intensities in both conditions, labeled as heavy and light) are correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). As further evidence for the high reproducibility between the replicates in these two conditions, we plotted the intensity values separately in K<sup>+</sup>, EGTA (heavy) and EGTA (light) conditions and calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1A and B</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14530.016</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Correlation of phosphosites between biological replicates.</title><p>Correlation plots depicting correlation of phosphosites between three biological replicates at Log<sub>10</sub> intensity level in depolarization without Ca<sup>2+</sup> (K<sup>+</sup>, EGTA, heavy) condition (<bold>A</bold>), no depolarization (EGTA, light) condition (<bold>B</bold>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14530.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14530.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-14530-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>The low correlation in the ratio level is simply a reflection of the fact that there is no major change of the phosphorylation status if the synaptosomes are depolarized in the absence of extracellular calcium. Consequently, most ratios cluster close to 1 (log2 scale 0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). In contrast, upon depolarization in the presence of calcium (K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>) many phosphosites are either up- or downregulated, which results in a high correlation not only of the intensity levels but also in the ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Because eLife is a journal with a broad readership, it would be appropriate to include an example of the raw data from which the extent of phosphorylation of a site in each sample is determined.

It seems more likely that calcium-stimulated phosphatases are stimulated to dephosphorylate these sites at a faster rate; whereas, the kinases are not stimulated by calcium. Therefore, dephosphorylation dominates after the calcium stimulus. Please comment.</italic></p><p>Our data indicate that both of the suggested mechanisms play a role: For ERK1/2 we consider downregulation as unlikely since two phosphosites in the active loop of ERK1/2 (T183, Y185, Supplementary file 2, K<sup>+</sup>, EGTA vs K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>) were found to be upregulated. It is known that upregulation of these sites increases the activity of ERK1/2 kinases (this point is mentioned now in the second paragraph of the section “Calcium-dependent kinases and phosphatases are mainly responsible for phosphorylation changes after stimulation”). In the case of GSK3, the enzyme is probably inactivated during stimulation, for the following reasons: First, two phosphorylation sites (S278, Y279) known to result in activation of the kinase (Liang and Chuang, 2007) were downregulated upon stimulation. Second, it was shown previously that upon stimulation, an inhibitory site of the GSK-3 (S9) is phosphorylated by CaMKII and inactivates the kinase (Song et al., 2010). With respect to CdK5, our data show that phosphosites known to be phosphorylated by CdK5 are downregulated upon stimulation (e.g. dynamin1 S774, septin5 S17). On the other hand, PP2A is probably activated upon stimulation (phosphorylation of Ser567 in the regulatory subunit). It is also well stablished that protein phosphatase 2B is activated by high concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
