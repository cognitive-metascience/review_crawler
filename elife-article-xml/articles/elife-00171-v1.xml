This subdivision insulates genes and/or regulatory elements within a domain from promiscuous interactions with nearby domains. While it was previously assumed that the chromosomal domain landscape is fixed, there is now growing evidence that the landscape may be subject to tissue and stage specific regulation.

The nucleus of a human cell, on the other hand, has a diameter of just 6 μm, so the DNA molecules that carry all the genetic information in the cell need to be carefully folded to fit inside the nucleus. Cells meet this challenge by combining their DNA molecules with proteins to form a compact and highly organized structure called chromatin. Packaging DNA into chromatin also reduces damage to it.</p><p>But what happens when the cell needs to express the genes carried by the DNA as proteins or other gene products? The answer is that the compact structure of chromatin relaxes and opens up, which allows the DNA to be transcribed into messenger RNA. Indeed, packing DNA into chromatin makes this process more reliable, thus ensuring that the cell only produces proteins and other gene products when it needs them. However, because cross-talk between neighboring genes could potentially disrupt or change gene expression patterns, cells evolved special elements called boundaries or insulators to stop this from happening. These elements subdivide eukaryotic chromosomes into functionally autonomous chromatin domains.</p><p>Since the protein factors implicated in boundary function seemed to be active in all tissues and cell types, it was assumed for many years that these boundaries and the resulting chromatin domains were fixed. However, a number of recent studies have shown that boundary activity can be subject to regulation, and thus chromatin domains are dynamic structures that can be defined and redefined during development to alter patterns of gene expression.</p><p>Aoki et al. report the isolation and characterization of a new fruit fly boundary factor that, unlike previously characterized factors, is active only during a specific stage of development. The Elba factor is also unusual in that it is made of three different proteins, known as Elba1, Elba2, and Elba3, and all three must be present for it to bind to DNA. While Elba2 is present during most stages of development, the other two Elba proteins are only present during early embryonic development, so the boundary factor is only active in early embryos. In addition to revealing a new mechanism for controlling boundary activity as an organism develops, the studies of Aoki et al. provide further evidence that chromatin domains can be dynamic.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00171.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00171.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>boundary</kwd><kwd>Insulator</kwd><kwd>Domain</kwd><kwd>Chromatin</kwd><kwd>Bithorax</kwd><kwd>Development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM043432</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schedl</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41 RR011823</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yates</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A chromatin boundary factor that is only active during early embryo development has been discovered in Drosophila.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic chromosomes are subdivided into functionally autonomous domains by special elements called chromatin boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gaszner and Felsenfeld, 2006</xref>). Boundaries define units of independent genetic activity by shielding genes and/or regulatory elements within a domain from adventitious interactions with regulatory elements/genes in nearby domains. The specific functions that can be ascribed to most boundary elements include an enhancer-blocking or insulator activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holdridge and Dorsett, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kellum and Schedl, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 1993</xref>), a silencer-blocking or barrier activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kellum and Schedl, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burgess–Beusse et al., 2002</xref>) and, when combined in specific pairwise combinations an ability to bring distant chromosomal DNA segments in close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai and Shen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Muravyova et al., 2001</xref>). Boundary elements have a diverse array of functions. In the yeast <italic>S. pombe</italic>, boundaries help restrict and maintain the heterochromatin state of the silenced mating type locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noma et al., 2001</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, boundary elements play a critical role in the Bithorax complex (BX-C), helping to ensure that the three BX-C homeotic genes properly specify segmental identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maeda and Karch, 2006</xref>). In vertebrates, boundaries have been implicated in controlling the expression of mRNAs encoding different neuronal Protocadherin-alpha isoforms and in regulating recombination and expression of immunoglobulin light and heavy chain genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ribeiro de Almeida et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Monahan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The first boundaries identified were able to block adventitious regulatory interactions irrespective of cell type or developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gyurkovics et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holdridge and Dorsett, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kellum and Schedl, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 1993</xref>). Moreover, the proteins conferring insulating activity in flies and vertebrates like Su(Hw), BEAF, Zw5, GAGA factor and CTCF are ubiquitously expressed and seemingly functional in all cell types. This led to the idea that boundaries are static structures and consequently that the regulatory domain landscape of eukaryotic chromosomes is largely invariant from one cell to the next. However recent studies argue that the domain landscape is more dynamic than previously imagined and that genes can be differentially regulated during normal development and differentiation and in the progression of disease states like cancer by redefining their domain organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell and Felsenfeld, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Witcher and Emerson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gomes and Espinosa, 2010</xref>). For example, regulation of the imprinted <italic>Igf2</italic> and <italic>H19</italic> genes pivots on parent of origin differences in the DNA methylation pattern and consequently the activity of a CTCF-dependent boundary element upstream of the <italic>H19</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell and Felsenfeld, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hark et al., 2000</xref>). In this and also other examples, regulatory domains are defined or redefined locally by modulating how a ubiquitous insulator protein functions at a specific boundary element. However, one mechanism for defining domains that has yet to be described are developmental stage or cell type specific changes in the available repertoire of boundary proteins.</p><p>In previous studies we discovered that the insulating activity of one of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Bithorax (BX-C) complex boundaries, <italic>Fab-7</italic>, depends upon distinct, stage specific boundary factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schweinsberg and Schedl, 2004</xref>). Like other boundaries in BX-C, <italic>Fab-7</italic> is required to ensure the functional autonomy of its flanking parasegment specific <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory domains, <italic>iab-6</italic> (parasegment 11) and <italic>iab-7</italic> (parasegment 12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gyurkovics et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). When <italic>Fab-7</italic> is deleted the <italic>iab-6</italic> and <italic>iab-7</italic> domains no longer function independently and instead fuse into a single domain that incorrectly specifies parasegment 11. While the primary function of <italic>Fab-7</italic> in BX-C is to prevent inappropriate crosstalk between regulatory elements in <italic>iab-6</italic> and <italic>iab-7</italic>, it can also block interactions between enhancers/silencers and promoters both in the context of the endogenous BX-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mihaly et al., 1997</xref>) and in reporter gene assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hagstrom et al., 1996</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00171.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Bithorax Complex, the <italic>Fab-7</italic> boundary and the Elba recognition element.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Drosophila</italic> Bithorax complex (BX-C). BX-C spans ∼300 kb and includes three Hox-family genes <italic>Ultrabithorax</italic>, <italic>abdominal-A</italic> and <italic>Abdominal-B</italic>. Parasegment specific expression of these three homeotic genes is generated by a series of functionally autonomous <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory domains: <italic>abx</italic>/<italic>bx</italic>, <italic>bxd</italic>/<italic>pbx</italic> and <italic>iab-2</italic>-<italic>iab8, 9</italic>. Functionally autonomy depends upon boundary elements that lie between each <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maeda and Karch, 2010</xref>). One of these boundary elements is <italic>Fab-7</italic>, which is located in between the <italic>iab-6</italic> and <italic>iab-7 cis</italic>-regulatory domains. Both in the context of BX-C and in transgene assays, the <italic>Fab-7</italic> boundary can block the action of enhancers/silencers at all stages of development, apparently irrespective of tissue or cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galloni et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hagstrom et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mihaly et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schweinsberg et al., 2004</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) The <italic>Fab-7</italic> boundary spans a sequence of 1.2 kb and consists of two prominent and one minor (*) chromatin specific nuclease hypersensitive regions (shown as yellow boxes). There is a third prominent nuclease hypersensitive region (blue) just distal to the boundary, which corresponds to a Polycomb Response Element (PRE) for the <italic>iab-7 cis</italic>-regulatory domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maeda and Karch, 2010</xref>). The orange box is a ∼100 base pair (bp) high-homology region which is conserved among <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (&gt;90%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2008</xref>). The ovals are binding sites for Trithorax-like (GAGA factor). (<bold>C</bold>) pHS1 is a 236-bp fragment from the proximal side of HS1 which has enhancer-blocking activity only in early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schweinsberg and Schedl, 2004</xref>). pHS1 includes the high-homology region and two GAGA-binding sites. These two GAGA sites are important for the early boundary activity of <italic>Fab-7</italic>, while GAGA sites elsewhere in <italic>Fab-7</italic> are needed later in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schweinsberg et al., 2004</xref>). In addition to the GAGA sites, the enhancer-blocking activity of pHS1 in early embryos also depends upon an 8-bp sequence, CCAATAAG, called Elba (Early boundary activity). Mutations in this sequence compromise the blocking activity of a 4×pHS1 multimer, while multimerization of a 27-bp oligo spanning the Elba sequence (8×Elba) [see (<bold>D</bold>)] is sufficient to confer early blocking activity. The Elba sequence is recognized by the stage-specific Elba DNA-binding factor. Elba factor binding is detected in 0–6 hr nuclear extracts, but it is absent in 6–12 hr (and 6–18 hr) nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2008</xref>).

(<bold>A</bold>) When a ‘non-specific’ DNA sequence is placed between the <italic>ftz</italic> enhancers and the <italic>hsp70:LacZ</italic> reporter, no blocking is observed.

(<bold>D</bold>) When mutations (M3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) that disrupt Elba binding in nuclear extracts are introduced into the Elba sequence of pHS1, the enhancer blocking activity of the mutated pHS1×4 is compromised.

The blocking activity seen at this stage with the 8× multimer is likely due to the presence of some residual Elba activity in older embryos as seen in EMSA experiments with 6–12 hr nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00171.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00171.004</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00171-fig1-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>Transgene assays and deletion mutations within BX-C have shown that the <italic>Fab-7</italic> boundary spans a DNA segment of 1.2 kb that contains two major nuclease hypersensitive sites, HS1 and HS2, and a minor hypersensitive site ‘*’ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Like other well-characterized <italic>Drosophila</italic> boundaries, it has insulating activity throughout development apparently irrespective of tissue or cell type both in the context of BX-C and in transgene assays. However, <italic>Fab-7</italic> appears unusual in that its constitutive boundary function is generated by sub-elements whose activity is developmentally restricted. The first evidence for this developmental restriction came from the effects of mutations in binding sites for the GAGA factor in enhancer blocking assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schweinsberg et al., 2004</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, there are three pairs of GAGA sites in HS1. Mutations in the proximal pair weaken boundary activity in early embryos, but have little effect from mid-embryogenesis onwards. In contrast, mutations in the central pair weaken boundary activity during mid-embryogenesis and in adults, but not in early embryos. Further evidence for sub-elements with developmentally restricted boundary activity came from experiments in which small fragments from HS1 were multimerized. Multimers of small 2- to 400-bp fragments from the distal half of HS1 were found to block enhancer-promoter interactions from mid-embryogenesis onwards even more efficiently that the intact <italic>Fab-7</italic> boundary. However, these fragments have less blocking activity than <italic>Fab-7</italic> in early embryos. Conversely, a multimerized 236-bp fragment, pHS1, containing the proximal pair of GAGA sites has enhancer blocking activity during early embryogenesis, but not thereafter. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> which shows that pHS1×4 blocks the <italic>fushi tarazu</italic> (<italic>ftz</italic>) UPS stripe enhancer in early embryos, but doesn't block the <italic>ftz</italic> NE enhancer during mid-embryogenesis. Consistent with these transgene results, two partial <italic>Fab-7</italic> deletions in BX-C that remove the distal half of HS1 plus H2, but retain the proximal pHS1 sequence including pair of GAGA sites function as boundaries during early embryogenesis but not later in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schweinsberg and Schedl, 2004</xref>). In addition, the early boundary activity of these partial deletions depends upon the GAGA factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schweinsberg et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>With the aim of identifying factors in addition to GAGA that confer the early boundary activity of pHS1, we used probes from pHS1 for EMSA (electrophoresis mobility shift assay) experiments with staged nuclear extracts. Only one DNA binding activity, Elba, had a stage-specificity consistent with the insulating activity of pHS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2008</xref>). It is present in extracts from early 0–6 hr embryos, a period when pHS1 boundary activity is high. In contrast, in extracts from older 6–12 hr embryos, where pHS1 boundary activity in vivo is largely absent, only little Elba is detected. Elba recognizes an asymmetric 8-bp sequence, CCAATAAG (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which is conserved in the <italic>Fab-7</italic> elements of other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species including the distant <italic>melanogaster</italic> relative <italic>D. virilis</italic>. Moreover, two lines of evidence indicate that the Elba factor is important for boundary activity in early embryos. We found that mutations in the recognition sequence that disrupt Elba binding in nuclear extracts compromise pHS1 insulator activity in vivo. Conversely, multimerizing the Elba recognition sequence is sufficient to confer early insulating activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2008</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Understanding the role of Elba in the context of BX-C and more generally in the establishment of chromatin domains during early embryogenesis requires the identification and characterization of this novel boundary factor. We describe here a general cross-affinity purification strategy for identifying components of multi-protein DNA binding complexes by mass spectrometry. Using this purification strategy, we show that the Elba boundary factor is an unusual hetero-tripartite protein complex. Two of the proteins, Elba1 and Elba2, share a conserved C-terminal ‘BEN domain’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abhiman et al., 2008</xref>). The third protein, Elba3, has no obvious conserved protein domains, but is encoded by a gene that is closely linked to Elba1. All three Elba proteins are required to reconstitute DNA binding activity in vitro. DNA binding depends upon the BEN domains in Elba1 and Elba2, while Elba3 mediates the assembly of an active Elba complex by interacting with the N-terminal domains of Elba1 and Elba2. All three Elba proteins are present in the Elba complex detected in 0–6 hr nuclear extracts and all three are required for chromatin domain boundary function in vivo. Finally, because <italic>elba1</italic> and <italic>elba3</italic> are ‘mid-blastula transition’ genes, Elba only binds to its' target sequences in <italic>Fab-7</italic> and confers insulator activity during early embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Isolation of the Elba factor</title><p>We tried to isolate Elba directly from nuclear extracts by DNA-affinity purification. However, excess non-specific DNA-binding activity in the extracts inhibited Elba binding to the affinity beads and necessitated the use of a pre-purification procedure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’). Following S-Sepharose chromatography, the active fraction was split into two aliquots and fractionated on either wild type (WT) or mutant (M) DNA affinity beads. Since Elba was substantially enriched in the 1.0 M KCl fraction from WT beads (WE1), while there was little in the corresponding fraction from mutant beads (WE2) (not shown), we analyzed the protein composition by mass spectrometry. However, in two independent single DNA-affinity purifications it wasn't possible to identify the Elba factor as far too many proteins were detected in ME1 (and also ME1) and none stood out from the rest (see ‘Materials and methods’).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00171.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Elba purification scheme.</title><p>Details provided in ‘Materials and methods’.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00171.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00171.005</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00171-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>To reduce the number of remaining non-specific binding proteins and increase the differences in Elba yield between WT and M affinity beads, we devised the cross affinity purification scheme shown at the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

First, all three are ∼40 kDa, which is close in size to the protein species in nuclear extracts that is UV cross-linked to probes containing the Elba sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2008</xref>). Second, the C-terminal ∼130 amino acids of Elba1 and Elba2 show extensive sequence similarities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Moreover, included within this region of similarity is a conserved ∼90 amino acids BEN domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) that has been implicated in protein:protein interactions and transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cha et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mackler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korutla et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duan et al., 2011</xref>). Two other fly proteins have BEN domains. One is a predicted isoform of the Mod(mdg4)C boundary factor, while the other is Insensitive (Insv) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which functions in neurogenesis and Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duan et al., 2011</xref>).

Mammals have a large family of BEND proteins.

The BEN domain of Insv is most closely related to BEN9/hNAC2 and BEND8/hNAC1.

To confirm that the properties of the reconstituted Elba factor match the endogenous factor in 0–6 hr nuclear extracts, we tested for sequence specificity. We previously identified the core recognition sequence by introducing a series of 3-bp point mutations into the Elba probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2008</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

We found that they did not. These findings indicate that the Elba factor in 0–6 hr nuclear extracts must also contain all three Elba proteins. While these results do not exclude the possibility that the Elba factor in nuclear extracts contains additional proteins besides Elba1–3, such proteins do not remain stably associated with Elba during its purification nor are they required for its DNA binding activity in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Characterization of the Elba complex</title><p>As hetero-tripartite DNA binding factors are unusual and there are no previously known DNA binding domains in the Elba proteins, we sought to learn more about the organization and DNA binding activities of the Elba complex. In preliminary experiments, we found very weak, but detectable DNA binding activity when we mixed bacterially expressed N-terminal GST (Glutahione-S-transferase) fusions of the two BEN domain proteins, Elba1 and Elba2, in the absence of Elba3. Since GST is known to form stable dimers, we reasoned that the GST moieties might be substituting for Elba3 by promoting the formation of GST-Elba1:GST-Elba2 heterodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This finding together with the asymmetric Elba binding motif, CCAATAAG, suggested a model in which the BEN domains in Elba1 and Elba2 are responsible for DNA recognition, while the function of Elba3 is to bring Elba1 and Elba2 together so that they can form the DNA binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00171.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Elba protein deletions and functional organization of the Elba complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Elba proteins and deletion mutants.

To maximize the formation of heterodimers, we co-translated mRNAs encoding the GST-Elba1F and GST-Elba2F fusions and assayed for DNA binding activity. As shown in lane 6 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, a prominent shift is generated when these two GST fusions are co-translated. In contrast, the individual GST fusions fail to shift the Elba probe on their own even though they are expected to form homodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lanes 7 and 8). Consistent with the idea that only the heterodimer is able to bind to the Elba probe, we found that there is little DNA binding activity when the two GST fusions are translated independently and then mixed together just before assaying (not shown). In this case, DNA binding activity is likely limited by a slow rate of dissociation of the GST-ElbaF homodimers. The fact that a heterologous dimerization domain can support what appears to be near full DNA binding activity would be consistent with the idea that the role of Elba3 is to link Elba1 and Elba2 together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). While GST can substitute for Elba3, the supershift generated by the addition of Elba3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lane 5) indicates that the GST-Elba1F:GST-Elba2F heterodimer is still able to form a trimeric complex with Elba3.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00171.010</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Characterization of Elba complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DNA binding activity of different Elba protein variants.

In this case, the GST moiety should substitute for the BEN domain. However, this is not the case. When the BEN domain was deleted from either one or both of the GST-fused Elba1 and Elba2 proteins (∆BEN), DNA-binding activity was completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lanes 9–11).</p><p>To further characterize the functional domains in the three Elba proteins we subdivided them into N-terminal and C-terminal halves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). As expected from the experiments described above, the N-terminal halves of Elba1 and Elba2 had no DNA binding activity either with (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) or without the GST moiety. For the C-terminal halves of Elba1 and Elba2 we first generated cDNAs that span the entire 130 amino acids homology region (including the 90 amino acids BEN domain) either with or without the N-terminal GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Like the full-length GST fusions, the GST-ElbaC homodimers have no detectable DNA binding activity on their own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lanes 14 and 15), while a very prominent shift is generated when the RNAs encoding GST-Elba1C and GST-Elba2C are co-translated (lane 13). In addition to having roughly equivalent activity to the ‘native’ hetero-tripartite Elba complex generated by the three full length Elba proteins, the GST-Elba1C:GST-Elba2C heterodimer exhibits a similar sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>). The two ElbaC proteins also resemble the corresponding full-length Elba1 and Elba2 proteins in that full DNA binding activity requires the dimerization activity of the GST (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lanes 13 16). On the other hand, the two ElbaC proteins differ from the full length Elba1 and Elba2 proteins in two respects. Most importantly, the addition of Elba3 to the two ElbaC proteins (without the GST moiety) does not reconstitute full DNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, lane 7). This finding suggests that Elba3 orchestrates the formation of the hetero-tripartite complex by interacting with sequences in the N-terminal domains of Elba1 and Elba2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Consistent with this idea, the shift generated by the active GST-Elba1C:GST-Elba2C heterodimer differs from the full-length heterodimer in that it is not supershifted by the addition of Elba3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lane 12). A second potentially interesting difference is that the mixture of Elba1C and Elba2C proteins (lacking GST) gives a faint shift that can be detected in long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, lane 8 filled arrowhead) but not short (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lane 16) exposures. Like the shift generated by the corresponding GST proteins, this shift is not enhanced or supershifted by the addition of Elba3 (lane 7) and it requires both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, lanes 9 and 10). Interestingly, it can be stabilized as well as supershifted by the addition of FLAG antibodies (but not GST antibodies: lanes 11 and 12). Although further studies will be required, it would appear that there are weakly active hetero-dimerization motifs in the C-terminal halves of Elba1 and Elba2 that become more readily accessible when the N-terminus of the two proteins is removed.</p><p>We also generated cDNAs that encode the 90 amino acids BEN domain and the remaining C-terminal amino acids. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, we failed to detect a shift with the GST-heterodimers between these two ‘BEN domain’ proteins (lane 17). It is possible that the close proximity of the GST moiety in these proteins precludes formation of a dimer that can form a stable DNA–protein complex. Alternatively, sequences in the extended 130 amino acid homology region might be important in facilitating DNA binding (e.g., aligning the two BEN domains).</p><p>As for the N- and C-terminal halves of Elba3, neither supported complex formation when mixed with the two other Elba proteins (not shown) nor did they supershift the shift generated by the GST-Elba1F:GST-Elba2F dimer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Expression of <italic>elba1</italic> and <italic>elba3</italic> is developmentally restricted</title><p>One important question is the basis for the developmentally restricted activity of the Elba factor.

A functional hetero-tripartite Elba factor would be assembled in early embryos and would bind to boundary elements containing the Elba recognition sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Later in development, after the <italic>elba1</italic> and <italic>elba3</italic> mRNAs disappear, the hetero-tripartite Elba factor would disappear as well. In this case, Elba2 wouldn't be able to bind to boundaries containing the Elba recognition sequence on its own. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of staged 2–5 hr and 9–12 hr embryos to test this model. As standard formaldehyde based ChIP protocols gave inconsistent enrichment of <italic>Fab-7</italic> sequences, we adapted the cross-linking procedure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nowak et al.

Consequently, the activity of the intact <italic>Fab-7</italic> boundary in the context of BX-C or in transgene assays is not expected to be disrupted by knocking down the Elba factor or even by mutations in the Elba binding site.

For this reason, we injected double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific for each Elba protein into embryos transgenic for the pHS1×4 pCfhl boundary reporter.

For both <italic>elba1</italic> and <italic>elba3</italic>, most fell into Class 3–5, while for <italic>elba2</italic> most were Class 2–4. The loss of boundary activity is specific to constituents of the Elba complex, as injection of dsRNA for the closely related <italic>insv</italic> did not disrupt boundary activity. Similar results were obtained in two other sets of pHS1×4 dsRNA injection experiments, and in experiments using embryos transgenic for the Elba multimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Like the set shown here, the disruption of boundary activity in these experiments was greatest for <italic>elba1</italic> and <italic>elba3</italic>, while smaller effects were observed for <italic>elba2</italic>.

Here we report the identification and characterization of a factor, Elba, which confers the insulator activity of one of these sub-elements in early embryos. Elba is an unusual hetero-tripartite complex. It consists of two ∼40 kDa proteins, Elba1 and Elba2, that have a C-terminal 90 amino acid BEN domain embedded in a larger 130 amino acid region of homology. The BEN domain is found in insect and vertebrate nuclear proteins and has been implicated in protein:protein interactions and transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abhiman et al., 2008</xref>). The third protein, Elba3 has no distinctive domains and seems to be limited to the Drosophilids. All three proteins are present in the Elba complex detected in nuclear extracts and are required to reconstitute Elba DNA binding in vitro.</p><p>Our functional studies indicate that DNA binding is mediated by the C-terminal domains of Elba1 and Elba2; however, in order to form a DNA binding ‘pocket’ that recognizes the asymmetric Elba sequence, CCAATAAG, Elba1 and Elba2 must be linked in a ‘heterodimer’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In the tripartite Elba complex, this seems to be the role of Elba3. It brings Elba1 and Elba2 together by interacting with sequences in the N-terminal half of the two proteins. These conclusions are supported by a number of findings. First, it is possible to circumvent the requirement for Elba3 by fusing a heterologous dimerization domain, in this case GST, to the N-terminus of full length Elba1 and Elba2. When co-translated, these two fusion proteins shift the Elba probe without Elba3. On the other hand, they can still interact with Elba3 as the shift generated by the two proteins can be supershifted by the addition of Elba3. Second, the Elba1C and Elba2C proteins, which span the 130 amino acid C-terminal homology region, can reconstitute full DNA binding activity when fused to GST. Since GST is known to dimerize, but not form higher order complexes, this would argue that the Elba DNA binding pocket is likely formed by a GST-Elba1C:GST-Elba2C dimer rather than by some other more complicated combination of the two proteins. Moreover, this binary complex has the same sequence specificity as the native hetero-tripartite complex. On the other hand, the GST-Elba1C:GST-Elba2C proteins differ from the full length GST fusions in that they don't interact with Elba3.</p><p>While these findings are consistent with the model for the Elba complex shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, there are several unresolved but important issues. For one, though our experiments indicate that the BEN domain is essential for DNA binding, we were unable to demonstrate that it is sufficient. It is possible that steric hindrance from the closely linked GST moiety prevents formation of the DNA binding pocket; alternatively, the extended homology region may contain elements that are important for DNA binding. Another apparent anomaly is that the homodimers formed by the full length or the C-terminal GST fusions don't appear to bind to the Elba probe. Since we've found that the Elba factor can bind to variants of the Elba sequence, albeit with reduced affinity, we would have expected that the homodimers would exhibit at least some evidence of DNA binding activity. Further studies will be required to resolve these issues.</p><p>As would be the case for many other boundaries, the presence of functionally redundant elements in the full length <italic>Fab-7</italic> precludes a direct demonstration that a single factor like Elba is needed for <italic>Fab-7</italic> insulating activity either in the context of BX-C or in transgenes assays. However, several lines of evidence argue that Elba does in fact have such a function for the endogenous <italic>Fab-7</italic> boundary. To begin with, previous studies showed that the insulating activity of the 236-bp pHS1 <italic>Fab-7</italic> sub-element in early embryos is compromised when the Elba recognition sequence is mutated. Moreover, when multimerized, the Elba sequence is sufficient on its own to confer insulating activity. That the Elba factor is responsible for this insulating activity is supported by the effects of RNAi knockdowns in embryos carrying either the pHS1×4 transgene or the Elba sequence multimer. For all three Elba proteins, RNAi knockdowns compromises the insulating activity of both pHS1×4 and the Elba multimer. In contrast, knockdowns of the closely related BEN domain protein, Insv, have no effect.</p><p>Our findings would also explain why the insulating activity of the Elba factor/Elba sequence is developmentally restricted. Two of the three Elba proteins, Elba1 and Elba3, are encoded by genes that are active during the mid-blastula transition, but not later in development. Since the hetero-tripartite complex is required to reconstitute DNA binding activity, Elba insulating activity would be expected to peak during the blastoderm/early gastrula stage when high levels of <italic>elba1</italic> and <italic>elba3</italic> mRNA are expressed. However, it should gradually dissipate after transcription of <italic>elba1</italic> and <italic>elba3</italic> ceases. While we don't know precisely when Elba1 and Elba3 disappear, there is little Elba DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts of 6–12 hr embryos. Moreover, even though the <italic>elba2</italic> gene is expressed throughout development, it is not found associated with <italic>Fab-7</italic> in 9–12 hr embryos. Importantly, the results of the EMSA and ChIP experiments provide strong support for the idea that the requirement for Elba activity evident in the RNAi knockdowns reflects a direct role in insulating activity rather than indirect role.</p><p>One important question is why does a constitutive insulator like <italic>Fab-7</italic> utilized developmentally limited factors like Elba? A plausible explanation comes from the finding that boundaries are not autonomous entities, but rather function in combination (likely pairwise) with other boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai and Shen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Muravyova et al., 2001</xref>). Both boundary competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gohl et al., 2011</xref>) and boundary bypass experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kyrchanova et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maksimenko et al., 2008</xref>) indicate that some combinations are functional while others are not. Moreover, how different boundary combinations work together depends upon developmental stage and tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gohl et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the use of stage specific factors at <italic>Fab-7</italic> could reflect a need to optimize combinations with other nearby BX-C boundaries or the Abdominal-B promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kyrchanova et al., 2008b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2011</xref>). A number of findings are consistent with this idea. When heterologous boundaries are used to replace <italic>Fab-7</italic> in BX-C, they are unable to provide bypass activity, while their insulating activity can be lost in a stage and tissue specific fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hogga et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Fab-7</italic> is able to replace <italic>Fab-8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iampietro et al., 2008</xref>). Likewise, the boundary activity of <italic>Fab-7</italic> in a foreign environment is not only context dependent, but also varies during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gohl et al., 2011</xref>). Probably the most direct evidence that boundaries in BX-C like <italic>Fab-7</italic> are closely matched with their flanking neighbors comes from the boundary bypass experiments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kyrchanova et al. (2011)</xref>. They found that bypass is observed when <italic>Fab-7</italic> is combined with the neighboring boundaries <italic>Fab-6</italic> and <italic>Fab-8</italic>, while bypass interactions with boundaries from elsewhere in BX-C are only weak at best. Interestingly, in the cases that have been analyzed most thoroughly, boundary bypass is mediated by homologous protein:protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kyrchanova et al., 2008a</xref>). Thus, bypass is observed when multimerized binding sites for the dCTCF boundary factor are paired, but not when dCTCF binding sites are paired with sites for example Zw5. Though <italic>Fab-8</italic> differs from <italic>Fab-7</italic> in that it utilizes dCTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holohan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kyrchanova et al., 2011</xref>), EMSA experiments with 0–6 hr and 6–12 hr nuclear extracts indicate that they also have binding sites for several of the same stage specific factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2008</xref>; Wolle et al., unpublished data). These include sites for the Elba factor, and sites for two different late (6–12 hr) stage specific factors. Conceivably this could also be true for <italic>Fab-6</italic>.</p><p>Another question is the fate of Elba2 after Elba1 and Elba3 disappear. While Elba2 can't bind to the Elba sequence on its own, it could function as an insulator in other contexts using different protein partners and presumably also recognition sequences. A plausible partner would be the <italic>Notch</italic> signaling pathway protein Insv, which is encoded by a tightly linked gene that has a similar expression pattern to <italic>elba2</italic>. Insv and its closest mammalian relatives, the NAC proteins (which are thought to function as stem cell pluripotency genes, as well as in cocaine addiction and cancer), are believed to regulate transcription by acting as co-repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cha et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mackler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korutla et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duan et al., 2011</xref>). However, since our findings indicate that the BEN domains of Elba1 and Elba2 are essential for DNA binding, it would be reasonable to suppose that Insv as well as the mammalian counterparts are not co-repressors, but are rather sequence specific DNA binding proteins. Interestingly, like members of the BEN domain protein family, CTCF was initially thought to be a transcriptional repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filippova et al., 1996</xref>). Thus, a seemingly plausible speculation would be that other members of the BEN family besides the two Elba proteins function as insulators restricting the action of nearby enhancer elements instead of directly repressing transcription. Potentially supporting this idea is the finding that one of the mammalian BEN domain proteins, SMAR1, is a component of the nuclear matrix and associates with Matrix Attachment Regions (MARS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chattopadhyay et al., 2000</xref>). If this were the case, this would mean that CTCF is not the only vertebrate insulator protein. Also as is case for the Elba complex, modulating the expression or activity of Elba2, Insv or NAC1 in different tissues or cell types could change the regulatory domain landscapes, and potentially alter global patterns of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Embryo collection and storage</title><p>Oregon R population cages were used to collect embryos of the appropriate stage on apple juice plates.

Third, the ME1 sample contained a small amount of Elba activity raising the possibility that the Elba factor was included in the list of proteins detected by mass spectrometry in both the WE1 and ME1 samples. To address these problems, we needed a procedure that would substantially reduce the number of non-specific proteins and at the same time give much greater differences in Elba yield from wild type and mutant affinity beads.

The transcribed RNA strands were annealed by heating and then chilling, treated with DNase and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The dsRNAs were suspended in injection buffer so that the final concentration was approximately 1 μg/μl (3.6–4.3 μM).</p><p>Transgenic embryos were collected on 10-cm apple juice agar plates from fly cups incubated at 18°C for 30 min. They were lined up on a piece of apple juice agar and then transferred onto double-stick tape attached to a cover glass. The embryos were covered with Halocarbon oil 27 and dsRNA was injected on the ventral side at the middle of the embryo. Each set of injected embryos was incubated on cover glasses at different temperatures (18°C, room temperature, or 25°C) so that they would develop to stage 10–11 at approximately the same time. The staged embryos were washed with PBS from the cover slips into a cup and then stained with X-gal as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2008</xref>). For each experiment, buffer-injected embryos were also prepared and processed in parallel. Approximately 100 embryos from each dsRNA/buffer injection were photographed and the photographed embryos classified into Classes 1–5 according to the intensity of the <italic>ftz</italic> UPS enhancer driven LacZ stripe expression.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank D Wolle and Drs F Karch, RK Maeda and R Mishra for communicating unpublished results and Drs JT Kadonaga and R Pulak for the generous gift of embryos.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of <italic>eLife's</italic> Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual responsible for the peer review of your submission wishes to reveal his identity: Jim Kadonaga (Reviewing Editor).</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports.</p><p>This paper describes the purification of a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein termed Elba (Early Boundary activity), which binds to the pHS1 region in the <italic>Fab-7</italic> insulator element from the bithorax complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Two of these polypeptides, Elba1 and Elba2, harbor a C-terminal BEN domain. The third polypeptide, Elba3, does not contain any conserved motifs. Beyond the biochemical scheme used to isolate the Elba complex, most of the data presented in the article are convincing gel shift experiments that bring insights into the mechanism of binding of the tripartite complex. In brief, Elba3 plays the role of an adaptor protein, bringing Elba1 and 2 together, thereby establishing a complex that recognizes the asymmetric sequence motif through the BEN domains of Elba1 and 2. It is interesting to note here that only the complex containing all three polypeptides can bind to the recognition site and that the different binary combinations of the subunits do not exhibit distinct binding to the Fab-7 target site. The genomic organization of the genes encoding Elba1-3 is intriguing. Indeed the <italic>elba2</italic> gene is found in the immediate vicinity of another BEN domain protein, Insensitive (Insv), involved in neurogenesis and Notch signaling. The <italic>elba1</italic> gene corresponds to a locus previously described by Judy Lengyel's laboratory as Bsg25A, based on its short expression window during embryonic development, at blastoderm stage (Bsg stands for Blastoderm-specific-gene).</p><p>Intriguingly, although <italic>elba3</italic> does not have sequence homology to <italic>elba1</italic>/Bsg25A, its transcription unit is located next to <italic>elba1</italic>. In addition to their close proximity, the <italic>elba1</italic> and <italic>elba3</italic> genes share the striking feature of being expressed during a very short and specific time window in early development at the blastoderm stage. This tight and specific regulation of <italic>elba1</italic> and <italic>elba3</italic> is in perfect agreement with the previous characterization of the Elba activity by Aoki et al. (2008) and represent a strong argument that the factors purified biochemically indeed correspond to the original Elba activity.</p><p>Ideally, a functional characterization with mutants would be the next best demonstration that the Elba protein complex mediates the early insulator activity of Fab-7. Unfortunately such mutants are not available and their generation is beyond the scope of this article. The authors nevertheless perform the difficult experiment of injecting embryos carrying their ftz-lac Z based insulator construct with double strand RNAs targeted at inactivating <italic>elba1</italic>, <italic>elba2</italic> or <italic>elba3</italic>. While the quality of the embryos that are depicted in Figure 10 is not optimal (probably reflecting the fact that they have to be injected and are thus limited in numbers), this last experiment nevertheless supports the idea that depleting <italic>elba1</italic>, <italic>elba2,</italic> or <italic>elba3</italic> interferes with the early enhancer-blocking activity of Fab-7.</p><p>The discovery that Elba is a new, BEN-domain dependent, heteromeric, sequence-specific DNA binding protein, and developmentally restricted boundary factor, is a significant finding. Boundaries represent an important class of regulatory elements and the identification of new boundary factors is of general interest. This work also establishes that the conserved BEN domain can contribute to DNA recognition in a sequence-specific manner.</p><p>Hence, the paper is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> if it is revised in a manner that suitably addresses the specific comments below. In addition, the title should be modified because DNA-binding protein complexes with multiple polypeptides are not unusual.</p><p>1. Figure 10. In these assays, Elba could be functioning as a repressor rather than as a transcriptionally neutral boundary element. While either outcome would be interesting, it would be informative to address this issue. For example, the authors could use a reporter construct in which the &quot;Fab-7 pHS1x4&quot; fragment was upstream of the ftz enhancer.</p><p>2. Figure 10. It would be preferable if the authors tested two independent dsRNAs for the depletions as well as carried out some analysis of the extent of depletion (e.g., western blots, reverse transcription-PCR). Such experiments would strengthen this work. It is understood, however, that the parallel analysis of the three Elba subunits does provide some cross-validation.</p><p>3. The description of the isolation and identification of the Elba factor is long, too detailed and distracting. The authors should just state that the capacity of the initial affinity columns was exceeded and proceed with the sequential method that worked. </p><p>4. Does the binding of Elba interfere with GAGA factor (GAF) binding?</p><p>5. A control that demonstrates the BEN-deletion mutant proteins are stable would be useful. One could argue these particular mutants do not bind the sequence because they are unstable.</p><p>6. Figure 8. How does the expression profile of the three Elba factors look at later stages of development? One could imagine that since the expression of Elba3 returns at later stages, the expression of Elba1 might increase post-18 hr. Thus, in later stage, the three Elba subunits could be present.</p><p>7. Have the authors tried to ChIP Fab-7 sequences with the Elba3 antibodies?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00171.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1.

No silencing was observed for this 'upstream' construct, indicating that pHS1x4 must, like <italic>Fab-7</italic> itself, be placed between the enhancer and promoter to alter enhancer activity.</p><p>We also thought that this was a point that the readers might wonder about and for this reason we mentioned this old experiment parenthetically at the end of the section describing the dsRNA injections in Figure 10, which we have made more obvious to readers in the revised version.</p><p><italic>2. Figure 10. It would be preferable if the authors tested two independent dsRNAs for the depletions as well as carried out some analysis of the extent of depletion (e.g., western blots, reverse transcription-PCR). Such experiments would strengthen this work. It is understood, however, that the parallel analysis of the three Elba subunits does provide some cross-validation</italic>.</p><p>Here the critical issue is whether the loss of blocking activity in our dsRNA injection experiments is due to depletion of Elba activity or arises from off-targets effects on some unknown factor(s). Typically concerns about off-target effects are addressed using a 2<sup>nd</sup> dsRNA and showing that it has the same effect as the original. The supposition in this case is that if there are off-targets for the two dsRNAs, they will be different. We would argue that the finding that three independent dsRNAs, each targeting a different <italic>elba</italic> gene, disrupt boundary activity, while no effects are observed for the related gene <italic>insv</italic>, provides a much more rigorous demonstration of specificity, and more compelling evidence that the Elba factor is responsible for boundary activity, than would typically be provided in papers in which the authors use a second dsRNA to demonstrate that a specific gene/factor is required for a particular process. As for measuring the extent of depletion, this would be a very difficult experiment in the context of embryo injections and, importantly, would add little to the conclusions we draw from these experiments.</p><p><italic>3. The description of the isolation and identification of the Elba factor is long, too detailed and distracting. The authors should just state that the capacity of the initial affinity columns was exceeded and proceed with the sequential method that worked</italic>.</p><p>Description of Elba isolation/identification has been shortened.</p><p><italic>4. Does the binding of Elba interfere with GAGA factor (GAF) binding</italic>?</p><p>We don’t know the answer to this. While we know that the flanking GAGA sites are important for early boundary activity, we haven’t detected EMSA shifts that could be attributed to the GAGA binding sites either in early or late nuclear extracts. We have seen shifts for GAGA sequences elsewhere in <italic>Fab-7</italic> and <italic>Fab-8</italic> that we know, from supershift experiments, are generated by the GAGA factor. This would suggest that there is something odd about the two GAGA sites flanking the Elba sequence.</p><p><italic>5. A control that demonstrates the BEN-deletion mutant proteins are stable would be useful. One could argue these particular mutants do not bind the sequence because they are unstable</italic>.</p><p>In our EMSA experiments we incubate the reaction mix for ½ hr at room temperature before loading it onto the gel. To address this question we incubated individual proteins in reaction mix for increasing amounts of time up to an hour and then analyzed stability by Westerns. We found that both the wild type and the deletion proteins underwent degradation and about three-quarters to one half was left after an hour. The mutant proteins also seemed to be slightly less stable. However, the small difference in stability would not account for our failure to detect DNA binding activity with the Ben deletions.</p><p><italic>6. Figure 8. How does the expression profile of the three Elba factors look at later stages of development? One could imagine that since the expression of Elba3 returns at later stages, the expression of Elba1 might increase post-18 hr. Thus, in later stage, the three Elba subunits could be present</italic>.</p><p>Our Northerns and also ModEncode data suggest that <italic>elba3</italic> may be re-expressed in late embryos and during subsequent stages of development. By contrast, <italic>elba1</italic> doesn’t appear to be re-expressed (with the caveat that expression in only a single tissue or cell type might not have been detected). If this were correct, the Elba complex would not be re-formed. However, Elba3 could potentially link Elba2 to some other protein, e.g., Insv. It will be interest to explore this possibility.</p><p><italic>7. Have the authors tried to ChIP Fab-7 sequences with the Elba3 antibodies</italic>?</p><p>We have not tried yet, but we are planning to do so once we’ve made further improvements with our DSG/DSP cross-linking procedure. As noted in the text, standard formaldehyde cross-linking didn’t give reproducible results for Elba1/Elba2, even though both should be directly contacting DNA. In order to get reproducible results for these two proteins, we had to use chemical cross-linking reagents like DSG/DSP, which have relatively long spacers between the two functional groups. Since Elba3 probably doesn’t contact the DNA at all, we expect that the ChIP experiments for this protein will be more difficult than for Elba1/Elba2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
