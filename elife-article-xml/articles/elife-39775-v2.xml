Binding of cyclic nucleotides (cAMP/cGMP) elicits diverse functional responses in different channels within the family despite their high sequence and structure homology. The molecular mechanisms responsible for ligand discrimination and gating are unknown due to lack of correspondence between structural information and functional states. Using single particle cryo-electron microscopy and single-channel recording, we assigned functional states to high-resolution structures of SthK, a prokaryotic cyclic nucleotide-gated channel. The structures for apo, cAMP-bound, and cGMP-bound SthK in lipid nanodiscs, correspond to no, moderate, and low single-channel activity, respectively, consistent with the observation that all structures are in resting, closed states. The similarity between apo and ligand-bound structures indicates that ligand-binding domains are strongly coupled to pore and SthK gates in an allosteric, concerted fashion. The different orientations of cAMP and cGMP in the ‘resting’ and ‘activated’ structures suggest a mechanism for ligand discrimination.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39775.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Ion channels are essential for transmitting signals in the nervous system and brain. One large group of ion channels includes members that are activated by cyclic nucleotides, small molecules used to transmit signals within cells. These cyclic nucleotide-gated channels play an important role in regulating our ability to see and smell.</p><p>The activity of these ion channels has been studied for years, but scientists have only recently been able to look into their structure. Since structural biology methods require purified, well-behaved proteins, the members of this ion channel family selected for structural studies do not necessarily match those whose activity has been well established. There is a need for a good model that would allow both the structure and activity of a cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel to be characterized.</p><p>The cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel, SthK, from bacteria called <italic>Spirochaeta thermophila,</italic> was identified as such model because both its activity and its structure are accessible. Rheinberger et al. have used cryo electron microscopy to solve several high-resolution structures of SthK channels. In two of the structures, SthK was bound to either one of two types of activating cyclic nucleotides – cAMP or cGMP – and in another structure, no cyclic nucleotides were bound. Separately recording the activity of individual channels allowed the activity states likely to be represented by these structures to be identified.</p><p>Combining the results of the experiments revealed no activity from channels in an unbound state, low levels of activity for channels bound to cGMP, and moderate activity for channels bound to cAMP. Rheinberger et al. show that the channel, under the conditions experienced in cryo electron microscopy, is closed in all of the states studied. Unexpectedly, the binding of cyclic nucleotides produced no structural change even in the cyclic nucleotide-binding pocket of the channel, a region that was previously observed to undergo such changes when this region alone was crystallized. Rheinberger et al. deduce from this that the four subunits that make up the channel likely undergo the conformational change towards an open state all at once, rather than one by one.</p><p>The structures and the basic functional characterization of SthK channels provide a strong starting point for future research into determining the entire opening and closing cycle for a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel. Human equivalents of the channel are likely to work in similar ways. The results presented by Rheinberger et al. could therefore be built upon to help address diseases that result from deficiencies in cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, such as loss of vision due to retinal degradation (retinitis pigmentosa or progressive cone dystrophy) and achromatopsia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel</kwd><kwd>lipid nanodisc</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>single-channel recording</kwd><kwd>partial agonism</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHM 3198/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidpeter</surname><given-names>Philipp AM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM124451</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nimigean</surname><given-names>Crina M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM088352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nimigean</surname><given-names>Crina M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High resolution SthK channel cryo-EM structures in different ligand-bound states combined with single-channel functional data in the same conditions constrain a gating mechanism for CNG channels.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cyclic nucleotide modulated ion channels are physiologically important for visual and olfactory signal transduction and pacemaking activity in the heart and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaupp and Seifert, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Craven and Zagotta, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson and Siegelbaum, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biel et al., 2009</xref>). Their activity is dependent on the binding or dissociation of cyclic nucleotides (cAMP or cGMP) to a cytoplasmic cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) within the channel. This in turn leads to changes in the ionic flow across the membrane and alterations in the membrane potential, allowing an intracellular signal such as an increase in cAMP concentration to be transmitted across the membrane of the cell. The magnitude of the ion channel response to ligand binding modulates the final cellular response and can lead to different physiological outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">James and Zagotta, 2018</xref>). Thus, it is important to understand the molecular mechanism by which binding of ligands leads to modification of the open-closed equilibrium in these ion channels.</p><p>Cyclic nucleotide-modulated channels comprise a large family of ion channels in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaupp and Seifert, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Craven and Zagotta, 2006</xref>). In eukaryotes, they are categorized into two subfamilies: cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) and hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) channels. HCN channels are activated by hyperpolarizing voltages and this activity is modulated by cyclic nucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Santoro et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lyashchenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou and Siegelbaum, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kusch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ludwig et al., 1998</xref>), while CNG channels are activated by cyclic nucleotides and their activity is only slightly modulated by depolarizing voltages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaupp et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benndorf et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clayton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nache et al., 2006</xref>). Prokaryotic cyclic nucleotide-modulated channels, homologous in both sequence and structure to their eukaryotic counterparts, have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nimigean et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">James et al., 2017</xref>), but not investigated enough to warrant a categorization into one of these two groups.</p><p>Ligand binding and activation have been extensively studied in eukaryotic CNG and HCN channels using electrophysiology on channels expressed in heterologous expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaupp and Seifert, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2002</xref>). However, only recently, high resolution structural information for human HCN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>) and TAX-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2017</xref>) (a <italic>C. elegans</italic> CNG channel homolog), became available with the advent of single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kuhlbrandt, 2014</xref>). For HCN1, two structures were reported, in an apo and a cAMP-bound, closed conformation, while TAX-4 is in a cGMP-bound open conformation only. HCN1 channels are activated by hyperpolarization, while the addition of saturating cAMP only marginally shifts the activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Santoro et al., 1998</xref>), questioning whether cAMP is an agonist for this channel.</p><p>Different models for ligand gating have been proposed for HCN and CNG channels based on functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Biskup et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ulens and Siegelbaum, 2003</xref>). These models are all versions or combinations of two fundamental models proposed to work in allosteric proteins: the concerted and the sequential model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koshland et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Monod et al., 1965</xref>). In the concerted model, all subunits of the tetrameric channel change their conformation together, all at once, upon ligand binding and accordingly all subunits in one channel adopt the same conformation whether open or closed and irrespective of how many ligands are bound. The sequential model, in contrast, allows individual domains and/or subunits to change conformation independently upon ligand binding, one after the other, on the pathway towards the open state. The existing structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">James et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2017</xref>) are not sufficient to argue in favor of either model because there are not enough conformations available and because of the lack of direct correspondence between conformations and functional states. In order to address this void, we selected SthK, a prokaryotic cyclic nucleotide-modulated channel from <italic>Spirochaeta thermophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brams et al., 2014</xref>). We showed previously that SthK is activated by cyclic nucleotides and its activity is modulated by depolarizing voltages, making it more similar in this respect to CNG rather than HCN channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmidpeter et al., 2018</xref>). The channel shares about 35% sequence similarity with eukaryotic CNG channels, and, unlike its eukaryotic counterparts, lends itself easily to high-resolution single-channel functional studies as well as structural investigations, providing a unique model to investigate ligand gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmidpeter et al., 2018</xref>). We present here the high-resolution cryo-EM structures of SthK in the apo, cAMP-bound, and cGMP-bound states in lipid nanodiscs. This is, to our knowledge, the first apo, resting structure of a member of the CNG channel family. The single channel electrophysiology data allow us to specifically assign functional states to the SthK structures in different ligand-bound conformations, and we propose a concerted mechanism for CNG channel gating, as well as a molecular basis for cyclic nucleotide discrimination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SthK is a cAMP-gated potassium channel</title><p>SthK has been previously reported to function as a CNG-like channel when expressed in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brams et al., 2014</xref>), and structures of the soluble ligand-binding domains in complex with both cAMP and cGMP have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kesters et al., 2015</xref>). We recently described an SthK ion channel construct that robustly expresses in <italic>E. coli</italic> and we established that the purified protein is active in binding, flux, and single-channel electrophysiology assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmidpeter et al., 2018</xref>). Purified and reconstituted SthK showed no activity in cyclic nucleotide-free conditions, became active upon cAMP application, channel activity was increased upon membrane depolarization and the channel showed no evidence of inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmidpeter et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Figure 4B). Nevertheless, the maximal open probability of SthK in saturating concentrations of cAMP was less than 1, even in the presence of depolarizing voltages, indicating that cAMP is a partial agonist for SthK. The cAMP-induced activity is inhibited by cGMP application, although infrequent single-channel openings are still observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmidpeter et al., 2018</xref>). Unlike in cyclic nucleotide-free conditions, the infrequent openings are still present in high concentrations of cGMP alone, indicating that cGMP is not an antagonist for SthK, as has been previously proposed based on patch-clamp recordings from oocytes expressing SthK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brams et al., 2014</xref>), but rather an extremely poor partial agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The difference in attribution is likely due to the extremely low open probability of SthK in cGMP making it easy to miss when recording from cells, or from the difference in the experimental setup (purified channels in controlled lipid bilayer composition versus channels expressed in oocytes).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39775.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM structures of SthK.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Apo SthK side-view density map, colored by subunit.

The top layer contains the transmembrane domain (TMD) with the ion-conducting pore, and a voltage sensor-like four transmembrane helix bundle, which presumably is responsible for voltage modulation of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). The voltage sensor-like domains are in a non-swapped configuration, similar to HCN1, TAX-4, and LliK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">James et al., 2017</xref>), but unlike MloK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kowal et al., 2018</xref>). The bottom layer, at the intracellular side, consists of four cyclic nucleotide binding domains (CNBDs), which contain the ligand-binding pockets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Sandwiched in between the top and bottom layers is the C-linker domain, strategically located to relay the ligand binding event from the CNBDs to the channel pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The C-linker/CNBD complex is domain-swapped with respect to the transmembrane region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>).

The pore widens below the selectivity filter into an aqueous cavity. Roughly half way down the membrane, in the middle of this cavity, the side chains of I215 pointing radially towards the pore axis, constrict the pore to a diameter of the size of a dehydrated potassium ion similar to what is seen in the HCN1 and LliK channels pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">James et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>).

The channel has a voltage sensor-like domain S1-S4, and the S4 transmembrane helix contains 4 basic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although we do not have direct evidence that this is a <italic>bona fide</italic> voltage sensor, the similarities to other known voltage sensor domains and the increase in channel activity with depolarization lead us to hypothesize that the S1-S4 helices in SthK also form a voltage sensor. Two out of the four basic residues in S4, R111 and K114, are located within the electric field drop across membrane and are likely to contribute to the gating charge, while R120 and R124 are solvent exposed due to a cavity on the intracellular side of the S4 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The small number of arginine and lysine residues in the S4 helix of SthK is in agreement with the lower voltage dependence of this channel compared with other voltage-gated channels, which have up to 9 positively-charged residues in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bezanilla, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tao et al., 2010</xref>). L54 on the S2 helix, at the equivalent position of the phenylalanine, the so-called charge transfer center in voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tao et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>), has its side chain protruding right in between R111 and K114 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that L54 is the charge transfer center in SthK. Although most charge transfer centers are either phenylalanines or tyrosines, the voltage-gated KvAP potassium channel also has a leucine at this position, similar with SthK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since the channel experiences a membrane potential of 0 mV on the EM grid, and the median value for voltage activation is about 85 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmidpeter et al., 2018</xref>), the voltage sensor is likely in the down, resting conformation in the SthK structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmidpeter et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). Furthermore, both R111 and K114 appear strongly anchored in place by multiple attractive interactions within short distances with residues from both S2 and S3 helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), in agreement with the requirement for strong depolarizations needed to activate the channel. In comparison, the positively-charged residues on the S4 helix of HCN1 (easier to open with voltage than SthK) appear less strongly anchored in place with counter charges than those in SthK, while those on TAX-4 (quasi voltage-insensitive) appear more strongly anchored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Previous crystal structures of isolated C-linker/CNBD domains of other CNG/HCN channels, and, importantly, also of SthK itself, allowing direct comparisons, have the most C-terminal helix of the CNBD (the C-helix) packed tightly like a lid against the binding pocket and interacting closely with the ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>, grey and wheat, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kesters et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saponaro et al., 2014</xref>).

We used single-channel analysis to define the functional state of SthK (open/closed) in the conditions employed to determine the structure with cryo-EM. In saturating cAMP concentrations, the open probability (Po) of SthK is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmidpeter et al., 2018</xref>) (~0.2–0.5, at +100 mV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), indicating that cAMP is only a partial agonist and not a full agonist for SthK. Additionally, as we showed before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>), SthK activity is increased by depolarization, and thus in the conditions on the microscope grid (at 0 mV, where the voltage sensor is not activated yet) the open probability is even lower (~0.05–0.1) and the open intervals are very short (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmidpeter et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, we expect that at most 5–10% of the channels imaged from a grid frozen in saturating cAMP conditions are in the open state. Moreover, despite our efforts towards detecting the open state, 3D classification never produced a class that could correspond to an open state, thus the channels that contribute to the final density map are mostly in a closed state.</p><p>The potential mixed-configuration binding of the cAMP in the binding pocket may provide an explanation for its partial agonist nature. As discussed above, cAMP may bind to apo SthK in both the <italic>syn</italic> and the <italic>anti</italic> configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, the ‘activated’ SthK CNBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kesters et al., 2015</xref>) displays cAMP bound in the <italic>anti</italic> configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

Thus, only a subset of all cAMP binding events (those where cAMP is in <italic>anti</italic>) can lead to channel opening, likely contributing to the subunitary open probability of SthK in saturating cAMP. On the other hand, in HCN2 channels, where cAMP is an efficacious agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wainger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zagotta et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>syn</italic> cAMP may not clash with the C-helix of HCN2 channels and may even make favorable interactions due to the different amino acid composition of the HCN2 C-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Weak-partial-agonist effect of cGMP binding reflected in the structure</title><p>The cGMP-bound SthK structure is closed, in agreement with the role of cGMP as very poor partial agonist (Po ~0.003, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), where less than 0.3% of the channels on the cryo-EM grid are expected to be in the open state. SthK discriminates strongly between cAMP and cGMP in the degree with which each of these ligands promote channel opening. The weak activation of SthK by cGMP may be explained by the different binding orientations of cGMP between the resting and ‘activated’ CNBDs. As we pointed out above, cGMP can be better accommodated in the <italic>syn</italic> configuration in the density map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This was surprising, given that cGMP was found to bind in an <italic>anti</italic> configuration in the ‘activated’ CNBD of SthK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kesters et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) likely prefers the <italic>syn</italic> cGMP due to the additional interaction with T378 also mentioned above, which cannot occur when the cGMP is in <italic>anti,</italic> and also because of the <italic>syn</italic>-biased distribution of cGMP configurations in solution. On the other hand, <italic>syn</italic> cGMP cannot be easily accommodated in the ‘activated’ CNBD binding pocket, likely due to a clash with the side chain of L422 on the C-terminal C-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, insert). We propose that the reason for the weak partial agonism of cGMP for SthK is that the apo conformation strongly prefers to bind the <italic>syn</italic> cGMP, which does not allow the CNBD to ‘activate’.</p><p>This is in contrast to TAX-4 and the isolated CNBD from HCN2, where <italic>syn</italic> cGMP stabilizes the ‘activated’ CNBD via favorable interactions between the base and the C-helix, which are absent in SthK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zagotta et al., 2003</xref>).

This can occur if strong allosteric coupling exists between the CNBD and the pore in the full-length channel. We propose that when ligand binds to the isolated CNBD, the binding energy is sufficient to activate it and change its conformation, but it is not enough to activate the CNBD when it is part of the full-length channel, suggesting that the CNBD and the pore domain must change conformation together, in a concerted way.</p><p>The absence of a local conformational change in the binding pocket despite the bound ligand can thus be understood in the context of a concerted Monod-Wyman-Changeux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Monod et al., 1965</xref>) (MWC) model, previously proposed to describe the gating of CNG/HCN channels and other multi-subunit ligand-gated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colquhoun and Sivilotti, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lape et al., 2008</xref>). This model stipulates that the channel exists in two conformations: closed (or resting), and open (or activated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, top). All closed conformations, whether apo or ligand bound, are identical, differing only in the number of ligands bound (all squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, top). Each closed channel can undergo a concerted conformational change to an open channel, meaning that all subunits undergo the closed to open transition at the same time. All open conformations are also identical to each other (all circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, top). This model requires that the difference between partial agonists and full agonists lies only in the efficacy with which the agonist can induce the concerted conformational change (the vertical transition from all squares to all circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, top). The conformational change is favored when efficacious agonists are bound, so that most bound channels are open. Conversely, the conformational change is less favored when less efficacious agonists are bound, so that most bound channels are closed. Our data shows identical, closed structures for the apo and inefficacious, partial agonist-bound SthK channels, which is consistent with the concerted gating model (the functional states - closed - that we solved with cryo-EM are indicated by dashed green circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, top). In contrast, identical structures are not expected from ion channels gating according to the sequential (or Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer, KNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koshland et al., 1966</xref>]) model, which predicts that binding of partial agonists and full agonists will induce specific closed conformational states (the red and green ligands leading to circles and octagons, respectively in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, bottom), different than the apo state (squares) and perhaps different from each other (circles versus octagons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), leading to channel opening.

To our knowledge, this study provides the first structural evidence that a concerted step exists in the gating of CNG channels. Conversely, other ligand-gated channels, such as the AMPA receptors, have been proposed to gate according to the sequential model, based on findings that the structures of the ligand binding domains display major differences depending on the type of agonist/antagonist bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Armstrong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sobolevsky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Twomey et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Additional evidence frequently invoked to support concerted channel gating and that we also found for SthK are the lack of subconductance states observed at the single-channel level and the equal single-channel amplitudes when the channel opens in response to cAMP or cGMP-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that there is only one structurally distinct open state, with the caveats that we are not able to observe states shorter than the dead time of the recording (~180 µs) and that structurally distinct open channel conformations may display the same single-channel current amplitude. Furthermore, in addition to the single ‘resting’ CNBD conformation reported here for SthK, there is also only one ‘activated’ CNBD conformation reported by the crystal structures of the isolated CNBDs of SthK (where the cAMP-bound is identical to the cGMP-bound conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kesters et al., 2015</xref>), despite their quite different phenotypes at the functional level).</p><p>In contrast to what we observe with SthK, the CNBDs in the full-length apo HCN1 channel appear to be almost identical to those in the cAMP-bound HCN1, which are in the same ‘activated’ conformation seen in other CNBDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, in HCN1, cAMP binding does not lead to a drastic conformational change likely because the CNBDs are already ‘pre-activated’ in the absence of ligand. This is in agreement with functional data showing not only that cAMP binding has minimal effect on HCN1 channel activity but also that they are the fastest activating HCN channels, requiring the least amount of hyperpolarization for opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Santoro et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Model for agonist-induced channel activation</title><p>We do not have the structure of the full-length open SthK channel.

Thus, an overlay of SthK and TAX-4 structures reveal the regions in the channel that likely have to rearrange and how, in order to go from a closed to an open conformation. In TAX-4, the CNBD/C-linker domains are closer to the membrane, and are rotated outwards, ~9 degrees counterclockwise viewed from the extracellular side compared to SthK apo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–D</xref>). The B- and C-helices are shifted together as a rigid body to bring the C-helix in close contact with the ligand, and consequently the siphon is also displaced vertically towards the membrane to make room (Labeled as 1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The C-linker from the adjacent subunit (labeled as 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) appears to have undergone a translation and rotation to accommodate for the displaced siphon, and since it is directly connected to the end of the S6 helices, they are consequently widened at the intracellular side.

Three datasets for SthK-cAMP containing 5473 micrographs (823, 2210, 2440 for each dataset, respectively) were first separately subjected to two rounds of 2D classification using two-times binned particles. 572844 particles from all three datasets were combined after the 2D classification and further classified into 20 classes in 3D without applying symmetry using a 40 Å low-pass filtered map of HCN1 generated in Xmipp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sorzano et al., 2004</xref>) as an initial reference (PDB: 5U6O). 233053 particles from four 3D classes showing a tetrameric channel arrangement were re-extracted, unbinned, and subjected to 3D Refinement applying C4 symmetry resulting in a 3.43 Å resolution map. From this point on, all processing steps were done with C4 symmetry applied. Further improvement of the resolution was achieved by focused classification using a mask excluding the nanodisc. The highest resolution class out of ten with most detailed features containing 81501 particles was subjected to a final 3D refinement. After conversion, the refinement was restarted applying a nanodisc-excluding mask. The resolution of refined maps was assessed by RELION postprocessing and the gold standard FSC value 0.143 using a mask that excluded the nanodisc.

One subunit of SthK-CNBD-cAMP crystal structure (PDB 4D7T) was docked into the density map of SthK-cAMP using UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). After a first round of refinement using phenix.real_space_refine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afonine et al., 2013</xref>) miss-aligned regions were manually adjusted in COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>). The transmembrane domain of one SthK subunit was then built de novo in COOT using bulky side chains (Phe, Trp, Arg) to establish the register of the alpha helices. The finished model of one SthK-cAMP subunit was subjected to real space refinement in PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afonine et al., 2013</xref>). The tetramer was obtained by placing monomers into all four subunits (UCSF Chimera). The new model was refined in real space applying non-crystallographic symmetry and secondary structure restraints (PHENIX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>]). The atomic model of an individual SthK-cAMP subunit was used as initial model for both the SthK-cGMP and the SthK-apo structures and refined against the respective density maps, following the same process. Outliers were fixed manually, and specific regions in the protein that display very low resolution and lack of definition (the S2-S3 loop, and the last ~2 helical turns of the C-terminal helix) were removed using COOT in all final models. The side chains of several residues were not 100% defined, but since they were within a recognizable stretch with a clear secondary structure and register, we decided to model them as the amino acid indicated in the sequence. The models were analyzed with Molprobity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) and EMRinger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barad et al., 2015</xref>) for validation. For further cross validation and to check for overfitting, all atoms of each model were randomly displaced by 0.5 Å and each resulting model was refined against the first half-map obtained from processing. We then calculated the FSC between the refined models and the half-maps used during refinement and compared them with the FSC between the refined models and the other half-maps, not used during refinement. In addition, the FSC between the refined model and sum of both half maps was calculated. The nanodisc area in all maps was excluded by applying the same mask used in RELION postprocessing to prevent non-meaningful correlation at low resolution. Correlations at higher resolution were not influenced by the mask. The resulting FSC curves were similar showing no evidence of overfitting. The final models contained amino acids 10–62 and 76–412 (SthK-cAMP, PDB 6CJU), 10–68 and 76–412 (SthK-cGMP, PDB 6CJT), and 10–65 and 80–415 (SthK-apo, PDB 6CJQ). HOLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smart et al., 1996</xref>) was used to measure the pore size and water accessible cavities in the voltage sensor domain. ‘Omit’ maps between experimental data and atomic models were calculated using phenix.real_space_diff_map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Afonine, 2017</xref>) (PHENIX).

Briefly, an artificial lipid bilayer was formed over a ~100 µm diameter hole in the partition separating the <italic>cis</italic> (top) and <italic>trans</italic> (bottom) chamber of the recording system by painting a 6.25 mg/mL solution of 1,2-dioleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhPC) in <italic>n</italic>-decane (Sigma). The solutions in both chambers contain 97 mM KCl, 3 mM KOH, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.0 . Agar bridges in the two chambers connect via Ag/AgCl pellet electrodes to an Axopatch 200A/B amplifier (Molecular Devices). All electrophysiological signals are filtered at 1000 Hz with an 8-pole low-pass Bessel filter, digitized at 20 KHz with Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices) and collected using Clampex software (V10, Molecular Devices). Bilayer formation was monitored electronically using an in-house designed protocol in Clampex. Freshly-thawed and briefly sonicated SthK-containing liposomes were applied to the <italic>cis</italic>-side of the bilayer, and fusion events were monitored in the Gap-Free recording mode in Clampex under +100 mV applied voltage. The channel orientation was determined by having cAMP only on one side of the bilayer, since SthK displays no activity in the absence of cAMP. The system was set up so that only channels with the CNBDs facing the <italic>trans</italic> chamber were recorded. The <italic>trans</italic> chamber was serially perfused to different conditions to determine the channel response to cyclic nucleotides. The single-channel data was analyzed in Clampfit (Molecular Devices) with no additional filter applied unless stated otherwise. The dwell-time analysis was performed using the Single-Channel Search module in Clampfit. The dwell-time histograms include only events longer than 360 µs (two times the dead time). The closed dwell-time histograms additionally do not contain the very rare events longer than 500 ms. All plots and fits were made in Clampfit and then imported into Adobe Illustrator for final figure assembly.

Your article has been reviewed by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor, Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1. The Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript reporting three new cryo-EM structures of the prokaryotic SthK channel from <italic>Spirochaeta thermophila</italic>. SthK is a K<sup>+</sup> selective channel that is modulated by cyclic nucleotides binding to the cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) in the intracellular C-terminus of the channel. Single channel data presented here shows that SthK is activated by cAMP and by membrane depolarization, although the open probability of the channel at 0 mV is only 0.15 in the presence of what appears to be a saturating concentration of cAMP, making this nucleotide a relatively weak agonist. Only occasional openings are observed in the presence of cGMP, making this nucleotide an even weaker agonist. The authors solve the structure of SthK in the absence of nucleotides (apo) and in the presence of either cAMP or cGMP. This is the first structure of a full-length cyclic nucleotide regulated channel in the apo state. One of the most interesting features of the structures is that all three are very similar, the pore appears closed and nucleotide binding does not cause any detectable structural change even in the CNBD. The authors clearly discuss the implications of their work for understanding the mechanisms of gating in the larger family, and interpret their structures as support for an allosteric mechanism of gating. The manuscript received thoughtful review at another journal, and the authors have revised the manuscript to address each of the points raised. The reviews and revised manuscript were reviewed by the Editor, who decided to invite revision to address several remaining issues that can be addressed with careful revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The discussion in the subsection “Ion channel pore” concerning the location of the gate seems counterintuitive. The diameter of the pore at I215 in SthK would seem to suggest this relatively intracellular region would be a barrier to ion permeation of hydrated ions. The most straightforward interpretation of the structure would be that the intracellular pore is likely a gate and that the selectivity filter may or may not play an additional role. The authors should consider revising this section.</p><p>2) In the subsections “SthK architecture” and “Voltage sensor”, when discussing the S1-S4 domains, the authors should tone down assertions that this domain is responsible for the voltage-dependent behavior they observe. That domain may serve as a voltage sensor in SthK, but at this point it is speculation and should be stated to be such. There are now a lot of structures of ion channels with S1-S4 domains (CNG, TRP) that have yet to implicated in voltage sensing.</p><p>3) Please go through all legends and make sure the concentration of cyclic nucleotides is specified. Figure 2E and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 are good examples.</p><p>4) The authors have no constraint on how many figures can appear in the main text, and the authors should consider moving some out of the supplement. Supplementary figure 9E for example, should clearly be moved to appear alongside Figure 2E. The other parts of Supplementary figure 9, Supplementary figure 7 and Supplementary figure 11 might be better to appear in the main text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39775.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The discussion in the subsection “Ion channel pore” concerning the location of the gate seems counterintuitive.
