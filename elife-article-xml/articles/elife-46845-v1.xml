undergo metamorphosis based on the presence of specific bacteria. Although this microbe–animal interaction is critical for the life cycles of diverse marine animals, what types of biochemical cues from bacteria that induce metamorphosis has been a mystery. Metamorphosis of larvae of the tubeworm <italic>Hydroides elegans</italic> is induced by arrays of phage tail-like contractile injection systems, which are released by the bacterium <italic>Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea</italic>. Here we identify the novel effector protein Mif1. By cryo-electron tomography imaging and functional assays, we observe Mif1 as cargo inside the tube lumen of the contractile injection system and show that the <italic>mif1</italic> gene is required for inducing metamorphosis. Purified Mif1 is sufficient for triggering metamorphosis when electroporated into tubeworm larvae. Our results indicate that the delivery of protein effectors by contractile injection systems may orchestrate microbe–animal interactions in diverse contexts.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46845.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many marine animals, including corals and tubeworms, begin life as larvae swimming in open water before transforming into adults that anchor themselves to the seabed. These transformations, known as metamorphoses, are often triggered by certain types of bacteria that form friendly relationships (or “symbioses”) with the animals.</p><p>One such symbiosis forms between a bacterium called <italic>Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea</italic> and a tubeworm known as <italic>Hydroides elegans.</italic> Previous studies have shown that <italic>P. luteoviolacea</italic> produces syringe-like structures known as Metamorphosis Associated Contractile structures (or MACs for short) that are responsible for stimulating metamorphosis in the tubeworm larvae. Some viruses that infect bacteria use similar structures to inject molecules into their host cells. However, it was not clear whether MACs were also able to inject molecules into cells.</p><p>Here, Ericson, Eisenstein et al. used a technique called cryo-electron tomography combined with genetic and biochemical approaches to study how the MACs of <italic>P. luteoviolacea</italic> trigger metamorphosis in tubeworms. The experiments identified a protein in the bacteria named Mif1 that was required for the tubeworms to transform. The bacteria loaded Mif1 into the tube of the MAC structure and then injected it into the tubeworms. Further experiments showed that inserting Mif1 alone into tubeworms was sufficient to activate metamorphosis.</p><p>Mif1 is the first protein from bacteria to be shown to activate metamorphosis, but it is likely that many more remain to be discovered. Since other marine animals also form symbioses with bacteria, understanding how Mif1 and other similar proteins work may inform efforts to restore coral reefs and other fragile ecosystems, and increase the production of oysters and other shellfish. Furthermore, MACs and related structures may have the potential to be developed into biotechnology tools that deliver drugs and other molecules directly into animal cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>contractile injection system</kwd><kwd>metamorphosis</kwd><kwd>symbiosis</kwd><kwd>phage</kwd><kwd>T6SS</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Harold and June Memorial Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ericson</surname><given-names>Charles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Norma Sullivan Memorial Endowed Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ericson</surname><given-names>Charles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>Dianne K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R21DC013180-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zeller</surname><given-names>Robert W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000006</institution-id><institution>Office of Naval Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N00014-17-1-2677</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shikuma</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000006</institution-id><institution>Office of Naval Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N00014-16-1-2135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shikuma</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000006</institution-id><institution>Office of Naval Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N00014-14-1-0340</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>Dianne K</given-names></name><name><surname>Shikuma</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

One of the most pervasive examples of bacteria stimulating development is the induction of animal metamorphosis by bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hadfield, 2011</xref>). During these interactions in marine environments, surface-bound bacteria often serve as environmental triggers that induce mobile animal larvae to settle on a surface and undergo metamorphosis. Although the stimulation of metamorphosis by bacteria is critical for diverse animal-mediated processes such as coral reef formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Webster et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Whalan and Webster, 2014</xref>), the recruitment of stocks for marine fisheries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dworjanyn and Pirozzi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2010</xref>) and the fouling of submerged surfaces like the hulls of ships (i.e. biofouling) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Khandeparker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nedved and Hadfield, 2008</xref>), we know little about the mechanisms that govern this microbe–animal interaction.</p><p>Despite the fact that the link between bacteria and animal metamorphosis was first discovered in the 1930s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zobell and Allen, 1935</xref>), few bacterial products have been described that stimulate this developmental transition. To date, identified bacterial cues can all be classified as small molecules. Two examples are the small bacterial metabolite tetrabromopyrrole, which induces partial or complete metamorphosis of corals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sneed et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tebben et al., 2011</xref>) and the polar molecule histamine from algae or associated microbes, which induces urchin metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Swanson et al., 2007</xref>). To our knowledge, however, no proteinaceous bacterial cues have yet been identified that stimulate animal metamorphosis.</p><p>To investigate how bacteria induce animal metamorphosis, we have previously studied the interaction between the tubeworm <italic>Hydroides elegans</italic> (hereafter <italic>Hydroides</italic>) and the bacterium <italic>Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hadfield et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang and Hadfield, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nedved and Hadfield, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shikuma et al., 2016</xref>). We found that <italic>P. luteoviolacea</italic> produces arrays of Metamorphosis Associated Contractile structures (MACs) that induce the metamorphosis of <italic>Hydroides</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shikuma et al., 2014</xref>). MACs are an example of a Contractile Injection System (CIS); macromolecular machines that are specialized to puncture membranes and often deliver proteinaceous effectors into target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brackmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>). Like other CISs, MACs are evolutionarily related to the contractile tails of bacteriophages (bacterial viruses) and are composed of an inner tube protein (homologous to gp19 from phage T4 and Hcp from type six secretion systems) surrounded by a contractile sheath, a tail-spike, and a baseplate complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shikuma et al., 2014</xref>). The conserved mechanism is driven by contraction of the sheath, which propels the inner tube/spike into the target cell.</p><p>Different ways of loading effectors onto a CIS have been suggested. Translocation mechanisms of effectors via the spike complex of a CIS have been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Quentin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shneider et al., 2013</xref>). The presence of an alternative pathway of loading effectors into the inner tube lumen has been speculated but is only poorly understood. For example, an amorphous density inside the inner tube of the Antifeeding prophage (Afp) was attributed to either the toxin payload or a tape-measuring protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Heymann et al., 2013</xref>). Other classes of effectors were found to interact with the inner tube protein (Hcp) and are likely released post-firing by tube dissociation in the target cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Silverman et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we set out to identify a potential metamorphosis-inducing effector that MACs inject into <italic>Hydroides</italic> larvae, as well as the loading of such an effector into MACs. We show that a previously identified genomic region in <italic>P. luteoviolacea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shikuma et al., 2016</xref>) encodes a bacterial protein that localizes to the inner tube lumen of the MAC structure and is necessary for inducing the metamorphosis of <italic>Hydroides</italic> larvae. Our results identify a proteinaceous effector stimulating animal metamorphosis and provide a direct visualization of an effector in the tube lumen of an assembled CIS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Two bacterial genes are responsible for densities within the inner tube lumen of MACs and are involved in metamorphosis induction</title><p>We previously identified a genomic locus in <italic>P. luteoviolacea</italic> encoding six genes (gene numbers JF50_12590, JF50_12595, JF50_12600, JF50_12605, JF50_12610 and JF50_12615) that was essential for inducing the larvae of <italic>Hydroides</italic> to undergo metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shikuma et al., 2016</xref>). Here we analyzed biofilms of strains with in-frame deletions of each of the six genes and tested their ability to induce <italic>Hydroides</italic> metamorphosis. The ΔJF50_12605 and ΔJF50_12615 mutants exhibited a reduced ability to induce metamorphosis (less than 20%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), while mutation of the other four genes had no observable effect. When JF50_12605 and JF50_12615 were replaced back into their native chromosomal loci, metamorphosis induction was restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We confirmed the effect of MACs on <italic>Hydroides</italic> metamorphosis by producing cell-free MAC array preparations. While larvae exposed to MACs from a ∆JF50_12615 mutant did not induce metamorphosis (even at high concentrations), MACs from a ∆JF50_12605 mutant induced metamorphosis when added at higher doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A/B</xref></xref>).

The densities in the tube lumen reinforced less strongly compared to the sheath-tube complex, which could be caused by one or a combination of the following factors: 1) during averaging, the alignment of the cargo was affected by the strong densities from the sheath-tube, 2) the cargo was not structured or flexible, and/or 3) the cargo was present at a sub-stoichiometric amount compared to tube subunits or tube-rings. In any case, it is likely that the packet-like shape of the cargo density was caused by alignment artifacts.

However, neither JF50_12605, nor Mif1 interacted with MacT1 (JF50_12680, tube). Together, these data indicate that Mif1 is present within the MAC structure and represents the densities seen in the tube lumen, while JF50_12605 might act as a chaperone that helps to localize Mif1 inside the MAC tube. Mif1, however, could also associate with MACs independently of JF50_12605 in an inefficient manner. This is shown by 1) the residual presence of Mif1 in MACs from a ∆JF50_12605 mutant as detected by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and 2) the fact that high concentrations of a cell-free ∆JF50_12605 MAC extract can induce metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Purified and electroporated Mif1 protein induces tubeworm metamorphosis</title><p>Because our results suggested that Mif1 was loaded into the MAC tube lumen, we next tested whether Mif1 was sufficient for stimulating metamorphosis when delivered to <italic>Hydroides</italic> larvae.

These insights are significant for different fields of research as discussed below.</p><p>First, previously reported bacterial cues for animal metamorphosis are all classified as small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sneed et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Swanson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tebben et al., 2011</xref>). The identification of a protein (Mif1) that stimulates tubeworm metamorphosis requires us to expand the scope of possible biomolecules and mechanisms by which bacteria stimulate animal development. Our findings suggest that rather than MACs stimulating metamorphosis solely by physical puncturing and depolarization of larval membranes, the delivered Mif1 protein could have an enzymatic activity. This challenges previous hypotheses on metamorphosis induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carpizo-Ituarte and Hadfield, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yool et al., 1986</xref>), however, it would be in line with many studies on other eukaryote-targeting CIS effectors with enzymatic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ma and Mekalanos, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vlisidou et al., 2019</xref>). Future investigations will shed light on the molecular mechanism by which Mif1 triggers animal metamorphosis, which is a challenging task, given that Mif1 does not feature any recognizable conserved protein domains.</p><p>Second, our results directly showed the previously hypothesized possibility of effector delivery via the tube lumen of a CIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Heymann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shneider et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Silverman et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, the comparison of MACs with a different class of CIS, namely the Type Six Secretion System (T6SS), reveals significant differences. The T6SS effectors that are thought to be delivered by the T6SS tube lumen show protein–protein interactions between the T6SS effector and the T6SS tube protein (Hcp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Silverman et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, we did not detect such interactions between Mif1 and MAC tube protein. One possible explanation could be that the biophysical characteristics of the T6SS tube and the MAC tube are different. While the T6SS tube is inherently unstable and disassembles soon after contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Szwedziak and Pilhofer, 2019</xref>), inner tubes of MACs and other extracellular CISs (and contractile phages) can be readily detected by electron microscopy and therefore seem to be much more stable. Given our observation that expelled MAC tubes were always empty (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), this poses the question of how the effectors exit such a stable tube after contraction. We hypothesize that this could be the very reason for weak or entirely absent interactions between Mif1 and MAC tube, as well as for the low-density region that was seen in subtomogram averages separating Mif1 and MAC tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Another mechanistic consequence of low affinity between Mif1 and tube could be the requirement of an assembly factor, that is JF50_12605, that allows for efficient targeting of Mif1 to the tube.</p><p>Third, our insights into MAC function could be significant to re-engineer the system for future medical and biotechnological applications. As micron-scale, syringe-like structures, MACs have potential for being developed as delivery systems targeting eukaryotic cells. Extracellular CISs such as MACs are of particular interest, because they are released from the producing bacterial cell and autonomously bind to the target cell’s surface. Extracellular CISs that target bacterial pathogens are already under development as narrow host-range antimicrobial agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scholl, 2017</xref>). The identification of effectors carried by MACs provides the basis for loading MACs with a cargo of choice. We recently reported a second effector that MACs deliver to eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rocchi et al., 2019</xref>), expanding the number of MAC effectors that could be engineered. Intriguingly, a cryotomogram of the ∆<italic>pne1</italic> (JF50_12610) mutant shows that the tube has a filled phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The filled phenotype suggests that Pne1 is not found within the inner tube, but instead could be loaded in a different location (e.g. spike) within the MACs complex. Understanding tube lumen-delivered effectors could be particularly helpful, based on the potential of a higher payload per CIS, as compared to spike-bound effectors.</p><p>Fourth, the identification of Mif1 and its delivery mechanism will facilitate the investigation of how bacterial factors trigger animal signaling systems, leading to metamorphosis. This could have potential practical applications for preventing biofouling, improving aquaculture husbandry, restoring degraded ecosystems like coral reefs, and as a biotechnology platform.</p><p>The fact that bacteria are known to stimulate metamorphosis in every major group of animals alive today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hadfield, 2011</xref>), combined with the detection of MAC-like gene clusters in microbes from diverse environments including the ocean, terrestrial environments and even the human gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Böck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>), underscores the huge diversity of bacterium–animal interactions that remains to be explored.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Metamorphosis assays</title><p>Bioassays were conducted with specimens of <italic>Hydroides elegans</italic> obtained from Quivira Basin, San Diego, California.

(2017)</xref>. In essence, gentle MAC extractions were seeded with 10 nm BSA-coated colloidal gold particles (1:4 v/v, Sigma) and 4 μl of the mixture was applied to a glow-discharged holey-carbon copper EM grid (R2/1, Quantifoil). The grid was backside blotted in a Vitrobot (FEI Company) by using a Teflon sheet on the front pad, and plunge-frozen in a liquid ethane-propane mixture (37%/63%) cooled by a liquid nitrogen bath. Frozen grids were stored in liquid nitrogen.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cryo-electron tomography</title><p>The gentle MAC extractions were imaged by cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weiss et al., 2017</xref>). Images were recorded on a Titan Krios TEM (FEI) equipped with a Quantum LS imaging filter operated at a 20 eV slit width and K2 Summit (Gatan). Pixel sizes at specimen level ranged from 2.14 Å to 2.72 Å. Tilt series were collected using a bidirectional tilt-scheme from −30° to +60° and −32° to −60° in 2° increments. Total dose was ~90 e-/Å<sup>2</sup> and defocus was kept at −5 to −6 µm. Some tilt series were recorded in focus using a Volta phase plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Danev et al., 2014</xref>). Tilt series were acquired using SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>) and reconstructed and segmented using the IMOD program suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>). Density plots to determine filled and empty phenotypes were done using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Contrast enhancement of some tomograms was done using the tom_deconv deconvolution filter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/dtegunov/tom_deconv">https://github.com/dtegunov/tom_deconv</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Sub-tomogram averaging</title><p>Tomograms used for structure identification and picking were binned by a factor of 4. Defocus was estimated using Gctf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang, 2016</xref>) and CTF correction, exposure filtering and backprojection was done using IMOD. SR data were binned by a factor of 2 resulting in a pixel size of 4.29 Å/px. The discrete extended MAC structures were identified visually in individual tomograms and their longitudinal axes were modeled with open contours in 3dmod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mastronarde, 2008</xref>). Individual model points were added at defined intervals of about 12 nm along the contours using the addModPts program from the PEET package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Heumann et al., 2011</xref>) resulting in 24’721 initial particles for filled tubes and 37’024 initial particles for empty tubes. Models were imported into Dynamo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Castaño-Díez et al., 2012</xref>), particles were extracted, the azimuth angle was randomized and all particles were averaged to obtain an initial reference. Four times binned subtomograms (17.14 Å/px) were used for four iterations of initial alignment with the reference low-pass filtered to about 50 Å. No symmetry was applied, but rotational search was limited to +/- 30°. Before unbinning, subtomograms were cleaned by distance and cross correlation coefficient leaving 20’358 filled and 20’782 empty tube particles. Two times binned subtomograms (8.57 Å/px) were extracted using the refined coordinates and the dataset was split in two half sets. Half sets were aligned independently for five iterations. Unbinned subvolumes (4.29 Å/px) were extracted using the refined coordinates and aligned for eight more iterations. Subvolumes were cleaned by cross correlation coefficient and final averages were generated using 13’039 particles and 13’425 particles for filled and empty tubes, respectively. UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) was used for visualization of the 3D models and to generate the difference map between wildtype and ∆<italic>mif1</italic> structure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Bacterial two-hybrid analysis</title><p>Bacterial two-hybrid Analysis was performed following the protocols detailed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Karimova et al., 2000</xref>). Briefly, proteins of interest were cloned into one of four <underline>B</underline>acterial <underline>T</underline>wo <underline>H</underline>ybrid (BTH) plasmids pUT18, pUT18C, pKT25, and pKNT25. These produced individual N- or C-terminal fusions between the proteins of interest and the T18 and T25 subunits on of the adenylate cyclase (<italic>CyaA</italic>) protein. All plasmid sequences were confirmed by PCR. Plasmid combinations containing the genes of interest were then electroporated into BTH101 electrocompetent cells that lacked a native <italic>CyaA</italic> gene. The BTH101 cells were grown on LB agar containing ampicillin (100 mg/ml), kanamycin (100 mg/ml) and 1% glucose. Glucose was used to suppress the expression of proteins before performing the assay. Protein–protein interactions were quantified by performing a β-galactosidase assay with cells being grown overnight at 37°C and shaking at 200 RPM. Protein expression was induced with 1.0 mM IPTG. The cultures were incubated at 25°C shaking at 200 RPM for 6 hr before being mixed with a one-step ‘β-gal’ mix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schaefer et al., 2016</xref>). A plate reader was then used to measure the absorbance at 420 nm and 600 nm. The optical densities were used to calculate Miller Units as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miller, 1972</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Protein purification and electroporation</title><p>To purify JF50_12615, JF50_12605 and GFP proteins, genes of interest were cloned into the pET15b plasmid and grown in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 pLysE. Bacteria were struck out on LB agar plates with ampicillin (100 µg/µl) and grown at 37°C for 24 hr. A single colony was inoculated into 5 ml LB with ampicillin (100 µg/µl) and grown at 37°C shaking at 200 RPM for 14–16 hr. The overnight culture was diluted 1:500 into 500 ml LB with ampicillin (100 µg/µl), grown at 37°C shaking at 200 RPM until the culture reached an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.95. Protein expression was induced with 0.1 mM IPTG and grown for 25°C for 16 hr. The culture was centrifuged at 4000 g for 20 min and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was then resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM imidazole, 25 mM tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, pH 8) with a protease inhibitor cocktail (100 µM leupeptin, 1 µM pepstatin and 5 µM bestatin). The culture was French pressed twice (1000 psi) and sonicated 3 times for 10–30 s each time. The lysed culture was then spun down at 12,000 g for 20 min and the supernatant was discarded. Inclusion bodies were purified from the pellet by first washing the pellet twice with 20 mM tris pH 8, 2 M urea, 2% triton X-100, 500 mM NaCl. The remaining pellet was resuspended using 5 ml 6M guanidinium HCl, 5 mM imidazole, 20 mM tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl. The 6XHIS tagged proteins were then bound to Ni-agarose beads which had been pre-equilibrated to the resuspension buffer. The proteins were refolded by adding 1 ml/min of 5 mM imidazole, 20 mM tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl up to a total of 50 ml. After refolding, the beads were loaded onto a vacuum column and washed twice with 10 ml of refolding buffer. The protein was then eluted using 250 mM imidazole, 20 mM tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl. Fractions containing the protein were buffer exchanged into a storage buffer (25 mM tris, 250 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) and stored at −80°C. A Bradford protein assay (BioRad) was done in order to quantify the amount of protein present. An antibody produced against the Mif1-specific peptide sequence CERSKGEFTEGKPKP (Genscript) was used to confirm expression and purification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Western blot</title><p>Protein samples and lysates were first normalized using Bradford protein assay to quantify protein concentrations. Equal concentrations of protein were loaded onto BioRad stain-Free SDS-PAGE gels 4–20% (catalog no. 4568093) and imaged prior to transfer to confirm equal loading using BioRad gel doc ez system and stain free tray. The protein gel was then used to transfer protein to a PVDF membrane via semi-dry transfer system. The membranes were blocked in 5% milk-TBST (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6; 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% tween-20) for 30 min. The primary antibody was added at 1:1000 dilution (unless otherwise stated) to 5% milk-TBST and rocked overnight at 4°C. The membrane was washed three times for 10 min each in TBST. Secondary antibody was added at 1:20,000 to TBST and rocked for 1 hr at room temperature. The membrane was washed three more times for 15 min each before chemiluminescent substrate was added and visualized using BioRad XRS imaging cabinet.

Specifically, 50 µl of 0.77 M mannitol, 20 µl of concentrated larvae (approximately 30 larvae), and 10 µl of purified protein (1.25–12.5 µg, 15.6–156 ng/µl final concentration based on protein recovery from inclusion bodies) were mixed and added to a 2 mm electroporation cuvette. The mixture was then electroporated with 30 V (150 V/cm) at 10 ohms and 3000 µF using a custom electroporation apparatus as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zeller et al., 2006</xref>). After electroporation, the mixture was immediately removed from the cuvette and mixed with 1 ml filtered artificial sea water and transferred into a 24-well plate. The larvae were then observed for metamorphosis 24 to 72 hr later (dependent on WT MACs positive control). Purification of proteins was performed on three separate occasions and each purification was electroporated twice, for a total of six independent biological replicates, each yielding similar outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Quantification of electroporation</title><p>To test whether purified protein is transferred to tubeworm larvae by electroporation, larvae were concentrated to 30 larvae/µl. Final GFP concentration used was 0.625 µg/µl (50 µg total per electroporation). 20 µl of larvae were either electroporated by adding them to 50 µl 0.77 M mannitol and 10 µl of 5 µg/µl purified GFP, then electroporated at 30 V (150 V/cm) at 10 ohms and 3000 µF or not electroporated. Larvae were recovered from the electroporation cuvette by adding 1 ml instant ocean and moved to microcentrifuge tubes. Larvae were then washed 5 times with 1 ml instant ocean by first spinning down at 4000 g for 30 s and removing all but 50 µl of liquid. After the five washes larvae were then spun down at 4000 for 2 min and the sea water was removed. On ice, the larvae were then lysed in 100 µl 50 mM tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and vortexed three times for 30 s each. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifuging at 21,000 g for 10 min and the pellet was discarded. The lysate was then quantified by first diluting a small aliquot of lysate (5 µl) 1:10 and using a Bradford protein assay. The GFP standard curve was created by performing 2-fold serial dilutions of the original purified GFP and using densitometry of the western blot. 8.76 µg of larvae lysate was loaded onto the same gel, with both the mock zap negative control and the electroporated larvae. Recovered protein was calculated using densitometry and the GFP standard curve. This was repeated for four biological replicates each with separate western blots.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Pulldown assays</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> containing a dual expression plasmid with 12605, Mif1, or both 12605 and Mif1 was grown in 50 ml of LB supplemented with chloramphenicol (100 µg/ml) until an OD<sub>600</sub> 0.6 at 37°C. The <italic>E. coli</italic> plasmid was induced with 1 mM IPTG and the temperature was lowered to 20°C, then expression was allowed to proceed overnight (16 hr). Cells were recovered by pelleting at 4000 g for 10 min and media was discarded. Cells were resuspended in 25 mM tris pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl and protease inhibitor cocktail (100 µM leupeptin, 1 µM pepstatin and 5 µM bestatin). Cells were lysed twice by French press 1000 Psi and then centrifuged at 10,000 g to remove cellular debris where the supernatant was then transferred to a new tube and the pellet was discarded. The conjugated agarose beads (Ni-NTA agarose and S-Tag binding agarose, EMD Millipore 69704–3) were equilibrated with the lysis buffer and 1 ml of agarose was added in batch to the recovered supernatant. Agarose was then recovered on a column and washed an additional two times with the lysis buffer to remove non-specific bound proteins. Proteins were eluted using either, 500 µl 3 M MgCl2, 20 mM tris pH 7.6 (S-TAG beads), or 500 µl 250 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 7.6 (Ni-NTA beads). 20 µg protein was loaded onto SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred onto PVDF membrane for western blot using either the endogenous Mif1 antibody or S-Tag antibody (GenScript Cat# A00625, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_915085">AB_915085</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p><italic>P. luteoviolacea</italic> was grown in 50 ml Marine Broth (MB) media in 250 ml flasks at 30°C for 6 hr or overnight (12–14 hr). Cells were centrifuged for 30 min at 7000 g and 4°C and resuspended in 5 ml cold extraction buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl). The resuspensions were centrifuged for 30 min at 4000 g and 4°C and the supernatant was isolated and centrifuged for 30 min at 7000 g and 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 20–100 µl cold extraction buffer and stored at 4°C for further use. All mass spectrometry was done by the Functional Genomics Center Zurich (FGCZ). To prep the MAC extracts for mass spectrometry, the extracts were precipitated by mixing 30 µl of sample with 70 µl water and 100 µl 20% TCA. The samples were then washed twice with cold acetone. The dry pellets were dissolved in 45 µl buffer (10 mM Tris/2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 8.2) and 5 µl trypsin (100 ng/µl in 10 mM HCl). They were then microwaved for 30 min at 60°C. The samples were dried, then dissolved in 20 µl 0.1% formic acid and transferred to autosampler vials for LC/MS/MS. 1 µl was injected.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Anca Segall and Dr. Manal Swairjo for reagents, technical support and constructive suggestions.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A contractile injection system stimulates tubeworm metamorphosis by translocating a proteinaceous effector&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Ericson and colleagues investigates the Metamorphosis Associated Contractile (MAC) system that <italic>Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea</italic> employs to induce metamorphosis of host larvae of the tubeworm <italic>Hydroides elegans</italic>. The authors characterized a cluster of six genes, one of which, Mif1, was found to be essential for the functionality of the MAC system towards <italic>Hydroides</italic>. Structural analysis by electron-cryotomography and subtomogram averaging revealed that while in the wild-type MAC system there is a density inside the inner tube, the Mif1-deficient system is lacking this density, suggesting the location of the effector to be inside the inner tube. In agreement of Mif1 being the translocated effector, electroporation of Mif1 into tubeworm larvae was sufficient to trigger metamorphosis.</p><p>The manuscript is interesting and well written; however, several essential points have to be addressed.</p><p>Essential comments:</p><p>1) The reviewers think that the assignment of the localization of Mif1 in the MAC particle requires more validation. Biochemical techniques such as SDS-PAGE or Western blotting could be used to analyze the protein composition in purified WT and ΔJF50_12615 particles normalized to the same protein concentration. Furthermore, there is no interaction observed between Mif1 and the tube component by BTH. This could not be taken as conclusive, particularly since the gp19-like structure in the assembled MAC system is a hexamer in which Mif1 could be fitted similarly to the Tse2-Hcp1 interaction in T6SS (Silverman et al., 2013). The reviewers suggest that similar approaches be considered to test the fit of Mif1 within the MAC tube.</p><p>2) A standard test for validating the function of the protein is the complementation assay. While the functional complementation for JF50_12605 and JF50_12615 mutants is shown in Figure 1B, the reviewers wonder whether the tubes were also found full after complementation of JF50_12615?</p><p>3) Could the authors suggest a potential function or discuss functional units of JF50_12615 based on its the amino sequence or its location in the genome? Any conserved/hypervariable regions? Do <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> or <italic>Serratia</italic> contain orthologs? The authors suggest that Mif1 can make pores. Are there any hydrophobic domains that could be identified which would support this hypothesis? JF50_12615 occupies the central channel of the tube and thus it could be related to tape measure proteins. Do the WT and ΔJF50_12615 mutant have similar or different particle length distributions?</p><p>4) The authors show that a mutant lacking JF50_12605 is impaired in inducing metamorphosis but instead and in contrast to the Mif1 mutant, when extracellular MACs are prepared from the JF50_12605 mutant, there are no significant defect observed. There is no clear explanation on why this could be. Also there is no suggestion about the role of JF50_12605. Would that protein somehow be involved in helping loading Mif1 into the MACs, a kind of chaperone-like element? Is there any homology, or other features that stand out when examining the sequence of JF50_12605? The reviewers believe that this deserves a little bit more discussion, particularly because an interaction between Mif1 and JF50_12605 has been found using BTH. From this prospect, other methods should be used to validate this interaction, for example co-purification and pull down. This is even more true since the proportion of empty MACs appeared to be similar for the Mif1 and the JF50_12605 mutants.</p><p>5) The authors have debated whether the empty MACs could have been missing the inner tube homologous to the bacteriophage tube made of gp19 (JF50_12680). Would the MACs form in absence of the tube? If yes, how do MACs without a tube look like?</p><p>6) The authors report they have identified a second MACs effector, a nuclease they called Pne1 (preprint on bioRxiv). Are the authors suggesting that Pne1 is not in the lumen of the MACs? This is confusing and the relationship between Pne1 and Mif1 should be clarified either experimentally, i.e. by subtomogram averaging of Pne1-deficient MACs or in the Discussion.</p><p>7) To aid the interpretation of the electroporation experiment it would be great to know how much protein actually ends up in the worm (if any)? Can that amount be compared to the total protein content of the worm?</p><p>8) The quality of electron cryotomography and subtomogram averaging data is below the currently accepted standards in the field. The structures presented in Figure 2 have signs of overfitting as revealed by a texture outside of the protein density in the panel A. From the description in the Materials and methods section is not clear how the subtomogram alignment was performed, this should be briefly stated in the Materials and methods section additionally to the reference to Weiss et al. (2017). Each subtomogram average reconstruction has to have a corresponding resolution estimated by similarity between two statistically independently generated maps (so called &quot;gold standard&quot; processing). The similarity curves have to be presented in a supplementary figure. The pixel size at which the data is recorded is not needed in the figures. Figure 1—figure supplements 2 and 3 would benefit from noise reduction in the corresponding tomograms by i.e. non-linear anisotropic diffusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46845.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential comments:</p><p>1) The reviewers think that the assignment of the localization of Mif1 in the MAC particle requires more validation.

We specifically detected the FLAG-tagged Mif1 proteins in each strain where Mif1 was tagged with FLAG. Results are now provided in Figure 3B and in the second paragraph of the subsection “The density within the MAC tube lumen represents a cargo protein”. This supports our imaging and mass spectrometry experiments and suggests that Mif1 is indeed found in the MAC structure.</p><p>Two different observations could explain the lack of interactions between Mif1 and the tube component. (1) We observed a low-density region between the density of the cargo and the density of the tube (shown by the black arrows in Figure 2B). (2) When expelled tubes were imaged by cryotomography, the tubes were always empty shown in the now added Figure 2—figure supplement 2. Together, these findings suggest that interactions between cargo and tube are weak or non-existent, which might facilitate the rapid release of the cargo into the target upon contraction (see subsection “The density within the MAC tube lumen represents a cargo protein”, first paragraph and Discussion, third paragraph).</p><p>As suggested, we purified heterologously-expressed tube protein and analyzed it by negative stain electron microscopy. Under the tested conditions, however, no ring structures were observed, which prevented us from performing the subsequent experiments according to Silverman et al. (2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A standard test for validating the function of the protein is the complementation assay.

Unfortunately, we did not identify any functional or transmembrane domains in Mif1. Other bacteria like <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> or <italic>Serratia</italic> do not contain orthologs of Mif1. This is consistent with the fact that contractile injection systems from these organisms are not known to induce metamorphosis. The Mif1-genomic context does not suggest a mechanism of function either. We have modified the Discussion to make our conclusions more clear (Discussion, second paragraph).</p><p>Mif1 does not show sequence similarities to tape measure proteins. Wildtype and ∆<italic>mif1</italic> MACs did also not show differences in length distribution (see also Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and 3)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors show that a mutant lacking JF50_12605 is impaired in inducing metamorphosis but instead and in contrast to the Mif1 mutant, when extracellular MACs are prepared from the JF50_12605 mutant, there are no significant defect observed.

In regards to metamorphosis induction by ∆JF50_12605 strains, the discrepancy between bacterial biofilms and purified MACs is likely based on higher concentrations of MACs affecting the larvae when MAC extracts are used. In mass spectrometry analysis of ∆JF50_12605 MACs a low abundance of Mif1 was observed (Figure 3A) suggesting that Mif1 may be able to associate in rare cases with MACs independent of JF50_12605. We have revised the text (subsection “The density within the MAC tube lumen represents a cargo protein”, Discussion, third paragraph) to explain this.</p><p>In order to validate the interaction between Mif1 and JF50_12605, we performed the suggested reciprocal pull-down of JF50_12605-S-tag with Mif1-6xHis-tag. We detected JF50_12605 by western blot after pull-down (now Figure 3C, subsection “The density within the MAC tube lumen represents a cargo protein”, last paragraph), corroborating our bacterial two-hybrid analyses (Figure 3C-F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors have debated whether the empty MACs could have been missing the inner tube homologous to the bacteriophage tube made of gp19 (JF50_12680). Would the MACs form in absence of the tube? If yes, how do MACs without a tube look like?</p></disp-quote><p>We showed in a previous paper that a mutant lacking the tube protein does not assemble MACs (Shikuma et al., 2014). In the previous version of the presented manuscript, we docked a homology model of the gp19 tube protein into the EM densities, in order to unambiguously show that the cargo density within the tube lumen was distinct from the tube itself. We realize that the way this was discussed might have been confusing and revised the text and figure (subsection “The density within the MAC tube lumen represents a cargo protein”, first paragraph, Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors report they have identified a second MACs effector, a nuclease they called Pne1 (preprint on bioRxiv).

We have included the cryotomogram of the ∆<italic>pne1</italic> (JF50_12610) mutant in Figure 1—figure supplement 3 and show that the tube has a filled phenotype. The filled phenotype suggests that Pne1 is not found within the inner tube, but instead could be loaded in a different location (e.g. spike) within the MACs complex. We have modified the labeling of Figure 1—figure supplement 3 to indicate that JF50_12610 is named Pne1 and added text to discuss this point (Discussion, fourth paragraph). The Pne1 paper has been recently published (Rocchi et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) To aid the interpretation of the electroporation experiment it would be great to know how much protein actually ends up in the worm (if any)? Can that amount be compared to the total protein content of the worm?</p></disp-quote><p>To determine if electroporation facilitates protein association with tubeworm larvae, we electroporated larvae in the presence of GFP protein, thoroughly washed the larvae and performed western blot analysis. We found that larvae subjected to electroporation had a higher concentration of GFP associated when compared to non-electroporated larvae. These results are now included in the manuscript (subsection “Purified and electroporated Mif1 protein induces tubeworm metamorphosis” and as Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The quality of electron cryotomography and subtomogram averaging data is below the currently accepted standards in the field.
