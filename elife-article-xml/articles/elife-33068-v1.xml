Mass spectrometry analysis of the PSM-fated ES cells revealed that proteasomes are major components of the Ripply2-binding complex, suggesting that recruitment of a protein-degradation-complex is a pivotal function of Ripply2.

During somitogenesis, somites form periodically from the anterior end of the PSM toward the posterior direction every 2 hr, which coordinates a balance between maintenance of the PSM and differentiation of epithelial somites. The expression of Tbx6 starts from the progenitors of the posterior mesoderm and extends to the anterior part of presomitic mesoderm (PSM), then progressively regresses from the anterior edge of its expression domain when a new somite is formed. Tbx6 maintains the mesodermal properties of somite progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chapman and Papaioannou, 1998</xref>), but induces the expression of segmentation genes in the anterior PSM to establish the new somite boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Oginuma et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The temporal periodicity of somitogenesis is established in the posterior PSM via the function of a so-called molecular clock, which is operated by complex gene regulatory networks under the control of three major signaling pathways, Notch, FGF and Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hubaud and Pourquié, 2014</xref>). The periodicity of this segmentation clock is translated into the activation of the segmentation gene <italic>Mesoderm posterior protein 2 (Mesp2)</italic> around the segmental border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Morimoto et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>Mesp2</italic> expression is temporally regulated by Notch signaling, and spatially defined by Tbx6; both factors work positively and coordinate each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yasuhiko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yasuhiko et al., 2008</xref>). The anterior limit of the <italic>Mesp2</italic> mRNA expression domain is consistent with the Tbx6 anterior limit. Once translated, Mesp2 induces the expression of its target gene <italic>Ripply2</italic>, then Ripply2 suppresses Tbx6 protein, which results in the termination of <italic>Mesp2</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Oginuma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). This Tbx6-Mesp2-Ripply2 reciprocal regulation is the spatial mechanism that successively defines the position of the next anterior border of Mesp2, by which the metronomic segmented somites with determined size are correctly generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Morimoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Takahashi et al., 2010</xref>). The activation/inactivation switch for Tbx6 is also a typical behavior among T–box transcriptional factors, which play important roles in development during embryogenesis such as Tbx3 in ICM development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davenport et al., 2003</xref>), Eomes in blastocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ciruna and Rossant, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Strumpf et al., 2005</xref>), and Tbx1, Tbx2, Eomes in limb development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hancock et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The negative feedback loop of Ripply2-Tbx6 for the termination of Mesp2 activity during each somitic cycle is the fundamental process to create the spatial periodicity of the segmented somites in mice. Recently, both zebrafish ripply1/2 and mouse Ripply2 proteins were found to play a role in the degradation of T-box family factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wanglar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Our previous study demonstrated that ectopic Ripply2 expression in the posterior PSM was sufficient for the destabilization of T-box factors- Tbx6 and T protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). However, the molecular nature of Ripply2-mediated destabilization is poorly understood.</p><p>In this study, we found that Tbx6 and Ripply2 interacted with each other, but Tbx6 degradation never occurred in cultured cells, indicating that the PSM tissue is necessary for Tbx6 degradation. However, it is difficult to use PSM tissue from embryos for biochemical analyses because the population of Ripply2<sup>+</sup> cells in the PSM is very low (only approximately 1000 ~ 3000 cells/embryo, depending on somitic phases). Thus, we established an induction system for PSM-like cells (we refer to this system as the PSM-fated induction system) using mouse ES cells, by which we reproduced the Tbx6 expression/degradation in cultured cells. We used this system to search for factors interacting with Ripply2. We also used BAC-transgenic mice and chimera mice produced by CRISPR/Cas9 engineered <italic>Tbx6<sup>Tbx6-venus</sup></italic> ES cells to examine the requirements of a motif in Tbx6 that is essential for degradation in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ripply2 directly interacted with Tbx6 but did not lead to destabilization of Tbx6 in cultured cells</title><p>Based on our previous study demonstrating that Ripply2 expression is sufficient for inducing Tbx6 destabilization in mouse PSM tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>), we presumed that Ripply2 and Tbx6 interacted directly, as reported for Zebrafish and Xenopus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hitachi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kawamura et al., 2008</xref>). The presence of a so-called Ripply homology domain (amino acids FPIQ), implicated in interaction with the T-box domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kawamura et al., 2008</xref>), suggested that mouse Ripply2 also has the ability to bind Tbx6. To examine their interaction, we co-transfected Myc-Ripply2 and FLAG-Tbx6 expressing constructs into HEK293T cells. The potential interaction was analyzed by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody followed by western blotting with anti-Myc antibody. A strong association between FLAG-Tbx6 with Myc-Ripply2 was observed with HEK293T cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To further explore whether the association between these two proteins is direct, we carried out an in vitro GST pull-down assay using bacterially expressed GST-Tbx6 and His-Ripply2 fusion proteins. GST-Tbx6 fusion protein, but not GST alone, was able to pull down His-Ripply2, indicating that Tbx6 directly interacts with Ripply2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33068.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Establishment of the PSM-fated ES cell system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoprecipitation (IP) for examining Tbx6-Ripply2 interaction.

We found that the T-box domain alone was sufficient for association with Ripply2 and that other regions of Tbx6 were dispensable for this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also generated Ripply2 mutants to test the requirement of the FPIQ tetrapeptide motif implicated in T-box binding (Myc-Ripply2<sub>ΔFPIQ</sub>) and the WRPW motif, a known Groucho binding domain (Myc-Ripply2<sub>ΔWRPW</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hancock et al., 1999</xref>).

In addition, the ectopic expression of Ripply2 in the cardiac mesoderm did not influence on the stability of T-box factors Tbx18 and Tbx5 in the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), which is different from the destabilizing effect of Ripply2 on Tbx6 and Brachyury (T) in the PSM. These results suggest that the PSM contains a specific factor(s) necessary for the destabilization of T-box factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Establishing the PSM-fated cell line using mouse ES cells</title><p>To reproduce the in vivo conditions for Tbx6 destabilization, we established a differentiation system for PSM from mouse ES cells.

The dissociated feeder-free <italic>Tbx6<sup>Tbx6-venus/Tbx6-venus</sup></italic> ES cells were cultured in differentiation-medium for 2 days to let the ES cells differentiate to the epiblast state. Then, PSM-fated differentiation was induced by treating the ES cells with 3 μM CHIR99021 (GSK inhibitor) for 2, 3, or 4 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Compared with ES cells treated with DMSO that exhibited almost no venus-positive cells, ES cells cultured with CHIR99021 exhibited Tbx6-venus expression from day 2 to day 4, as indicated by immunostaining with anti-GFP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–R</xref>).

We reasoned this to be because Ripply2 expression is induced transiently in the anterior PSM in vivo, which may be a very small population of PSM-fated ES cells. To test whether Ripply2-mediated Tbx6-degradation occurs in the PSM-fated ES cells, we used the Tet-On inducible gene expression system to induce Ripply2 expression upon Doxycycline (Dox) administration. To monitor the expression of both Ripply2 and Tbx6-venus, we designed TRE-<italic>mcherry-T2A-FLAG-Ripply2</italic> in order to detect Ripply2 expression through mcherry expression by fluorescence and by anti-FLAG antibody.

The established <italic>Tbx6<sup>Tbx6-venus/Tbx6-venus</sup>;mcherry-T2A-FLAG-Ripply2</italic> ES cells were cultured and PSM differentiation was induced by treating with CHIR99021 for 3 days, followed by the addition of 1 μg/mL Dox to induce FLAG-Ripply2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We confirmed the strong induction of both mRNA and FLAG-Ripply2 protein at 12 hr after Dox addition in undifferentiated ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In PSM-fated differentiating ES cells, we found that the expression level of FLAG-Ripply2 reached the peak at 6 hr after induction by Dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), along with a gradual decrease in Tbx6-venus expression from 3 to 12 hr after Dox treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E–N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–L</xref>).

These results indicate that Tbx6 can be ubiquitinated even in the absence of Ripply2 in PSM-fated cells and Ripply2 is mainly involved in the degradation step.

The immunoprecipitation data showed that Ripply2 assembled the endogenous proteasome 20S subunit regardless of differentiation induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

To achieve this, we first used BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome)-based transgenic F0 analyses. We introduced the venus-tag into the translational initiation site of <italic>Tbx6</italic> and created BAC-venus, which expressed only venus protein under the control of the Tbx6 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). We dissected embryos at E10.5, and confirmed that the expression of venus protein was stable and expanded to the anterior region beyond the segmentation point indicated by the arrow (N = 3. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We also introduced the venus-tag just before the Tbx6 termination codon to produce the Tbx6-venus fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>). As expected, the transgene faithfully reproduced the endogenous expression pattern of Tbx6, in which the expression domain has a clear anterior border just before the segmental border in the anterior PSM (N = 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating that the Tbx6-fusion protein was degraded in the anterior PSM. We then inserted the venus-tag after and before the T-box domain to construct fusion proteins lacking only the C-terminal region (BAC-Tbx6<sub>ΔC</sub>-venus: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,D</xref>) or together with the T-box domain (BAC-Tbx6<sub>ΔTC</sub>-venus: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,E</xref>), respectively. Tbx6<sub>ΔC</sub>-venus protein exhibited an expression pattern with a clear anterior border (N = 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>); however, the Tbx6<sub>ΔTC</sub>-venus protein expanded to the anterior region (N = 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These results indicated that the T-box domain is necessary for degradation of Tbx6 protein. Next, to ask whether the T-box domain itself is sufficient for destabilization, we created BAC-T-box-venus, which expresses only the T-box domain fused with venus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,F</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of T-box-venus protein had a clear anterior border (N = 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), demonstrating that the T-box region of Tbx6 is necessary and sufficient for degradation. Following immunoprecipitation, only the T-box but not other domains of Tbx6 led to the precipitation of Ripply2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that the T-box-dependent Tbx6 degradation is achieved through the interaction between T-box and Ripply2.

As expected, when the C-terminal from the 124<sup>th</sup> amino acid was deleted from Tbx6 (Tbx6<sub>1~124aa</sub>), the mutant protein failed to bind Ripply2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–J</xref>), but Tbx6<sub>1~152aa</sub> succeeded in interacting with Ripply2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–J</xref>), suggesting that amino acids 125 ~ 152 contain the Ripply2-binding-motif in the T-box. However, we surprisingly found that the deletion of 125 ~ 152 aa (Tbx6<sub>Δ124~152</sub>) did not affect the ability to form a complex with Ripply2 either in HEK293T immunoprecipitation analysis or in GST-pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–K</xref>), suggesting that although 125 ~ 152 aa has Ripply2-binding ability it is not the only Ripply2-binding motif in the T-box. Therefore, the stabilization of Tbx6<sub>Δ124-152aa</sub>-venus in the chimera embryo was not due to disruption of Ripply2 association but perhaps to a special motif for degradation in the region of 125 ~ 152 aa.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Recapitulation of Tbx6-degradation using the PSM-fated ES differentiation system</title><p>The T-box family of transcription factors play crucial roles throughout embryonic development and their expression patterns are strictly controlled via tissue specific context-dependent mechanisms. The activation/inactivation switch for Tbx6 via the expression of Ripply2 in the anterior PSM is a key issue for the determination of the segmental border during somitogenesis. However, it is almost impossible to assess the biochemical nature of the Ripply2-dependent Tbx6 degradation mechanism using in vivo samples because the segmental border is an ephemeral structure that contains only a small cell population. To solve this problem, we established a PSM-fated ES cell system, which can provide a similar environment to in vivo, and successfully reproduced the Tbx6 expression/degradation process using a very simple method. We introduced a venus tag just before the stop codon in the endogenous <italic>Tbx6</italic> gene using a Cas9/CRISPR-mediated method to make the Tbx6-venus fusion protein, which enabled us to identify specific cells in the PSM, and importantly, allowed us to monitor Tbx6 protein stability during the differentiation process. Using this monitoring system, we observed the quick disappearance of Tbx6-venus signal upon Ripply2 expression. The reduction of Tbx6-venus occurred in a short time; the effective time was less than 2 hr, which is comparable with the time observed in in vivo somitogenesis. This system also allowed us to prepare Ripply2-interacting proteins required for Tbx6 degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Ripply2 mainly functions as a factor involved in protein degradation in mice</title><p>Activation and termination of transcription factor activity in specific tissues at an appropriate time is important during embryonic development. The termination of Mesp expression is a pivotal pathway in segmental border determination in mice, but the regulation cascade of Tbx6, Mesp and Ripply likely diverged during vertebrate evolution. Zebrafish tbx6 directly induces the expression of ripply without mediating mesp function, after which ripply1/2 in turn suppresses the expression of both tbx6 and mesp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wanglar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Windner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yabe et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, mouse Ripply2 requires Mesp2 for transcriptional activation in addition to Tbx6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dunty et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Morimoto et al., 2007</xref>), and suppresses Mesp2 function through destabilization of Tbx6. Repression of transcriptional activity of T-box family transcriptional factors is a well-known function of Ripply family factors in zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kawamura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kawamura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kondow et al., 2007</xref>). However, there is no evidence of a similar repression mechanism in mice, and we suggested the negative regulation in mouse to be mediated by the destabilization of T-box proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Oginuma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>), arguing that Ripply factors are not completely functionally conserved within vertebrates. This study provided clear evidence that Ripply2 participates in Tbx6 protein degradation through the proteasome pathway. Proteomic screening of Ripply2-binding proteins from PSM-fated mouse ES cells identified all members of 26S proteasome subunits, and Ripply2-Tbx6 was able to form a complex through direct interaction, demonstrating that Ripply2 physically associates with the proteasome anβd targets Tbx6 protein to the proteasome for permanent inactivation by degradation. Ripply2-mediated Tbx6 degradation was interrupted by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. This result is in agreement with the in vivo discovery that the Tbx6 expression domain was elongated by one-somite-length with MG132 treatment for 2 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Oginuma et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Although TLE1/2 are well-known Groucho family co-repressors and their expression was observed in mouse PSM tissue, mouse Tbx6 transcriptional activity was never affected when TLE1 and Ripply2 were co-transfected in an Mesp2 luciferase reporter system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This raises the question of how TLE1/2 functions in mouse PSM tissue. We found that the Groucho-binding motif of Ripply2 is also required for binding to Tbx6, indicating that TLE1/2 may participate in the degradation of Tbx6 via protein-protein interaction. Mass spectrometry analysis also revealed TLE in the Ripply2-Tbx6 complex, possibly reflecting the involvement of TLE in Tbx6 degradation in the PSM, but its molecular function in protein degradation remains unclear.</p><p>It is of note that Ripply2 can recruit the 26S proteasome subunit in ES cells without PSM-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), even though the Ripply2-mediated T-box factor degradation was found to be a highly context-dependent event. Tbx6 degradation never occurred in cultured cells, and even in vivo, the Ripply2-mediated induction of T-box factor degradation occurred only in PSM tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>) but not in other mesodermal tissue such as the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that other than proteasomes, there are other factor(s), possibly cell-specific E3 ligases, that help to down-regulate Tbx6 in PSM tissue. Consistent with this observation, Tbx6 was ubiquitinated only at a low level in undifferentiated ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Once the ES cells were induced to PSM, the ubiquitination was accelerated even in the absence of Ripply2. This suggests that Ripply2 is not involved in the ubiquitination step and only in the degradation step of Tbx6, indicating that a PSM-specific E3 ligase must be induced and functions in Tbx6 ubiquitination. However, such a candidate protein was not included in our MASS analysis. Additional studies are needed to identify the responsible E3 ligase and/or unknown factor(s) involved in Tbx6 degradation in the PSM.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>T-box is A conserved motif for recognition by Ripply2 during degradation</title><p>The T-box, which spans 180–200 amino acid residues, is a relatively large domain for the requirement of well-known DNA binding functions, suggesting that other functions likely depend on the T-box. For example, the β-sheet structures can constitute protein-protein interfaces for binding of other factors. In our study, the T-box domain was confirmed to be necessary and sufficient for both Ripply2-binding and Tbx6 degradation. The T-box family factors are ancient in origin and present in all metazoans, calling into question whether Ripply-dependent destabilization is a general event for other T-box factors in other species. Besides Tbx6, other T-box family transcriptional factors, such as T (Brachyury), have also been found to be degraded by Ripply2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Zebrafish tbx6 protein has been reported to be destabilized <italic>via</italic> ripply1/2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wanglar et al., 2014</xref>). These studies support the idea that the T-box dependent degradation pathway is conserved among T-box family factors. The domain of 124 ~ 152 aa in the T-box was found to be necessary for Tbx6 degradation in our chimera mouse experiment. However, Tbx6<sub>Δ124-152</sub> did not lose its ability to bind Ripply2, indicating that this region regulates degradation not by Ripply2-Tbx6 interaction but through providing a critical protein degradation point, such as a ubiquitin-binding site. It has been reported that ubiquitin is usually attached to the ε-amino group of lysine through an isopeptide bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hicke et al., 2005</xref>). However, no lysine residue or ubiquitin-binding domain was found in the 124 ~ 152 aa region. This means that this T-box region likely contains an unusual ubiquitylation site or a specific factor may be required for the degradation of T-box factors. There is much more to be learned about the co-factors in the degradation process of T-box factors to fully understand the tissue-specific developmental regulation mechanisms during embryogenesis. Research using PSM-fated ES cells offers a rich source of material that will lead to further understanding of these molecular mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>The strategy to generate the expression vectors used for biochemical analyses</title><p>The wild-type Tbx6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Oginuma et al., 2008</xref>) and Ripply2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Morimoto et al., 2007</xref>) cDNA were cloned in vectors shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

We expect that the specificity is due to a tissue-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase. However, we have not yet identified such an E3 ligase responsible for Tbx6 degradation in the PSM. Instead, we presented several data indicating that some PSM-specific factor or mechanism is involved in the Tbx6 degradation.</p><p>1) Tbx6 degradation was not induced by Ripply2 in HEK293 cells.</p><p>2) Ectopic induction of Ripply2 in the PSM resulted in the down-regulation of T-family proteins, Brachyury and Tbx6 in the PSM (Zhao et al., 2015), but the forced expression of Ripply2 in the heart lineage did not affect T-family proteins, Tbx5 (cardiomyocyte marker) or Tbx18 (epicardium marker) (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><p>3) We confirmed that Tbx6 was more ubiquitinated in the PSM-fated ES cells compared with in undifferentiated ES cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
