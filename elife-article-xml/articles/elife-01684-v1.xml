In a search for components that participate in building the elaborate architecture of this complex organelle we have identified Aim24, an inner membrane protein. Aim24 interacts with the MICOS complex that is required for the formation of crista junctions and contact sites between inner and outer membranes. Aim24 is necessary for the integrity of the MICOS complex, for normal respiratory growth and mitochondrial ultrastructure. Modification of MICOS subunits Mic12 or Mic26 by His-tags in the absence of Aim24 leads to complete loss of cristae and respiratory complexes. In addition, the level of tafazzin, a cardiolipin transacylase, is drastically reduced and the composition of cardiolipin is modified like in mutants lacking tafazzin. In conclusion, Aim24 by interacting with the MICOS complex plays a key role in mitochondrial architecture, composition and function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01684.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01684.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01684.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Respiration is vital to all living things because it is the process by which nutrients are converted into useful energy.

While significant progress was made in these fields, relatively little attention was devoted to the internal organization of mitochondria. Early electron microscopic studies had revealed the highly elaborate architecture and its large variety in mitochondria of different species, tissues and cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fawcett, 1981</xref>). Few cohesive attempts were made to elucidate the genes and other factors responsible for the architecture of the mitochondria. It is now becoming evident that in order to understand the communication and regulation between mitochondria, cytosol and nucleus this area of mitochondrial biology must be strengthened.</p><p>Metabolism, biogenesis, dynamics and inheritance of mitochondria are intimately linked to their architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mannella et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">John et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mannella, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hess et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perkins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Perkins and Ellisman, 2011</xref>). The internal organization of the mitochondria plays also an important role in apoptosis and mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nowikovsky et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Merkwirth et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rolland et al., 2009</xref>). Mitochondrial architecture is altered in many diseases affecting the performance of the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zick et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it is essential to identify and characterize the proteins and lipids responsible for mitochondrial architecture with regard to structure, suborganellar location, function and dynamics.</p><p>Mitochondria are separated from the cytosol by a mitochondrial envelope consisting of the proximate outer membrane (OM) and the inner boundary membrane (IBM). The cristae protrude into the matrix from narrow tubule-like or slot-like crista junctions (CJ) at which the membrane has a strong negative curvature. In most cases they form leaf-like or tubule-like structures. At their edges, the crista rims, the membrane is bent with a strong positive curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rabl et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>A considerable number of proteins have been identified which influence mitochondrial architecture. To some of them distinct functions could be assigned. These proteins include the subunits of the F<sub><bold>1</bold></sub>F<sub><bold>O</bold></sub>-ATP synthase that are responsible for oligomerisation of this enzyme complex, such as subunits e, g and 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arnold et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rabl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davies et al., 2012</xref>). These subunits apparently introduce positive curvature into the dimers and oligomers of the F<sub><bold>1</bold></sub>F<sub><bold>O</bold></sub>-ATP synthase and thereby into the membrane which then leads to the formation of crista rims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dudkina et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Strauss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rabl et al., 2009</xref>). Mitofilin is another protein whose architectural role was recognized early on. It is required for the formation of crista junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">John et al., 2005</xref>). Later, it was proved to be a component of a larger complex, the MICOS/MINOS/Mitos complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">von der Malsburg et al., 2011</xref>). An agreement between researchers in this field was recently reached to introduce a uniform nomenclature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50a">Pfanner et al., 2014</xref>). The MICOS/MINOS/Mitos complex is now called MICOS (‘mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system’). MICOS is composed of at least six subunits whose names are now (former names in brackets): Mic60 (Fcj1), Mic10 (Mcs10/Mos1/Mio10), Mic12 (Mcs12/Aim5), Mic19 (Mcs19/Aim13), Mic26 (Mcs29/Mos2, Mio27) and Mic27 (Mcs27/Aim37). All subunits are integrated in or associated with the inner membrane. They contact the outer membrane by interacting with the TOB/SAM complex and the Ugo1-Fzo1 complex. Thereby they anchor MICOS and the crista junctions to the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harner et al., 2011</xref>). The MICOS complex, or in some cases components of the complex, have been shown to exist also in higher organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Darshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Head et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkhaja et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">An et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weber et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Further outer and inner membrane proteins with an important role in mitochondrial architecture are different splice and proteolytic processing forms Mgm1/Opa1, a dynamin-related GTPase at the inner membrane. It is involved in fusion of the mitochondrial inner membrane, and mutations and depletion lead to severe defects of the structure of cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sesaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amutha et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frezza et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meeusen et al., 2006</xref>). Also proteins involved in lipid transport and metabolism and others whose function is not understood, have been described as affecting mitochondrial architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Messerschmitt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dimmer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Connerth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neupert, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tasseva et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The functional analysis of all these proteins is complicated for a variety of reasons: They can be part of a complex protein interaction network, they can affect protein function through lipid function and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klingenberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Osman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tasseva et al., 2013</xref>), and some proteins may have dual or multiple different functions which even may influence each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We have recently reported a proteomics approach by which mitochondrial proteins can be assigned to different mitochondrial architectural elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harner et al., 2011</xref>). An artificial protein spanning both the outer and inner membrane was introduced that functions as a marker for sites of adhesion. Vesicles were generated by sonic fragmentation of mitochondria and separated by buoyant density centrifugation. We used high resolution mass spectrometry to determine the distribution profiles of proteins across the gradient. In this way, the MICOS complex was identified. In addition, we identified other proteins that meet the criterion of a protein present at contact sites between outer and inner membranes, among them Aim24. Like several subunits of the MICOS complex, Aim24 belongs to a larger group of proteins identified in a screen for altered inheritance of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hess et al., 2009</xref>). Here we report an analysis of the role of Aim24 in mitochondrial architecture, function and dynamics. Although Aim24 could not be co-isolated with the MICOS complex, our results suggest that Aim24 plays a central role in the modulation of the MICOS complex and in the control of mitochondrial architecture, morphology as well as protein and lipid composition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Aim24 is a protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane</title><p>In our previously reported proteomics screen for proteins which accumulate at mitochondrial contact sites we identified a protein exhibiting the same distribution as the subunits of the MICOS complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The MS/MS data identified it as the product of the gene <italic>AIM24</italic> (systematic name <italic>YJR080C</italic>). This gene had previously been found in a screen for mutants with altered inheritance of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hess et al., 2009</xref>). It encodes a 391 amino acid protein (44.4 kDa) with unknown function. It was localized to mitochondria in the MitoGFP database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huh et al., 2003</xref>) and in a proteomics screen for identification of mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reinders et al., 2006</xref>). The presence of an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal is predicted by the deduced amino acid sequence. To confirm presequence-dependent targeting we analyzed the sizes of wild type Aim24, N-terminally His-tagged Aim24 (inserted after the initial methionine) and C-terminally His-tagged Aim24. In isolated mitochondria N-terminally His-tagged Aim24 showed the same apparent size as wild type Aim24 indicating cleavage of the targeting sequence. In contrast, C-terminally His-tagged Aim24 was slightly larger as it contained the C-terminal His-tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The processing of the N-terminus of Aim24 strongly suggests import via the TOM-TIM23 pathway and the location of the mature protein in the matrix space or inner membrane. In order to analyse the location of the C-terminus, we treated mitochondria and mitoplasts containing a version of Aim24 carrying a C-terminal HA-tag with proteinase K. Removal of the HA-tag was not observed, suggesting also the presence of the C-terminus in the matrix or in the membrane. Aim24 could only be degraded by proteinase K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) and several other proteases (not shown) when mitochondria were lysed with Triton X-100.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01684.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Topology of Aim24.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Aim24 is a contact site protein. Isolated mitochondria from wild type (YPH499) cells were subjected to osmotic shrinking, sonication and buoyant density fractionation. Gradient fractions were analyzed by SILAC supported quantitative mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harner et al., 2011</xref>). The distribution of Aim24 in the gradient is shown in red. Distribution of marker proteins of the OM (Tom40), the IM (Yme1) and of the contact site protein Mic60 are included. (<bold>B</bold>) Aim24 is synthesized as a precursor with an N-terminal targeting signal which is cleaved upon import. Wild type cells harboring pYES2 empty vector, Δ<italic>aim24</italic>harboring pYES2 6xHis-Aim24 or pYES2 Aim24-6xHis were grown on SLac medium containing 0.1% glucose. Protein expression was induced by incubation for 30 min in SLac medium containing 0.1% galactose. Mitochondrial and supernatant fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies against Aim24.(<bold>C</bold>) The C-terminal HA-tag of Aim24-3xHA is not accessible to proteinase K (PK) added to intact mitochondria and mitoplasts.

The protein was found to be resistant against alkaline extraction. This observation was rather surprising, since the sequence of Aim24 does not contain a predicted transmembrane segment, although a segment lacking charged residues (residues 200–213) is present. To investigate whether Aim24 is anchored in the inner membrane by this segment, we introduced two charged residues (G207R, G208E); according to computational analysis this strongly reduces the hydrophobicity. This mutation did not interfere with targeting of the protein to mitochondria in vivo nor did it alter its lack of extractability by alkaline solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Moreover, after alkaline treatment of mitochondria, the mutated Aim24 remained in the membrane and was not present as an aggregate as shown by membrane flotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, in homologs of Aim24 of other species, for example <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic> and <italic>Candida glabrata</italic>, the uncharged segment corresponding to residues 200–213 of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Aim24 was even shorter with 12 and 9 residues, respectively. Thus, Aim24 must be integrated in the mitochondrial inner membrane in a different way than by a hydrophobic α-helical transmembrane segment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Aim24 is required for the integrity of the MICOS complex</title><p>In order to determine whether Aim24 is interacting with the MICOS complex, mitochondria from wild type cells were solubilized with digitonin under conditions that preserve the integrity of the complex and then subjected to size exclusion chromatography.

In mitochondria isolated from cells lacking Mic60 or Mic10, the MICOS subunit Mic26 was almost exclusively found in smaller complexes of ca. 250 kDa, suggesting dissociation of the MICOS complex in these strains. In contrast, Aim24 was still present in a complex of the same apparent molecular mass as in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Thus, assembly of Aim24 into its complex does not depend on the integrity of the MICOS complex.</p><p>Next, we asked whether deletion of the <italic>AIM24</italic> gene affects the integrity of the MICOS complex. Strikingly, with mitochondria from Δ<italic>aim24</italic> cells the majority of Mic10 was found as a ca.300 kDa complex, whereas only a small fraction was present in the 1.5 MDa complex upon gel filtration. The subunits Mic60, Mic27 and the majority of Mic26 were still recovered in the 1.5 MDa complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This suggests that absence of Aim24 either leads to loss of Mic10 from MICOS, or Mic10 remains with MICOS but is destabilized and Mic10 dissociates upon solubilisation with digitonin. Notably, the expression of C-terminally His-tagged or HA-tagged forms of Aim24 had the same effect on the integrity of the MICOS complex as deletion of the <italic>AIM24</italic> gene; it led to almost complete dissociation of Mic10 upon solublisation of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The MICOS complex may undergo only minor conformational changes due to the minor alterations generated by Aim24 modified by a small C-terminal tag. Therefore, the behavior of Mic10 in Δ<italic>aim24</italic> and Aim24-HA cells appears to represent a destabilization of the MICOS complex. Localization of Mic10 in Δ<italic>aim24</italic> cells by immuno EM analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>. About 93% of all gold particles were located at the IBM, of which 51% at crista junctions. A parallel analysis of wild type mitochondria yielded 95% at the IBM and 62% of these at crista junctions. This does not prove, but is consistent with a continued but weaker association of Mic10 with the MICOS subunits. In conclusion, these results suggest that functional Aim24 is required for the integrity of Mic10 into the MICOS complex.</p><p>Do the steady state levels of MICOS components depend on Aim24? In cells in which the <italic>AIM24</italic> gene was deleted, the expression of MICOS subunits was altered. The levels of Mic10, Mic12, Mic27 and Mic26 were increased whereas that of Mic60 was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In contrast, deletion of Mic60 and Mic10 led to down-regulation of the other MICOS subunits. The level of Aim24 in cells lacking Mic60 was unchanged and slightly decreased in cells lacking Mic10. In comparison, the levels of several OM and IM membrane proteins, ATP4, Su e, F1β, Tim50 and Tom40, were not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In view of the increased level of Mic10 in Δ<italic>aim24</italic> mitochondria, a fraction of Mic10 in the 300 kDa complex could represent unassembled species rather than protein dissociate upon gel filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We quantified the amount of Mic10 present in wild type and Δ<italic>aim24</italic> in the 1.5 MDa (fractions 2–5) and the 300 kDa complex (fractions 16–19) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref>. If the amounts of Mic10 present in the 1.5 MDa fractions in wild type and Δ<italic>aim24</italic> are normalized to a ratio of 1, the ratio in the 300 kDa fractions amounts to 5.0. This excludes the possibility that the presence of Mic10 in the 300 kDa fraction was due or solely due to an unassembled form of Mic10. Notably, other MICOS subunits with similar increased levels in Δ<italic>aim24</italic> mitochondria were not present as unassembled species. Finally, we quantified the expression levels of MICOS subunits in Aim24-HA expressing cells. Here, the levels of Mic10 and the other MICOS subunits were not altered as compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). However, with these mitochondria Mic10 was observed virtually completely in the 300 kDa fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This observation strongly supports the notion that the modification of Aim24 by the HA-tag, like the deletion of Aim24, leads to a destabilization of the MICOS complex. In sum, these findings demonstrate the importance of Aim24 for maintaining the integrity of the MICOS complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Aim24 interacts with Mic10</title><p>We asked whether Aim24 physically interacts with the MICOS complex. Association was analyzed by co-isolation assays, using digitonin lysed mitochondria containing a His-tagged version of Mic10. While Mic12, Mic19, Mic27, Mic26 and Mic60 could be co-isolated with Mic10, no specific binding of Aim24 was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, left). However, when mitochondria were solubilized with Triton X-100, which leads to dissociation of the MICOS complex into smaller complexes, efficient co-isolation of Aim24 with Mic10 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, right). This shows that both proteins can specifically interact depending on the state of the MICOS complex. Furthermore, the precise co-fractionation with the MICOS subunits upon fragmentation of mitochondria into small vesicles derived from contact sites is consistent with an association of Aim24 with the MICOS complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, Aim24 is likely to be weakly or transiently associated with the MICOS complex at mitochondrial contact sites, and Mic10 appears to be involved in this interaction. It should be noted in this context that the MICOS complex itself has a high propensity to fall apart upon solubilisation even with very mild detergents.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01684.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Aim24 interacts with Mic10.</title><p>Mitochondria isolated from wild type and a strain expressing Mic10-His6 were lysed with 1% digitonin or 1% TX-100 and incubated with NiNTA-beads.

Strikingly, cells expressing His-tagged MICOS subunits Mic12 or Mic26 in the Δ<italic>aim24</italic> deletion background did not grow at all on a non-fermentable carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This was surprising since cells containing these His-tagged proteins in the presence of Aim24 displayed no impairment of growth. The combination of two other His-tagged MICOS subunits, Mic19-His6 or Mic27-His6, with Δ<italic>aim24</italic> deletion did not result in a synthetic lethal phenotype on non-fermentable carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To relate this to the assembly state of the MICOS complex, we analyzed the His-tagged strains which lacked Aim24 by size exclusion chromatography.

These results corroborate the conclusion of Aim24 being critical for the assembly of a fully functional MICOS complex.

To investigate this phenotype in more detail, we performed Blue native gel electrophoresis to analyse respiratory complexes in isolated mitochondria. Because of the inability of cells harboring His-tagged Mic12 or Mic26 in the Δ<italic>aim24</italic> deletion background to grow on non-fermentable carbon source all strains were grown by adding glucose to lactate containing growth medium. The mitochondria isolated from these cells displayed a drastic reduction or complete absence of the respiratory supercomplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). There was also a strong reduction of the steady state levels of individual respiratory chain subunits and an almost complete deficiency in subunit e (Su e) of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase.

Membrane lipids of mitochondria isolated from Δ<italic>aim24</italic> cells and Δ<italic>aim24</italic> cells carrying His-tagged MICOS subunits were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Mitochondria from wild type, Δ<italic>aim24</italic> as well as Δ<italic>aim24</italic> cells in combination with His-tagged Mic19 or Mic27 did not show a significant difference in the distribution of membrane phospholipids and ergosterol (not shown). In contrast, mitochondria from cells lacking Aim24 and harboring His-tagged Mic12 or Mic26 contained slightly increased levels of ergosterol and, conspicuously, the pattern of acyl chains specifically of cardiolipin was significantly altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). There was a shift towards longer and more saturated acyl chains. Since the enzyme responsible for mediating exchange of acyl chains on cardiolipin was identified as tafazzin (Taz1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schlame, 2013</xref>), we checked whether deletion of Aim24 would affect this protein. Mitochondria from wild type and Δ<italic>aim24</italic> cells as well as Δ<italic>aim24</italic> cells carrying His-tagged versions of Mic12, Mic19, Mic27 and Mic26 were analyzed.

Furthermore, cells in which the subunits Mic60 and Mic10 of the MICOS complex were deleted showed wild type levels of Taz1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, loss of Taz1 is not simply a consequence of the destabilization of the MICOS complex or the loss of crista junctions. These data link together the observed deficiency in respiratory supercomplexes with the function of tafazzin and suggest that the steady state level of tafazzin is coupled to the state of the MICOS complex. Tafazzin was reported to be anchored to the inner face of the outer membrane. Upon gradient fractionation of mitochondrial membrane vesicles it was also found in inner membrane fractions as well as in fractions containing both outer and inner membranes, presumably representing contacts between both membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Claypool et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herndon et al., 2013</xref>).

Initially detected in a screen for altered inheritance of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hess et al., 2009</xref>), we found Aim24 in a search for proteins that are present in crista junctions and associated with contact sites that link outer and inner boundary membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harner et al., 2011</xref>). We report here that Aim24 has a distinct function in stabilizing/modulating the MICOS complex which is relevant in a number of aspects such as protein and lipid composition, architecture and metabolic function of mitochondria. Aim24 is firmly associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. This was unexpected in view of the overall hydrophilic nature of the protein and the absence of a predicted transmembrane segment. Computational structure prediction of Aim24 indicates that it belongs to the family of TRAP-like proteins. A hallmark of this family is that its members are composed of antiparallel β-sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antson et al., 1995</xref>). So far no protein with a domain consisting of β-sheets has been described to exist in the inner membrane of mitochondria; however, it cannot be excluded that Aim24 is embedded in the lipid environment by this structural element. This would explain the firm association with the inner membrane. At the same time, this might explain the existence of Aim24 as a large complex of ca. 400 kDa as the members of the TRAP-like protein family were reported to form oligomers.</p><p>The important role of Aim24 is due to its intimate relationship to the MICOS complex. In the absence of functional Aim24, the MICOS complex is destabilized as demonstrated by the dissociation of Mic10 upon detergent solubilisation of mitochondria. Interestingly, a physical interaction of Aim24 with subunits of the wild type MICOS complex was not observed after lysis of mitochondria with digitonin. However, when the MICOS complex was dissociated by Triton X-100, Aim24 was found to be completely associated with Mic10. In the intact mitochondria Aim24 is apparently associated with the MICOS complex, in consistence with its topology indicated by our quantitative proteomics screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harner et al., 2011</xref>). This interaction is obviously highly sensitive to minor disturbances, such as lysis of mitochondrial membranes even with mild detergents and the presence of C-terminal tags on certain MICOS subunits. The interaction is also reflected in the strong alteration of the expression levels of the MICOS subunits in cells deficient in Aim24, most of them being up-regulated. Thus, Aim24 is likely to regulate the association of Mic10 with other subunits of the complex. One would, however, not exclude the possibility that Aim24 exerts its function also as an assembly factor of the MICOS complex.</p><p>Deletion of Aim24 leads to distinct functional deficiencies of the mitochondria. In agreement with the reported alteration of inheritance of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hess et al., 2009</xref>), Aim24 deficient cells are restricted in their growth on non-fermentable carbon source. Interestingly, combination of deletion of Aim24 with the expression of each of the two MICOS subunits Mic12 or Mic26 as C-terminally His-tagged variants leads to synthetic lethality on non-fermentable carbon sources. This points to a functional interaction of these genes as the single deletion mutants are either not at all or only mildly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harner et al., 2011</xref>). This supports the conclusion that Aim24 has a very important role in controlling the function of the MICOS complex.</p><p>Aim24 is a protein with a distinct architectural role. This is not only suggested by its interaction with the MICOS complex, but also by prominent phenotypical traits that become apparent upon deletion or modification of Aim24. First, the percentage of mitochondria with septae is strongly increased, as seen in cells grown on fermentable and non-fermentable carbon source. And second, giant distorted mitochondria accumulate with irregular inner membranes. In particular the formation of inner membrane septae indicates a role of Aim24 in the shaping of crista junctions. These are usually narrow ring- or slot-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mannella et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rabl et al., 2009</xref>). Their extension leads to structures which in sections show double membranes crossing the matrix completely, and which appear as septae. Notably, the width of the junctions of cristae and septae at the inner boundary membrane were like in wild type, whereas their lateral extension was strongly increased. The formation of giant mitochondria is apparent both in fluorescent and electron microscopic images. These mitochondria show a dramatically altered structure of their inner membrane. We consider it likely that they represent later stages of inner membrane deterioration concomitant with accumulation of inner membrane defects.</p><p>The effect of tagging specifically the MICOS subunits Mic12 or Mic26 in the Δ<italic>aim24</italic> deletion background is dramatic. Introducing one of these altered subunits into Δ<italic>aim24</italic> cells leads to the absence of the large and giant mitochondria typical of Δ<italic>aim24</italic> cells and presence of particularly small mitochondria, entirely lacking cristae and instead containing septae. This is accompanied by the loss of complexes and components of oxidative phosphorylation and the inviability under respiratory conditions. Although the over all levels of cardiolipin and of other membrane phospholipids is not altered in these latter mutants, the difference in the pattern of acyl chains in cardiolipin is remarkable. The massive reduction of respiratory complexes whose function is dependent on cardiolipin indicates a connection between Aim24, cardiolipin and the function of the MICOS complex. Surprisingly, the alteration in the types of acyl residues observed were characteristic of those described for mutants with deficiencies in tafazzin in different organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vreken et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schlame et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2004</xref>). Deficiency in tafazzin underlies the Barth syndrome, a severe X-chromosome-linked disorder characterized by cardiac and skeletal myopathy and neutropenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barth et al., 1983</xref>). In mitochondria of patient cells the fraction of cardiolipin with tetralinoleoyl groups is largely diminished. Furthermore, alterations of the structure of cristae and partial deficiency of respiratory complexes were observed in humans and also in several different organisms including yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acehan et al., 2011</xref>). Tafazzin is a cardiolipin transacylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schlame, 2013</xref>). It was suggested to be recruited to non-bilayer type lipid domains that occur in curved membrane areas sensing non-bilayer arrangement of membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schlame et al., 2012</xref>). Mitochondrial cristae junctions and contact sites, structured by the MICOS complex correspond exactly to such proposed areas. Interestingly, the human homolog of Mic26, APOOL, has recently been shown to have the ability to bind cardiolipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weber et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We report here that mitochondria lacking Aim24 and containing either His-tagged Mic12 or Mic26 not only show the characteristic alterations of cardiolipin resulting from tafazzin depletion, but in addition almost completely lack tafazzin. Surprisingly, beside the drastic changes in mitochondrial architecture, there is a practically complete loss of respiratory complexes. This phenotype is much more severe than that reported for tafazzin deficiency, but can be explained by the complete loss of cristae in these mutant cells. Putting all the available information together we propose that the localization of tafazzin in the outer membrane provides it with the ability to reach the inner membrane specifically at contact sites and crista junctions. On the one hand, this would explain the partial co-localization with inner membrane fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Claypool et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herndon et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand in this way tafazzin could become enzymatically active directly at crista junctions, membrane sites showing extreme curvature where cardiolipin modified by tafazzin is specifically needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schlame et al., 2012</xref>). Such a mechanism may be relevant also in regard to the important question raised previously, why and how only a specific limited fraction of cardiolipin is modified by tafazzin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schlame, 2013</xref>). In conclusion, Aim24 appears to have an important role in determining mitochondrial architecture by affecting not only assembly of the MICOS complex, but also by organizing complex reactions such as the remodelling of cardiolipin which makes it competent for the formation of respiratory supercomplexes and the architecture of cristae.</p><p>Finally, our study illustrates the difficulties in the attempt to determine the relevance of molecular architecture of organelle function. This is obviously due to a number of factors, such as the multiplicity of diverse functions of individual proteins, the intricate and flexible interactions of proteins and membrane lipids, compensatory genetic effects as well as complex mechanisms of organellostasis. Future research on the molecular architecture of mitochondria will have to integrate these various determinants of this complex regulatory network.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and cell growth</title><p><italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> strain YPH499 {<italic>ura3-52</italic>, <italic>lys2-801</italic><sup><italic>amber</italic></sup>, <italic>ade2-101</italic><sup><italic>ocre</italic></sup>, <italic>trp1-Δ63</italic>, <italic>his3-Δ200</italic>, <italic>leu2-Δ1</italic>} was used as the wild type (WT).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Harner and colleagues report that the mitochondrial protein Aim24 participates in either the maintenance of, or as a new component of, the MICOS complex that regulates the junctions between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. Stability of the cardiolipin transacylase tafazzin requires MICOS activity. This work expands our understanding of the emerging topic of cristae morphogenesis. But how Aim24 functions to maintain the MICOS complex remains unclear.</p><p>There are a number of important technical concerns that would need to be addressed before this work would be acceptable for <italic>eLife</italic>. Those issues that are most important and noted by two or more reviewers include:</p><p>1) The authors should assess the change in the amount of Mcs10 in the intact MICOS complex by co-IP experiments.</p><p>2) All three reviewers feel that the immuno EM images presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> do not justify the conclusion. This needs to be repeated with the contrast high enough to allow cristae junction identification and with more gold particles displayed.</p><p>3) One of the major discussion points is that loss of Aim24 together with His-tagging of Mcs12/Mcs29 destabilizes tafazzin. Is this simply a consequence of the loss of cristae junctions? What happens to tafazzin stability when for example Fcj1, Mcs10 or other components of the MICOS complex are deleted? Is Aim24 specifically involved in tafazzin stability or is it simply that cristae junctions are required?</p><p>4) Most of the results link Aim24 to MICOS indirectly. One important result is the demonstration of direct binding of Mcs10 to Aim24 in Triton X-100. Later in the manuscript the authors show synthetic phenotypes between loss of Aim24 and His-tagging of Mcs12/Mcs29. Does expression of His-tagged Mcs12 or Mcs29 affect Mcs10 binding to Aim24?</p><p>5) Given the potential problems with tags in this system, there is concern about interactions with a tagged version of Aim24 (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in which Aim24 associates differently in Triton vs digitonin; is Aim24 tagged?). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, it is not clear why a tagged version of Aim24-3XHA is used when an antibody is available.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01684.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We thank all three referees for reviewing this manuscript. Before answering their comments, we report that very recently the community working on the MICOS complex has reached an agreement on a uniform nomenclature of the MICOS complex and the genes and proteins of its subunits. This agreement, signed by 26 authors, has been submitted as a Comment to The Journal of Cell Biology and is expected to be published shortly. We are now using this nomenclature in our revised manuscript.</p><p>Please note: In our response to the comments of the referees we are still using the old nomenclature to avoid confusion.</p><p><italic>1) The authors should assess the change in the amount of Mcs10 in the intact MICOS complex by co-IP experiments</italic>.</p><p>We have now quantified the levels of the MICOS subunits in the Aim24 deletion strain and in the Aim24-3HA strain relative to wild type. We have also quantified the distribution of Mcs10 in the 1.5 MDa and 300k Da fractions of gel filtration of wild type, the Aim24 deletion strain and the Aim24-3HA strain. Taking into account the increase of Mcs10 in the Aim24 deletion strain, it is clear that the increase of Mcs10 in the 300 kDa fraction cannot be the result of the increase of Mcs10 in whole mitochondria. If Mcs10 was present as an unassembled, supernumerary subunit, the subunits Mcs12, Mcs19, Mcs27 and Mcs29 which are increased like Mcs10 would be expected to be present as supernumerary species. This is not the case. Moreover, in the Aim24-3HA strain Mcs10 is not increased, but Mcs10 is completely dissociated upon gel filtration. This strongly supports the notion that indeed the deletion of Aim24, like the His-tagging of Aim24 alters the interaction of Mcs10 with the other MICOS subunits and affects the integrity of MICOS.</p><p>We have not performed co-immunoprecipitation because this procedure leads to partial falling apart of the MICOS complex. The MICOS complex is not held together by strong forces and binding of antibodies might lead to displacement of other subunits.</p><p>We have now included the determination of the steady state levels of MICOS subunits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref> and have discussed the whole issue in the text.</p><p><italic>2) All three reviewers feel that the immuno EM images presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2F</italic></xref> <italic>do not justify the conclusion. This needs to be repeated with the contrast high enough to allow cristae junction identification and with more gold particles displayed</italic>.</p><p>Unfortunately, the immuno EM image presented had lost its contrast during processing of the manuscript. We are now showing the same image with higher contrast, but have included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> several further images demonstrating the presence of Mcs10 at crista junctions. We have also quantified the distribution of Mcs10 by evaluating 70 mitochondrial profiles and include the numbers (very similar percentage of Mcs10 in the mutant as in wild type) now in the text. We could provide the original images if there is still a loss of contrast due to conversion to PDF.</p><p><italic>3) One of the major discussion points is that loss of Aim24 together with His-tagging of Mcs12/Mcs29 destabilizes tafazzin. Is this simply a consequence of the loss of cristae junctions? What happens to tafazzin stability when for example Fcj1, Mcs10 or other components of the MICOS complex are deleted? Is Aim24 specifically involved in tafazzin stability or is it simply that cristae</italic> <italic>junctions are required?</italic></p><p>We show now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> that in mitochondria lacking Fcj1 or Mcs10 the steady state levels of tafazzin are not altered. Notably, crista junctions in these two strains are virtually absent. Therefore, loss of tafazzin is not a simple consequence of loss of cristae junctions. Also, in the absence of Aim24 tafazzin is present (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Most of the results link Aim24 to MICOS indirectly.

Unfortunately it is not possible to co-isolate Aim24 together with Mcs10-3xHA by co-IP experiments. It seems, that the anti-HA antibody displaces Aim24.</p><p><italic>5) Given the potential problems with tags in this system, there is concern about interactions with a tagged version of Aim24 (i.e.,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>in which Aim24 associates differently in Triton vs digitonin; is Aim24 tagged?).

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> the HA-tagged version of Aim24 was used to demonstrate that its expression has a similar effect on the integrity of the MICOS complex upon gel filtration as deletion of Aim24, not for reasons of usage of the anti-HA antibody.</p></body></sub-article></article>
