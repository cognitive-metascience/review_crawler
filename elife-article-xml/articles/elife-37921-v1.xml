In vertebrates, only a few methylhistidine-containing proteins have been reported, including β-actin as an essential example. The evolutionary conserved methylation of β-actin H73 is catalyzed by an as yet unknown histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase. We report here that the protein SETD3 is the actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase. In vitro, recombinant rat and human SETD3 methylated β-actin at H73. Knocking-out SETD3 in both human HAP1 cells and in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> resulted in the absence of methylation at β-actin H73 in vivo, whereas β-actin from wildtype cells or flies was &gt; 90% methylated. As a consequence, we show that Setd3-deficient HAP1 cells have less cellular F-actin and an increased glycolytic phenotype. In conclusion, by identifying SETD3 as the actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase, our work pioneers new research into the possible role of this modification in health and disease and questions the substrate specificity of SET-domain-containing enzymes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>SETD3 protein</kwd><kwd>actin-specific histidine N-methyltransferase</kwd><kwd>EC 2.1.1.85</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281</institution-id><institution>Narodowe Centrum Nauki</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Opus Grant (DEC-2013/11/B/NZ1/00078)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drozak</surname><given-names>Jakub</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Chercheurs qualifié</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Veiga-da-Cunha</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The Erasmus+ Programme</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Terreri</surname><given-names>Marianna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CePT infrastructure</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jagielski</surname><given-names>Adam K</given-names></name><name><surname>Drozak</surname><given-names>Jakub</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vertommen</surname><given-names>Didier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerstwo Nauki i Szkolnictwa Wyższego</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DSM 501-D114-86-011500-23</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kwiatkowski</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Histone-lysine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase SETD3 (NP_115609.2) was identified as the actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase, an enzyme catalyzing the extremely well-conserved methylation of H73 in β-actin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein methylation is one of the most common post-translation modifications (PTMs) in eukaryotic cells (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clarke, 2013</xref>) and histones are the best studied substrates of protein <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferases. Consequently, much is known about the methylation of lysine and arginine residues in histones and about the fundamental role of such modifications in the epigenetic control of mammalian gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Greer and Shi, 2012</xref>). In addition, there are a growing number of examples showing that the methylation of non-histone proteins is a prevalent PTM that regulates diverse biological processes, including protein synthesis and signal transduction (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biggar and Li, 2015</xref>). More interestingly, non-histone proteins may be methylated on atypical residues such as glutamate, glutamine, cysteine and histidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clarke, 2013</xref>). The methylation of histidine residues in proteins has been known for many years but, curiously, only for a few proteins in Nature, including β-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al., 1967</xref>), S100A9 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raftery et al., 1996</xref>), myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elzinga and Collins, 1977</xref>), myosin kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meyer and Mayr, 1987</xref>) and ribosomal protein RPL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Webb et al., 2010</xref>). However, a recent study from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ning et al. (2016)</xref> suggests that protein methylation on histidine residues may actually be a quite common phenomenon, modifying dozens if not hundreds of intracellular proteins in mammalian cells.</p><p>The current knowledge on histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferases, which are the enzymes that catalyze the methylation of histidines in proteins is still sparse. The yeast protein Yil110w (Hpm1p), which methylates histidine 243 in the ribosomal protein Rpl3p, is the first and only histidine protein methyltransferase molecularly identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Webb et al., 2010</xref>). Hpm1p is the seven β-strand methyltransferase (7BS MTase), which has been classified in the methyltransferase family 16 (MTF16) (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Falnes et al., 2016</xref>). The MTF16 group comprises mostly protein-lysine methyltransferases, such as Mettl20–23 and Camkmt, with the noticeable exceptions of Hpm1p and of Efm7, which methylates the N-terminal glycine in the eukaryotic translation elongation factor one alpha (eEF1A). The MTF16 group appears to be distinct from both the other known 7BS protein-lysine MTases (e.g. Dot1L, Mettl10 and N6amt2) and the non-protein methylating 7BS MTases (e.g. Mettl1, Comt and Gnmt). On the other hand, the enzyme responsible for actin-specific histidine methylation has been partially purified, but the gene encoding this enzyme remains to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vijayasarathy and Narasinga Rao, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raghavan et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells and a major component of the cytoskeleton (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pollard and Cooper, 2009</xref>). It is a highly conserved protein during evolution (≈90% identity between yeast and human protein), and in vertebrates there are three main isoforms that only differ by a few amino acids at their N-terminus. α-Actins are expressed in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle, whereas β- and γ-isoforms are present in non-muscle and muscle cells. Under physiological conditions, actin exists as a 42-kDa monomeric globular protein (G-actin) that binds ATP and spontaneously polymerizes into stable filaments (F-actin). Once these filaments have been assembled, the terminal phosphate of the bound ATP is hydrolyzed and slowly released from actin, leading to the sequential depolymerization of the filament. The maintenance of a pool of actin monomers, the initialization of the polymerization process, and the regulation of the assembly and turnover of actin filaments are extremely complex and well controlled. These involve more than 100 interacting partner proteins, so that actin contributes to more protein–protein interactions than any other protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lappalainen, 2016</xref>). Actin plays a role in many central cell functions, including cell growth, division, and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dominguez and Holmes, 2011</xref>), which makes it essential for cell survival. Consequently, various efforts have been made to elucidate the role of the conserved methylation of the H73 residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nyman et al., 2002</xref>). As a result, it was shown in vitro that H73 methylation stabilizes actin filaments, and that the rate of filaments depolymerization was increased when actin was non-methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nyman et al., 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, the physiological effects of actin hypomethylation have yet to be reported in cells, tissues or organisms.</p><p>Here, we report the identification of actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.85) as SET domain-containing protein 3 (SETD3, C14orf154), which was previously shown to act as a histone lysine methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eom et al., 2011</xref>). We reveal that SETD3 is responsible for the methylation of H73 in human and drosophila actin, and that a loss of SETD3 activity impacts the phenotype of the human HAP1 cell line by lowering F-actin content and increasing glycolytic activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Purification and identification of rat actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase</title><p>Actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase activity was assayed by measuring the incorporation of the [<sup>3</sup>H]methyl group of [<sup>3</sup>H]<italic>S</italic>-adenosyl methionine ([<sup>3</sup>H]SAM) into either homogeneous recombinant human β-actin produced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> or a H73A β-actin mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which served as a negative control, ensuring that only the H73-specific <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase activity was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The use of recombinant human β-actin as the rat methyltransferase substrate was reasonable because the sequences of human and rat β-actin cannot be distinguished from one another, owing to an extreme evolutionary conservation. Following numerous purification steps, the <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase activity was purified from rat leg muscle approximately 1200-fold (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The methyltransferase was eluted as a single peak in each of the purification steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), indicating the presence of a single enzyme species. No methylation of H73A β-actin was detected at any stage of the purification, suggesting that the myofibrillar extract of rat muscle is devoid of other β-actin-methylating enzymes. The overall yield of the purification was only about 0.6% (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), largely because of the fact that in the last two steps of purification, only the most active fractions were used for the next step of the procedure.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37921.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Purification of the rat actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase.</title><p>The enzyme was purified by chromatography on (<bold>A</bold>) DEAE-Sepharose, (<bold>B</bold>) Q-Sepharose, Phenyl-Sepharose, HiScreen Blue-Sepharose (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), Superdex 200, and (<bold>C</bold>) Reactive Red 120 Agarose, as described in the 'Materials and methods' section.

The SAM molecule is bound in the bottom of the cleft, exposing its labile methyl group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

The nucleotide-binding cleft (for ATP or ADP binding) is located inside the cleft between subdomains 2 and 4, while a hydrophobic cleft is present between subdomains 1 and 3 at the ‘bottom’ of the actin molecule, and serves as a primary binding site for numerous actin-binding proteins. The methyl-accepting H73 residue is present in a nucleotide sensor loop (P70 to N78) in an insert between subdomains 1 and 2. The H73 is present at the surface of the actin monomers and seems to be easily accessed by the methyltransferase. Furthermore, the estimated dimensions of the actin monomer and of the substrate-binding cleft in SETD3 indicate that actin could be accommodated well at the cleft of the methyltransferase and that steric hindrance should not prevent interactions between these proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Characterization of recombinant SETD3 proteins</title><p>To confirm the molecular identity of rat actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase with that of rat SETD3 and to compare the activities of rat and human methyltransferases, these two SETD3 orthologs were expressed in COS-7 cells as fusion proteins with the C-terminal polyhistidine tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

This is because actin requires the assistance of the eukaryotic chaperonin CCT (TRiC) to enable it to fold into its native conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martín-Benito et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stemp et al., 2005</xref>). Completely denatured actin is, however, largely capable of re-folding in a spontaneous manner into its native tertiary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martín-Benito et al., 2002</xref>), and it was this re-folded recombinant β-actin that we used in the experiments described above. We next wanted to know whether STED3 would methylate natively folded actin, like that found in cells, equally well. To this end, recombinant human β-actin was produced in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, an eukaryotic species that is devoid of actin-specific histidine methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kalhor et al., 1999</xref>). Surprisingly, neither rat nor human SETD3 methylated ATP-β-actin or ADP-β-actin, as determined using the radiochemical assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), suggesting that the endogenous substrate of SETD3 might not be the natively folded nucleotide-bound actin monomers. More importantly, yeast-produced human β-actin became a good substrate for SETD3 when purified in denaturing conditions and re-folded into nucleotide-free quasi-native actin, as did <italic>E. coli</italic>-produced recombinant human β-actin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This effect was not due to the absence of free nucleotides in the reaction mixture because the addition of either 0.5 mM ATP or ADP (a 10-fold excess over the concentrations of nucleotides in the preparation of yeast-produced actin) did not impact the activity of SETD3 towards the refolded actin. To try to solve this puzzle, we prepared nucleotide-free yeast-produced human β-actin monomers in complex with either profilin or cofilin (two well known interacting partner proteins of β-actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lappalainen, 2016</xref>]) and tested whether the actin complexes became good substrates for SETD3. The methylation of profilin-β-actin was negligible and that of cofilin-β-actin complex was low (only ≈3–4% of the total protein in the complex could be methylated). Taken together, our results indicate that globular actin monomers (probably in complex with some actin-binding proteins) or possibly also F-actin can be methylated by SETD3 in vivo.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37921.030</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>SETD3-dependent methylation of human β-actin that is overexpressed in <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic></title><p>Homogeneous recombinant rat SETD3 (rSETD3, 0.6 µg protein) or its human orthologue (hSETD3, 0.45 µg protein) were incubated at 37°C for 40 min in the presence of 1 µM (100 pmol, ≈220 × 10<sup>3</sup> cpm) [<sup>1</sup>H+<sup>3</sup>H]SAM and 2 µM (200 pmol, 8.9 µg) homogenous recombinant human β-actin produced in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and either purified in non-denaturing conditions as complexes with ATP (ATP-actin) or ADP (ADP-actin) or denatured and refolded to obtain soluble nucleotide-free protein (refolded nucleotide-free actin).

This conclusion is supported by the following findings: (i) two different and extensive rounds of purification of the actin-methylating activity from rat skeletal muscle resulted in the identification of the protein SETD3 as the only logical candidate matching the enzymatic activity; (ii) recombinant rat SETD3 catalyzes the specific methylation of the H73 residue present in both the recombinant β-actin protein and the synthetic peptide corresponding to the nucleotide sensor loop of β-actin; (iii) in contrast to actin isolated from control HAP1 cells, the protein present in <italic>Setd3</italic>-deficient cells is essentially devoid of methylated H73 residues, as verified by MS/MS analysis; and (iv) the inactivation of SETD3 in <italic>Drosophila Setd3</italic> knockout larvae results in the complete absence of H74 methylation in all three different actins found in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>The methylation of H73 is a highly conserved modification among actins from many different eukaryotes, although it has been found to be absent from the actin of the amoeboflagellate <italic>N. gruberi</italic> and the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sussman et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nyman et al., 2002</xref>).

The independent studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref> confirmed the histone methyltransferase activity of SETD3 and suggested that the enzyme may have other non-histone substrates in the cytoplasm owing to the presence of the Rubisco LSMT substrate-binding domain in its structure. This view was further strengthened by the finding that SETD3 is predominantly localized in the cytosol of human cells, while only a small portion is found in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>). In the present study, we have not examined the activity of recombinant SETD3 towards histones because isolated histones are extremely poor substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). When we investigated the methyltransferase activity of SETD3 with either the actin peptide H or the histone peptide H3N4, however, the activity with the histone peptide was at least a 4000-fold lower than that of recombinant β-actin. Consequently, we identified actin as the novel physiological substrate of SETD3, which is present in the cytoplasm and is likely to be the most abundant actin methyltransferase. It is possible however, that SETD3 may also be a dual methyltransferase able to methylate both the Lys and His residues of other proteins, but this still requires in vivo confirmation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Quasi-native β-actin from bacterial inclusion bodies is a good substrate for the actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase</title><p>The molecular identification of the actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase through its extensive purification from rat muscles was only possible because we were able to prepare large amounts of pure β-actin monomers to be used as the substrate for measuring the enzymatic activity in radiochemical assays. Although this β-actin was produced and subsequently purified from the inclusion bodies of <italic>E. coli</italic> in the nucleotide-free form, it remained a good substrate for the methyltransferase. Given that, on the one hand, it is not possible to produce natively folded actin in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stemp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martín-Benito et al., 2002</xref>) and that, on the other hand, the ATP/ADP-free actin denatures rapidly and irreversibly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Graceffa and Dominguez, 2003</xref>), it is likely that the actin preparation used in our study may comprise actin molecules with stable non-native spatial structures. Indeed, the actin methylation reaction was still substoichiometric, and we have observed the methylation of up to 35% of the total actin present in the reaction mixture. This observation was readily reproducible in the presence of bacterial SAH nucleosidase and adenine deaminase, suggesting that it was not due to a potential accumulation of SAH in the reaction mixture (unpublished data, Drozak et al.). This indicates that only a small portion of the actin monomers produced in bacteria and purified under denaturing conditions adopted a conformation that was recognized by the SETD3 enzyme. This observation is in line with a previous report, showing only a minor methylation of actin inclusion bodies (up to 1% protein) by rabbit actin methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raghavan et al., 1992</xref>). Furthermore, SETD3 was at least 200-fold less active towards the synthetic peptide H, corresponding to the amino acid sequence surrounding the H73, than was recombinant β-actin (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). This indicated that structural features of the actin molecule other than the primary sequence of the sensor loop are probably important for its recognition by the actin methyltransferase.</p><p>Both tested SETD3 orthologs are rather ‘lazy’ enzymes, with a <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of 0.6–0.8 min<sup>−1</sup>, resembling the values estimated for protein methyltransferases rather than those measured for enzymes catalyzing the methylation of low-molecular-weight substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clarke and Banfield, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Osborne et al., 2007</xref>).

These observations suggest that the enzymes may be fully saturated by substrates and operate at rates that are close to their V<sub>max</sub> in vivo. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the recombinant β-actin used in the present kinetic studies is certainly not a physiological form of β-actin. Therefore, the affinity of SETD3 to physiological β-actin remains to be verified.</p><p>It is very intriguing to note that in our hands both the recombinant ATP- and ADP-β-actins produced in yeast (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), which are expected to have a native conformation, were not methylated by the SETD3 enzyme. By contrast, the yeast-produced actin that was purified in denaturing conditions to yield nucleotide-free quasi native protein became a good substrate for the methyltransferase. This finding may suggest that the presence of ATP or ADP could create a structural hindrance that prevents SETD3 from reaching the H73 residue if the methyltransferase interacts with actin through the nucleotide-binding cleft (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these observations have led us to hypothesize that nucleotide-free actin monomers in a complex with one or more actin-binding proteins of yet unknown identity could be the physiological substrate for the SETD3 methyltransferase. If so, this resembles the activity of the yeast Yil110w protein, the only other known protein histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase, which methylates His243 of the ribosomal Rpl3 protein only when Rpl3 is associated with the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Webb et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hadid et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>This hypothesis fits with the current knowledge on the enzymes belonging to the family of SET-domain-containing proteins. Indeed, many of these methyltransferases are found in complexes with numerous other proteins that are essential for their catalytic activity and substrate specificity. For example, to exert its catalytic activity, the yeast histone H3 methyltransferase SET1 requires the presence of seven different proteins that form a complex named COMPASS (Complex of Proteins Associated with Set1), and similar COMPASS-like complexes are formed by other mammalian SET-domain-containing methyltransferases (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herz et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Biological importance of the SETD3 methyltransferase</title><p>Several reports describing the role of SETD3 in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), myocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eom et al., 2011</xref>), cell response to hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohn et al., 2016</xref>) and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pires-Luís et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>) have been published to date.

The existence of two distinct domains in SETD3, i.e. SET and Rubisco LSMT substrate-binding domains, has been suggested to be the structural basis for such dual substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our results identify β-actin as a novel substrate of SETD3 and show that disruption of its activity leads to the depletion of F-actin and a loss of cytoskeleton integrity. This observation is probably explained by an increased rate of depolymerization of the non-methylated actin filaments. As a result, there is an accelerated conversion of a more structurally stable ATP-F-actin into a less stable ADP-F-actin, as also shown for a hypomethylated form of recombinant actin in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nyman et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, the biochemical role of the methylated H73 residue is likely to contribute to stabilizing the structure of monomers that build the ATP-F-actin and to delay the intermolecular conformational rearrangements of F-actin that complement the hydrolysis of ATP. This conclusion finds at least partial confirmation in the thermal stability assay, which shows that the methylated actin derived from the wildtype HAP1 cells is clearly more thermo-stable than the non-methylated one (SETD3-KO cells) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>). Taken together, our results show that the phenotype that we have identified in <italic>Setd3</italic>-deficient human HAP-1 cells is caused by the absence of the catalytic activity of SETD3, rather than by a non-catalytic or actin-stabilizing interaction between SETD3 and actin filaments.</p><p>The inherent instability of F-actin in <italic>Setd3</italic>-deficient HAP1 cells is likely to be at the origin of the increased lactate production by these cells. Both the polymerization and the depolymerization of actin filaments occur continuously even in resting cells and constitute a major energy drain, causing up to 50% of total ATP consumption in vertebrate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kudryashov and Reisler, 2013</xref>). Thus, the destabilization that leads to the accelerated degradation of hypomethylated F-actin probably drives an increasing demand for ATP that could be fulfilled by shifting the cell metabolism towards glycolysis. The phenotype of <italic>Setd3</italic>-deficient cells is therefore somewhat similar to that of malignant cells, suggesting that SETD3 activity may play a role in suppressing tumor development. Indeed, the hypomethylation of actin was observed in rat cells following their transformation with the Src oncogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiou et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the enzymatically inactive SET-domain-loss form of SETD3 was shown to function as a dominant-negative mutant, promoting oncogenesis in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), most probably by blocking the methylation of an unknown SETD3 substrate. It is tempting to speculate that actin could be this substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the current investigation, we have identified the rat actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase as SETD3, an enzyme catalyzing the extremely well-conserved methylation of H73 in β-actin. The SETD3 enzyme is therefore the first protein-histidine methyltransferase to be identified in vertebrates and the first SET-domain-containing enzyme possibly displaying a dual methyltransferase specificity towards both Lys and His residues in proteins. SETD3 is responsible for the methylation of H73 in human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> actin, and a loss of SETD3 activity in human HAP1 cells induces phenotypic changes resembling those present in cancer cells, suggesting that the hypomethylation of actin might be involved in tumorigenesis. Finally, this work also shows that non-native protein substrates might be useful tools in the search for novel protein methyltransferases.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Note added in proof</title><p>While this paper was in production, similar and complementary data describing the identification of SETD3 as the actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase was accepted for publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilkinson et al., 2018</xref>). Since the work was independently carried out by both research groups and equally contributes to reveal the biochemical importance of SETD3 enzyme as the actin-specific H73 N-methyltransferase, we ask the authors referring to the function SETD3 in their future publications to mention both this paper, as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilkinson et al.

The yield of β-actin methylation was about 30%, as determined for the parallel labeling reaction in the presence of [<sup>2</sup>H +<sup>3</sup>H]SAM.</p><p>For MS/MS analysis of deuterated protein, 35 µl of denatured sample (≈18 µg protein) was separated in 10% SDS-PAGE and silver stained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shevchenko et al., 1996</xref>). The bands corresponding to β-actin were excised from the gels, destained and digested with trypsin according to the methods described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shevchenko et al., 2006</xref>. In addition, 18 µl of the flesh-frozen sample (12 µg protein) was trypsin-digested ‘in solution’ for 16 hr at 30°C in 30 µl of the reaction mixture containing 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> and 1.5 µg trypsin (MS grade, Sigma-Aldrich). The digestion reaction was terminated by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1%. Resulting peptides were analyzed by nanoUPLC-tandem mass spectrometry, as described above in the section ‘Identification of rat actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase by tandem mass spectrometry’. To identify actin peptides, the full amino-acid sequence of recombinant human β-actin in fusion with the His<sub>6</sub>-tag at the N-terminus was used as a databank for the MS/MS software. Detection of the trideuterium-methylated peptides was performed in a fully automatic mode by PLGS 2.4 software (Waters, USA), following its update by adding trideuterium-methylation (+17.03448 Da) of Cys, Asp, Asn, His, Lys, Arg, Glu and Gln residues as a possible modification of peptides.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Detection of methylated β-actin from HAP1 human cell lines by tandem mass spectrometry</title><p>HAP1 wildtype (WT-A1 and WT-A2) and SETD3-KO cells (KO-A1 and KO-A3) were cultured in IMDM containing 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies), each in four 10 cm diameter plates. At confluence, the medium was rapidly removed, the plates were washed with 5 ml cold PBS and each of them scraped in 0.8 ml of buffer A (25 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 20 mM NaCl, 2.5 µg/ml leupeptin and 2.5 µg/ml antipain) and combined to collect the cells.

The column was washed with 6 ml of buffer A and proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (20–750 mM in 20 ml buffer A). The elution fractions (1 ml) were analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining and by western blotting using a rabbit anti-actin antibody (A2066, Sigma-Aldrich). The actin band of the richest fraction was cut out of the gel and digested with trypsin.</p><p>The resulting peptides were analysed by LC-MS/MS with a LTQ XL (ThermoFisher Scientific) equipped with a microflow ESI source interfaced with a Dionex Ultimate Plus Dual gradient pump, a Switchos column switching device, and a Famos Autosampler (Dionex, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Houddane et al., 2017</xref>). Raw data files were then analyzed by bioinformatics using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peak lists were generated using the application spectrum selector in the Proteome Discoverer 1.4 package. From raw files, MS/MS spectra were exported as individual files in the .dta format with the following settings: peptide mass range, 400–3500 Da; minimal total ion intensity, 500; and minimal number of fragment ions, 12. The resulting peak lists were searched using SequestHT against a human protein database obtained from Uniprot and containing only actin sequences. The following parameters were used: trypsin was selected with semi-proteolytic cleavage only after lysine and arginine; the number of internal cleavage sites was set to 2; the mass tolerance for precursor and fragment ions was 1.0 Da; and the considered dynamic modifications were + 15.99 Da for oxidized methionine,+14.00 Da for methylation on histidine and + 42.00 Da for acetylation of N-terminus or lysines. Peptide spectral matches (PSM) were filtered using charge-state versus cross-correlation scores (Xcorr) and methylation sites were validated manually.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Detection of actin methylation in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> by tandem mass spectrometry</title><p>To investigate whether the absence of SETD3 in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> also prevented actin methylation, we prepared protein extracts by homogenizing approximately 20 larvae from wildtype or SETD3 KO flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tiebe et al., 2018</xref>) in 0.5 ml of 25 mM Hepes pH 7.5 with 2.5 µg/ml of leupeptin and antipain.

Peptides were dissolved in solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in 2% acetonitrile (ACN)), directly loaded onto reversed-phase pre-column (Acclaim PepMap 100, Thermo Scientific) and eluted in backflush mode. Peptide (250 ng) separation was performed using a reversed-phase analytical column (Acclaim PepMap RSLC, 0.075 × 250 mm, Thermo Scientific) with a linear gradient of 4–27.5% solvent B (0.1% formic acid (FA) in 98% ACN) for 100 min, 27.5–40% solvent B for 10 min, 40–95% solvent B for 1 min and holding at 95% for the last 10 min at a constant flow rate of 300 nl/min on an EASY-nLC 1000 ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system. The peptides were analyzed by an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos tribrid mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). The peptides were subjected to NSI source followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in Fusion Lumos coupled online to the UPLC. Intact peptides were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 120,000. Peptides were selected for MS/MS using a higher-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD) setting of 30; ion fragments were detected in the ion trap. A data-dependent procedure that alternated between one MS scan followed by 20 MS/MS scans was applied for the top 20 precursor ions above a threshold ion count of 5.0E3 in the MS survey scan with 30.0 s dynamic exclusion. The electrospray voltage applied was 2.1 kV. MS1 spectra were obtained with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 4E5 ions and a maximum injection time of 50 ms, whereas MS2 spectra were acquired with an AGC target of 5E3 ions and a maximum injection time of 300 ms. For MS scans, the m/z scan range was 350 to 1500. The resulting MS/MS data were processed using the Sequest HT search engine within Proteome Discoverer 2.2 against a protein database containing <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> sequences obtained from Swissprot (4810 entries, version 27 10 2017). Trypsin was specified as cleavage enzyme allowing up to two missed cleavages, four modifications per peptide and up to five charges. Mass error was set to 10 ppm for precursor ions and 0.6 Da for fragment ions. Oxidation on Met, carbamidomethyl on Cys and methylation on His (+14.015 Da) were considered as variable modifications. False discovery rate (FDR) was assessed using Percolator and thresholds for protein, peptide and modification site were specified at 1%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Phenotypic analysis</title><sec id="s4-15-1"><title>Glucose consumption and lactate production</title><p>HAP1 cells (150 × 10<sup>3</sup>) were seeded in 12-well plates and incubated in IMDM with 10% FBS for 40 hr with a change of medium every 20 hr.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor.

The paper uses classical purification techniques and enzymatic assays to enrich for actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase from rat muscle. Proteomic techniques then identified SETD3 as a candidate histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase, which was subsequently validated in vitro. The authors went on to develop CRISPR knockout lines and showed that this modification is important for maintaining cellular F-actin levels and for regulating glycolysis. Overall, this paper represents the beginnings of a field of study, and we expect that it will be widely appreciated. The authors should be roundly applauded for their comprehensive Materials and methods section as it demonstrates the rigor of the work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Regarding Table 4, please provide kinetic data for the methylation of peptide mimics of histone H3 and actin in the table. If saturation is not achieved, provide estimates of k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> for each peptide. This is important for putting the catalytic efficiency in context with other enzymes that catalyze methyl transfer reactions.</p><p>2) The authors compared peptide substrates derived from actin and histone to compare SETD3 methylation activity on His and Lys. Since differences between actin protein and peptide are ~250-fold, it would be important to compare the histone H3 protein with actin protein as substrates for methyltransferase studies to put into better context the relative substrate recognition. In addition, it would be valuable to use docking to understand how SETD3 recognizes two different substrates for methyl transfer. Since the structure of human SETD3 is available, more efforts should be made to compare the structure with other well-characterized SET-domain lysine methyltransferases at the sequence and 3D levels. Given the different physical properties between Lys and His, the residues that favor Lys binding may not be conserved for His binding. More comparisons of this sort will strengthen this manuscript.</p><p>3) To access recombinant human/rat SETD3, the authors expressed these enzymes in mammalian cells, which also contain their endogenous histine methyltransferase activities. There is thus a small possibility that the histine methyltransferase activity comes from a polypeptide that can associate with SETD3 rather than intrinsic to SETD3 itself. To most effectively address this concern, the authors should access recombinant human/rat SETD3 with a single-point mutation in a conserved residue in the active site that is predicted to eliminate catalytic activity and demonstrate that such a mutation is sufficient to abolish the activity. The modeling effort described above (point 2) should allow for identification of such a mutant(s). Alternatively, SETD3 should be expressed in a cell strain which lacks endogenous His methyltransferase activity to authenticate that the enzymatic activity comes from SETD3.</p><p>4) To characterize the functional roles of SETD3-mediated actin His74me, only <italic>Setd3</italic>-deficient lines were examined. The limitation of this experiment is that it is possible that the full length protein of SETD3 rather than its catalytic activity accounts for the observed biological outcomes. Therefore, a recue experiment with active and catalytically dead SETD3 should be conducted to further validate the roles of SETD3. Alternatively, the authors could compare the functional outcomes of wild-type actin with those of His74X actin in wild-type and <italic>Setd3</italic>-deficient contexts.</p><p>5) To understand the scope of the SETD3 reaction, it would be valuable to incubate the enzyme with lysate and determine whether there are multiple substrates. If they could demonstrate that multiple proteins are methylated by this enzyme, it would greatly ramp up enthusiasm in the methyltransferase field for this PTM and enzyme function.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>6) Subsection “Characterization of Recombinant SETD3 Proteins”, last paragraph: The lack of methylation of yeast produced actin is a concern, however, the authors data are consistent with their conclusion that there must be a conformational difference that precludes methylation of this form. Does ATP inhibit methylation of refolded actin? Please comment on this possibility.</p><p>7) Ideally, the authors could develop an antibody to detect methylated histidine 73 in actin and then specifically test whether the SETD3 knockouts show less methylated actin. However, this experiment is not critical at this stage because their mass spectrometry is consistent with the loss of this modification in the knockout cells.</p><p>8) Introduction, second paragraph: Please provide information on Hpm1p homology to other known methyltransferases</p><p>9) Subsection “Generation of the HAP1 Cell Lines Deficient in SEDT3 by CRISPR/Cas9 Method”: The authors should specify whether the CRISPR knockouts represent single or double allele knockouts.</p><p>10) Subsection “Glucose Consumption and Lactate Production”: The authors use PCA for perchloric acid whereas earlier they used the molecular formula. Since PCA is used only once, HClO4 is preferred.</p><p>11) The authors should provide a figure depicting the overall reaction and should comment on what nitrogen gets methylated (if known). The side chain of His contains two nitrogen atoms. It is not clear whether one of the two or both nitrogen atoms can be methylated by SETD3. If the latter is the case, did the authors identify a di-methylated product?</p><p>12) Figure 1: The fraction numbers 200, 400, 900, 1400 are confusing and it is unclear why they are provided in this format instead of, for example, 1, 2, 3 etc.</p><p>13) Figure 4: Change the color of H73 in panel B as the current colors are not color blind friendly.</p><p>14) Figure 5 legend: The legend is incomplete and it is difficult to evaluate the data in the figure.</p><p>15) &quot;Actin-specific histidine N-methyltransferase&quot; and &quot;specifically modifies H73 residue&quot; are imprecise descriptions for the following two reasons: 1) Authors used actin as the only protein substrate for SETD3. It is unknown if SETD3 can methylate His residues in other proteins. 2) SETD3 is a known lysine methyltransferase for K4 and K36 of H3. Therefore, &quot;dual methyltransferase&quot; may be a better choice in this case.</p><p>16) There is about a 250-fold activity difference between peptide and protein substrate measured here. Such differences may be caused by different recognition efficiency and possibly a specificity shift to other methylation sites. The authors stated that the His73 residue was the only tri-deuterium-methylated peptide in the MS analysis (subsection “Characterization of Recombinant SETD3 Proteins”, third paragraph). It is not clear if mono- and di-deuterium-methylated sites have been scrutinized.</p><p>17) The authors applied 6 purification steps to isolate the active fraction for His methylation. It would be helpful to provide the rationale for each purification step. Also, it is not clear how the purification (-fold) in Table 2 was calculated.</p><p>18) Since only nucleotide-free actin is the substrate, is it possible that methylated His facilitates the binding of actin with nucleotide and affects the dynamics of polymerization and depolymerization?</p><p>19) Protein markers in some figures including Figure 5, 8, Figure 6—figure supplement 1 seem to be a drawing instead of an image.</p><p>20) Professional editing to improve the writing would be helpful.</p><p>21) To characterize that His73 is the only target site of SETD3 with MS with recombinant proteins, the authors mentioned that only a His73 peptide contains this modification. In this situation, the authors should describe the percentage of MS coverage of actin was achieved (hopefully close to 100%).</p><p>22) It would be appreciated if the authors could comment on the percentage of His73me-containing actin out of the total actin. In general, the higher the percentage is, the more likely it is that this methylation event is functionally important.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37921.048</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Regarding Table 4, please provide kinetic data for the methylation of peptide mimics of histone H3 and actin in the table.

However, we were unable to obtain reasonable results for the histone peptide H3N4, due to the extremely low activity of SETD3 enzymes towards peptide H3N4, resulting in a very week and highly non-reproducible radiolabeling of this peptide as well as a high background radioactivity (a consequence of [<sup>3</sup>H]SAM degradation).</p><p>This kind of problem was expected, since the activity of SETD3 on histone peptide H3N4 is at least 10-fold lower than it is on actin peptide H (cf. Figure 8 – —figure supplement 1) and close to 5000-fold lower than the SETD3 activity on actin protein (cf. Table 4). However we tried to overcome these limitations by using very high concentrations of histone peptide H3N4 (up to 40 mM) and increased the radio assay time, which resulted in a loss of the enzyme’s activity.</p><p>Together, these results further support our hypothesis that SETD3 is an actin-methylating enzyme rather than a histone methyltransferase in vivo, resembling, for example, SETD7 enzyme that displays limited activity on nucleosomes in vitro, and efficiently methylates numerous non-histone substrates in vivo [for review see Herz, Garruss and Shilatifard, 2013].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors compared peptide substrates derived from actin and histone to compare SETD3 methylation activity on His and Lys.

More comparisons of this sort will strengthen this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We find the reviewers’ suggestions interesting and we thank them for it. However, we think it is unlikely that either (1) the comparison of SETD3 activity towards histone H3 and actin proteins or (2) the suggested docking experiments will be successful and help to elucidate the mechanism of substrate recognition by the methyltransferase studied. The reasons for this are stated below:</p><p>At this stage we still do not know what is the native form(s) of actin that is the in vivo substrate of SETD3. As we emphasize in the manuscript, native ATP-/ADP-actin, for which the crystallographic data is indeed available, is not a substrate for SETD3 in vitro. The enzyme methylates only non-physiological, quasi-native nucleotide-free actin of unknown structure, indicating that the nucleotide-free native actin, probably in complex with one or more as yet not identified stabilizing protein(s), is likely to be the actual substrate for SETD3 in vivo. The same is also true for histone H3 protein, since the purified histone H3 is not a substrate for SETD3 enzyme either, in agreement with the observation that the histone methyltransferase was shown to modify H3 protein only if it is incorporated into isolated native nucleosomes (Chen et al., 2013).</p><p>All these observations are in fact in good agreement with the current knowledge for the enzymes belonging to the family of SET domain-containing proteins. Many of these methyltransferases are found in complexes with numerous other proteins that are essential for their catalytic activity and substrate specificity. For example, to exert its catalytic activity, yeast histone H3 methyltransferase SET1 requires the presence of 7 different proteins that form a complex named COMPASS (Complex of Proteins Associated with Set1), and similar COMPASS-like complexes are formed by mammalian SET-domain containing methyltransferases [for review see Herz, Garruss and Shilatifard,2013].</p><p>To fulfill the suggestion from the reviewers diligently, the docking experiments should be performed employing 3D structures of SETD3 and the actin peptide H that could be reasonably predicted with, for example, PEP-Fold server. We have in fact started such experiments and ceased them eventually, when we identified a yet non-released PDB record by Horton et al. (PDB: 6MBL), describing a crystallographic structure of SETD3 with the actin peptide (but not with the actin protein!). Therefore, since this should provide the required results very soon, we have decided to drop these experiments.</p><p>We have however tried to strengthen the in vivo function of SETD3 as the actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase, as suggested by the reviewers, by determining the methylation status of actin in tissues of SETD3 knock-out <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larvae, employing the tandem mass spectrometry. These results are now included in Table 5, showing that the knockout of SETD3 prevented methylation of all three different forms of actin (actin-42A, -57B and -87E) present in extracts from the fly larvae, while all H74-containg actin peptides (which corresponds to the H73 in the mammalian protein) derived from wild-type larvae were all methylated. We believe that these findings further confirm the molecular identification of SETD3 as the actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To access recombinant human/rat SETD3, the authors expressed these enzymes in mammalian cells, which also contain their endogenous histine methyltransferase activities. There is thus a small possibility that the histine methyltransferase activity comes from a polypeptide that can associate with SETD3 rather than intrinsic to SETD3 itself.

The modeling effort described above (point 2) should allow for identification of such a mutant(s). Alternatively, SETD3 should be expressed in a cell strain which lacks endogenous His methyltransferase activity to authenticate that the enzymatic activity comes from SETD3.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ objections, and to provide an unambiguous answer, we have produced both rat and human recombinant SETD3 in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified them with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (see Figure 7—figure supplement 1.). As now shown in Figure 7, <italic>E coli</italic>-derived purified recombinant SETD3 enzymes methylate actin protein with specific activity similar to that determined for SETD3 expressed in mammalian COS-7 cells (≈ 5 nmol × min<sup>-1</sup>× mg<sup>-1</sup> protein). We believe that, this together with the various knock out models solve the concerns of the reviewers that are stated above.</p><p>We have now included the activity of <italic>E. coli</italic>-produced SETD3 towards actin in the Results section (subsection “Characterization of Recombinant SETD3 Proteins”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) To characterize the functional</italic> roles <italic>of SETD3-mediated actin His74me, only Setd3-deficient lines were examined. The limitation of this experiment is that it is possible that the full length protein of SETD3 rather than its catalytic activity accounts for the observed biological outcomes. Therefore, a recue experiment with active and catalytically dead SETD3 should be conducted to further validate the roles of SETD3. Alternatively, the authors could compare the functional outcomes of wild-type actin with those of His74X actin in wild-type and Setd3-deficient contexts.</italic> </p><p>We agree that rescue experiments could help strengthen that the phenotypic observations in HAP1 cells are indeed due to a lack of SETD3 catalytic activity. We think however, that the facts mentioned below rather support a crucial role of the catalytic activity (instead of the suggested structural effects) for the observed biological outcomes of <italic>Setd3-deficiency</italic>.</p><p>First, proteomics data show that actin protein is at least 40-fold more abundant than SETD3 in mammalian cells (protein expression level: 1836,1 and 44,1 ppm for β-actin and SETD3, respectively, The MaxQuant DataBase), indicating that only catalytic amounts of SETD3 are present in cells. This becomes even more apparent when it is contrasted with corresponding data for the well-characterized actin-binding proteins. For example, human cofilin-1 and profilin-2, actin-interacting proteins that regulate the rate of its polymerization/depolymerization through “a structural mechanism” are present in cells at levels similar to that of actin (2859,7 and 1577,4 ppm for cofilin-1 and profilin-2, respectively, The MaxQuant DataBase), while tropomyosin β chain that binds to actin filaments and stabilizes them is present in about 20-fold excesses over the SETD3 in various human cells (804,0 ppm, The MaxQuant DataBase).</p><p>Secondly, Nyman and colleagues [Nyman et al., 2002] reported that purified actin filaments built of monomers lacking H73 methylation show a significantly increased rate of depolymerization. This effect is due to an inherent structural instability of non-methylated actin monomers (and not the loss of any actin-interacting protein), which the authors detected using a thermal stability assay. We have thus tested the thermostability of actin present in cell-free lysates of control (methylated actin) and SETD3-KO (non-methylated actin) HAP1 cells. This was performed by heating the lysates for 5 min and subsequent quantification of the still soluble (non-denatured) actin by western blotting. As now shown in a novel Figure 14, at temperatures between 30 and 46 °C, the methylated actin (WT) is clearly more stable than the protein devoid of such modification (SETD3-KO). These results unambiguously show that the loss of SETD3 enzymatic activity and not the protein itself is the cause of observed disturbances in the cytoskeleton integrity of SETD3 KO cells.</p><p>We have now included into the Results section a short paragraph describing the results of the thermostability assay (subsection “Absence of SETD3 reduces F-actin and increases glycolytic rate in SETD3-deficient HAP1 cells”, second paragraph).</p><p>Summing up, we believe that these data are a reasonable argument in support that the phenotype we have identified in <italic>Setd3</italic>-deficient human HAP-1 cells is indeed due to lack of catalytic action of SETD3, rather than a non-catalytic/actin stabilizing interaction of SETD3. However, we took into consideration the reviewer’s comment and have now introduced a short paragraph addressing these concerns in the Discussion section (subsection “Biological Importance of SETD3 Methyltransferase”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) To understand the scope of the SETD3 reaction, it would be valuable to incubate the enzyme with lysate and determine whether there are multiple substrates. If they could demonstrate that multiple proteins are methylated by this enzyme, it would greatly ramp up enthusiasm in the methyltransferase field for this PTM and enzyme function.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ suggestions, and such experiments have already been done and their results are freely available now. Briefly, Cohn and colleagues [Cohn et al., 2016] performed a proteomic screen using the ProtoArray platform to identify interactors of SETD3 among 9500 human proteins tested. They found 172 novel SETD3 interacting proteins (including actin!), belonging to very different ontology classes (nucleic acid binding, transcription factors, enzymes modulators, cytoskeleton protein, etc.). Next, the authors decided to concentrate on the transcription factor FoxM1, showing that SETD3 apparently methylates this protein, though the identification of methylated site was not performed.</p><p>In contrast to this, when we searched for other proteins (in addition to actin) that might have been differently methylated in their histidines among those identified by LCMS in the larvae extracts of the WT flies and SETD3 KO ones, we did not to see any others.</p><p>Together, these findings suggest that one should not exclude the possibility that SETD3 might have multiple substrates yet, but more dedicated work is necessary to provide an answer to this question which could be the subject of another investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p><p>6) Subsection “Characterization of Recombinant SETD3 Proteins”, last paragraph: The lack of methylation of yeast produced actin is a concern, however, the authors data are consistent with their conclusion that there must be a conformational difference that precludes methylation of this form. Does ATP inhibit methylation of refolded actin? Please comment on this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, we had already addressed that exact same question but had not included the results in the manuscript. We found that the addition of either 0.5 mM ATP or ADP (10-fold excess over the nucleotides concentration in the preparation of yeast produced actin) did not impact the activity of either human or rat SETD3 towards the refolded actin.</p><p>We have now introduced a short sentence into the Results section, that provides this information (subsection “Characterization of Recombinant SETD3 Proteins”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Ideally, the authors could develop an antibody to detect methylated histidine 73 in actin and then specifically test whether the SETD3 knockouts show less methylated actin.

However, we now show (by MS analysis) that the methylhistidine-containing actin is also absent from tissues of SETD3 knock-out <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larvae (see comment 2.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Introduction, second paragraph: Please provide information on Hpm1p homology to other known methyltransferases</p></disp-quote><p>Hpm1p (also known as YIL110W) is the seven β-strand methyltransferase (7BS MTase), containing motifs I, post I and motif II that are hallmarks of this group of enzymes [Webb et al., 2010]. Recently Hpm1p has been classified in the so-called methyltransferase family 16 (MTF16), based on the presence of the conserved DXXY motif localized immediately downstream of Motif II [for review see Falnes et al., 2016]. The MTF16 group comprises mostly protein-lysine methyltransferases such as Mettl20 – 23 and Camkmt, with the noticeable exception of Hpm1p and Efm7 that methylate His243 of the yeast ribosomal protein Rpl3p ribosomal and the N-terminal glycine in the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 α (eEF1A), respectively. The MTF16 group appears to be distinct from both other known 7BS protein-lysine MTases (e.g., Dot1L, Mettl10, N6amt2) and non-protein methylating 7BS MTases (e.g. Mettl1, Comt, Gnmt). These observations illustrate well that in general, the 7BS MTase represent a diverse set of enzymes, both in terms of amino acid sequence and of protein structure. They all share the core 7BS fold, but the additional structural elements required to make up the catalytically active enzyme vary greatly.</p><p>We have now introduced a short paragraph into the Introduction section to provide information on the homology of Hpm1p to other members of methyltransferase family 16 (Introduction, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Subsection “Generation of the HAP1 Cell Lines Deficient in SEDT3 by CRISPR/Cas9 Method”: The authors should specify whether the CRISPR knockouts represent single or double allele knockouts.</p></disp-quote><p>The HAP1 cells have a haploid karyotype except for a disomy of chromosome 8 (25, XY, +8, PH<sup>+</sup>) and are therefore considered near-haploid.

The side chain of His contains two nitrogen atoms. It is not clear whether one of the two or both nitrogen atoms can be methylated by SETD3. If the latter is the case, did the authors identify a di-methylated product?</p></disp-quote><p>We detected only a mono-methylated histidine residue in both recombinant actin protein and synthetic peptide H by mass spectrometry analysis. To the best of our knowledge, no di-methylated histidine residues have ever been identified in proteins or metabolites.</p><p>We did not investigate which nitrogen of imidazole ring is methylated by SETD3 since this information is provided by Raghavan and collaborators [Raghavan, Lindberg and Schutt, 1992] who show that the actin-specific histidine methyltransferase catalyzes exclusively <italic>N</italic>τ-methylation of H73 residue.</p><p>We have now introduced a new Figure 1—figure supplement 2, describing the reaction catalyzed by the actin-specific histidine methyltransferase (SETD3), clearly showing the position of methylated nitrogen in the imidazole ring of histidine.

It is unknown if SETD3 can methylate His residues in other proteins. 2) SETD3 is a known lysine methyltransferase for K4 and K36 of H3. Therefore, &quot;dual methyltransferase&quot; may be a better choice in this case.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewers’ objection, but we would rather keep this description to indicate that: 1) SETD3 is the protein which indeed corresponds to the actin-specific histidine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase that is currently referenced as EC 2.1.1.85 and 2) actin is the only well-characterized substrate for SETD3, and much research effort is still needed to reliably identify other physiologically relevant substrates for this enzyme.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) There is about a 250-fold activity difference between peptide and protein substrate measured here. Such differences may be caused by different recognition efficiency and possibly a specificity shift to other methylation sites. The authors stated that the His73 residue was the only tri-deuterium-methylated peptide in the MS analysis (subsection “Characterization of Recombinant SETD3 Proteins”, third paragraph). It is not clear if mono- and di-deuterium-methylated sites have been scrutinized.</p></disp-quote><p>We share the reviewers’ opinion that the difference in the activity of SETD3 towards peptide H and actin substrates is plausibly the consequence of the several thousand-fold lower affinity of the enzyme for the peptide substrate (see Table 4). Though, in our opinion, the simplest explanation of this phenomenon is that the more rigid H73-containg sensor loop of actin is much better fitted into the catalytic pocket of SETD3 than the unstructured peptide H.</p><p>We detected neither mono-deuterium (-CH<sub>2</sub>D, + 15.021926 Da) nor di-deuterium methylation (-CHD<sub>2</sub>, +16.028203 Da) of recombinant actin protein by Q-TOF mass spectrometry. This was in fact expected as the isotopic enrichment of utilized (S-methyl-d<sub>3</sub>)SAM (D-4093, C/D/N Isotopes Inc., Canada) was equal to 99% atom D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) The authors applied 6 purification steps to isolate the active fraction for His methylation. It would be helpful to provide the rationale for each purification step. Also, it is not clear how the purification (-fold) in Table 2 was calculated.</p></disp-quote><p>Since the molecular properties of the investigated methyltransferase were unknown, the choice of the purification strategy used is based both on our protein purification experience and on preliminary small scale trials. Once the purification conditions were optimized, the protocol was scaled-up for the FPLC as shown in the manuscript. The chromatographic methods used here, included ion-exchanger, gel filtration and affinity chromatography columns, which are those classically used when one is aiming to purify (and obtain a significantly enriched preparation) of a naturally abundant protein from a tissue.</p><p>The purification-fold is an enrichment in specific activity of SETD3 from one purification step to the next. So if the specific activity of SETD3 is 1 nmole/min/mg prot in the initial myofibrillar extract and 100 nmole/min/mg prot in the preparation obtained after 2 purification steps, the purification fold for SETD3 is 100/1 = 100-fold (there is a 100-fold enrichment in the activity of SETD3 after these two purification steps compared to the activity in the initial extract).</p><p>This way of measuring protein enrichment is classically used during protein purification experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) Since only nucleotide-free actin is the substrate, is it possible that methylated His facilitates the binding of actin with nucleotide and affects the dynamics of polymerization and depolymerization?</p></disp-quote><p>Nyman et al. [Nyman et al., 2002] showed that the rate constant for dissociation of ATP-H73A-actin is 10-fold higher than that for the ATP-actin, indicating that the methylated His73 may indeed facilitate/stabilize the binding of ATP to the actin monomer. However, based on the overall results, the authors concluded that the main biochemical role of methylated H73 is to delay the hydrolysis of ATP and P<sub>i</sub>-release, which prevents too rapid conversion of F-actin from ATP-state to ADP-state. Hence, an accelerated appearance of ADP-actin is likely the major cause of the observed disturbances in the integrity of nonmethylated F-actin.</p><p>We have now introduced a few sentences into Discussion section to clarify the importance of H73 methylation for the stability of ATP-actin (subsection “Biological Importance of SETD3 Methyltransferase”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) Protein markers in some figures including Figure 5, 8, Figure 6—figure supplement 1 seem to be a drawing instead of an image.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this observation that in fact is correct. All western-blotting analyses were performed, employing chemiluminescence and signals acquisition with X-ray film, while the pattern of prestained protein ladder was copied from the blotting membrane onto the film using a set of felt-tip pens.</p><p>We have now modified the Materials and methods section to explain the presence of the hand-drawn protein ladder (subsection “Analytical Methods”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) Professional editing to improve the writing would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>The text has now been read and the English improved and edited by a senior scientist, fluent in English.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) To characterize that His73 is the only target site of SETD3 with MS with recombinant proteins, the authors mentioned that only a His73 peptide contains this modification. In this situation, the authors should describe the percentage of MS coverage of actin was achieved (hopefully close to 100%).</p></disp-quote><p>The percentage of actin sequence coverage in MS analysis was equal to 75% (see Figure 9—source data 1). Though, this value is still quite far from 100%, taking into account that all known methyl-accepting sites in human actin (K18, K68, H73, K84, K191 and K326, see PhosphoSitePlus database) were covered and H73 was the only methylated residue in our analysis, and no radiolabeling of H73A actin was detected in the presence of SETD3, we think that our data fully support the conclusion that H73 is the only target site for SETD3 activity.</p><p>We took into consideration the reviewers’ comment and we have now modified the text of the Results section to provide required information (subsection “Characterization of Recombinant SETD3 Proteins”, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22) It would be appreciated if the authors could comment on the percentage of His73me-containing actin out of the total actin. In general, the higher the percentage is, the more likely it is that this methylation event is functionally important.</p></disp-quote><p>The data shown in the newly added Table 5 strongly indicates that 100% of actin is methylated in H73 in vivo, as non-methylated actin was not detected in extracts from <italic>Setd3</italic>-deficient fly larvae. However, to obtain a more comprehensive picture it would be easier to use an antibody that specifically recognizes meH73, which we have not developed, that could be used to quantify the amount of the methylated actin.</p><p>The functional importance of results shown in Table 5 has been now highlighted in the Results section (subsection “SETD3 is the β-actin H73 methyl transferase in HAP1 Human Cells and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>”, last paragraph.</p></body></sub-article></article>
