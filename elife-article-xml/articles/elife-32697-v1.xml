Transcriptional programs determining cellular identity are preserved by epigenetically-acting chromatin factors. Although such regulators are among the most frequently mutated genes in cancer, it is not well understood how an abnormal epigenetic condition contributes to tumor onset. In this work, we investigated the gene signature of tumors caused by disruption of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> epigenetic regulator, <italic>polyhomeotic (ph).</italic> In larval tissue <italic>ph</italic> mutant cells show a shift towards an embryonic-like signature. Using loss- and gain-of-function experiments we uncovered the embryonic transcription factor <italic>knirps (kni)</italic> as a new oncogene. The oncogenic potential of <italic>kni</italic> lies in its ability to activate JAK/STAT signaling and block differentiation. Conversely, tumor growth in <italic>ph</italic> mutant cells can be substantially reduced by overexpressing a differentiation factor. This demonstrates that epigenetically derailed tumor conditions can be reversed when targeting key players in the transcriptional network.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32697.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When an animal is developing as an embryo, different cells start to specialize into the specific cell types needed to form the tissues and organs of the body. How an individual cell commits to become a certain type of cell is mostly determined by which of the genes in its DNA are active. In animal cells, DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones, and one way that cells can maintain their distinct pattern of gene activity is via chemical tags on the histones. These tags can switch nearby genes on or off, and are added or removed by other proteins called epigenetic regulators. The epigenetic tags are also stably inherited when the cell divides, meaning that a cell’s identity can be maintained over many cell generations.</p><p>If epigenetic regulators fail to work properly or get disrupted, the pattern of gene activity in a cell becomes altered. As a consequence, that cell can lose its identity and will often turn into a cancer cell. In fact, mutations in epigenetic regulators are found in several human cancers. It is not yet understood how these changes in gene expression lead cells to become cancerous.</p><p>Torres et al. have now analyzed an epigenetic regulator called Polyhomeotic in developing larvae of the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. The results show that when Polyhomeotic is not produced the fly larvae develop tumors. Moreover, the mutant cells without Polyhomeotic had different gene expression profiles compared to normal cells. This in turn caused the mutant cells, which had previously committed to a certain fate, to become more like the unspecialized cells found in early embryos.</p><p>Torres et al. next showed that, among the genes that were incorrectly regulated when Polyhomeotic’s activity was compromised, one gene called <italic>knirps</italic> was switched on by mistake, which led the mutant cells to become tumor cells. When the activity of <italic>knirps</italic> was reduced instead, almost no tumors grew. Additionally, Torres et al. found that the protein encoded by <italic>knirps</italic> activates a signaling pathway that keeps tumor cells unspecialized by blocking their normal progress to a more mature and specialized state – a process known as differentiation. Experimentally raising the levels of a different molecule that ultimately promotes differentiation caused the tumor cells to grow less.</p><p>These findings suggest that tumors caused when epigenetic regulation goes awry may be reversed by targeting key genes such as <italic>knirps</italic>. Further work is now needed to test whether these findings will also extend to humans. Forcing cancer cells from a highly dividing, non-specialized state into a dead-end, mature state may lead to new ways to treat cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dedifferentiation</kwd><kwd>embryonic-TF signature</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>epigenetic regulation</kwd><kwd>tumor onset</kwd><kwd>cell fate loss</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_143922</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paro</surname><given-names>Renato</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ETH Zurich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Torres</surname><given-names>Joana</given-names></name><name><surname>Monti</surname><given-names>Remo</given-names></name><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>Ariane L</given-names></name><name><surname>Seimiya</surname><given-names>Makiko</given-names></name><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Yanrui</given-names></name><name><surname>Beerenwinkel</surname><given-names>Niko</given-names></name><name><surname>Beisel</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name><name><surname>Paro</surname><given-names>Renato</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF1131-2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beira</surname><given-names>Jorge V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A previously unknown oncogenic feature of an embryonic transcription factor was uncovered from transcriptomic analysis of tumors that lack functional Polycomb silencing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During development, epigenetic regulators are responsible for controlling and restraining cellular plasticity. This tight regulation allows cells to differentiate faithfully and heritably towards a specific fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roy and Hebrok, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wainwright and Scaffidi, 2017</xref>). An appropriate balance between proliferation and differentiation is fundamental and multiple regulatory layers of transcription factors and epigenetic regulators are employed to accomplish the underlying transcriptional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonda and Ramsay, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Piunti and Shilatifard, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Many epigenetic regulators are evolutionary conserved and among the most commonly mutated genes in human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Piunti and Shilatifard, 2016</xref>). Disruption of epigenetic constraints leads to global reorganization of the epigenome and changes in transcriptional profiles, which might provide a cellular state permissive for tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wainwright and Scaffidi, 2017</xref>). Indeed, disturbed transcriptional profiles and putative oncogenic transcriptional regulators have recently gained significance as better alternatives for therapeutic targets in comparison to signaling pathways. Transcription factors (TFs) are less prone to be bypassed by alternative mutational events, and their perturbation can affect several cancer hallmarks. In addition, due to the complexity of transcriptional networks, it is unlikely that one TF functioning as an oncogenic driver can be entirely replaced by another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonda and Ramsay, 2015</xref>). For these reasons it is fundamental to identify the core transcriptional networks defining cancer cell types, and target those regulators crucial for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonifer and Cockerill, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Epigenetic regulators involved in preserving cellular identity are composed of two classes of chromatin proteins, the Polycomb (PcG) and the Trithorax group (TrxG), whose complementary functions maintain the repressed and active gene expression state, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Geisler and Paro, 2015</xref>). PcG proteins are organized into two basic complexes, Polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Piunti and Shilatifard, 2016</xref>). One example of classical PcG targets are homeotic genes encoding Homeobox TFs, first identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and responsible for correct spatial body development in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shah and Sukumar, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abate-Shen, 2002</xref>). The altered expression of Hox genes in human tumors suggests important roles for both oncogenesis and tumor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shah and Sukumar, 2010</xref>), which further hints towards an role for PcG proteins in oncogenesis.</p><p>The tumor suppressive role of PcG proteins, in particular PRC1 members in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs, has been extensively investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Classen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martinez et al., 2009</xref>). However, the effects on the transcriptional landscape after PRC1 deregulation in tumorigenesis has only recently started to be assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bunker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loubière et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we show that loss of Polyhomeotic (<italic>ph</italic>), a member of the PRC1 complex, in eye-antennal imaginal discs of larvae leads to a reprogramming of cellular identity towards an embryonic state and a concomitant loss of differentiation markers. Among the reactivated genes is <italic>knirps</italic>, an orphan nuclear hormone receptor. Depletion of <italic>knirps</italic> revealed its vital role in tumor maintenance, while misexpression showed its capacity to drive tumorigenesis in otherwise wild-type tissues. Tumors initiated by <italic>ph</italic> disruption or misexpression of <italic>knirps</italic> share features such as ectopic activation of JAK/STAT signaling and a differentiation block. We conclude that the embryonic TF <italic>knirps</italic> is an oncogene in eye-antennal imaginal discs and is crucial for the tumorigenic capacity of the epigenetic tumor under study. Additionally, we found that overexpressing a pro-neural TF leads to reduction of proliferation and suppression of the tumor phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic> mitotic mutant clones were generated using the Flp/FRT system, allowing for specific tumor growth within eye-antennal imaginal discs (from here on referred to as <italic>ph<sup>505</sup>-</italic>tumor). Mutant clones were fluorescently labeled with GFP, by using the mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu and Luo, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Reduced expression of Ph in the mutant clones compared to tissues carrying FRT19A (neutral) mitotic clones was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Only a small number of larvae carrying <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumors reached adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The majority of tumors arising in these epithelial tissues display disrupted cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martinez et al., 2009</xref>), which was confirmed using the cell adhesion marker Armadillo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). Additionally, we observed ectopic expression of Matrix metalloprotease 1 (MMP1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>), which is required for matrix degradation and the invasive potential of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christofi and Apidianakis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The tumorigenic capacity of PcG mutant tissues has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Classen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martinez et al., 2009</xref>). Here we show for the first time that neoplastic growth of <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic> mutant clones in eye-antennal imaginal discs can be rescued by wild-type <italic>ph</italic> (via UAS-ph) co-expression. The resulting tissues with restored Ph levels harbored smaller clones compared to the tissues containing <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H–I</xref>). To better quantify changes of tumor volume in these tissues we developed an image analysis pipeline (see Materials and methods). This enabled us to concomitantly measure the volume of mutant clones (GFP-labeled) as well as the volume of the tissue. We found that in tissues with <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic> clones 46% of the disc was composed of tumor cells, while in the rescue experiment this ratio was reduced to only 7% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K–N</xref>). Consistent with these observations, a reduced number of larvae carrying <italic>ph<sup>505</sup>-</italic>tumors reached adulthood (eclosion rate &lt;20%). In contrast the eclosion rate of <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>, UAS-ph pupae (97%) was similar to control flies (99%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these results show that the tumorigenic phenotype of <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic> tissues is primarily due to the loss of <italic>ph</italic> since it can be rescued by the expression of the wild-type protein. We had shown previously that tumors with impaired <italic>ph</italic> do not accumulate genetic instabilities, even when cultivated for prolonged time in adult hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sievers et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, the observed neoplastic behavior can be solely restricted to the loss of the silencer <italic>ph</italic> and the ensuing deregulation of the transcriptional state described below.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>ph<sup>505</sup>-</italic>tumor cells exhibit global gene expression deregulation</title><p>To better understand the molecular consequences of <italic>polyhomeotic</italic> loss-of-function in vivo, we analyzed the transcriptome of <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumor cells by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) of dissociated eye-antennal imaginal discs to separate GFP-labeled tumor cells from surrounding unlabeled and non-mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martinez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dutta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harzer et al., 2013</xref>). This proved to be an essential step for an accurate diversification of the tumor transcriptome. Transcriptome analysis showed substantial deregulation of gene expression in mutant cells compared to neighboring non-mutant cells. We identified 1337 differentially expressed genes (Benjamini adjusted p-value, padj. &lt;0.01), with 275 genes being upregulated in <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that neurogenesis-related genes were mainly downregulated in <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumor cells, while genes regulating transcription were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since PcG target genes encode crucial developmental regulators, such as TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simon and Kingston, 2009</xref>), our expression data corroborates its impaired function. Moreover, we observed deregulation of genes involved in tissue development (e.g., GO-terms for genital disc development, imaginal disc development) and enrichment for TFs among the upregulated genes (GO-term sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). The observed global modulation of transcription output is in agreement with PcG proteins constituting a global regulatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simon and Kingston, 2009</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32697.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Gene expression analysis of <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumor cells reveals loss of cell identity and acquisition of an embryonic-TF signature.</title><p>RNA-sequencing was performed in FACS-sorted <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic> tissue samples.

As such, we decided to focus on the fraction of differentially expressed TF-encoding genes, due also to the enrichment of genes in this category in our RNA-seq dataset. We evaluated which upregulated TFs, and thus the primary response to the <italic>ph</italic> knock-out, could be contributing to the overall deregulation of gene expression observed.

To further reveal the transcriptional identity of <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumor cells, we integrated available datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Edgar et al., 2002</xref>) and compared the gene expression signature of <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumors with other tissues and/or developmental stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In total, 83 samples including different tissues and cell types (namely ovaries, larval brain, adult head, wing disc, eye-antennal disc, larval neurons and larval neuroblasts) and developmental stages (embryo, larva and pupa) were considered for the analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>). Specifically, we compared 124 differentially expressed genes involved in transcriptional regulation (GO0006355) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata4">Figure 1—source data 4</xref>). Strikingly, hierarchical clustering of 83 transcriptome samples showed that <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumor cells clustered close to samples from early embryonic developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). As expected, our RNA-seq control samples (neighboring unlabeled cells) clustered with wild-type eye-antennal imaginal disc transcriptomes. This result might reflect the re-establishment of an earlier developmental program in <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumors as a consequence of a reprogrammed epigenomic state. Additionally, this is not a general feature shared by all tumors, as depicted by other tumor types (i.e. <italic>brat</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jüschke et al., 2013</xref>] and <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup>/scrib<sup>-</sup></italic> tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atkins et al., 2016</xref>]) not clustering with embryos.</p><p>We hypothesize that the clustering of <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumor cells with early embryos was not only the result of the ectopic expression of embryonic TFs in the <italic>ph<sup>505</sup>-</italic>tumor cells, but also due to reduced expression of the TFs, which characterize differentiated tissues. Downregulation of neurogenesis-related genes suggests that these tumor cells may be unable to differentiate, losing cell fate markers and their normally established identity. We confirmed the downregulation of neurogenesis-related markers at the protein level for ELAV (Embryonic Lethal Abnormal Vision), which is normally expressed in the differentiated neuronal cells that make up the eye imaginal disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>) and for Eya (Eyes absent, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>). This supports previous findings that suggested that neoplastic <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelial cells reverse their developmental commitments and switch to primitive cell states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khan et al., 2013</xref>). In this particular report, the switch in the eye primordium was shown to be Homothorax (Hth)-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khan et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, in our RNA-seq dataset <italic>hth</italic> was downregulated and at the protein level we confirmed that Hth is not ectopically expressed in the <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–F</xref>). Thus, our study reveals that <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumors do not depend upon ectopic expression of Hth to keep cells in a non-differentiated state and support neoplastic growth.</p><p>The similarity of the <italic>ph<sup>505</sup>-</italic>tumor TF signature with <italic>Drosophila</italic> early embryos was reinforced by confirmation of the presence of embryonic-TF misexpression across tumor-tissue samples. We performed immunostaining for additional embryonic TFs, namely Even-skipped, Abdominal-B and Caudal, and observed ectopic expression of these proteins specifically in mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that <italic>ph<sup>505</sup>-</italic>tumor cells previously committed to a neurogenesis-related path switch their cell fate as they fail to differentiate during the process of tumorigenesis due to the modulation of the transcriptional regulatory program of the cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>TFs as key regulators of tumorigenesis – candidate-hit validation in vivo</title><p>In order to pinpoint key regulators of tumorigenesis in <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumors, we performed an <italic>in vivo</italic> screen for a subset of selected candidates. Among all the TFs upregulated in <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumor cells, we chose, based on literature search, 24 to assess their importance in promoting tumorigenic potential in these cells. Our approach to test the ability of candidate genes playing a key role in <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumorigenesis was to combine generation of <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumor clones with RNAi-mediated knock-down (KD) of a target of interest within these clones.

Previous approaches of generating PcG-negative transcriptomes investigated gene expression of mutant cells that were deprived from contact with non-mutant cells (using the cell lethal system), which was then compared with wild-type discs composed of neutral clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loubière et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bunker et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, we set out to compare <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic> mutant cells with their surrounding wild-type cells to gain potential additional information by taking into account non-autonomous growth effects previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feng et al., 2011</xref>). The RNA-seq dataset presented here reveals enrichment for TFs in the upregulated gene set. It also indicates that tumor cells fail to differentiate, supported by the downregulation of neural-cell fate markers characteristic of this tissue and by the upregulation of embryonic TFs. This is also highlighted by the clustering of the TF-signature of <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumors with embryonic stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. Moreover, we also found several Hox genes in our set of upregulated genes (e.g., <italic>Antp, Ubx, Abd-A, Abd-B</italic>), which are classical embryonic PcG-targets shown to be important in oncogenesis.</p><p>Although not regarded as a traditional hallmark of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000</xref>), a key event in tumorigenesis is the perturbation of normal cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonda and Ramsay, 2015</xref>). Re-expression of particular embryonic genes in an aberrant spatial-temporal pattern could contribute to oncogenesis by maintenance of a more embryonic state through the activation of anti-apoptotic pathways or suppression of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shah and Sukumar, 2010</xref>). For example, re-establishment of an earlier developmental program has been proposed in human pediatric gliomas that frequently have mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27M) and compromised PRC2 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Funato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wainwright and Scaffidi, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Since several classic TFs with important functions during embryogenesis are among the upregulated genes in the <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumor transcriptome, we subsequently blocked their expression and showed for some TFs their potential to rescue the <italic>ph</italic> knock-out phenotype and reduce tumor growth. Quantitative measurements of tumor volume in various conditions ensured the reproducibility of the data, excluding an observer bias. The observed effects of TF-KD on eclosion rate and tumor volume did not necessarily correlate with the genes that are direct targets of Ph silencing in eye discs. This is illustrated for example by the strong effects of bgcn-KD that has not been identified as a direct Ph target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loubière et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>These observations on TFs are particularly important since transcription has a direct influence on the balance between proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, when transcriptional regulators (TFs, co-regulators or epigenetic modifiers) are misregulated, differentiation is blocked and pre-cancer cells can proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonda and Ramsay, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>An embryonic nuclear hormone receptor as new oncogene</title><p><italic>kni</italic> is a gap gene involved in the subdivision of the embryo anterior-posterior axis that can function as an activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Langeland et al., 1994</xref>) or a repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pankratz et al., 1990</xref>). Besides its classic function in embryonic development, <italic>kni</italic> is subsequently also required for vein formation in wing imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lunde et al., 2003</xref>). We show that KD of <italic>knirps</italic> in <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumors is sufficient to reduce tumor volume by 90%. It also reduces the tumorigenic capacity of <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumors, as assessed by a transplantation assay. Misexpression of TFs in imaginal discs and formation of cysts has been suggested to be an indicator of precancerous lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bielmeier et al., 2016</xref>). Here we show that ectopic expression of <italic>knirps</italic> in eye-antennal imaginal discs leads to the formation of cysts and is sufficient to recapitulate the phenotypic tumor appearance. Moreover, we believe that this TF, with its dual regulatory role, could activate or repress other genes and thus form a regulatory circuit that is beneficial for tumor initiation and progression.</p><p>Inducing a cell fate switch can be achieved by forcing expression of a TF that can activate the transcriptional network of the resulting cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamada et al., 2014</xref>). We show that impairment of a global silencing regulator leads to reversion of neurogenesis-lineage committed cells to a less differentiated cell state, but also that this can be achieved by single ectopic expression of <italic>kni</italic>. This raises the possibility that embryonic TFs such as <italic>kni</italic> drive the establishment of a regulatory circuit that blocks differentiation. Although the involved factors of such mechanisms remain to be identified, we consider the identification of <italic>kni</italic> as a strong oncogene a valuable starting point for future studies.</p><p>The identification of a tumorigenic role of the embryonic TF Kni in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, is in line with the identification of other embryonic TFs playing a role in several different tumor models. For instance, aberrant expression of the embryonic TF Oct-4 blocks progenitor-cell differentiation and causes dysplasia in mouse adult epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hochedlinger et al., 2005</xref>). In humans, activation of the TF TAL1, normally expressed early in the erythroid lineage, has been shown to alter a core transcriptional regulatory circuit that in turn leads to tumor onset (T cell leukemia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bradner et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, other relevant embryonic TFs, such as FOXF1, normally expressed in mesenchyme-derived cells, activate MAPK signaling when expressed in prostate epithelial cells and contribute to tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fulford et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our data show that <italic>knirps</italic> can drive tumor onset and is a strong oncogene in <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumors. Moreover, our work is consistent with a growing understanding between the connections of developmental gene expression and cancer. We hope that in the long-term these findings can contribute to the development of new therapies for cancers driven by misexpression of TFs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Inability to differentiate as target for therapy in embryonic-like tumors</title><p>Loss of differentiation capabilities, as well as the emergence of a progenitor-like state that promotes cellular transformation and tumor initiation are common processes observed in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roy and Hebrok, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bossuyt et al., 2009</xref>). The concept of dedifferentiation preceding tumorigenesis has been shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons, where neurons lacking the TF Lola dedifferentiate, turning on neural stem cell genes, begin to divide, and form tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Southall et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We provide evidence that kni-ectopic tumors, very similar to <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumors, also fail to undergo differentiation. Besides commonalities such as loss of polarity and loss of cell identity, these two tumor models also share the ectopic activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Developmental studies suggest the cooperation between JAK/STAT and gap genes (e.g. <italic>knirps</italic>) in regulating expression of pair-rule genes for segmentation during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hou et al., 2002</xref>). Hyperactivation of the JAK/STAT pathway has been observed in different human cancers, where it activates survival and proliferation genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buchert et al., 2016</xref>). Also, cells can be maintained in a less differentiated and more proliferative state by JAK/STAT pathway activation, as highlighted by its activation in stem cell niches in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amoyel and Bach, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christofi and Apidianakis, 2013</xref>) and in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hao et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that this pathway must be switched off to allow differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amoyel and Bach, 2012</xref>). In agreement with this, blocking JAK/STAT activity suppresses the PRC1 mutant tumor phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Classen et al., 2009</xref>) and in our hands induces the re-establishment of the differentiation program characteristic of eye-antennal imaginal discs.</p><p>However, using the blockage of signaling pathways as a therapeutic target has been shown to be difficult due to the redundancy of the signaling networks and thus acquired drug resistance is common in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonda and Ramsay, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buchert et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, forced differentiation by means of TF activation might solve this issue. We used <italic>atonal</italic>, a pro-neural TF in eye discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bossuyt et al., 2009</xref>) and downregulated in <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic>-tumors, to ultimately restore differentiation in eye-antennal tissues. This approach proved to be sufficient to prevent tumor cells from proliferating, reduce tumor burden and recover the normal pattern of differentiation.</p><p>The significance of these observations, referred to as ‘differentiation therapy’, is supported by work done in acute myeloid leukemia where therapies to overcome the cellular differentiation arrest have led to favorable outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gocek and Marcinkowska, 2011</xref>). Moreover this strategy has also been suggested to restrict the cellular plasticity of cancer stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wainwright and Scaffidi, 2017</xref>). Our findings highlight the importance of embryonic transcription factors in oncogenesis and favor the potential of re-establishing differentiation as an attractive alternative in future considerations for cancer therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="bottom">Designation</th><th valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">genetic reagent (D. melanogaster)</td><td valign="bottom">OregonR (host flies)</td><td valign="bottom">Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center</td><td valign="bottom">BL25211</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">genetic reagent (D. melanogaster)</td><td valign="bottom">w[1118] (host flies)</td><td valign="bottom">Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center</td><td valign="bottom">BL5905</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">genetic reagent (D. melanogaster)</td><td valign="bottom">yw, FRT19A</td><td valign="bottom">Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center</td><td valign="bottom">BL1744</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">genetic reagent (D. melanogaster)</td><td valign="bottom">FRT19A, ph505/FM7 act-GFP</td><td valign="bottom">A.-M.

Each biological replicate for FACS was composed of a total of 200–250 eye-antennal imaginal discs of third instar larvae dissected in PBS 1x. After spinning down and removing PBS 1x, imaginal discs were placed in low-binding 1.5 mL tube with 200 uL of saline solution containing collagenase (25 discs/tube) (collagenase SIGMA, C1639 - 1.5 mg/mL diluted in Rinaldini’s saline solution) and incubated at RT for 45 min, 300rpms. Tubes were agitated every 15 min and mechanical digestion was performed twice during collagenase incubation (pipetting up-and-down with 27G syringe). After digestion, tubes were pooled in a total of 2 1.5 mL tubes and centrifuged for 25 min, 300 g, 4°C. Supernatant was removed and pellet was resuspended in PBS 1x. Solution was filtered and shortly kept on ice before proceeding for FACS. Several rounds of FACS-sorting were performed from pools of <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic> eye-antennal discs, using a BD FACS Aria cell sorter (BD Biosciences) of the FMI FACS facility (FMI, Basel) and data was collected on the basis of FSC/SSC parameters. Sorting time was kept below 45 min to insure the maximum viability of the cells. Two populations of cells were collected separately, GFP<sup>+</sup>- (mutant cells) and GFP<sup>-</sup>-sorted cells (control), directly into extraction buffer (200 µL, PicoPure RNA isolation kit, Thermo Fisher, KIT0204). RNA extraction was performed accordingly to manufacturers instructions, including a step of DNase treatment (Qiagen, catalog #79254). Samples were eluted in the final volume of 11 µL and kept at −80°C. RNA concentration (RiboGreen, ThermoFisher, #R11490) and integrity (Fragment analyzer, AATI) of sorted samples was assessed by the Genomics Facility Basel (D-BSSE, Basel). From the several rounds of samples’ preparation, we choose 4 pairs of samples (tumor and matched-control) and three extra tumor samples from batches where control cells did not have the desired quality, to prepare libraries for sequencing. Due to the low amount of RNA in these samples, libraries were prepared by the Genomics Facility Basel using a method conceived for single cell RNA-seq (Smart-seq2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Picelli et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA-sequencing – Differential expression analysis</title><p>The following steps were performed on 22 libraries. There were two technical replicates <italic>per</italic> sample corresponding to a total of 11 samples (seven tumor, four control).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Georg Halder (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors introduce a tumor in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs via loss of the epigenetic regulator polyhomeotic. They provide data to suggest that the acquisition of a tumor fate is due to a reprogramming event toward an earlier developmental stage. They further identify knirps as a key regulator of this new transcriptional program, providing the first evidence that Knirps can function as an oncogene. This interesting and well written paper contributes to an emerging theme in tumor development that tumors represent a distinct, but abnormal cell fate and that tumors have their own developmental networks. Torres, et al. utilize a tumor that is independent of Ras activation and find that the polyhomeotic tumors activate a different kind of program from that of previously characterized Ras driven tumors, bringing novelty to the field. Despite the strong difference in gene expression and network architecture, the authors observe similar roles for JNK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways in promoting many of the tumor phenotypes as has been noted for other tumors. Technically, the authors do a nice job of combining genetic and transcriptomic data. They also are successful with FACS and tumor transplant analyses, which are technically challenging in this system. However there were several points that all reviewers agreed must be addressed before this manuscript is acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors posit that <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic> cells may undergo dedifferentiation. This would be an interesting finding, but it would require first showing that the clones differentiate at an earlier developmental time point, then lose that cell fate. If the authors truly believe that dedifferentiation occurs they should show data which supports this conclusion. As the <italic>ph</italic> clones are induced in first instar, and transcriptomics supports that they have an embryo-like fate, it may be that the clones simply fail to undergo differentiation. The authors must show data to support this claim, or re-word the manuscript. For example, what is the transcriptome of a first instar discs?</p><p>2) The control of the RNA-seq are the GFP-negative cells from FACS sorting. What about differential expression compared to wild type EA discs?</p><p>3) Among the 75 samples used to compare, why was Ras/Scrib not included? That is typically used and for this tumour plenty of microarray and RNA-seq data are available.</p><p>4) How general are their findings? Do <italic>ph</italic> clones give rise to tumors in other tissues as well? The authors should test the effects of <italic>ph</italic> clones in other tissues, and address autonomy of <italic>ph</italic> clones effects.</p><p>5) Autonomous vs. non-autonomous effects should be addressed: ELAV that marks photoreceptors (PR) is used as a differentiation marker. <italic>ph</italic> clones lose ELAV and it is re-established when <italic>kni</italic>, the embryonic TF, is knocked down or Ato, required for PR differentiation, is expressed in these cells. What is puzzling is that adult eyes from discs with <italic>ph</italic> tumors display normal looking PRs in higher numbers. If <italic>ph</italic> mutant cells themselves are ELAV negative, then the surrounding wild-type cells must be forming these excessive PRs. As the authors cite (Feng et al., 2011), there is a non-autonomous component to the <italic>ph</italic> phenotype, which was proposed to be caused by JAK/STAT induction in neighbouring cells. So, are the tumors formed by the <italic>ph</italic> cells or their wt neighbours? This is a very important point as it changes the way the RNA-seq data would be interpreted. The authors state in the Discussion that the differential expression analysis was done comparing GFP (+) and (-) cells in discs with <italic>ph</italic> mutants. I think, comparing GFP (+) cells from discs with <italic>ph</italic> mutants to GFP (+) cells from discs with wt clones would be important as well, the same goes for GFP (-) cells.</p><p>6) Is Knirps a key regulator of the downregulated genes? The authors speculate on this point, but should include the analysis of the downregulated genes in iRegulon as this would reveal if Knirps is implicated as a key regulator in both sets.</p><p>7) Ato overexpressing clones in normal tissue appear to be small. The ELAV pattern in these discs is also somewhat disrupted. While overexpression of Ato clearly prevents tumor overgrowth in this model, it is unclear if this is due to actually inducing differentiation or if Ato overexpression simply prevents cells from proliferating. The authors should clarify this point, which may require EdU or pH3 stainings to address the proliferation, along with quantifications of normal relative to tumor clones sizes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32697.052</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors posit that <italic>ph<sup>505</sup></italic> cells may undergo dedifferentiation.

Indeed, the term ‘dedifferentiation’ was used to refer to a developmental reversion or cellular reprogramming event, such as eye-antennal imaginal disc to embryo-like identity. Ph-tumors do not express neuronal markers and express embryonic TFs, suggestive of a switch of cell fate, potentially through a dedifferentiation step. Dedifferentiation is a common event observed in cancer development (Southall et al., 2014). However, we agree that if the term dedifferentiation is used in the context of eye-antennal disc development (as pointed out by the reviewers), only tumors arising from differentiated cells (late third instar) would in principle be able to go through dedifferentiation, as first instar larvae discs are composed of undifferentiated cells.</p><p>In the system we used, MARCM-GFP clones are induced from an earlier stage of eye-antennal disc development. We confirmed this again ourselves by checking GFP-signals in late first-instar discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Technically, the dissection of first-instar imaginal discs is very challenging. We succeeded to isolate imaginal discs attached to brain tissue for imaging, but we do not have the technical capabilities required for dissection of first-instar discs that are intact and in a considerable amount required for transcriptomic analysis (several hundreds). We also could not find published gene expression datasets from first-instar EA discs (to our knowledge, these are not publicly available).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32697.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Eye-antennal imaginal discs from different developmental stages carrying <italic>ph</italic><sup><italic>505</italic></sup>-clones (<bold>A</bold>-<bold>C</bold>).</title><p>Mutant cells are GFP labeled and present in late first instar EA discs (<bold>A</bold>).

Our goal was to ask whether a differentiated cell, once mutated and tumorigenic, would return to a less differentiated state. To this end, we attempted to generate mutant clones at a later stage of eye-antennal imaginal development, when differentiation cues are already established, so that we could assess whether these late mutant cells would still lack differentiation markers.</p><p>First, we defined a time-point when the wave of differentiation has started and cells received signals to differentiation. This wave of differentiation follows the morphogenetic furrow (MF) and progresses in a posterior-to-anterior direction. In our hands, and as previously reported (Chanut and Heberlein, 1995), at early third instar (96h AEL) this differentiation wave has started. We could confirm this by the obvious presence of the MF (marked with white arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>) and the ELAV positive staining of the posterior cells located further away from MF. However, there is some variation of the number of cells that express ELAV between different larvae, as you can appreciate between left and central pictures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Additionally, using a later time point when there is less variability and more cells express ELAV (120h AEL) might not be ideal since discs would need to be dissected a day later, which would not allow sufficient time to robustly generate tumor clones.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32697.027</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Expression of ELAV (magenta) in developing eye-antennal imaginal discs (EA), 96h and 120h after egg laying (AEL).</title><p>White arrows, morphogenetic furrow.

In particular, we checked the ELAV expression in clones that are located in the most posterior region of the disc, making sure that these clones are generated after the MF was already anterior to them.</p><p>Our results showed that some clones generated in the posterior region of the disc (at 96h AEL) do not express ELAV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>), suggestive of a dedifferentiation event in <italic>ph</italic><sup><italic>505</italic></sup>-tumor clones. However, it is difficult to find clones in this region and in addition be entirely certain that this is indeed due to the tumor development and not simply a result of a developmental delay when clones were generated. Since we have generally used the eyFlp/MARCM system, we cannot completely exclude a potential effect of a developmental delay; hence, we tend to agree with the reviewers that one needs to be cautious in using the term dedifferentiation. In light of these considerations, and even though we observed some cases supporting our initial claim, we decided to re-word the manuscript to reflect a more accurate description of the condition (e.g. ‘failure to differentiate’).</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32697.028</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Expression of ELAV in mitotic clones generated 96h AEL.</title><p>Heat shock (HS) experiments were performed at 96h AEL (90min, 37ºC).

What about differential expression compared to wild type EA discs?</p></disp-quote><p>This project was designed with the aim of defining the transcriptional signature of <italic>ph</italic><sup><italic>505</italic></sup> tumors by comparing mutant cells with adjacent non-mutant cells. From the initial design, we found it important to define a tumor-signature that would be targetable by genetic tools specifically inside the mutant-clones. These considerations led us to selectively isolate GFP-positive (tumor cells) and GFP-negative cells which had undergone the exact same experimental procedure (including FACS sorting). One of the main benefits of this approach was that it allowed us to identify a mutant-specific signature and not a tumor tissue signature (mix of mutant and non-mutant cells), while minimizing artifacts generated by alternative experimental conditions. We believe this actually brings an advantage to the field regarding other published approaches using bulk material. The expression profiles of these GFP-negative cells also resembled the profiles of other published EA transcriptomes, which is also apparent from the clustering analysis based on TF expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> in the manuscript).</p><p>Nevertheless, in order to address the question posed by the reviewer, we performed differential expression analysis comparing our tumor transcriptomes against several available datasets of wild-type EA discs (which had already been included in our clustering analysis). The conclusions one can draw from such an approach are limited, as differences in gene expression levels through this analysis can arise due to batch-effects. Because of batch effects and the higher number of samples, we expected to find a higher number of differentially expressed genes, which was indeed the case. The total number of differentially expressed (DE) genes increased over 4-fold (padj&lt;=0.01) when comparing GFP+/tumor with wild-type EA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4A</xref>). However, the general tendencies were conserved in both analyses; e.g. a higher number of genes is downregulated (DOWN vs. EA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4B</xref>) compared to up-regulated. Also, log2-fold-changes were correlated (r=0.624) between the two approaches.</p><fig id="respfig4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32697.029</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Differential Expression analysis – comparison of <italic>ph</italic><sup><italic>505</italic></sup>-tumor cells (GFP+) with wildtype EA discs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Venn diagram showing the overlap (1088 DE genes) between the previous analysis (DE vs. GFP-) and the new analysis (DE vs. EA).

What is puzzling is that adult eyes from discs with ph tumors display normal looking PRs in higher numbers. If ph mutant cells themselves are ELAV negative, then the surrounding wild-type cells must be forming these excessive PRs. As the authors cite (Feng et al., 2011), there is a non-autonomous component to the ph phenotype, which was proposed to be caused by JAK/STAT induction in neighbouring cells. So, are the tumors formed by the ph cells or their wt neighbours? This is a very important point as it changes the way the RNA-seq data would be interpreted. The authors state in the Discussion that the differential expression analysis was done comparing GFP (+) and (-) cells in discs with ph mutants. I think, comparing GFP (+) cells from discs with ph mutants to GFP (+) cells from discs with wt clones would be important as well, the same goes for GFP (-) cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The point that the reviewers raise is very valid, and we tried to tackle this aspect in several ways. First, we performed a quantitative analysis in order to assess the volume taken by ELAV+ (differentiated) cells in the eye disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig7">Author response image 7</xref>), and indeed we observed that there are more PR precursor cells in discs carrying tumors (shown in the blue bar plots on the left). As <italic>ph</italic><sup><italic>505</italic></sup>-cells are mostly negative for ELAV, we focused on the surrounding non-mutant cells (GFP-) that might be responsible for formation of excessive number of normal looking PRs. We confirmed that the difference observed was attributed to the surrounding cells (purple bar plots on the right), in agreement with the reviewers’ point.</p><p>However, if these non-mutant cells were tumorigenic, one would expect that upon transplantation they would also contribute to the tumor mass, which we never observed, however. Hence, this strengthens our position that tumorigenic cells are GFP+ <italic>ph</italic> mutant cells, while the surrounding tissue is not (even if it may overgrow due to non-autonomous effects, as previously shown (Feng et al., 2011)).</p><fig id="respfig7"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32697.032</object-id><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>Quantitative analysis of tissue volume occupied by ELAV+ cells.</title><p>Number of tissues used for quantification analysis (using Imaris): FRT19A N=12; <italic>ph</italic><sup><italic>505</italic></sup> N=19).

It becomes difficult to disentangle this issue, as one cannot be certain about which larvae survive to adulthood (e.g. the surviving 20% could actually be among the ones that were composed of smaller tissues and smaller tumor clones). Nevertheless, we still tried to address this point in an unbiased and quantitative manner (see above), leading us to conclude that the overgrowth phenotype observed in the eclosing adults is likely due to compensatory mechanisms during the development of eye-antennal disc with formation of tumor clones.</p><p>Furthermore, observations made with the cell-lethal system in EA discs (Classen et al., 2009) showed that even in the absence of non-mutant surrounding cells, the tissue still overgrows. Thus, the overgrowth phenotype is not exclusively due to wt cells, but they do contribute and support this phenotype (see also our response to point 4).</p><p>Taken together, these observations indicate to us that it is important to distinguish between tumorigenic (mutant) and overgrowth phenotypes. Based on previous reasoning, we consider that further comparison of GFP+ and GFP- transcriptomes from wild-type tissues could be of interest to distinguish these two populations, but this approach would be technically challenging (wild-type tissues are 4-times smaller, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and would diverge from the focus of our work.</p><p>It was very challenging to set up the workflow for sample preparation for RNA-seq from <italic>ph</italic><sup><italic>505</italic></sup>-tissues. We believe that the suggested experiment would require an even higher number of tissues (perhaps over 1000 discs), and their dissection would also need to be done in less than an hour to avoid cell death, making it impossible for us to achieve at this point.</p><p>In sum, the design of this study was targeted at comparing mutant cells with adjacent cells (non-mutant) within the same tissue. It is possible that adjacent cells contribute to compensatory growth (Uhlirova et al., 2005). One of the strong points from our work is the extended in vivo validation presented in the manuscript. This serves as good evidence that our strategy has been successful in identifying key regulators in mutant cells, and with a functional validation through KD which led to considerable effects in the tumorigenic capacity and overall tissue overgrowth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Is Knirps a key regulator of the downregulated genes?

Indeed, Knirps, among others, was enriched as a regulator of targets that are DE in our dataset.

We have now extended the iRegulon analysis, partitioned into downregulated genes as input. The output revealed that Knirps is indeed among the possible regulators of these genes, in agreement with its repressive function. Conversely, when we provide the list of upregulated genes as input, Knirps ectopic expression does not seem to be directly contributing (at least from motif enrichment analysis), which is expected given its main role as a repressor.
