TrAP elicits developmental anomalies phenocopying several TGS mutants, reduces the repressive H3K9me2 mark and CHH DNA methylation, and reactivates numerous endogenous KYP-repressed loci in vivo. Moreover, KYP binds to the viral chromatin and controls its methylation to combat virus infection. Notably, <italic>kyp</italic> mutants support systemic infection of TrAP-deficient Geminivirus. We conclude that TrAP attenuates the TGS of the viral chromatin by inhibiting KYP activity to evade host surveillance.

The Geminiviruses are a family of plant viruses that are transmitted by insects and infect tomato, cabbage, and many other crop plants. These viruses hijack the plant cells that they infect and force the plant cells to make viral proteins using instructions provided by the genes in the virus' own DNA. To make proteins, DNA is first copied into molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid (or mRNA) in a process called transcription. However, plants can defend themselves by blocking the transcription of viral DNA through ‘transcriptional gene silencing’.</p><p>In plant cells, DNA is packaged around proteins called histones to form a structure called chromatin. Small chemical tags attached to the histones can alter the structure of chromatin to regulate the activity of the genes encoded within it. For example, ‘methyl’ tags added to certain histones can block transcription and lower the activity of a gene. DNA from viruses can also associate with histones inside plant cells meaning that transcriptional gene silencing can take place by the addition of these methyl tags. Many Geminiviruses produce a protein called TrAP, which can activate transcription, but it is not clear how this works.</p><p>Castillo-González et al. studied the TrAP proteins from two different Geminiviruses that can infect crop plants. The commonly used model plant, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, was genetically engineered to produce high levels of these TrAP proteins. These ‘transgenic’ plants did not develop properly: they grew more slowly, had abnormal leaves, and flowered earlier. Furthermore, hundreds of plant genes were more active than usual in the transgenic plants, which suggests that TrAP inhibits transcriptional gene silencing. Further experiments showed that TrAP directly binds to a plant enzyme called KYP—which normally deposits methyl groups on chromatin and prevents it from working. This reduces the number of methyl groups that are attached to histones associated with both viral and plant chromatin, which results in the activation of genes that would normally be switched off.</p><p>Castillo-González et al.'s findings show how Geminiviruses can stop transcriptional gene silencing of chromatin that contains virus DNA to evade the host plant's defenses. The next challenge is to understand how TrAP inhibits KYP, which may present new ways to genetically engineer plants to become resistant to infection by viruses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06671.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06671.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>epigenetic silencing</kwd><kwd>viral suppression</kwd><kwd>geminivirus</kwd><kwd>histone methyltransferase</kwd><kwd>TrAP/AL2/AC2</kwd><kwd>host–virus interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 AI097570</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xiuren</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A-1777</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xiuren</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1253369</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xiuren</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A viral protein hijacks the key effector of transcriptional gene silencing, Su(var)3-9, to evade host plant surveillance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA silencing is a host defense mechanism to combat invading nucleic acids. One type of RNA silencing is referred to as post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). In PTGS, double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are processed by Dicer-like ribonucleases into small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Mature siRNAs are incorporated into an Argonaute (AGO)-centered RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to regulate expression of target genes through RNA cleavage or translational repression. PTGS has evolved as a universal defense response toward all viruses because dsRNAs can result from intermediates in RNA virus replication, highly structured RNA virus genomes, or from viral transcripts. To evade this surveillance mechanism, virtually all plant viruses are known to encode suppressor proteins that are able to block different key steps of the PTGS pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding and Voinnet, 2007</xref>).</p><p>While the host/virus battle at the PTGS level has been well appreciated, virus suppression at a transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) level is poorly understood. In eukaryotes, the nuclear DNA is wrapped onto histone octamers to constitute chromatin. The chromatin undergoes various DNA and histone methylations, and these modifications have variable effects on gene expression depending on the precise residues, contexts, and modification complexity. Histone methylation takes place on lysine and arginine residues of the amino-terminal tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greer and Shi, 2012</xref>). The prevailing dogma is that histone 3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) is mostly associated with transcriptionally active euchromatin, while H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 are repressive marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deal and Henikoff, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng and Jacobsen, 2011</xref>). Histone methylation is catalyzed by SET domain containing methyltransferases, specifically, H3K9me2 is deposited by <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Su(var)3-9 homolog 4, Kryptonite (KYP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2014a</xref>), and its paralogs (SUVH5,6), while H3K27 methylation is carried out by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)<italic>,</italic> which includes Curly Leaf (CLF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng and Chen, 2011</xref>). Local H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 can spread over wide regions to elicit heterochromatin configuration. In animals, the propagation of histone methylation entails co-repressor heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), whereas in plants, KYP acts synergistically with DNA methyltransferases (i.e., Chromomethylase 3 [CMT3]) to constitute a mutually reinforcing cycle of DNA and histone methylation to secure TGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2014a</xref>).</p><p>Histone methylation not only regulates endogenous gene expression but also invasive DNAs such as transposons and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Narasipura et al., 2014</xref>). Plant DNA viruses, exemplified by Geminivirus, form minichromosomes in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanley-Bowdoin et al., 2013</xref>). Both Geminivirus DNA and associated histones are methylated in infected cells, whereas viral methylation is reduced in methylation-deficient hosts, methylation-compromised <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants are hypersusceptiple to Geminivirus infection and show exacerbated disease symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raja et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, plants appear to employ methylation of viral chromatin to limit viral replication and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aregger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pumplin and Voinnet, 2013</xref>). On the other hand, Geminiviruses encode a multi-functional protein called transcriptional activation protein (TrAP/AL2/AC2) that counters the epigenetic defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchmann et al., 2009</xref>). It has been shown that TrAP inhibits adenosine kinase (ADK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). ADK catalyzes the synthesis of 5′ AMP from adenosine and ATP, a process that promotes the regeneration of S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), the major methyl donor in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moffatt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchmann et al., 2009</xref>). Consequently, the TrAP-mediated inhibition of ADK activity likely impedes downstream trans-methylation events, including viral chromatin methylation in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bisaro, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchmann et al., 2009</xref>). In parallel, some Geminivirus encode a TrAP positional homolog, named C2, that is able to stabilize SAM decarboxylase 1 to downregulate the methyl group metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). It seems that interfering with the methyl cycle is a common suppression mechanism for Geminivirus-encoded TrAP/AL2/C2 proteins. In addition, C2 also subverts the activity of COP9 signalosome to inhibit jasmonate signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lozano-Durán et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting its multiple functions in viral counter-defense.</p><p>Here, we investigated the suppression mechanism of TrAP proteins, encoded by two Geminivirus members, <italic>Tomato Golden Mosaic Virus</italic> (TGMV) and <italic>Cabbage Leaf Curl Virus</italic> (CaLCuV). We found that constitutive expression of TGMV-<italic>TrAP</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> caused morphological abnormalities that mimic loss-of-function mutants of numerous TGS components including <italic>lhp1</italic> (<italic>like-heterochromatin1</italic>) and <italic>clf</italic>. Microarray analyses of <italic>TrAP</italic> transgenic plants and <italic>lhp1</italic> mutants revealed a substantial overlap in reprogrammed host genes at a genome-wide level. Through biochemical screening, we identified KYP as the bona fide target of TrAP. We demonstrated in vitro that TrAP binds to the catalytic domain of KYP and inhibits its enzymatic activity; while in vivo, <italic>TrAP</italic> decreases the repressive H3K9me2 marks and H3K9me2-dependent CHH methylation in gene-rich regions. We also found that KYP directly associates with the Geminivirus minichromosome and deposits H3K9me2 marks on viral chromatin. In addition, <italic>kyp</italic> mutants but not wild-type plants sustain low systemic infection of CaLCuV lacking TrAP protein. Taken together, we propose that KYP-catalyzed H3K9me2 is a line of the innate immunity against invading DNA pathogens, and Geminivirus TrAP functions to inactivate KYP to counter host defense. Thus, this study provides new insight into the host–virus interaction at the TGS level.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TGMV-encoded TrAP causes developmental abnormalities in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> but not through miRNA pathway</title><p>To study the suppression mechanism of TrAP, we generated 235 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transgenic lines overexpressing full-length TGMV TrAP, with or without Flag-Myc4, 3HA, or CFP epitopes.

Of these, 295 transcripts were elevated whereas 291 were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We performed real-time PCR and RNA blot assays to validate the microarray results for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

Transcriptome analysis revealed that out of 295 genes significantly upregulated in the <italic>35S-TrAP</italic> transgenic lines, 120 (40.7%) were also upregulated in <italic>lhp1</italic> mutant. This is significantly greater than 1.28% expected by chance (p &lt; 2.2e<sup>−16</sup>, Pearson's Chi-squared test). Interestingly, among the co-upregulated genes are a group of flowering-stimulated transcriptional factors including the key flowering-time integrator, <italic>FT,</italic> and 12 other genes such as <italic>TFL1</italic>, <italic>AGL5</italic>, and <italic>AGL9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farrona et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 8</xref>) clustered in the transcriptional regulation category. Importantly, all these genes are regulated through epigenetic pathways and account for the early flowering phenotypes of <italic>lhp1</italic> mutant and possibly of <italic>TrAP</italic> transgenic plants as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gan et al., 2013</xref>). Other highly represented categories included 31 genes involved in aging and 116 genes engaged in stress responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Notably, the stress-responsive genes included genes specific to biotic stress such as <italic>PR4</italic>, <italic>WRKY18</italic>, <italic>FLS2</italic>, and <italic>PDF1.2</italic>; additionally, genes related to chemical stress, such as <italic>PTR3</italic> and <italic>TAT3</italic>, were also identified. Thus, constitutive expression of <italic>TrAP</italic> could trigger plant senescence and innate defense pathways, and this activation is potentially through interference with the <italic>LHP1</italic>-related epigenetic silencing.</p><p>Similarly, out of 291 genes significantly downregulated in the <italic>35S-TrAP</italic> transgenic lines, 137 (47.1%) were also repressed in <italic>lhp1</italic> mutant. This is significantly greater than 1.25% expected by chance (p &lt; 2.2e<sup>−16</sup>, Pearson's Chi-squared test) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Genes related to auxin response were of special interest. Of the 32 DEGs involved in the auxin pathway, 29 genes were downregulated in the <italic>35S-TrAP</italic> transgenic plants, classified as small auxin upregulated mRNAs (<italic>SAUR</italic>s). These results suggested a possible hyposensitivity to auxin in <italic>lhp1</italic> mutants and <italic>TrAP</italic> transgenic plants, which could explain the smaller statues of both genotypes. Consistent with this hypothesis, numerous auxin-repressed loci including <italic>PS2</italic> and aging genes like <italic>TET9</italic>, <italic>SAG13</italic>, and <italic>SRG1</italic> were upregulated in both lines. Concomitantly, six genes related to cell growth and five genes engaged in cell wall loosening were also repressed. Significant genome-wide overlap of <italic>35S-TrAP</italic> and <italic>lhp1</italic> loss-of-function-responsive genes suggested that <italic>TrAP</italic> might be genetically involved in the <italic>LHP1</italic>-related TGS pathway.</p><p>Since LHP1 is believed to reside in euchromatic regions, we wondered whether <italic>TrAP</italic> also deregulates expression of heterochromatic loci. To this end, we selected numerous transposable elements (TEs) that were not recovered from the microarray assays and assessed them directly by qRT-PCR. Excitingly, most of the tested transposons were transcriptionally active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), further suggesting that <italic>TrAP</italic> indeed inhibits the TGS pathway, in both euchromatic and heterochromatic regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>KYP is a bona fide target of TrAP</title><p>Given that <italic>TrAP</italic> transgenic plants phenocopied several TGS mutants and displayed transcriptional activation of heterochromatic loci, we hypothesized that TrAP epistatically regulates a TGS integrator (s), indirectly leading to deregulation of the epigenetic marks. Analysis of the microarray data challenged this possibility as no significant changes in the transcripts of any canonical TGS components were revealed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). An alternative hypothesis was that TrAP directly interferes with the function of a TGS component (s). To test this in an unbiased manner, we used luciferase complementation imaging (LCI) assay to screen 34 TGS-related proteins and some other cellular factors for TrAP interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). In the LCI experiments, the N- and C-terminal parts of firefly luciferase (NLuc and CLuc) are fused to different test proteins to be transiently expressed in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> (<italic>N. benthamiana</italic>). When NLuc and CLuc are brought together through interaction of the test proteins, catalytic activity is restored and recorded through CCD camera. In our LCI screening, we recovered LHP1 and KYP, a SUVH-type H3K9me2 methyltransferase, suggesting that TrAP is physically close to LHP1 and/or KYP proteins in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Next, we carried out confocal microscopy imaging assays. TrAP co-localized with both LHP1 and KYP in scattered but not yet clearly defined nuclear foci, whereas co-expression of TrAP-CFP and other YFP-tagged proteins in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> cells did not show such patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These observations further suggested that TrAP was in the same complexes as LHP1 or KYP. To further examine if TrAP interacted with these proteins, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, we validated the TrAP-KYP interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) but not TrAP-LHP1 (data not shown), indicating that the LCI signal resulting from the TrAP-LHP1 combination likely involved additional cofactors between TrAP and LHP1 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Alternatively, TrAP-LHP1 interaction might be transient or unstable in our stringent co-IP condition. We observed that expression of CLuc-HA3-KYP in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> yielded truncated proteins of various lengths that accumulated to comparable levels as the full-length protein; only the full-length KYP showed specific interaction with TrAP, implying the KYP C-terminal domain as the interaction interface with TrAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We further confirmed the in vivo TrAP-KYP interaction by Förster resonance energy transfer-acceptor bleaching (FRET-AB), using TrAP-CFP as a donor and YFP-KYP as an acceptor. Shortly, FRET involves the energy transfer from an excited donor to an adjacent acceptor when the fluorophores are less than 10 nm apart. If the fluorophores are coupled, the excited donor leads to acceptor emission; bleaching the acceptor allows the emission of the donor to be measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Consecutive cycles of YFP-KYP bleach/recovery correlated with release/quench on the TrAP-CFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>); the positive FRET-AB (CaLCuV-TrAP 2.699 ± 0.23, TGMV-TrAP 3.8228 ± 0.58, p &lt; 0.05) corroborated TrAP-CFP/YFP-KYP interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). To examine whether TrAP interacted with KYP under physiological conditions, we isolated TrAP complexes through two-step immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>) from stable transgenic plants expressing <italic>Flag-Myc4-TrAP</italic> under the inducible promoter (<italic>XVE</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zuo et al., 2000</xref>) followed by mass spectrometry analysis. A total of 624 peptides representing 288 unique sequences were recovered from the TrAP sample; of those, 31 unique peptides matched specifically to KYP/SUVH4 and were not found in control immunoprecipitates using Col-0 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This interaction was specific as MBP-KYP was unable to pull down GST protein alone. Notably, we did not observe direct LHP1-TrAP interaction in the parallel pull-down experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>); and this result was consistent with the in vivo Co-IP experiments. From N- to C- termini, KYP contains SRA, PreSET, SET, and PostSET domains. To further define the protein domain (s) responsible for the specific interaction, we generated five truncations of KYP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Pull-down assays showed that the SET domain interacted with TrAP proteins from both TGMV and CaLCuV at a higher affinity, whereas SRA domain might interact with CaLCuV TrAP at a reduced affinity in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). These results were consistent with the results of the in vivo Co-IP experiments in which only full-length KYP, but not C-terminal-truncated versions, could recover TrAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Excitingly, KYP was found at all tested loci in the viral chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). Notably, regions delineated by the primer #7 showed KYP-independent H3K9me2 marks but were still immunoprecipitated in the KYP-chromatin complex. A possible explanation is incomplete chromatin shearing of the small viral mini-chromosome under the conditions used in this experiment, which were standardized for host chromatin ChIP. Alternatively, this might suggest the presence of additional epigenetic regulation that masks KYP activity on this locus. This notwithstanding, our results indicate that KYP directly deposits the H3K9me2 mark on the Geminivirus minichromosome to reinforce the silent status of the virus.</p><p>Since constitutive expression of <italic>TrAP</italic> reduced H3K9me2 in vivo, we wondered if Geminivirus infection could also decrease the repressive marks in the host. To this end, we tested the KYP-controlled endogenous transposons for H3K9me2 accumulation. CaLCuV-infected plants showed 60–100% H3K9me2 loss in the tested loci compared to the amount in the mock-inoculated plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), this is reminiscent of the molecular phenotype of <italic>TrAP</italic> transgenic plants, which showed lower enrichment of H3K9me2 mark at the studied loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results indicated that Geminivirus infection largely removed the repressive H3K9me2 marks in the transposons, and that the removal resulted at least in part from TrAP function. Given that TrAP is known to activate the expression of viral genes in the minichromosome and that endogenous transposons can serve as a proxy for viral genomes, it is conceivable that virus-encoded TrAP acts to suppress KYP in order to prevent the deposition of H3K9me2-repressive marks in the epigenome, to activate the expression of viral genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title><italic>kyp</italic> mutants sustain systemic infection of CaLCuV lacking a functional <italic>TrAP</italic> gene</title><p>Previous studies show that TrAP is required for the accumulation of the virus infective form, single-stranded (ss) DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayes and Buck, 1989</xref>). TrAP is indispensable for systemic infection of Begomoviruses because it activates the expression of the viral ssDNA binding proteins (nuclear shuttle protein and coat protein), which are essential for releasing the virus from the nucleus and for cell-to-cell spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sunter and Bisaro, 1992</xref>). If TrAP-mediated transcriptional activation and accumulation of ssDNA result from inhibition of KYP and correspondingly heterochromatin formation, then infectivity of CaLCuV lacking TrAP should be impaired in wild-type but recovered in <italic>kyp</italic> plants. To test this hypothesis, we engineered a CaLCuV variant without functional TrAP protein (CaLCuV Δ<italic>trap</italic>) by changing a single nucleotide (T to A) that produces an amber mutation and introduces an XbaI restriction site after the sixth codon in the <italic>TrAP</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).

Consistent with the hypersusceptible phenotype of <italic>kyp</italic> mutants to CaLCuV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>), these plants accumulated significantly higher titers of CaLCuV relative to wild-type control as both the replicative intermediate, open circle (OC), and the infective particle, SS DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Consistent with previous reports, the wild-type plants did not show any symptoms of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>) or systemic accumulation of CaLCuV Δ<italic>trap</italic>, as evidenced by Southern blot analyses and PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).

As a counter-defense strategy, Geminivirus-encoded TrAP protein inhibits KYP activity to maintain the euchromatic status of the minichromosome to allow active replication and transcription of viral genes and correspondingly to escape host surveillance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06671.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06671.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06671-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig9s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06671.020</object-id><label>Figure 9—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>CaLCuV lacking functional TrAP protein cannot cause systemic infection in wild-type plants.</title><p>The region corresponding to <italic>TrAP</italic> gene was amplified by PCR using the primers AL3_cterm_F and AL1_cterm_R (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 8</xref>) from total DNA extracted from plants infected with CaLCuV or CaLCuV Δ<italic>trap</italic>. 5 μl of the PCR products were run, and 3 μl were used for digestion with EcoRI or XbaI to examine the presence of the amber mutation in all the amplified products.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06671.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06671.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06671-fig9-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>TrAP was among the first viral suppressors identified to interfere with the TGS pathway. The prevailing model is that TrAP lowers the reservoir of transferable methyl groups by targeting ADK, a key enzyme in the SAM pathway. Here, we propose a novel model in which TrAP regulates TGS by directly targeting KYP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). Several pieces of evidence supported our notion: (1) TrAP genetically interfered with the TGS pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>); (2) TrAP directly interacted with KYP in vivo and also with other HMTase<italic>s</italic> in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>); (3) TrAP inhibited the catalytic activity of KYP in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); (4) TrAP reduced the repressive H3K9me2 marks in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and correspondingly, reactivated numerous loci that are otherwise repressed by KYP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>); (5) TrAP decreased CHH methylation in gene-rich regions that are also regulated by KYP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>); (6) methylation of viral chromatin entailed KYP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>); (7) KYP bound the viral chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>); and (8) <italic>kyp</italic> mutants but not wild-type plants sustain low systemic infection of CaLCuV lacking TrAP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). To our best understanding, this is the first evidence that a viral protein directly suppresses HMTases in the host TGS machinery.</p><p>Given that TrAP protein could concurrently limit the upstream supply of the methyl groups and directly inhibit downstream enzymatic activity of KYP, Geminiviruses appear to have evolved sophisticated strategies to cripple the host TGS pathway. What would be the biological advantages of blocking the TGS pathways? In eukaryotes, chromatin appears to be a critical battleground for virus–host interaction. Animals use histone modifications to reinforce the latency of integrated viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">du Chene et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Narasipura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2014</xref>). Plant DNA viruses including Geminiviruses and pararetroviruses replicate as nuclear minichromosomes or episomes. Clearly, TGS functions as an immune system to control virus replication and the expression of viral genes, in a similar fashion as the repression of endogenous TEs and transposon remnants. In previous studies and here in our experiments, <italic>kyp</italic> mutants displayed hypersusceptibility to Geminivirus infection, which could be rescued by exogenous wild-type <italic>KYP</italic> gene. KYP directly acts on viral chromatin and deposits the repressive H3K9me2 mark on the viral chromatin. Moreover, viruses lacking the essential TrAP protein can, although inefficiently, cause systemic infection in <italic>KYP</italic>-deficient hosts. All these facts point out the unambiguous role of KYP-mediated TGS in defense against viral infection. On the other hand, TrAP functions to inhibit KYP catalytic activity, reducing the repressive H3K9me2 mark, to activate transcription of viral genes. Our KYP reconstitution assays show that TrAP:KYP molar ratio of around 2 is enough to cause ∼50% inhibition of KYP activity, indicating that TrAP is a potent inhibitor of HMTase activity. Thus, direct inhibition of KYP represents a novel counter-defense mechanism for virus survival in the hosts. This mechanism could account for the long-documented essential role of TrAP in expression of viral genes including the coat protein and the nuclear shuttle protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sunter and Bisaro, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanley-Bowdoin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In plants, H3K9me2 marks often correlate with non-CG DNA methylation, and in particular with CHG modification. The tight coordination results from a self-enforcing loop consisting of KYP and CMT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2014a</xref>). Briefly, KYP methylates H3K9 to generate the binding sites for CMT3, which further methylates CHG DNA to create more binding sites for KYP. Consequently, the crosstalk between DNA and histone methylation ascertains the silent status of heterochromatin. We hypothesized that TrAP targets KYP to reduce H3K9me2 marks, and this inhibition would further decrease DNA methylation both on the host and on the viral genome. Here, we found that ectopic expression of TrAP had no effect on CHG but only on CHH methylation, at sites that are up to 96.7% overlapped with the hypo-methylated regions in <italic>kyp</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In plants, sequence contexts of CHG and CHH methylation are largely overlapped throughout the genome and are maintained to a limited extent by all non-CG methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stroud et al., 2014</xref>). One outstanding question would be how could TrAP differentially alter methylation of CHH rather than CHG, given that TrAP targets KYP? Methylation in the CHH context is catalyzed by CMT2 and DRM1/2 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and the sites regulated through the two sets of enzymes are mostly non-overlapping. Thus, the functions of CMT2 and DRM1/2 are mostly non-redundant at CHH sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stroud et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2014</xref>). DRM1/2 largely catalyze CHH methylation at the TE-rich regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stroud et al., 2014</xref>). In our study, we did not observe any effect of TrAP on CHH methylation in the TEs, suggesting that TrAP might not (or not sufficiently) interrupt the RdDM pathway that entails DRM1/2 and 24-nt siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stroud et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, it has been recently discovered that bulk CHH methylation is maintained by CMT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stroud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dubin et al., 2015</xref>) and that its activity is largely dependent on H3K9me2. In this scenario, CMT2 recognizes methylated H3K9 but preferentially binds to di-methylated over mono-methylated histone tails. This preference towards H3K9me2 is not observed in the CHG methyltransferase CMT3, which can equally bind to all forms of H3K9 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stroud et al., 2014</xref>). We envision that methylation at CHH sites could be more sensitive to changes in H3K9me2 than CHG, since CMT3 could still maintain CHG DNA methylation in the presence of H3K9me1 resulting from residual activity of HMTase, as would be the case when KYP is inhibited by TrAP. Alternatively, CHH methylation might play an important but yet unappreciated regulatory role in host defense genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). If so, preferentially targeting these loci by TrAP protein might represent a new counter-defense mechanism.</p><p>In the host, Geminivirus DNAs also undergo extensive methylation modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raja et al., 2008</xref>). In our study, TrAP reduces CHH methylation in the host and possibly in the viral genome, too. Remarkably, the Geminivirus replicase, Rep/AC1/C1 and the embedded protein AC4/C4, downregulate the expression of host DNA methyltransferases <italic>MET1</italic> and <italic>CMT3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pumplin and Voinnet, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rodriguez-Negrete et al., 2013</xref>); hence, it interrupts the reinforcing loop of histone and DNA methylation. Consistent to this study, <italic>cmt3</italic> mutants exhibit hypersusceptibility to viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raja et al., 2008</xref>). The fact that Rep/C4 repress <italic>CMT3</italic> expression in the host is in perfect alignment with our ChIP assay results on CaLCuV-infected plants, where the loss of H3K9me2 is even more severe than the observed in TrAP transgenic plants. Thus, interruption of the compelling feedback loop of histone and DNA methylation represents an important strategy to sustain transcription of viral chromatin. Together, it seems that the synergistic inhibition of histone and DNA methyltransferases by Geminivirus proteins evolves as a powerful tactic to win the arms race between host and pathogen.</p><p>Our in vitro assays clearly demonstrated that TrAP predominantly binds to the catalytic domain of KYP and inhibited its enzymatic activity. Whether TrAP might alter KYP conformation or block the accessibility of substrates to the active sites upon interaction awaits future structural analysis. We note, however, that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has 49 SET domain containing proteins of which 31 are considered to have HMTase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Arising from this fact is whether TrAP specifically targets KYP or promiscuously acts on additional HMTases. Although TrAP overexpression plants display molecular features in common with <italic>kyp</italic> mutant (i.e., reduced H3K9me2 levels), and an early flowering phenotype similar to loss-of-function mutant of the <italic>kyp</italic> paralog, <italic>SUVH2</italic>, the transgenic plants are phenotypically different from <italic>kyp</italic> single mutant. This could be due to functional redundancy between <italic>KYP</italic> and its paralogs in vivo; alas, the morphological phenotype of the higher-order mutants has not been fully documented.</p><p>We also noticed that <italic>TrAP</italic>-overexpression plants are morphologically similar to <italic>lhp1,</italic> which is characteristic of the H3K27me3 pathway. Moreover, the substantial overlapping of <italic>TrAP</italic>-responsive genes with <italic>lhp1</italic>-regulated genes strongly suggested that TrAP might target the <italic>LHP1</italic>-related H3K27me3 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng and Chen, 2011</xref>). Indeed, most of our tested loci in the host genome exhibited decreased H3K27me3 levels, consistent with the fact that ∼50% genes were co-regulated by TrAP and <italic>LHP1</italic> in a genome-wide scale. Interestingly, recent ChIP–chip studies revealed that H3K27me3 and <italic>LHP1</italic>-bound sites are predominantly distributed in the euchromatic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Turck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2007b</xref>). This distribution is not correlated with KYP-dependent H3K9me2 marks that are highly enriched at pericentromeric regions as large and uninterrupted heterochromatic blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Black et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). H3K9me2 can also occur in euchromatic regions but rather exist as small heterochromatin patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng and Chen, 2011</xref>). In our current study, we did not further examine whether TrAP physically targets H3K27me3 HMTases in the <italic>LHP1</italic> pathway. But it is plausible that TrAP inhibits both KYP and <italic>LHP1</italic> pathways. Notably, we did not observe the repression of transcriptionally active histone methylation marks, such as H3K4me3 and H3K36me3. This observation suggests that TrAP does not target the HMTases that are writers for the active marks. How can TrAP distinguish KYP from those active writers remains unclear, but we propose that structural components other than the SET domain might contribute to the recognition and affinity of TrAP binding to HMTases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Alternatively, additional cellular factors might also contribute to the specificity.</p><p>The direct consequence of TrAP-dependent inhibition of KYP activity is to activate viral transcription and replication. Because KYP is a key effector of TGS in the host and regulates a broad array of endogenous genes, interference with this core component would reprogram the expression profile of the host genome and thus trigger a series of downstream cascade signaling events that impact the balance of host/virus interaction. As an example, TrAP suppresses auxin and cell growth, whether this change might constitute a defense mechanism for the host benefit or create a favorable cellular niche for virus propagation remains for further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, our results support the notion that Geminivirus-encoded TrAP protein interferes with the TGS pathway and abrogates epigenetic silencing by direct interaction with KYP and inhibition of its transmethylation activity. Thus, Geminvirus TrAP functions clearly different from most of previously characterized viral suppressors, which target various steps of the PTGS pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding and Voinnet, 2007</xref>). Together with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raja et al., 2008</xref>), we provide evidence that KYP evolves as a critical immune system to control invading nucleic acids in plants; this is reminiscent of the roles of human SUV39H1 in maintaining the latency of HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">du Chene et al., 2007</xref>), Epsteinn-Barr virus (Imai et al., 2014), and some other mammalian viruses. Thus, sequestering or interfering with this core component is an effective strategy for Geminivirus to block TGS and to subvert host defense; we expect this strategy to be used by other suppressors in plants and mammals. Given that many viral suppressors interrupt different steps in the PTGS pathways to efficiently combat host surveillance, it would not be surprising that additional key cellular factors in the TGS pathway, besides HMTase, were readily targeted by invading viruses in eukaryotes. Importantly, it is believed that compounds or drugs that alter chromatin methylation might ultimately be the most effective means of combating disease. Our discovery that TrAP inhibits a histone-modifying enzyme also offers a new natural strategy to develop epigenetic-targeted drugs to cure human diseases that arise from epigenetic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25a">Højfeldt et al., 2013</xref>) or to engineer new biotechnological products to improve agricultural productivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA constructions</title><p>All the plant constructs were made using the Gateway system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor) and three reviewers. All four discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In your manuscript, you propose that a geminivirus encoded protein, TrAP, acts by interfering with the action of the SET domain histone methyltransferase SUVH4, a component of the plant host's transcriptional gene silencing machinery, providing a means that promotes virus survival in the arms race between virus and host. The topic is of broad interest given the conservation of HMTases in multicellular eukaryotes and the existence of other DNA viruses that affect animals, including humans. Your findings expand upon the previously proposed pleiotropic functions of TrAP proteins in suppression of TGS, such as adenosine kinase inhibition and SAMDC1 stabilisation. As well as illustrating a new role for TrAP during viral pathogenesis, your work could provide a useful tool for scientists, who could employ TrAP as a dominant inhibitor of H3K9me modification.</p><p>Your conclusions regarding the TrAP/SUNVH4 interaction are based on <italic>TrAP</italic> overexpression causing developmental defects reminiscent of certain epigenetic mutants, on physical interaction of TrAP with SUVH4 and inhibition of SUVH4 histone methyltransferase activity in vitro, and on SUVH4 effects on the viral genome. While there was in principle broad enthusiasm for the work among the reviewers, there were several substantial concerns that preclude acceptance of the work in its current form. However, we would be very interested in a substantially revised version, in which you provide:</p><p>1) Whole-genome comparisons of DNA and H3K9 methylation in <italic>suvh4</italic> mutants and <italic>TrAP</italic> overexpressers.</p><p>2) More evidence of direct interaction of SUVH4 and TrAP using co-IPs from complemented mutants.</p><p>The first major point of your manuscript concerns the interaction of TrAP with SUVH4. While we were convinced that TrAP can interact with SUVH4 in vitro, the in vivo data with overexpression constructs were less convincing. This is especially important considering there might be competition for binding to other SET domain proteins. As is, it is difficult to determine whether TrAP is indeed exerting its effect largely through SUVH4 rather than through any of the other 31+ <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SET domain proteins or any of the other previously documented TrAP targets. The differences in phenotypes between <italic>TrAP</italic> overexpressers and <italic>suvh4</italic> mutants would suggest that the SUVH4 interaction is not the entire story. To further support the conclusion that TrAP specifically interacts with SUVH4 in vivo, you should conduct co-IP experiments using constructs expressed at endogenous levels. You already have a tagged version of SUVH4 expressed under its endogenous promoter and you have many plant lines expressing varying levels of TrAP, and these lines could be easily crossed. Even better, but not mandatory, would be affinity purification of the epitope tagged TrAP followed by mass spectrometry.</p><p>A second main point is that TrAP inhibits SUVH4. Again, the in vitro data are very good, but the in vivo data are less conclusive. For example, you demonstrate that constitutive expression of TrAP causes developmental defects reminiscent of mutations affecting various epigenetic modifications. However, such defects are not observed in the <italic>suvh4</italic> single mutant, nor the <italic>suvh456</italic> triple mutant, in which H3K9me levels are drastically reduced. In fact, you start out by comparing <italic>TrAP</italic> overexpressers with <italic>lhp1</italic> mutants. In any case, the phenotypic discrepancies suggests that expression of TrAP disrupts many biological processes not connected with SUVH4 or its closest homologs, and it raises the possibility that TrAP generally targets SET domain HMTases, a possibility that you acknowledge in the Discussion. In and of itself, such potential promiscuity of TrAP is not an issue, as it would be just as interesting if a single viral protein could inhibit many SET domain HMTases. However, to make the argument that part of the effects of TrAP are through inhibition of SUVH4, you should compare the effects of <italic>TrAP</italic> overexpression to the effects of <italic>suvh4</italic> mutants rather than the effects of other chromatin regulatory factors like LHP1. As there are very few genes mis-regulated in <italic>suvh4</italic> single mutants, you should compare global levels of DNA and H3K9 methylation in <italic>TrAP</italic> overexpressers to those observed in a <italic>suvh4</italic> mutant (or <italic>suv456</italic> triple mutants). We also note that LHP1 has been shown to bind H3K27me3 and that it is in the CURLY LEAF/Polycomb pathway, and that there is no evidence that LHP1 is related to SUVH4 function. It is not clear how these distinct effects can be easily reconciled, and it tends to make the current presentation appear disjointed. On the other hand, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> you show that <italic>TrAP</italic> overexpression tends to phenocopy methylation patterns of <italic>suvh4</italic> mutants at several endogenous loci, more so than the <italic>lhp1</italic> knockout. These issues would most easily be reconciled with whole-genome data, as suggested above.</p><p>A final main point concerns the hypothesis that TrAP-mediated inhibition of SUVH4 is a means of suppressing host defense. In support of this notion, you cite (and reproduce) previous data showing that <italic>suvh4</italic> mutants are more susceptible to geminivirus infection. You also show that SUVH4 associates with the geminivirus genome by ChIP. However H3K9me modification of the viral genome is largely unaffected by loss of SUVH4, and there is no evidence that the observed changes influence expression of viral genes. You should compare viral gene expression in wild type and <italic>suvh4</italic> mutants, to determine if transcriptional gene silencing by SUVH4 does indeed affect viral gene expression. If no change in expression is observed in the <italic>suvh4</italic> mutant, this would argue against the presented model and suggest TrAP is functioning via an alternative mechanism.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Geminivirus-encoded TrAP suppressor inhibits the histone methyltransferase SUVH4/KYP to counter host defense” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor) and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>Specifically, we would like you to follow up as much as possible the suggestions of Reviewer 2, and also to provide BS-seq data.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have addressed all my concerns. I understand the difficulties the authors had to address the major concern #2 and I think that, even when the requested experiment would improve the manuscript its absence doesn't make the manuscript any weaker.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the revised version of their manuscript, Castillo-Gonzalez et al. addressed several, but not all, of my main concerns. Regarding the in vivo relevance of the KYP-TrAP interaction, the authors conducted TrAP IP mass spectrometry experiments and found many peptides corresponding to KYP, confirming an interaction under biologically relevant conditions. A second concern was in regards to the H3K9me2 ChIP data supporting the conclusion that <italic>TrAP</italic> overexpression affects the activity of KYP in vivo. As outlined below, I remain concerned about the interpretation of this data. Regarding the final point, the role of KYP in regulating the expression of virus genes, the authors provide additional genetic evidence supporting a role of KYP in virus infection in a manner that is specifically connected to the <italic>TrAP</italic> gene. While this is not a direct assessment of the role of KYP in transcriptional regulation of viral genes, it does further support a link between TrAP, KYP, and viral defense. Taken together, the new experiments presented significantly strengthen the connection between KYP and TrAP, but the extent to which the TrAP protein modulates KYP HMTase activity at endogenous loci remains less clear.</p><p>ChIP data:</p><p>Castillo-Gonzalez present H3K9me ChIP data at a total of 14 endogenous loci in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-C</xref> and conclude that ∼11/14 show reduced H3K9me levels in the <italic>TrAP</italic> overexpression lines which is in support of their hypothesis that TrAP inhibits KYP activity in vivo. However, as detailed below, it is not clear which, if any of the 10 genes tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref> are normally marked H3K9me2, as would be expected for bona fide KYP targets. Without further clarification on these loci, that leaves the 4 transposons tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, of which only two show a &gt;2x reduction in signal in the <italic>TrAP</italic> overexpression lines and the <italic>kyp</italic> mutants. Thus, while this data is in support of their conclusion that TrAP affects KYP activity in vivo, it is unclear how broadly TrAP is affecting KYP function. Inclusion of more loci known to be targets of KYP would significantly strengthen the conclusion that TrAP affects KYP function in vivo.</p><p>The ChIP data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>/B should be separated out to indicate which genes are marked by each chromatin modification in WT plants. Each gene will be predominantly marked by only one modification (H3K4me, H3K9me, or H3K9me). Without knowing the levels of each modification in WT plants, the data cannot be fully interpreted as presented because the WT sample is artificially set to one. For example if a gene (like RDR1) is expressed and marked by H3K4me in Wt plants, but is not marked by H3K9me or H3K27me then a ChIP signal showing reduced H3K9me or H3K27me is likely noise rather than a real signal. This is a critical point in the paper, as they use this data make the statement that TrAP causes decreased H3K9me levels. In the subsection “TrAP reduced H3K9me2 repressive marks in vivo” they state: “specifically, eight out of 10 TrAP deregulated loci, including the flowering-promoting genes, displayed reduced H3K9me in the <italic>TrAP</italic> overexpression plants compared to WT plants…”. However, in looking at available H3K9me2 data on the UCSC browser, these genes are largely devoid of H3K9me signal. To determine if there is H3K9me2 signal at the sites tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref> in WT plants, and to determine if this signal is meaningfully reduced in the <italic>TrAP</italic> overexpression lines, the WT signal should not be normalized to one and instead should be presented as a % input (and/or normalized to H3) alongside the enrichment level at a gene without H3K9me (like actin). Such analysis should not require repeating the ChIP assays and thus can be done in the absence of a good lot of Abcam 1220 antibody. However, if these sites do not have sufficient H3K9me2 signal in Wt plants then testing additional loci will become necessary. In this case, looking at DNA methylation levels (even if they have been shown to be affected by other TrAP proteins the Bisaro lab) in Wt plants, <italic>TrAP</italic> overexpressor lines, and <italic>kyp</italic> mutants can serve in support of the authors’ claims without relying on the Abcam H3K9me2 antibody.</p><p>Mass spectrometry data:</p><p>The text referring to the TrAP mass spectrometry data is quite brief and ambiguous as written. For example it is stated that 31 peptides uniquely match KYP, but it is unclear if these were only recovered in induced samples. Additional details should be provided in the text. For example in the response to the reviewers it is clearly stated that no peptides to KYP were identified in Col controls and that KYP was the most abundant hit from the mass spectrometry. It is not clear why these important details would be omitted from the text.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript has improved, and I can understand the difficulties with the H3K9me2 ChiP-seq, but I dont really agree with the reasoning to not do the BSseq. This is easy enough and while changes in DNA methylation might represent a downstream effect, the DNA methylation changes are well characterised in in suvh4 so they could still get a good idea of whether or not <italic>TrAP</italic> overexpression mimics loss of SUHV4 activity. The papers that the authors mention “Dr. David Bisaro's lab (Buchmann et al., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> in 2009 JV. 83 p5005-5013; and Raja, et al., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> in 2008, JV. 82 p8997-9007)” only perform BSseq at specific loci, not genome wide.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06671.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The first major point of your manuscript concerns the interaction of TrAP with SUVH4.

To further confirm the interaction between SUVH4/TrAP, we have pursued proteomics analysis of the TrAP protein complexes by mass spectrometry. To this end we used stable <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> transgenic lines carrying the <italic>XVE::Flag-Myc4-TrAP</italic> construct. The XVE promoter is inducible with β-estradiol and allows for time-regulated expression of the viral protein. For this experiment we used 9-days old seedlings and we induced TrAP expression for 16h, then we purified the TrAP complexes through two-step affinity purification to study whether we could recover endogenous KYP protein, we performed this experiment in parallel with Col-0 plants. The mass spectrometry analysis recovered 31 unique peptides that matched specifically to KYP/SUVH4, none of which were found in the Col-0 control plants. Moreover, KYP was among the most abundant recovered proteins in the immunoprecipitated TrAP complexes. We have added these results in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>. Thus, we are now very confident that KYP is a bona fide target of TrAP in vivo.</p><p>Importantly, we proposed in our manuscript that TrAP targets KYP to counter host defense. However, we did not mean that KYP is the only target of TrAP in the host. Indeed, we found by in vitro pull down assay that TrAP also interacts with the KYP paralogs SUVH2, 5, and 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>), and we also discussed the possibility of a more promiscuous effect of TrAP in the SET domain proteins predicted from the morphological phenotypes (in the Discussion). In fact, one aspect of our future effort is to examine how many SET domain containing proteins does TrAP target in the host, and how many of those targets are involved in host defense mechanisms. Also, we are working on additional potential targets recovered by proteomic analysis in our future study on this project.</p><p><italic>A second main point is that TrAP inhibits SUVH4. Again, the</italic> in vitro <italic>data are very good, but the</italic> in vivo <italic>data are less conclusive. For example, you demonstrate that constitutive expression of TrAP causes developmental defects reminiscent of mutations affecting various epigenetic modifications. However, such defects are not observed in the</italic> suvh4 <italic>single mutant, nor the</italic> suvh456 <italic>triple mutant, in which H3K9me levels are drastically reduced. In fact, you start out by comparing</italic> TrAP <italic>overexpressers with</italic> lhp1 <italic>mutants. In any case, the phenotypic discrepancies suggests that expression of TrAP disrupts many biological processes not connected with SUVH4 or its closest homologs, and it raises the possibility that TrAP generally targets SET domain HMTases, a possibility that you acknowledge in the Discussion. In and of itself, such potential promiscuity of TrAP is not an issue, as it would be just as interesting if a single viral protein could inhibit many SET domain HMTases. However, to make the argument that part of the effects of TrAP are through inhibition of SUVH4, you should compare the effects of</italic> TrAP <italic>overexpression to the effects of</italic> suvh4 <italic>mutants rather than the effects of other chromatin regulatory factors like LHP1. As there are very few genes mis-regulated in</italic> suvh4 <italic>single mutants, you should compare global levels of DNA and H3K9 methylation in</italic> TrAP <italic>overexpressers to those observed in a</italic> suvh4 <italic>mutant (or</italic> suv456 <italic>triple mutants). We also note that LHP1 has been shown to bind H3K27me3 and that it is in the CURLY LEAF/Polycomb pathway, and that there is no evidence that LHP1 is related to SUVH4 function. It is not clear how these distinct effects can be easily reconciled, and it tends to make the current presentation appear disjointed. On the other hand, in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>you show that</italic> TrAP <italic>overexpression tends to phenocopy methylation patterns of</italic> suvh4 <italic>mutants at several endogenous loci, more so than the</italic> lhp1 <italic>knockout. These issues would most easily be reconciled with whole-genome data, as suggested above</italic>.</p><p>This is an insightful point. It is true that TrAP transgenic plants phenocopy the morphology of mutants in the lhp1/leafy/polycomb pathway, but they also recapture the molecular phenotype of <italic>suvh4</italic>. We do not have to reconcile the relevance of LHP1 with SUVH4 (in fact, they are independent pathways in plants) since TrAP could target both pathways as stated in the discussion. We agree that our manuscript would be further improved if we could conduct whole-genome comparisons of H3K9 methylation in <italic>suvh4</italic> mutants and TrAP transgenic lines. With the advice as a guide, we have been actively pursuing this experiment. We prepared all materials and were ready for the ChIP-seq. However, we experienced an unexpected problem with the antibodies: as you know, the Abcam anti-H3K9me2 antibody (Ab1220) is the preferred antibody for ChIP-seq, and it is also the one we have successfully used before. Unfortunately, we ran out of our previous antibody (lot number 138716-4), and the newly purchased lots have not worked. We have screened the antibody from three lots already, with only one replacement barely immunoprecipitating H3K9me2 (signal 10<sup>3</sup> fold less than the previous antibody). To date, we have spent many weeks doing all kinds of tests in all possible conditions. The conclusion is that we need to wait for a new lot of antibody from Abcam to be tested, and to perform the ChIP-seq if it is good.</p><p>I thought to mention that the reason for us to choose the Abcam antibody was that Abcam is known to produce good anti-H3K9m2 antibody. In a big collaborative project funded by NIH to screen varieties of antibodies from many vendors worldwide, to filter out noise and to find the best ones in the epigenetics field (Egelhofer, et al., 2011. An assessment of histone-modification antibody quality. 18:91-93), Abcam’s ab1220 was reported as the best antibody for H3K9me2 ChIP. A website was provided for evaluation of the performance of each antibody (i.e. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/antibodies/targets/37">http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/antibodies/targets/37</ext-link> and</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/antibodies">http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/antibodies</ext-link>). There are several other companies producing anti-H3K9me2 (i.e. Active motif; Diagenode; Hiroshi Kimura Lab; and millipore). Data from this project suggested that the antibodies from these vendors could not be used for ChIP-seq.</p><p>We understand the concerns brought up by the reviewers, and we agree that this experiment can improve our manuscript. Nonetheless, in order for us to present solid work to the scientific community, we require high-quality antibody for the ChIP-seq assay. While we could continue to test the new antibodies from different lots from Abcam and other sources, there is no guarantee of when and where we could obtain the high-quality anti-H3K9me2 antibody. However, to clarify the concern from this reviewer, we pursued an alternative genetic approach: First of all, we performed Southern blot analysis of virus titers in <italic>kyp</italic> mutant and Col-0 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A-C</xref>), and observed substantial increase of virus replication in the <italic>kyp</italic> mutant compared to wild-type plants. This result indicates that KYP is a major immune system for defense of virus. More importantly, we created a mutant virus without functional TrAP (CaLcV ∆TrAP), inoculated <italic>kyp</italic> mutants and Col-0 control. We found that control plants did not allow replication of CaLCuV ∆TrAP at a detectable level. In contrast, the <italic>kyp</italic> mutant plants displayed systemic virus accumulation to a certain extent (as shown in single-stranded viral DNA, New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B-E</xref>). Thus, these new results clearly boosted our model that TrAP targets KYP to counter host defense (also see response below).</p><p>Given our extensive genetic and biochemical evidence in the manuscript and new proteomics data, we believe that TrAP functionally targets KYP to counter host defense. At this stage, we would rather leave whole-genome comparisons of H3K9 methylation in <italic>suvh4</italic> mutants and <italic>TrAP</italic> transgenic lines for a follow-up work. Regarding comparison of DNA methylation levels in <italic>suvh4</italic> and <italic>TrAP</italic> transgenic lines, we would like to mention that this assay is not a priority for this manuscript – the reason is that the impact of TrAP and SUVH4 on host and viral genomes has been reported by Dr. David Bisaro's lab (Buchmann et al., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> in 2009 JV. 83 p5005-5013; and Raja, et al., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> in 2008 JV. 82 p8997-9007). These results are well in line with our current work. Thus, additional sequencing might not increase the novelty and concept advance of our study; moreover, our biochemical study shows that TrAP mainly interacts with SET domain of KYP, which is the methyltransferase domain, and we presume that changes in histone methylation might be the primary cause for the TrAP function, while DNA methylation changes might be a downstream effect.</p><p><italic>A final main point concerns the hypothesis that TrAP-mediated inhibition of SUVH4 is a means of suppressing host defense. In support of this notion, you cite (and reproduce) previous data showing that</italic> suvh4 <italic>mutants are more susceptible to geminivirus infection. You also show that SUVH4 associates with the geminivirus genome by ChIP. However H3K9me modification of the viral genome is largely unaffected by loss of SUVH4, and there is no evidence that the observed changes influence expression of viral genes. You should compare viral gene expression in wild type and</italic> suvh4 <italic>mutants, to determine if transcriptional gene silencing by SUVH4 does indeed affect viral gene expression. If no change in expression is observed in the</italic> suvh4 <italic>mutant, this would argue against the presented model and suggest TrAP is functioning via an alternative mechanism</italic>.</p><p>Another insightful point. So far, we have provided evidence of the effect of KYP levels on the progression of CaLCuV infection in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, as the <italic>kyp</italic> mutants are hypersensitive, the complemented lines are as sensitive as the wild type, and the over expression lines are more resistant to infection. Moreover, we have shown that KYP expression affects the methylation status of the viral chromatin. Together, these data point to a direct effect of KYP in the pathogenesis of CaLCuV.</p><p>With the comment as a guidance, we have performed Southern blots to determine the populations of the viral DNA in the infected plants, and we have now shown that <italic>kyp</italic> mutant plants not only show more severe symptoms of infection, but also they accumulate the virus titers at more than 20-fold higher level than that in the wild type plants. The virus accumulation and systemic infection entails TrAP protein, as it is required for the expression of the late genes (coat protein and nuclear shuttle protein) that are necessary for the accumulation of the infective ssDNA particle. Most importantly, we have engineered a TrAP null mutant virus and we have performed infection studies in both the wild type and <italic>kyp</italic> mutant plants. As previously shown, begomoviruses deficient in TrAP are unable to cause systemic infection in wild type hosts; however, <italic>kyp</italic> mutant hosts can sustain systemic infection of this virus, although at low levels (Please refer to our response above).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Specifically, we would like you to follow up as much as possible the suggestions of Reviewer 2, and also to provide BS-seq data</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>The authors have addressed all my concerns. I understand the difficulties the authors had to address the major concern #2 and I think that, even when the requested experiment would improve the manuscript its absence doesn't make the manuscript any weaker</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>In the revised version of their manuscript, Castillo-Gonzalez et al. addressed several, but not all, of my main concerns. Regarding the</italic> in vivo <italic>relevance of the KYP-TrAP interaction, the authors conducted TrAP IP mass spectrometry experiments and found many peptides corresponding to KYP, confirming an interaction under biologically relevant conditions. A second concern was in regards to the H3K9me2 ChIP data supporting the conclusion that</italic> TrAP <italic>overexpression affects the activity of KYP</italic> in vivo<italic>. As outlined below, I remain concerned about the interpretation of this data. Regarding the final point, the role of KYP in regulating the expression of virus genes, the authors provide additional genetic evidence supporting a role of KYP in virus infection in a manner that is specifically connected to the</italic> TrAP <italic>gene. While this is not a direct assessment of the role of KYP in transcriptional regulation of viral genes, it does further support a link between TrAP, KYP, and viral defense. Taken together, the new experiments presented significantly strengthen the connection between KYP and TrAP, but the extent to which the TrAP protein modulates KYP HMTase activity at endogenous loci remains less clear</italic>.</p><p>ChIP data:</p><p><italic>Castillo-Gonzalez present H3K9me ChIP data at a total of 14 endogenous loci in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A-C</italic></xref> <italic>and conclude that ∼11/14 show reduced H3K9me levels in the</italic> TrAP <italic>overexpression lines which is in support of their hypothesis that TrAP inhibits KYP activity</italic> in vivo<italic>. However, as detailed below, it is not clear which, if any of the 10 genes tested in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A and B</italic></xref> <italic>are normally marked H3K9me2, as would be expected for bona fide KYP targets. Without further clarification on these loci, that leaves the 4 transposons tested in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C</italic></xref><italic>, of which only two show a &gt;2x reduction in signal in the</italic> TrAP <italic>overexpression lines and the</italic> kyp <italic>mutants. Thus, while this data is in support of their conclusion that TrAP affects KYP activity</italic> in vivo<italic>, it is unclear how broadly TrAP is affecting KYP function. Inclusion of more loci known to be targets of KYP would significantly strengthen the conclusion that TrAP affects KYP function</italic> in vivo.</p><p>This is a very important point. Obviously, we missed the opportunity of presenting our point clearly in the previous versions. Here in this version, we emphasized this critical point.</p><p>Briefly, we have included five transposable elements known to be targets of KYP, all of which showed greater than 2-fold decrease in our experiments (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). On the other hand, the comprehensive body of work published by Dr. Steven Jacobsen group on chromatin structure and regulation (Zhang et al., Genome-wide analysis of mono-, di- and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, Genome Biology, 2009; Bernatavichute et al., Genome-Wide Association of Histone H3 Lysine Nine Methylation with CHG DNA Methylation in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, PLoS ONE, 2008; Zhang et al., PLoS Biology, 2007) allowed us to pinpoint the specific histone modifications (H3K9me2, H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) on the genome and to provide a guide for selection of the regions for ChIP-qPCR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06671.031</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06671.031">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06671.031</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06671-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>In fact, the criteria we used to select the loci for RT-qPCR and ChIP-qPCR were: 1) their transcription was significantly affected by the expression of the TrAP transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>); and 2) H3K9me2 mark have been found in the loci. For example, FTM1, FT, AGL9, MFT, PRE1 and AT4G17810 all harbor H3K9me2 marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><p>We should also mention that there might be few cases in which our data was not fully consistent with the published work. The reason is that plant materials in our experiments differ from the materials used in previous studies. We used 11 days-old seedlings grown in short day conditions (8h light/ 16h dark), while some of the data reported was obtained from 3 weeks old adult plants grown under constant light (i.e. H3K9me2 and H3K4me3), or from 10-14 days-old seedlings grown in long day condition (16h light/ 8h dark) (i.e. H3K27me3). These differences imply a huge disparity in the developmental stage of the samples, as H3K9me2 and H3K4me3 mark were measured from flowered adult plants. Taking into consideration that we focused on flowering genes, it is not surprising that some differences between our data and others’ exist.</p><p><italic>The ChIP data presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref><italic>/B should be separated out to indicate which genes are marked by each chromatin modification in WT plants. Each gene will be predominantly marked by only one modification (H3K4me, H3K9me, or H3K9me). Without knowing the levels of each modification in WT plants, the data cannot be fully interpreted as presented because the WT sample is artificially set to one. For example if a gene (like RDR1) is expressed and marked by H3K4me in Wt plants, but is not marked by H3K9me or H3K27me then a ChIP signal showing reduced H3K9me or H3K27me is likely noise rather than a real signal. This is a critical point in the paper, as they use this data make the statement that TrAP causes decreased H3K9me levels. In the subsection “TrAP reduced H3K9me2 repressive marks</italic> in vivo<italic>” they state: “specifically, eight out of 10 TrAP deregulated loci, including the flowering-promoting genes, displayed reduced H3K9me in the</italic> TrAP <italic>overexpression plants compared to WT plants…”. However, in looking at available H3K9me2 data on the UCSC browser, these genes are largely devoid of H3K9me signal. To determine if there is H3K9me2 signal at the sites tested in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A and B</italic></xref> <italic>in WT plants, and to determine if this signal is meaningfully reduced in the</italic> TrAP <italic>overexpression lines, the WT signal should not be normalized to one and instead should be presented as a % input (and/or normalized to H3) alongside the enrichment level at a gene without H3K9me (like actin). Such analysis should not require repeating the ChIP assays and thus can be done in the absence of a good lot of Abcam 1220 antibody. However, if these sites do not have sufficient H3K9me2 signal in Wt plants then testing additional loci will become necessary. In this case, looking at DNA methylation levels (even if they have been shown to be affected by other TrAP proteins the Bisaro lab) in Wt plants,</italic> TrAP <italic>overexpressor lines, and</italic> kyp <italic>mutants can serve in support of the authors’ claims without relying on the Abcam H3K9me2 antibody</italic>.</p><p>This is another insightful point; and thanks to this reviewer for guiding us on how to present our ChIP data in a more accurate way.</p><p>First, based on the advice from this reviewer, we recalculated our ChIP-qPCR and completely reformatted the data taking into account the background signal, by redoing qPCR using the remaining ChIP DNA from the original experiments. In the new figures, each histone modification is shown separately. Also, the data is presented as enrichment relative to tubulin (TUB8) or relative to input alongside to TUB8 (this is particular for H3K9me2, since the TUB8 signal was extremely low and the values relative to TUB8 resulted in an exorbitant range). We would like to emphasize that our remaining ChIP-DNA from previous experiments only allowed us to repeat 7 of 12 protein-coding genes in our original manuscript, and the 5 transposable elements presented in the current version.</p><p>We would like to reiterate that the previously published H3K9me2 ChIP-seq data are obtained using plants at a developmental stage different from ours as stated above, and this fact could cause differences at the chromatin level that may render the data not readily comparable. For instance, the reported H3K9me2 marks at some of our target genes are low in the 3-week old plants, but one could not imply that they do not exist at the seedling stage. As an additional case, the published H3K27me3 (obtained from seedlings) and H3K4me3 (obtained from adult plants) available datasets, if directly compared, might mislead us to conclude that both modifications coexist at the flowering genes.</p><p><italic>Mass spectrometry data</italic>:</p><p><italic>The text referring to the TrAP mass spectrometry data is quite brief and ambiguous as written. For example it is stated that 31 peptides uniquely match KYP, but it is unclear if these were only recovered in induced samples. Additional details should be provided in the text. For example in the response to the reviewers it is clearly stated that no peptides to KYP were identified in Col controls and that KYP was the most abundant hit from the mass spectrometry. It is not clear why these important details would be omitted from the text</italic>.</p><p>We stated this point in the previous point-to-point response letter; and now we have moved this critical information in the main text.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>The manuscript has improved, and I can understand the difficulties with the H3K9me2 ChiP-seq, but I dont really agree with the reasoning to not do the BSseq. This is easy enough and while changes in DNA methylation might represent a downstream effect, the DNA methylation changes are well characterised in in suvh4 so they could still get a good idea of whether or not</italic> TrAP <italic>overexpression mimics loss of SUHV4 activity. The papers that the authors mention “Dr. David Bisaro's lab (Buchmann et al.,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5B</italic></xref> <italic>in 2009 JV. 83 p5005-5013; and Raja, et al.,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C</italic></xref> <italic>in 2008, JV. 82 p8997-9007)” only perform BSseq at specific loci, not genome wide</italic>.</p><p>As requested, we have performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing in our Col-0 wild type, <italic>suvh4/kyp</italic>, and 35S-TrAP plants. The new result is now included in the new subsection “TrAP decreases CHH DNA methylation” and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>, and the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data SD6-data SD7-data">Supplementary files 5, 6, and 7</xref>.</p><p>We found that <italic>TrAP</italic> overexpression did not affect CHG methylation; however, it reduced CHH methylation in gene rich regions that were almost completely overlapped with the <italic>suvh4</italic> mutant. These regions included FT, CUC1, and AT4G17810, in accordance with our reported loss of H3K9me2 enrichment in TrAP transgenic lines and <italic>suvh4</italic> mutants. Our new result is a bit surprising, but more exciting, that is to say, CHH and CHG could be regulated separately – it is known that CMT2 – the main CHH DNA methyltransferase – has greater affinity for H3K9me2 over H3K9me1. Other non-CG methyltransferases, such as CMT3 (which catalyzes CHG methylation) do not show binding preference among different methylation levels in the histone tail. We therefore envision methylation at CHH sites to be more sensitive to changes in H3K9me2 methylation than CHG. In all, our data is consistent with decrease in H3K9me2, which could be explained by partial inhibition of SUVH4 activity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
