2α (eIF2α) kinase GCN2 is activated by amino acid starvation to elicit a rectifying physiological program known as the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). A role for uncharged tRNAs as activating ligands of yeast GCN2 is supported experimentally. However, mouse GCN2 activation has recently been observed in circumstances associated with ribosome stalling with no global increase in uncharged tRNAs. We report on a mammalian CHO cell-based CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis screen for genes that contribute to ISR activation by amino acid starvation. Disruption of genes encoding components of the ribosome P-stalk, uL10 and P1, selectively attenuated GCN2-mediated ISR activation by amino acid starvation or interference with tRNA charging without affecting the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein stress-induced ISR, mediated by the related eIF2α kinase PERK. Wildtype ribosomes isolated from CHO cells, but not those with P-stalk lesions, stimulated GCN2-dependent eIF2α phosphorylation in vitro. These observations support a model whereby lack of a cognate charged tRNA exposes a latent capacity of the ribosome P-stalk to activate GCN2 in cells and help explain the emerging link between ribosome stalling and ISR activation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Often thought of as “workhorse” molecules, proteins take part in almost every structure and activity in a living cell. They are constructed from smaller building blocks called amino acids by molecular machines called ribosomes. Each cell needs a constant supply of amino acids to make new proteins. If cells are running low on amino acids, they can change their internal biochemistry to use amino acids more economically. GCN2 is one protein that helps activate these biochemical changes, but it was unclear how a shortage of amino acids could activate GCN2.</p><p>Earlier in 2019, researchers reported that, in a test tube at least, isolated ribosomes could themselves activate GCN2. They also identified a part of the ribosome called the P-stalk as playing an important role in the interaction. Now, Harding et al. – who include some of the researchers involved in the earlier study – explore the activation of GCN2 further, but this time based on experiments with mammalian cells.</p><p>First, a genetic screen was conducted to identify genes that if mutated specifically prevented the activation of GCN2 in cells that were starved of amino acids. This screen identified a few genes, several of which are involved in creating the P-stalk of the ribosome. By isolating the mutant ribosomes from these cells and studying them in the laboratory, Harding et al. then showed that these ribosomes are unable to activate GCN2.</p><p>These findings confirm that the P-stalk of the ribosome plays an essential role in activating GCN2 in response to a shortage of amino acids. They shed light on a fundamental biological system, and further work will undoubtedly seek to uncover the details of the process by which GCN2 is activated.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>integrated stress response</kwd><kwd>ribosome stalling</kwd><kwd>P-stalk</kwd><kwd>CHO</kwd><kwd>GCN2</kwd><kwd>ul10</kwd><kwd>p1</kwd><kwd>p2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C14801/A21211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Roger L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome 100140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome 200848/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic lesions that compromise the ribosome P-stalk implicate direct signalling from the ribosome to the translation initiation factor eIF2 kinase GCN2 in the cellular response to amino acid starvation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phosphorylation of translation initiation factor 2 on serine 51 of its alpha subunit (eIF2α) is a potent mechanism for translational regulation in eukaryotes. Phosphorylated eIF2 impedes the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B thereby limiting the pool of active GTP-bound eIF2. The consequences to rates of translation initiation are mRNA-specific. By way of this direct effect on protein synthesis and its indirect consequences to the abundance of downstream effector proteins, levels of eIF2α phosphorylation modulate gene expression translationally and transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In animals four different kinases couple unrelated stress signals to eIF2α phosphorylation (eIF2α<sup>P</sup>). eIF2α<sup>P</sup> effectively integrates these into a stereotypical downstream response referred to as the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harding et al., 2003</xref>). The ISR modulates biological processes ranging from the cell autonomous endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response to organismal immunity, memory and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wek, 2018</xref>). The four eIF2a kinases, GCN2, PERK, PKR and HRI, share a similar kinase effector domain, but diverge in the molecular mechanisms and nature of the upstream signals that regulate their kinase activities.</p><p><underline>G</underline>eneral <underline>C</underline>ontrol <underline>N</underline>on-depressible 2 (GCN2) is the oldest eIF2α kinase, conserved in all known eukaryotes. It was discovered as the product of a gene required for yeast adaptation to starvation for any amino acid, as in its absence yeast were unable to mount a rectifying transcriptional General Control response (the yeast counterpart to animal cell ISR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hinnebusch and Fink, 1983</xref>). This amino acid starvation-induced, GCN2-dependent unicellular gene expression program has as its targets genes encoding transporters and biosynthetic enzymes that function to restore amino acid sufficiency, as well as tRNA synthetases that promote amino acid utilization as building blocks of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>). These physiological features, in conjunction with the domain organization of the GCN2 protein (including an eIF2α kinase module and a module highly related to histidyl-tRNA synthetases, HisRS-like), suggested that uncharged tRNAs may serve as activating ligands of GCN2 as part of a feed-back mechanism that defends cellular pools of charged tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wek et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wek et al., 1990</xref>). This model was supported by the observations that mutations in the HisRS-like module that interfere with uncharged tRNA-binding in vitro abolished GCN2 activity in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wek et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhu et al., 1996</xref>) and by evidence that tRNA binding to the HisRS-like portion of GCN2 relieves an intramolecular repressive signal arising from its interaction with the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dong et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Parallel lines of enquiry indicate that GCN2 activity also relies on direct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ramirez et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhu and Wek, 1998</xref>) and indirect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marton et al., 1997</xref>) interactions with ribosomes or ribosome-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiménez-Díaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Inglis et al., 2019</xref>). These latter observations suggest that GCN2 activation may not arise solely by binary interaction between GCN2 and uncharged tRNAs as activating ligands. Additionally, a recent genetic observation made in mice brought into question the singular role of excess uncharged tRNAs as GCN2 activating ligands and instead suggested that in some circumstances the interaction between GCN2 and ribosomes might take center stage. A strain of mice (C57BL/6J) that lacks an abundant neuron-specific isoacceptor arginyl-tRNA was noted to have higher levels of GCN2-dependent ISR activity in brain tissues compared with a reference strain that expressed normal levels of the neuron-specific arginyl-tRNA. ISR activity in arginyl-tRNA depleted C57BL/6J brain was not associated with globally elevated uncharged tRNAs, but was increased by a second mutation that compromises the cells ability to re-cycle stalled ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ishimura et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these observations suggest a mechanism for activating mammalian GCN2 that emanates from a (stalled) ribosome-generated signal that arises when pools of charged tRNAs are limiting. Whilst a role for localized pools of uncharged tRNAs remains possible, the findings of Ishimura (et al. 2016) suggest that GCN2 activation may proceed independently of globally elevated levels of uncharged tRNAs.</p><p>Following up on these hints for the existence of additional aspects of mammalian GCN2 activation, we took advantage of recent developments in CRISPR-Cas9 technology to search for mammalian genes whose compromise also enfeebles GCN2 activation. Our findings, pointing to a role for the ribosomal P-stalk in coupling an amino acid starvation-induced change in the ribosome to GCN2 activation, are described below.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A genetic screen implicates the ribosomal P-stalk in ISR induction selectively by histidinol or amino acid deprivation</title><p>As a first step towards identifying genes implicated in GCN2-mediated ISR induction we confirmed the suitability of two reporter cell lines.

After two rounds of sorting, sequencing of the guides confirmed that those targeting the GCN2 encoding <italic>Eif2ak4</italic> were amongst the most highly enriched in the dull cells. Ontology cluster analysis also revealed enrichment for guides targeting the mRNA cap binding complex, other translation initiation factors, and ribosomal proteins, consistent with similar studies previously carried out in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Despite the enrichment for guides targeting genes plausibly implicated in amino acid starvation-mediated ISR activation, many of the HeLa cells selected for CHOP::GFP dullness had also lost the ability to respond to tunicamycin (not shown). Furthermore, it became evident that the clonogenic potential of stressed HeLa cells was poor, compared with CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These features were deemed to compromise the prospect of enrichment for guides targeting genes of interest by further cycles of selection in HeLa cells. To circumvent this problem, we drew on the sequence information derived from the targeted HeLa cells to create a CHO-based CRISPR library focused on those genes enriched in the dull HeLa cells and expanded to other members of their gene families. The resulting 19,305-guide library targeting 3,222 CHO genes (~6 guides per gene) was used to mutagenize CHO cells. Flow cytometry-based sorting enriched for cells that were selectively compromised in CHOP::GFP expression in response to histidinol but retained significant responsiveness to tunicamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Sequencing of the integrated guides from genomic DNA isolated from the CHOP::GFP dull CHO cells confirmed enrichment of guides targeting <italic>Eif2ak4</italic> and a subset of genes encoding translation initiation factors and ribosomal proteins. Among the latter was <italic>Rps10</italic> (encoding eS10), previously implicated in GCN2 responsiveness to amino acid starvation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Guides targeting two other ribosomal genes were also conspicuously enriched in the dull CHO cells: <italic>Rplp0</italic> and <italic>Rplp1</italic>, encoding uL10 and P1, both components of the acidic ribosomal P-stalk, a heteropentameric structure that also includes P2 (guides directed to the P2-encoding <italic>Rplp2</italic> gene were also modestly enriched in the dull population) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>The enriched <italic>Rplp0</italic> guides caught our interest, because they mapped to the region encoding the C-terminus of uL10, which constitutes the helical spine of the P-stalk protrusion from the ribosome surface and the linker connecting it to the ribosome core. Guides targeting the ribosome-embedded N-terminal portion of uL10 were strongly depleted from all pools of CHO cells (regardless of their ISR status) consistent with a role for this portion of the protein in cell fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). These findings hinted at a possible role for the P-stalk in ISR activation in response to histidinol. Given the proximity of the P-stalk to the ribosomal A site, we considered a role for the P-stalk in signaling event(s) triggered by lack of charged tRNAs or by ribosome stalling.</p><p>To follow up on the genotype-phenotype relationship suggested by the screen, we targeted CHO cells with the <italic>Rplp0</italic> and <italic>Rplp1</italic> guides found to be enriched in CHOP::GFP dull cells and characterised genotypically-defined clones phenotypically. Histidinol induction of CHOP::GFP expression was conspicuously compromised in the targeted clones, whereas their responsiveness to ER stress-inducing agents was unaffected. A selective defect was also observed in <italic>Rplp0</italic> and <italic>Rplp1</italic> mutant cells in response to lysine and arginine depletion, albeit not to the level of GCN2 ablated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). The defect in the ISR brought about by targeting cells with the <italic>Rplp0</italic>-directed guide was rescued by restoring gene function, attained by re-targeting the mutant <italic>Rplp0</italic> locus with a homologous repair template to reestablish the coding region of the gene (whilst adding an epitope tag) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). These findings formally establish a correlation between CRISPR-Cas9-induced lesions in the P-stalk and a selective defect in the inducibility of the CHOP::GFP ISR reporter in response to inhibition of tRNA charging or to starvation for amino acids.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CRISPR-Cas9-based P-stalk lesions impair CHOP::GFP induction upon histidinol treatment or amino acid starvation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow cytometry analysis of the ISR-inducible CHOP::GFP and the UPR inducible XBP1::mCherry reporters from untreated (UT red), histidinol-treated (0.5 mM, HD, blue), thapsigargin-treated (1 mM, Tg, orange), or cells starved for lysine and arginine (-KR, purple) all for 20 hr.

In elongating ribosomes, charged cognate tRNAs (in complex with eEF1A) followed by eEF2, cycle through the A site (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brown and Shao, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dever et al., 2018</xref>). It is tempting to speculate on a scenario whereby the cycling of these factors in proximity to the P-stalk restrains the latter’s GCN2 stimulatory activity. This may occur through elongation factor mediated steric blocking of the interaction between GCN2 and domain II of uL10 (shown to be essential for GCN2-P-Stalk binding, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Inglis et al., 2019</xref>), by competition for the attention of the acidic C-terminal tails of the P-stalk proteins (which are important for activation of GCN2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Inglis et al., 2019</xref>), or by eliciting conformational changes in the P-stalk. Disruption of this elongation cycle by lack of cognate charged tRNA presumably stalls ribosomes in a conformation that relieves such restraint(s), exposing the dormant capacity of the P-stalk to activate GCN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model for ribosome state-dependent GCN2 activation by the P-stalk.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In amino acid replete cells, charged tRNAs and elongation factors eEF1A and eEF2 cycle through the GTPase associated centre repressing the P-stalk’s latent ability to activate GCN2.

Presumably ribosome isolation disrupts the aforementioned constraints on the P-stalk and exposes its latent ability to activate the kinase in vitro. In this vein, it is interesting to compare the P-stalk’s role in yeast and mammalian GCN2 activation. Activation by the mammalian P-stalk requires both the ribosome-associated N-terminal domain II of uL10 and the acidic C-termini of the three P-stalk components that extend from the ribosomes surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Inglis et al., 2019</xref>). By contrast, the yeast P1/P2 proteins are sufficient for GCN2 activation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiménez-Díaz et al., 2013</xref>). These observations fit the genetic evidence of a role for the free (not ribosome-associated) pool of yeast P2 in GCN2 activation in vivo. Interestingly, the free pool of yeast P2 contributes to GCN2 activation in response to osmotic stress and glucose deprivation, but is dispensable for GCN2 activation by histidine depletion. The latter observation is consistent with the notion that GCN2’s response to amino acid starvation might depend on a ribosome-coupled P-stalk mediated signal, which may be provided adequately by yeast uL10 even in the absence of associated P1/P2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiménez-Díaz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The importance of the physical coupling between the P-stalk and the ribosome to mammalian GCN2 activation is suggested by the strong phenotype of the compound <italic>Rplp0/Rplp1<sup>m29-132</sup></italic> mutant in which the truncation of uL10 and the internal deletion of P1 conspire to deplete ribosomes of associated P-stalk acidic C-termini, whilst retaining a substantial pool of cytosolic P proteins with intact C-termini. The notion that efficient delivery of the P-stalk’s message to GCN2 relies on proximity to the ribosome is consistent with the importance of other contacts made between GCN2 and the mammalian ribosome, such as those dependent on eS10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2015</xref>) (a product of a gene also ‘hit’ in our screen for CHOP::GFP dull cells).

These seminal early findings, together with more recent work (of which this paper is part), point to a role for a stalled ribosome-initiated P-stalk-mediated activation signal. Moreover, these observations suggest the possibility that GCN2, the first eIF2α kinase, evolved initially as part of a simple feed-back loop attenuating translation initiation in response to ribosome stalling. The coupling of GCN2’s activity to a gene expression program that acts physiologically to relieve some of the more common causes of stalling, may have emerged later and eventually evolved into the ISR we recognize today in multicellular organism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction and materials</title><p>Standard cloning techniques were used to create the recombinant DNA vectors listed in the Key Resources Table (supplementary Table 1).

After quantification the products were subjected to NGS sequencing using custom primer UK1435 and the illumina indexing primer with single-end reads of 50 bp on a hiseq 4000. The sequences were processed and guide counts, gene rankings and statistics were generated using MAGECK software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2014</xref>). The top 1% (200 hits) were submitted to metascape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>) for gene annotation analysis and genes in the top enriched ontology clusters were added to the list along with the next ~9% of genes selected in the screen. Guides to 1500 unrelated CHO genes and 200 non-targeting control guides were also included in the library (NCBI Geo database; accession numbers awaiting assignment). CHO homologues were identified from a gene list from the CHO-K1 reference genome (GCF_000223135.1). Guides based on improved efficiency rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doench et al., 2014</xref>) were designed against the selected genes and pooled single stranded oligonucleotides (see oligo UK2580) were synthesized as part of a full genome library made with two sets of arms for independent PCR amplification and cloning (Twist Biosciences, California USA). The 19305 guide library (CHO-mini-library) targeting 3222 CHO genes (six guides per gene) was PCR amplified from the pool in 8 rounds of PCR with primers UK1855 and UK1856), digested with Bbs1, and the 27 bp fragments purified by PAGE and cloned into a BbsI cut UK1789 pKLV-U6gRNA (BbsI)-PGKpuro2ABFP vector (Addgene 50946) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koike-Yusa et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The resulting focused library was used to mutagenize the CHO-CHOP::GFP, XBP1::mCherry double reporter cells at a MOI of 0.1 and a representation of ~350 cells for each library guide in duplicate pools. In the first round, 4–5% of the dullest cells following 20 hr induction with histidinol were selected and corresponding unselected pools maintained. In the second round three levels of dull cells corresponding to the lowest ~4.6, 11, and 24% were collected from each duplicate along with pools of treated unsorted cells. The selected guides were PCR amplified from genomic DNA as above but using primers UK1758 and UK1434 for the first round and primers UK1432 and one of the barcoded reverse primers (UK1759-UK1776) for the second round of PCR. The PCR products were subjected to NGS sequencing and analysis by MAGECK software as above for the HeLa screen. The figures show an average of the duplicates for both the dullest and medium dull selected cells (n = 4) compared to the average for the duplicate unselected controls (n = 2).

contributing to GCN2 activation and thereby to the cells' response to amino acid starvation was originally suggested years ago, by findings that yeast GCN2 physically interacts with ribosomes and that essential co-factors to GCN2 activation, such as GCN1 and GCN20 are tightly ribosome-bound. Earlier this year, the Williams lab provided strong evidence that GCN2 transiently associates with ribosomes in vitro via a region of the ribosome known as the P-stalk and that the acidic tails of the P-stalk proteins can serve as GCN2 activators. However, the relevance of these important findings to GCN2 activation in cells remained unproven. This paper bridges the gap between the in vitro observations and cells, by showing that CRISPR/Cas9 engineered truncations of the P-stalk that compromise the ability of purified ribosomes to activate GCN2 in vitro also compromise GCN2 activation in amino acid starved cells. The findings here, therefore establish a role for the ribosome in conveying an amino acid starvation signal to GCN2. Though the details of that signal remain to be worked out, this study helps the field by telling us where to look for it.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The ribosomal P-stalk couples amino acid starvation to GCN2 activation in mammalian cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Evelyn Sattlegger (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors report on the link between the ribosomal P-stalk and GCN2 activation. They performed a CRISPR/Cas9 screen to discover modifiers of GCN2-mediated integrated stress response (ISR) activation. From the many targets, they chose to study the ribosomal P-stalk, uL10, and P1 proteins because of a prior paper that demonstrated their importance in GCN2 activation in vitro. Importantly, they show here the P-stalk significance for ISR and GCN2 stimulation in vivo.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please find below the full reviews of the three reviewers. As you can see they agree that the data are interesting and important, but the major reservation of the reviewers is that the novelty issue was not clearly and adequately addressed in this paper. It is important to show that the ribosomal protein-dependent activation of GCN2 occurs in vivo (in cells). The Williams paper (PNAS 2019) reported that isolated ribosomes promoted GCN2 activation, but there is the possibility that this could be an in vitro artifact. You showed by performing an independent genetic screening that the Williams' data are correct and thus your findings bolster these data. It is also significant that the mutants, which do not activate GCN2 in vivo, do not do it in vitro, either. Although they do not show that the ribosomal proteins activate directly GCN2, the data of this paper and those of Williams demonstrate that ribosomal proteins play an essential role in GCN2 activation. We assume that the reason you chose to select from the many targets to concentrate your study on ul10, P1, and P2 is because of the Williams paper and because these proteins provide a coherent target.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a nice piece of work, this reviewer only has a few comments.</p><p>Introduction section: &quot;.… not require elevated levels of uncharged tRNAs&quot;. The experiments used cannot exclude the possibility that there are localised changes in distribution of uncharged tRNAs (which cannot be detected after cell lysis), thus the statement &quot;does not require elevated levels of uncharged tRNAs&quot; should be phrased more carefully.</p><p>Though unlikely, is it possible that the function of the ribosome and its P-stalk merely is to help GCN2 to be efficient in accessing its substrate eIF2alpha, at least under the in vitro conditions used (Figure 6D), instead of to per se activate GCN2?

The authors undertake a CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify modifiers of GCN2-mediated integrated stress response (ISR) activation. Among the hits identified, they focus on sgRNAs targeting the ribosomal P-stalk, uL10 and P1. They then take advantage of in vitro biochemical assays to link P-stalk function to the ISR and GCN2 stimulation. This is a fast-moving field and much of the in vitro novelty of this study however has been preceded by a recent PNAS publication by the Williams group (PMID 30804176) (which the authors acknowledge and cite), but which steals the &quot;thunder&quot; from the current study.</p><p>I don't understand the rationale for keying in on <italic>Rplp0</italic> and <italic>Rplp1</italic> from the screening data. Looking at Figure 1E, there are a lot of sgRNAs that are enriched in the HD-dull sorted cells. What criteria places <italic>Rplp0</italic> and <italic>Rplp1</italic> above any of these other ones. Without this explanation, it looks like <italic>Rplp0</italic> and <italic>Rplp1</italic> were simply cherry-picked. The authors make the statement in the figure legend that &quot;only <italic>Rplp0</italic> guides that were not depleted from the unselected pool of transduced cells were enriched in the CHOP:GFP dull population.&quot; I don't think that this is accurate since on the Figure I am given, I see 2 enriched guides for <italic>Rplp0</italic> (purple circles), 2 depleted guides, and 2 non-depleted guides. Hence 50% of the <italic>Rplp0</italic> guides that were not depleted were enriched.</p><p>Technically, the screen could have been better performed. In the initial screen, only 60 cells/guide were used which is quite low and likely to affect guide representation (most screens aim for &gt;400 cells/guide). As I understand the Materials and methods, the top 10% genes were selected to go forward in the CHO screen. To this was added 1500 unrelated CHO genes and 200 non-targeting. How did these unrelated and non-targeting guides perform in the CHO screen? Were they truly neutral or they showed a wide spread. The authors need to show these controls and explain their behaviour.</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 1B shows a plot of the mean log2 fold change from each of the 3222 genes in the CHO mini library. It might be my inexperience, but I have not seen screening data presented in this manner without any statistics. What is the variation on these numbers? Where is <italic>Rplp0</italic> on this plot since only 2/6 guides showed activity in the primary screen (Figure 1E).</p><p>Figure 5C, 6C should have error bars.</p><p>The authors indicate in the Results that they identify sgRNAs that target the mRNA cap binding complex, other translation initiation factors, and ribosomal proteins, consistent with similar studies previously carried out in yeast. Can they elaborate and comment on this – also specifically what was found and how does the activity of these targets impinge on the GCN2 response.</p><p>In my opinion, the authors have to clearly indicate what is novel here in their study compared to the Williams group.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Background:</p><p>Ishimura et al., 2016 observed an induction of the integrated stress response by GCN2 in the absence of accumulated uncharged tRNA, a known activator of GCN2, in mice brain with stalled ribosomes. This novel result implicated ribosome stalling with the activation of GCN2.</p><p>Jimenez-Diaz et al., 2013 showed that free yeast P1 and P2 proteins, which also form part of the ribosome P-stalk complex with uL10, activate mouse GCN2 autophosphorylation and eIF2alpha substrate phosphorylation.</p><p>Recently, Inglis et al., 2019 mapped interaction of human GCN2 with the ribosome (purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate) to the uL10 subunit of the P-stalk by hydrogen deuterium exchange mass-spectrometry (HDX-MS). They also demonstrated addition of human P-stalk (consisting of uL10, P1/P2) potently activated GCN2 substrate phosphorylation in vitro. However, in contrast to what was observed for the yeast system, Inglis et al. did not observe GCN2 activation when they added only the human P1/P2 proteins to Gcn2 (ie the presence of uL10 was required).</p><p>In the submitted manuscript, Harding et al. further investigate the mechanism of mammalian GCN2 activation using a CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen. Consistent with prior art, they uncovered a role for uL10 and P1 proteins of the P-stalk in the activation of Gcn2 in cells and in vitro.</p><p>Figure 1/2</p><p>The authors performed a CRISPR-Cas9 knock out screen using HeLa and CHO cell lines with GFP tagged CHOP, an effector of the ISR, as reporter of ISR activation. Cells were subjected to chemically induced amino acid starvation via inhibition of protein synthesis by histidinol. Cells impaired for CHOP-GFP activation appearing dull were isolated and the gRNA sequenced to identify genes involved in activation of the ISR upon amino acid starvation.</p><p>The authors incorporated appropriate controls by selecting for cells that showed impaired CHOP-GFP activation in response to histidinol, but remained ISR competent via activation of PERK by tunicamycin induced ER stress, avoiding false positive dull cells whereby ISR is entirely abolished. This gave confidence that dull cells would identify genes involved specifically in starvation activated ISR involving GCN2.</p><p>Two genes were identified in this screen namely the ribosomal P-stalk proteins uL10 and P1. These two hits were validated by observation of impaired CHOP-GFP indication upon histidinol treatment or lysine/arginine starvation in CHO cells with CRISPR-Cas9 targeted deletion of portions of uL10 and P1 protein.</p><p>Figure 3:</p><p>The authors looked at the effect of uL10 and P1 truncations on ISR – in terms of shift of ribosomes from polyribosomes to free 40s and 60s subunits measured by the ratio of the two upon induction of ISR and induction of ATF4 and CHOP proteins. Upon lysine/arginine starvation, a large increase in ribosome free subunits and a small decrease in polysomes was observed for WT cells. These signals were markedly attenuated by knock out of GCN2 and to a slightly less degree by double mutations in P1 and uL10.</p><p>Comment: The authors should make note of the fact (and explain) that the profile of WT cells in panel C does not look like the profile for the WT cells in Figure 2A. Specifically, the red blue and purple populations are fully distinct in Figure 2A but purple and blue overlap almost perfectly in Figure 3C.</p><p>Figure 4:</p><p>uL10 and P1 mutants showed impaired association of P1/P2 proteins with the ribosome by observation of decreased detection of P1/P2 protein from purified ribosomes with truncated uL10 compared to WT ul10; the authors showed this decrease cannot be explained by change in overall P1/P2 and uL10 protein level in cytoplasmic extract.</p><p>Figure 5:</p><p>Ribosomes activate the ability of GCN2 to phosphorylate eIF2alpha. Importantly, the extent of eIF2lapha phosphorylation correlated with level of association of P1/P2 protein with ribosomes.</p><p>Comment: The authors should consider inclusion of a catalytically dead GCN2 mutant.</p><p>Figure 6:</p><p>Ribosome activation alters GCN2 enzyme kinetics. The authors show a striking shift in GCN2 enzyme kinetics in response to ribosome addition. Consistent with flow-cytometry results, ribosome does not appear to activate the isolated kinase domain of PERK, lacking its regulatory domain apparatus (panel A).</p><p>Comment: The authors should consider using a full-length protein control to make for a more fair comparison (I doubt that the kinase domain of Gcn2 would be responsive to ribosomes either). In this regard, PKR would be easy to produce.</p><p>Comment: Panel B doesn't make sense as presented. Gcn2 appears more active without ribosome and the quantification in panel C doesn't match the gel pattern in panel B.</p><p>In panel D, the authors claim that GCN2 autophosphorylation, which was previously shown to be required for GCN2 catalytic activity, is not affected by ribosome addition.</p><p>Comment: The western blots are not compelling. The authors should consider repeating the experiment with fully dephosphorylated Gcn2 to make a stronger case. It appears that the starting Gcn2 material is already phosphorylated to a significant degree</p><p>Figure 7:</p><p>In a model figure, the author place GCN2 activation in the broader context of ribosome translation.</p><p>Comment: The complicated shapes of the protein in the cartoon make the figure hard to navigate – there is too much distracting complexity for the simple proposed model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50149.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please find below the full reviews of the three reviewers.

We were further impressed that the pattern of guides targeting uL10, an essential protein, suggested that those affecting the C-terminal extra-ribosomal segment of the gene (the part that recruits the other P-stalk proteins) were enriched in cells displaying the ISR-deficient phenotype, whereas those located in regions encoding the ribosome associated mass of the protein were depleted.</p><p>Whilst such reasoning may qualify as <italic>simple cherry picking</italic>, we believe that sharing the reasoning that informed our choice with our readers has value.

Furthermore, Inglis et al. have previously documented that the eIF2α -directed kinase activity in the preparations of GCN2 used here were entirely dependent on integrity of the GCN2 protein (see Figure 1 therein).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6:</p><p>Ribosome activation alters GCN2 enzyme kinetics. The authors show a striking shift in GCN2 enzyme kinetics in response to ribosome addition. Consistent with flow-cytometry results, ribosome does not appear to activate the isolated kinase domain of PERK, lacking its regulatory domain apparatus (panel A).</p><p>Comment: The authors should consider using a full-length protein control to make for a more fair comparison (I doubt that the kinase domain of Gcn2 would be responsive to ribosomes either). In this regard, PKR would be easy to produce.</p></disp-quote><p>Full-length PERK is a membrane associated protein, its isolation for biochemical experiments in vitro is impractical. Furthermore, given the absence of ribosomes in the ER lumen, the domain of PERK that is likely to benefit from any interaction with ribosomes is its cytosolic kinase domain, the one tested here as a relevant counterpoint to GCN2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment: Panel B doesn't make sense as presented. Gcn2 appears more active without ribosome and the quantification in panel C doesn't match the gel pattern in panel B.</p></disp-quote><p>To extract enzyme kinetics, this gel is loaded with equal mass of substrate in each well not the whole reaction to prevent overloading in the high substrate lanes (see Materials and methods). The enzyme velocity in the corresponding reaction is derived from the product of the fraction of the protein phosphorylated and the substrate concentration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In panel D, the authors claim that GCN2 autophosphorylation, which was previously shown to be required for GCN2 catalytic activity, is not affected by ribosome addition.</p><p>Comment: The western blots are not compelling. The authors should consider repeating the experiment with fully dephosphorylated Gcn2 to make a stronger case. It appears that the starting Gcn2 material is already phosphorylated to a significant degree</p></disp-quote><p>Whilst we recognize the potential utility of commencing the reaction with dephosphorylated GCN2, the need to re-purify the kinase away from the phosphatase, renders this an impractical experiment. Thus we have further qualified our conclusions from this experiment, which we now interpret in light of the analysis of the ribosome’s role in GCN2 activation/phosphorylation in cells (new Figure 3D and 3E, and figure supplement): “It is noteworthy that in vitro, ribosomes promote GCN2 phosphorylation on residues other than threonine 899 (Inglis, 2018). Unfortunately, the antiserum directed towards human GCN2 pThr899 used here fails to recognise the hamster protein, thus we are unable to ascertain if the defect in GCN2 phosphorylation observed in amino acid deprived, P-stalk mutant cells (Figure 3D and 3E and Figure 3—figure supplement 1) encompasses that residue. However, given that the phos-tag gels report on multiple phosphorylation events in the amino acid deprived wildtype cells that are absent from P-stalk mutant cells, it seems reasonable to conclude that the ribosome-mediated signal also results in other phosphorylating events in vivo. Their relationship to GCN2’s activity as an eIF2a kinase remains to be determined.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7:</p><p>In a model figure, the author place GCN2 activation in the broader context of ribosome translation.</p><p>Comment: The complicated shapes of the protein in the cartoon make the figure hard to navigate – there is too much distracting complexity for the simple proposed model.</p></disp-quote><p>We have simplified the figure by removing the lower part of the bottom panel.</p></body></sub-article></article>
