Here, we investigated the physiologic function of the conserved lncRNA <italic>Norad</italic> in vivo. Deletion of <italic>Norad</italic> in mice results in genomic instability and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to a dramatic multi-system degenerative phenotype resembling premature aging. Loss of tissue homeostasis in <italic>Norad</italic>-deficient animals is attributable to augmented activity of PUMILIO proteins, which act as post-transcriptional repressors of target mRNAs to which they bind. <italic>Norad</italic> is the preferred RNA target of PUMILIO2 (PUM2) in mouse tissues and, upon loss of <italic>Norad</italic>, PUM2 hyperactively represses key genes required for mitosis and mitochondrial function. Accordingly, enforced <italic>Pum2</italic> expression fully phenocopies <italic>Norad</italic> deletion, resulting in rapid-onset aging-associated phenotypes. These findings provide new insights and open new lines of investigation into the roles of noncoding RNAs and RNA binding proteins in normal physiology and aging.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42650.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Only a tiny portion of our genetic material contains the information required to create proteins, the workhorses of the body. The rest of our DNA, however, is not useless: some of it can be transcribed to create molecules known as non-coding RNAs, which are increasingly scrutinized by scientists.</p><p>For example, a non-coding RNA called <italic>NORAD</italic> acts as a guardian of the genome by reducing the activity of a protein named PUMILIO. Without <italic>NORAD</italic>, PUMILIO becomes overactive, and this causes problems as genetic information is split between two ‘daughter cells’ when a cell divides.</p><p>Defects in the amount of genetic material in cells have been linked with faster aging in animals. In addition, some studies suggest that as animals get older, the levels of <italic>NORAD</italic> in the body decrease, while the levels of PUMILIO increase. However, the precise role that <italic>NORAD</italic> may play in aging remains unclear.</p><p>To address this question, Kopp et al. engineered mutant mice that lack <italic>Norad</italic> (the mouse equivalent of human <italic>NORAD</italic>) and carefully monitored how they grew and developed. The animals looked normal at birth, but they seemed to age faster: for instance, their fur became thin and gray, and their brains developed age-related abnormalities much sooner than normal mice.</p><p>At the level of individual cells, losing <italic>Norad</italic> was also associated with problems often seen in old age. The mutant animals were more likely to have incorrect amounts of genetic information in their cells, and they had defects in the cell compartments that create the energy necessary for life. Further experiments showed that these issues were driven by PUMILIO being hyperactive. Overall, the work by Kopp et al. reveal that the non-coding RNA <italic>Norad</italic> is essential to keep PUMILIO activity in check and to prevent problems associated with aging from appearing in young animals. Further studies are now needed to take a closer look at how <italic>NORAD</italic> and other non-coding RNAs keep us healthy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>long

comprise a heterogeneous class of transcripts that are defined by a sequence length greater than 200 nucleotides and the lack of a translated open-reading frame (ORF). lncRNAs have been proposed to perform a variety of cellular functions including regulation of gene expression in <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>, modulation of functions of RNAs and proteins to which they bind, and organization of nuclear architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Batista and Chang, 2013</xref>). Although they have been estimated to number in the tens of thousands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrow et al., 2012</xref>), the biological significance of the vast majority of lncRNAs remains to be established. This is due, in part, to the generally low abundance and poor evolutionary conservation of most lncRNAs, which has limited our ability to interrogate their biochemical functions as well as their biologic roles in vivo using model organisms. Moreover, while genetic studies in mice have uncovered important functions for selected mammalian lncRNA loci in development and disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sauvageau et al., 2013</xref>), it has often been challenging to connect specific lncRNA-driven phenotypes to defined RNA-mediated functions. As a result, our broad understanding of how the molecular pathways controlled by lncRNAs impact development and physiology remains limited.</p><p><italic>Noncoding RNA activated by DNA damage</italic> (<italic>NORAD</italic>) is a recently described lncRNA that is distinguished from the majority of transcripts in this class due to its high abundance in mammalian cells and strong evolutionary conservation across mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tichon et al., 2016</xref>). Studies in human cells have established that this RNA functions as a strong negative regulator of PUMILIO1 (PUM1) and PUMILIO2 (PUM2), RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that belong to the deeply conserved family of Pumilio and Fem3 binding factor (PUF) proteins. PUM1/2 bind specifically to the eight nucleotide (nt) PUMILIO response element (PRE) (UGUANAUA), which is often located in the 3’ UTR of mRNAs. Binding of PUM1/2 to these sites triggers accelerated deadenylation, reduced translation, and turnover of mRNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller and Olivas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Quenault et al., 2011</xref>). With the capacity to bind a large fraction of PUM1/2 within the cell, <italic>NORAD</italic> limits the availability of these proteins to repress target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tichon et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, inactivation of <italic>NORAD</italic> results in PUMILIO hyperactivity with augmented repression of a program of target mRNAs that includes key regulators of mitosis, DNA repair, and DNA replication. Dysregulation of these genes results in dramatic genomic instability in <italic>NORAD</italic>-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). In accordance with this model, PUM2 overexpression is sufficient to phenocopy, while PUM1/2 loss-of-function is sufficient to suppress, the <italic>NORAD</italic> knockout phenotype in human cells. Recent work has identified additional RNA-binding proteins that interact with <italic>NORAD</italic> including SAM68, which facilitates PUMILIO antagonism by this lncRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tichon et al., 2018</xref>), and RBMX, an RNA binding protein that contributes to the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Munschauer et al., 2018</xref>). While it has not yet been demonstrated that <italic>NORAD</italic>:RBMX interaction is essential to maintain genomic stability, this intriguing interaction raises the possibility of additional functions for <italic>NORAD</italic> beyond regulation of PUMILIO activity.</p><p>Although PUF proteins are deeply conserved across eukaryotic species, the emergence of <italic>NORAD</italic> specifically within mammals suggests the existence of strong selective pressure to maintain tight control of PUMILIO activity within this lineage. In mice, PUM1 and PUM2 loss-of-function has been linked to behavioral abnormalities, elevated neuronal excitability, and impaired neurogenesis, while inactivation of PUM1 reduces fertility in males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldstrohm et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, mammalian neurons are exquisitely sensitive to reduced dosage of PUMILIO, with only a 25% to 50% reduction in PUM1 expression resulting in neurodegeneration in both human and mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gennarino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gennarino et al., 2015</xref>). The existence of <italic>NORAD</italic> suggests that hyperactivity of PUMILIO, expected to occur in the absence of this lncRNA, may also result in deleterious effects. While studies in cell lines have demonstrated that <italic>NORAD</italic> loss or PUMILIO overexpression results in genomic instability, the consequences of mammalian PUMILIO hyperactivity in vivo have yet to be examined.</p><p>Here, we report an investigation of the physiologic role of the <italic>Norad</italic>-PUMILIO axis through the generation and characterization of <italic>Norad</italic>-deficient and <italic>Pum2</italic> transgenic mouse lines. While deletion of <italic>Norad</italic> does not overtly impact development, mice lacking this lncRNA develop a dramatic multi-system degenerative phenotype that resembles premature aging. Loss of <italic>Norad</italic> results in PUMILIO hyperactivity and repression of genes that are essential for normal mitosis, leading to the accumulation of aneuploid cells in <italic>Norad</italic>-deficient tissues. Unexpectedly, <italic>Norad</italic> loss also causes striking mitochondrial dysfunction, associated with repression of PUMILIO targets that regulate mitochondrial homeostasis. Importantly, transgenic expression of <italic>Pum2</italic> is sufficient to fully phenocopy <italic>Norad</italic> loss of function, triggering genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and rapidly-advancing aging-associated phenotypes. These findings demonstrate the importance of <italic>Norad</italic> in maintaining tight control of PUMILIO activity in vivo and establish a critical role for this lncRNA-RBP regulatory interaction in mammalian physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deletion of the mouse <italic>Norad</italic> ortholog</title><p>A mouse ortholog of <italic>NORAD</italic> (<italic>2900097C17Rik</italic> or <italic>Norad</italic>), exhibiting 61% nucleotide identity with its human counterpart, is clearly identifiable on mouse chromosome 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Our studies of the murine <italic>Norad</italic> ortholog reported here unequivocally establish the importance of this lncRNA, and the tight regulation of its target PUMILIO proteins, in mammalian biology and implicate the <italic>Norad</italic>-PUMILIO axis as a major regulator of aging-associated phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). These findings provide important new insights and open new lines of investigation into the roles of noncoding RNAs and RNA binding proteins in normal physiology, aging, and disease.</p><p>While PUMILIO proteins belong to a deeply conserved family of post-transcriptional regulators, obvious <italic>Norad</italic> orthologs are apparent only in mammals. Other RNAs that regulate the activity of PUMILIO-related proteins in a similar manner in non-mammalian species have not been reported. Why then did this additional layer of PUMILIO regulation evolve? A possible answer to this question may relate to recent findings that, together with those reported here, demonstrate an exquisite sensitivity to PUMILIO dosage in mammals. Zoghbi and colleagues recently showed that slightly reduced <italic>PUM1</italic> dosage causes neurodegeneration in human and mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gennarino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gennarino et al., 2015</xref>). Human subjects carrying heterozygous <italic>PUM1</italic> deletions or missense mutations develop a neurodevelopmental disorder referred to as <italic>PUM1</italic>-associated developmental disability, ataxia, and seizure (PADDAS), associated with a ~ 50% reduction in PUM1 protein, or a later onset variant known as <italic>PUM1</italic>-related cerebellar ataxia (PRCA), associated with only a ~ 25% lowering of PUM1 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gennarino et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together with our findings from this study, in which we examined for the first time the effects of mammalian PUMILIO hyperactivity in vivo, we can conclude that PUMILIO activity must be maintained within a very narrow range in order to prevent widespread deleterious consequences. In light of these findings, we propose that one major function of <italic>Norad</italic> is to buffer PUMILIO activity such that it stays within this critical range. This model posits the existence of <italic>Norad</italic>-bound and free PUMILIO pools which are exchangeable and in equilibrium, ensuring a consistent amount of available PUMILIO for target mRNA engagement and preventing fluctuations in PUMILIO expression from manifesting in altered target repression. Indeed, an RNA such as <italic>Norad</italic> represents an ideal molecule to serve as a buffer of this type, as it is able to efficiently regulate the activity of a pre-existing pool of PUMILIO at the level of target engagement.</p><p>In addition to providing a buffering function, it is likely that <italic>Norad</italic> is also utilized for dynamic regulation of PUMILIO activity under selected conditions. In particular, this lncRNA is known to be induced by a variety of cellular stressors, including DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2016</xref>) and hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michalik et al., 2014</xref>), which would be expected to result in de-repression of PUMILIO targets following these stimuli. Although the functional consequences of modulating PUMILIO-mediated gene regulation under these conditions is not yet understood, continued investigation of the signaling inputs that control this system and the resulting effects on PUMILIO-regulated gene networks will be important to further elucidate the roles of this newly discovered pathway in mammalian biology.</p><p>A surprising observation reported in this study was the rapid onset of dramatic premature aging-like phenotypes in <italic>Pum2</italic> transgenic mice despite a lack of overt overexpression of PUM2 protein at the bulk tissue level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This finding raises the question of how transgene induction is able to drive such a striking phenotype if the protein product does not accumulate to supraphysiologic levels. An appealing hypothesis to explain this observation postulates that there are key vulnerable cell populations that become dysfunctional or damaged upon <italic>Pum2</italic> induction. These cells may be rare or may naturally express lower levels of PUMILIO, such that a large change in PUM2 expression within them may be masked by the majority of cells in the tissue. Indeed, isolated MEFs from <italic>Pum2; rtTA3</italic> transgenic mice show a robust increase in PUM2 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), thereby demonstrating clear transgene activity in isolated cell types. In addition, given that production of transgenic FLAG-PUM2 is robustly detectable by IHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), repression of endogenous PUMILIO through a previously described negative feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galgano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kedde et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morris et al., 2008</xref>) may also contribute to the apparent lack of increase in total PUM2 levels in bulk tissue. Most importantly, the significant repression of PUM2 targets upon transgene induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>) demonstrates detectable PUM2 hyperactivity in <italic>Pum2; rtTA3</italic> tissues even in the absence of a global increase in protein abundance. Finally, it is worth noting that the absolute magnitude of repression of individual PUM2 targets in <italic>Norad<sup>–/–</sup></italic> or <italic>Pum2; rtTA3</italic> tissues is generally low (~10–20%) (for example, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). While the complexity of bulk tissue may mask more robust repression of PUM2 targets in specific cell-types, it is likely that the phenotypic consequences of PUMILIO hyperactivity cannot be attributed to repression of individual targets. Rather, the coordinated, modest repression of a broad set of PUMILIO targets in aggregate most likely produces the dramatic phenotypes observed.</p><p>Cells that are sensitive to enforced <italic>Pum2</italic> expression likely include stem cell populations whose dysfunction could lead to loss of tissue homeostasis and degenerative phenotypes. Accordingly, PUMILIO and related proteins have been implicated as critical stem cell regulators in model organisms and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crittenden et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Forbes and Lehmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leeb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin and Spradling, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Naudin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shigunov et al., 2012</xref>). Identification of specific cell populations that drive aging-associated phenotypes under conditions of <italic>Norad</italic>-deficiency or PUMILIO hyperactivity represents an important priority for future work as this approach may reveal new cell types whose dysfunction contributes to the natural aging-associated decline of tissue homeostasis and renewal.</p><p>Analyses of <italic>Norad</italic>-deficiency and enforced <italic>Pum2</italic> expression unexpectedly revealed that PUMILIO hyperactivity triggers the coordinated repression of a large set of PUM2 target transcripts with key roles in mitochondrial function and homeostasis, associated with widespread structural and functional mitochondrial defects. These findings were corroborated by a recent study reporting that elevated PUM2 levels in aged mice impaired mitochondrial homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">D'Amico et al., 2019</xref>). A large body of evidence has linked a decline in mitochondrial function to aging-associated phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2016</xref>), including the direct demonstration that ‘mitochondrial mutator mice’, which harbor a mutation in the mitochondrial DNA polymerase and consequently accumulate mtDNA mutations, develop a premature aging phenotype with many features in common with <italic>Norad<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trifunovic et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction in concert with genomic instability, another abnormality associated with premature aging in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2006</xref>), provides a compelling mechanistic basis for the phenotype of <italic>Norad</italic>-deficient animals. The regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and function by PUMILIO-related proteins is not restricted to mammals. The budding yeast Puf family member Puf3p preferentially associates with mRNAs that encode mitochondrial proteins and facilitates their local translation in the vicinity of the mitochondrial protein import machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">García-Rodríguez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saint-Georges et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and cultured mammalian cells, PUMILIO proteins repress translation of mRNAs that encode mitochondria-destined proteins until these transcripts are docked at the mitochondrial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gehrke et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these observations suggest a deeply conserved role for PUMILIO proteins in the regulation of mitochondrial biology across eukaryotic species.</p><p>Perhaps, the most intriguing question to arise from these studies is whether dysregulation of the <italic>Norad</italic>-PUMILIO axis plays a role in physiologic aging and/or human disease. Remarkably, a recent RNA-seq study of noncoding RNA expression in the subependymal zone of human brains of increasing age reported a strong age-related decrease in <italic>NORAD</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barry et al., 2015</xref>). These findings take on added significance in light of our new understanding of the consequences of disruption of the <italic>Norad</italic>-PUMILIO axis and suggest that this lncRNA, and its target PUMILIO proteins, represent new candidates whose altered expression or function may influence the normal age-related decline in tissue function. These genes also represent previously unrecognized candidates that may be mutated or otherwise disrupted in rare progeroid cases that are unlinked to the genes that are presently known to cause these disorders. Thus, further study of the <italic>Norad</italic>-PUMILIO axis, and the pathways that regulate this noncoding RNA and its target proteins, promises to reveal important and unexpected new insights into mammalian physiology and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>Norad</italic> (<italic>2900097C17Rik</italic>)</td><td>NA</td><td>Ensembl: <break/>ENSMUSG00000102869</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td><italic>NORAD</italic> (<italic>LINC00657</italic>)</td><td>NA</td><td>Ensembl: <break/>ENSG00000260032</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Norad<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice</td><td>This paper; <break/>see Materials and methods <break/>section Generation of <break/>mice with <italic>Norad</italic> deletion <break/>or enforced PUM2 expression</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Pum2</italic> (TRE-<italic>FLAG-Pum2</italic>) <break/>mice</td><td>This paper; <break/>see Materials and methods <break/>section Generation of <break/>mice with <italic>Norad</italic> deletion or <break/>enforced PUM2 expression</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>rtTA3</italic> (CAG-<italic>rtTA3</italic>) mice</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Stock# 016532</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57BL/6J mice</td><td>UTSW Breeding Core</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Norad<sup>-/-</sup></italic> primary MEFs</td><td>This paper; <break/>see Materials and methods <break/>section Generation and <break/>culture of mouse embryonic <break/>fibroblasts (MEF)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Norad<sup>+/- </sup></italic>primary MEFs</td><td>This paper; <break/>see Materials and methods <break/>section Generation and <break/>culture of mouse embryonic <break/>fibroblasts (MEF)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Norad<sup>+/+</sup></italic> primary MEFs</td><td>This paper; <break/>see Materials and methods <break/>section Generation and <break/>culture of mouse embryonic <break/>fibroblasts (MEF)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Norad<sup>-/-</sup></italic> immortalized <break/>MEFs</td><td>This paper; <break/>see Materials and methods <break/>section Generation and <break/>culture of mouse embryonic <break/>fibroblasts (MEF)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Norad<sup>+/+</sup></italic> immortalized <break/>MEFs</td><td>This paper; <break/>see Materials and methods <break/>section Generation and culture <break/>of mouse embryonic <break/>fibroblasts (MEF)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>rtTA3</italic> primary MEFs</td><td>This paper; <break/>see Materials and methods <break/>section Generation and <break/>culture of mouse embryonic <break/>fibroblasts (MEF)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Pum2</italic> primary MEFs</td><td>This paper; <break/>see Materials and methods <break/>section Generation and <break/>culture of mouse embryonic <break/>fibroblasts (MEF)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Pum2;rtTA3</italic> primary <break/>MEFs</td><td>This paper; <break/>see Materials and methods <break/>section Generation and <break/>culture of mouse embryonic <break/>fibroblasts (MEF)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Neuro-2a</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CCL-131</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>CT26</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-2638</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Hepa1-6</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-1830</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HCT116</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CCL-247</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td><italic>NORAD<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCT116</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al.

CPM (counts per million) and FPKM (fragments per kilobase million) were obtained using EdgeR and Stringtie (v1.2.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pertea et al., 2015</xref>), respectively.</p><p>Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) was performed using default gene sets of gene ontology (GO) terms. The results obtained from the RNA-seq analyses of brain and spleen (normalized reads as CPM) were used as input data. The normalized enrichment scores (NES) as well as the false discovery rates (FDR) are provided in the figures. GO analysis of spleen RNA-seq data was also carried out on genes that were significantly (p≤0.05) downregulated in <italic>Norad<sup>–/–</sup></italic> spleens using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2009b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Enhanced UV crosslinking immunoprecipitation (eCLIP)</title><p>PUM2 RNA interactions in the mouse brain were determined by eCLIP, following a previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Van Nostrand et al., 2016</xref>). In brief, brains from 3-month-old <italic>Norad<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Norad<sup>–/–</sup></italic> females (two mice per genotype representing two biological replicates) were resected and cut in halves. Per sample, one half of a brain was minced with razor blades in 1X ice-cold diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated PBS. The resulting tissue suspensions were UV crosslinked on ice in a Spectrolinker XL-1500 (Spectronics) at 254 nm three times at 400mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. The UV crosslinked tissues were centrifuged, snap-frozen in ethanol/dry ice, and stored at −80°C until needed. For the immunoprecipitation of PUM2, Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were used together with the same polyclonal goat anti-PUM2 antibody (sc-31535, Santa Cruz) used previously for PUM2 CLIP analysis in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). For each genotype, duplicate size-matched input and immunoprecipitation samples were prepared (four samples per genotype). In contrast to the original protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Van Nostrand et al., 2016</xref>), in which libraries were designed for paired-end sequencing, we adapted the RNA and DNA linker sequences for single-read sequencing. For each sample, separate sequencing libraries were generated using a unique modified RiL19-new RNA linker as well as a modified rand103Tr3-new DNA linker and AR17-new reverse transcription primer (sequences provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). PCR library amplification was performed with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)-purified oligonucleotides containing specific indexes (D501-D504, D701-D703). Single-read sequencing was performed on a NextSeq 500 platform using a NextSeq 500/550 High Output v2 Kit, 75 cycles (Illumina) in the UTSW McDermott Center Next-Generation Sequencing Core.</p><p>All adapter sequences were removed using Cutadapt with an e-value set to 0.1. All reads less than 18 nt after adapter trimming were discarded, and the unique molecular identifiers (10 nt randomers) for PCR duplication identification were trimmed and recorded using in-house scripts. Because of the high number of <italic>NORAD</italic> pseudogenes in the human and mouse genome, we followed a similar mapping strategy to that used in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Reads were first mapped to <italic>Norad</italic> (<italic>2900097C17Rik</italic>) before all remaining reads, which did not align to <italic>Norad</italic>, were mapped to GRCm38 (mm10) using Tophat2 (v2.0.12) with default settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Only uniquely mapped genomic reads were retained. PCR duplicates were then removed based on the unique molecular identifier information using in-house scripts. All remaining reads were regarded as usable reads and subjected to cluster calling.</p><p>For each IP sample, the read coverage of each nucleotide was calculated and all regions with coverages of equal or greater than three were kept as candidate bins. The read counts of each IP/input pair were obtained for every bin, requiring at least a 50% sequence overlap. The fold-changes of the normalized read counts were then calculated for each bin: normalized fold-change = ((reads_in_bin[IP]+1)/total_usable_reads[IP])/((reads_in_bin[input]+1)/total_usable_reads[input]). Bins with fold-changes greater than or equal to four were considered as clusters. Finally, we filtered clusters for those that were detected in both biological replicates of either genotype. Clusters that overlapped with at least 30% of their length were merged. Bedgraph files of each sample were generated with BEDtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>) using reads normalized to the total usable genomic read count and visualized with the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). Genes with one or more CLIP clusters in their 3’ UTRs were regarded as PUM2 target genes. The number of CLIP reads per gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) was determined by calculating the weighted sum of all reads within 3’ UTR CLIP clusters for each PUM2 target gene from both <italic>Norad<sup>+/+</sup></italic> CLIP replicates. To calculate normalized CLIP signal of PUM2 targets in <italic>Norad<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Norad<sup>–/–</sup></italic> brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), a method similar to that used by Bosson <italic>et al.</italic> was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosson et al., 2014</xref>). Genes were first filtered for those with an average expression level of at least 1 FPKM in brain RNA-seq data. The average normalized number of CLIP reads from both CLIP replicates within 3’ UTR clusters of each PUM2 target gene were then summed and divided by the gene’s expression level (average FPKM) in the respective genotype. For CDF plots depicting fold-changes of CLIP targets in brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>), non-CLIP targets were filtered for those whose expression levels were within 25% of the log mean value for this parameter in the set of CLIP targets. Non-CLIP targets were also filtered for those whose 3’ UTR length was within 25% of the mean of 3’ UTR lengths in the set of CLIP targets. For similar CDF plots in which the expression of CLIP targets was examined in spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>), brain CLIP targets were filtered for those with FPKM ≥ 1 in either <italic>Norad<sup>–/–</sup></italic> or <italic>Pum2; rtTA3</italic> spleen and the presence of at least two PREs within 100 nucleotides of CLIP clusters in the target 3’ UTR. Non-CLIP targets were filtered as described above for brain to match expression level and 3’ UTR length to the set of CLIP targets shown in each plot.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantification of mitochondrial DNA</title><p>Total DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Briefly, cell pellets were lysed in RLN1 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5% NP-40, RNAse inhibitor), incubated on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged. The supernatant contained the cytoplasmic fraction, while the pellet contained the nuclear fraction. Both fractions were then subjected to RNA isolation and equal cell equivalents of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA were used in subsequent qRT-PCR reactions. All samples were tested for <italic>Norad</italic> as well as for <italic>Neat1</italic> (nuclear control) and <italic>Actb</italic> (cytoplasmic control). Because equal cell equivalents of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA were used in each reaction, the sum of the expression level of each transcript in the nucleus plus cytoplasm can be set to 100%, thereby allowing determination of the percentage of each transcript localized to each compartment. <italic>Neat1</italic> and <italic>Actb</italic>, respectively, showed the expected nuclear and cytoplasmic localization in each experiment, confirming successful subcellular fractionation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Fluorescent in situ hybridization (RNA FISH)</title><p>RNA FISH was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mito et al., 2016</xref>).

For these studies, one group of mice were given xylazine/ketamine anesthesia and euthanized by cardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by 5% glutaraldehyde (both in 0.1 M phosphate buffer). Tissue samples from brain and spinal cord were removed under a dissecting microscope. A second group of mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and their muscles were removed and further fixed in situ in 5% glutaraldehyde. These tissues were dissected into small blocks and processed for plastic embedding using standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sahenk and Mendell, 1979</xref>). Thick (1 µm) sections were stained with toluidine blue and selected blocks were sectioned and examined with an electron microscope (Hitachi H7650).

Mean neuronal densities of anterior horn areas per lumbar cord level were calculated.</p><p>Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme histochemistry was used to assess metabolic fiber type changes in the aging muscle. For this purpose, muscle fiber types were grouped into three categories: slow twitch oxidative (STO), fast twitch oxidative (FTO), and fast twitch glycolytic (FTG).

Two sections, 100 µm apart, were analyzed from each mouse. The anterior horn areas of each section were photographed at 10X magnification and the number of neurons with normal COX activity were determined. Counts from the hemicord anterior horn cell area with the higher number of neurons with normal COX activity was included in the analysis. Only cell bodies with an obviously visible nucleolus on the plane of the section and with a COX activity clearly above the background of gray matter were considered. The number of neurons with normal COX activity was counted per each section analyzed.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Chris P Ponting as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Igor Ulitsky (Reviewer #2). A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, Mendell and colleagues describe the generation and characterization of Norad-/- mice. NORAD was previously described as an abundant and conserved lncRNA, whose disruption in human cells results in genome instability through either increase in activity of Pumilio proteins in the cytoplasm or disruption of protein complex formation involving RBMX in the nucleus. In this new work, Norad-/- mice were generated, and shown to have a severe aging phenotype, which is accompanied by genome instability and mitochondrial defects, along with some changes in gene expression, which can be attributed in part to hyperactivity of the Pumilio proteins. Convincingly, mice with mild inducible transgenic over-expression of Pum2 are shown to recapitulate the Norad-/- phenotype, strongly arguing that Pumilio hyperreactivity is indeed responsible for the Norad loss-of-function phenotype.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) CLIP experiments.</p><p>A) Arguably the weakest part of the results is the changes observed in gene expression in the mouse brain, particularly Figure 3E, which shows deviations in both up-regulated and down-regulated genes, contrary to the expectation for mostly up-regulation of Pumilio targets. This is possibly because the authors select Pum targets based on CLIP data, which has the advantage of yielding &quot;experimentally defined&quot; targets, but biases towards more abundantly expressed genes (as those are likely to have more reads/clusters in CLIP data). What does Figure 3E look like if the authors define the targets based on presence of PREs in 3'UTRs (e.g., requiring at least 2 PREs)? An alternative would be to sample non-targets that have the same expression level distribution (and 3' UTR lengths) as the CLIP-defined targets and repeat the analysis. In any case, it is worth discussing how the changes observed in gene expression, at least in bulk tissue are very small (~5%) and occur in both directions. This is consistent with the studies in human cells, but still worth dwelling on in the Discussion section.</p><p>B) Another molecular phenotype the authors observe is increase in Pumilio target clusters based on eCLIP data. This analysis has two caveats – first, differences in quality of eCLIP libraries can result in differences in numbers of clusters etc. Can the authors show that the replicates of eCLIP from the same genotype (if performed) are similar to each other more than Norad+/+ samples to Norad-/- samples? Alternatively – is the PRE motif recovered equally strongly from Norad+/+ and Norad-/- libraries?</p><p>C) The other caveat with the eCLIP analysis is that the authors normalize the total number of eCLIP reads, and then compare the eCLIP/FPKM ratios between genes. This makes it difficult to interpret Figure 3D. To me, it shows that the reads become redistributed to clusters in the more abundant genes, rather than that target occupancy globally is indeed increased (it’s not clear to me that the latter can be shown with just eCLIP data, which have to be normalized somehow). First, why don't both curves reach 1 at the y-axis? Also, since the total number of reads is normalized, is this evidence sufficient to say that &quot;target occupancy was significantly increased&quot;? The authors should explain more thoroughly why this analysis is valid (I could be missing something), and how it supports the conclusion in the main text.</p><p>D) Related to (A) above. Is a PRE-dependent signature of Pum target repression evident in the MEF data (Figure 4)? If it is – it's worth showing in supplement. If not – worth discussing.</p><p>2) NORAD/RBMX.</p><p>Analysis of two other protein binding partners have been published for Norad/NORAD: SAM68 and RBMX. In particular, the interaction of NORAD with RBMX and its influence on the topoisomerase complex (Munschauer et al., 2018) is very convincing and accounts for the genome instability resulting from NORAD loss. Moreover, the topoisomerase complex is also implicated in mtDNA maintenance, similar to what the authors show in their work here. The authors briefly mention the NORAD/RBMX study in the Introduction, but curiously state that the role of this interaction for genome stability is unknown. The role of topoisomerases in genome stability is thus known and the authors need to discuss the NORAD/RBMX study in light of their own findings. There are, however, some discrepancies between these studies. Lee et al., and Tichon et al., found NORAD to be predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, while the NORAD/RBMX study find that NORAD is evenly distributed (smFISH and fractionation) between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. RNA-FISH data, if available, would resolve this issue.</p><p>3) PUM2 level in FLAG-tag experiment.</p><p>There is a surprising lack of PUM2 protein level change for the FLAG-tag PUM2 mouse experiment. This means that the authors' model is not definitive and they need to be more circumspect in their conclusions. (subsection “Enforced PUM2 expression phenocopies <italic>Norad</italic> loss of function”) The authors need to define how PUM2 is deregulated, if it is not overtly overexpressed. Otherwise, the models cannot be defined as such. One alternative hypothesis is that deregulated PUM2 RNA, but not protein, is required for the phenotype to be manifested. Do the authors have evidence that this is, or is not, the case? If not then they need to discuss alternative explanations, remove the word &quot;accordingly&quot; (Abstract), and insert further caveats to their conclusion that (subsection “Enforced PUM2 expression phenocopies <italic>Norad</italic> loss of function” and elsewhere) &quot;PUMILIO hyperactivity in Norad-deficient animals results in.…&quot; etc. The rare cell specificity of effect (Discussion section) is an attractive one but is not supported by evidence in the submission. Subsection “Enforced PUM2 expression phenocopies <italic>Norad</italic> loss of function”: The lack of alteration of PUM2 protein levels in these 7 tissues (even with the negative feedback mechanism) cannot be reconciled with the PUMILIO &quot;hyperactivity&quot; of the title.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42650.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) CLIP experiments.</p><p>A) Arguably the weakest part of the results is the changes observed in gene expression in the mouse brain, particularly Figure 3E, which shows deviations in both up-regulated and down-regulated genes, contrary to the expectation for mostly up-regulation of Pumilio targets.

As noted by the reviewers, our original analysis of expression of PUM2 CLIP targets vs. non-targets in <italic>Norad<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Norad<sup>–/–</sup></italic> brains simply compared all CLIP targets to all non-targets. To incorporate the reviewers’ suggestions, we first filtered the CLIP targets for those with at least 2 PREs in the 3’ UTR. However, this only marginally increased the apparent repression of PUM2 targets in <italic>Norad<sup>–/–</sup></italic> brain (not shown). On the other hand, the reviewers’ suggestion to sample non-targets with the same expression level distribution and 3’ UTR length dramatically improved the results. As shown in the new Figure 3D-E, when non-targets are filtered for those whose expression level and 3’ UTR length are similar to these parameters in the set of PUM2 CLIP targets, the results much more clearly show repression of PUM2 targets in <italic>Norad<sup>–/–</sup></italic> brain. In addition, we have expanded the discussion in the manuscript to introduce the concept that modest repression of a large set of PUMILIO targets can, in aggregate, produce a dramatic phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Another molecular phenotype the authors observe is increase in Pumilio target clusters based on eCLIP data. This analysis has two caveats – first, differences in quality of eCLIP libraries can result in differences in numbers of clusters etc. Can the authors show that the replicates of eCLIP from the same genotype (if performed) are similar to each other more than Norad+/+ samples to Norad-/- samples? Alternatively – is the PRE motif recovered equally strongly from Norad+/+ and Norad-/- libraries?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that comparing the absolute numbers of PUMILIO CLIP clusters between <italic>Norad<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Norad<sup>–/–</sup></italic> samples could be easily confounded by experimental variation. Therefore, we did not intend to make the point that there were significantly more clusters in <italic>Norad<sup>–/–</sup></italic> brain. We did not put forth this conclusion in the original text, although the original Figure 3C which showed the number of CLIP clusters in each genotype may have inadvertently implied that we were interpreting any apparent differences as meaningful. To avoid any confusion, we have removed this figure panel from the revised manuscript. The numbers of CLIP clusters in each genotype can be easily determined from Supplementary file 1 should a reader be interested in this information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) The other caveat with the eCLIP analysis is that the authors normalize the total number of eCLIP reads, and then compare the eCLIP/FPKM ratios between genes.

The authors should explain more thoroughly why this analysis is valid (I could be missing something), and how it supports the conclusion in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any confusion regarding this analysis. To generate this figure, we first normalized the number of CLIP reads in each library based on the total number of usable reads (uniquely mapped, non-PCR duplicates). We next calculated the average number of normalized CLIP reads in each 3’ UTR cluster between the two replicates that were performed for each genotype. For each PUM2 CLIP target, we determined the total number of clusters in the 3’ UTR and then summed the average number of normalized CLIP reads in each cluster to determine the total number of normalized CLIP reads per CLIP target. Because increased PUM2 binding (expected to occur frequently in the <italic>Norad<sup>–/–</sup></italic> condition) will likely result in reduced steady-state mRNA abundance, it is critical to normalize the apparent CLIP signal to the expression of the transcript. Therefore, we divided the normalized CLIP reads per target by FPKM (note that we are only considering targets expressed at or above 1 FPKM). These data were then used to generate the CDF plot in Figure 3C (previously Figure 3D). Importantly, this method of analysis has been used previously to estimate relative binding in CLIP data (Bosson et al., 2014) and we believe that it can provide a reasonable estimate of this parameter. To be as careful as possible, we have expanded our discussion of this result in the text to better describe how the analysis was done and to emphasize that it provided an estimate of relative CLIP signal that suggested increased PUM2 target occupancy in <italic>Norad<sup>–/–</sup></italic> brain. We have also added the Bosson et al., reference to the main text and Materials and methods section.</p><p>Regarding the question of why both curves do not reach 1 at the y-axis in Figure 3C of the current manuscript, we simply zoomed in on a narrower region of the x-axis to better highlight the difference between <italic>Norad<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Norad<sup>–/–</sup></italic> conditions, as is commonly done with these types of plots. The full plot is provided here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) for the reviewers.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-42650-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D) Related to (A) above. Is a PRE-dependent signature of Pum target repression evident in the MEF data (Figure 4)? If it is – it's worth showing in supplement.

Regardless, whether there is evidence of enhanced PUM2 target repression in these data is a valid question which we have addressed in the revised manuscript. Starting with the set of PUM2 brain CLIP targets identified in this study, we first determined which of these were expressed in spleen (FPKM ≥ 1). Because we were attempting to translate the targets identified in brain to a different tissue, we further filtered the CLIP targets for those that have at least two PREs (building off of a suggestion from the reviewers above). The expression of this set of PUM2 targets was compared to the set of non-targets with similar expression level and 3’ UTR length. The results, presented in Figure 4E of the revised manuscript, demonstrate statistically-significant repression of PUM2 targets in <italic>Norad<sup>–/–</sup></italic> spleen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) NORAD/RBMX.</p><p>Analysis of two other protein binding partners have been published for Norad/NORAD: SAM68 and RBMX. In particular, the interaction of NORAD with RBMX and its influence on the topoisomerase complex (Munschauer et al., 2018) is very convincing and accounts for the genome instability resulting from NORAD loss.

RNA-FISH data, if available, would resolve this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the <italic>NORAD</italic>:RBMX interaction is very interesting and we did not mean to diminish those findings. It is important to point out that the regulation of RBMX and PUMILIO by <italic>NORAD</italic> are not mutually exclusive and it is possible that this lncRNA performs both functions. We have therefore revised this section of the Introduction by describing the role of SAM68 in PUMILIO antagonism by <italic>NORAD</italic> and by emphasizing that the intriguing RBMX interaction suggests other functions for <italic>NORAD</italic> beyond regulating PUMILIO activity.</p><p>Despite these revisions, we still feel that it is appropriate and important to state that it has not yet been demonstrated that the <italic>NORAD</italic>:RBMX interaction is essential to maintain genomic stability. The basis for this statement is the fact that no experimental evidence exists showing that loss of the RBMX binding site in <italic>NORAD</italic> impairs <italic>NORAD</italic>’s ability to maintain genome stability. Alternatively, one could show a critical role for RBMX in the <italic>NORAD</italic> loss-of-function phenotype by performing genetic epistasis experiments, in which modulation of RBMX activity is shown to rescue the <italic>NORAD</italic> deletion phenotype. These types of experiments have not yet been performed. It is important to contrast this with the <italic>NORAD</italic>:PUMILIO interaction, for which it has been shown that PUMILIO depletion reverses the <italic>NORAD</italic> loss-of-function phenotype (Lee et al., 2016), providing strong genetic evidence for PUMILIO’s role in the <italic>NORAD</italic> pathway. Our purpose in making this statement is to provide as accurate a description of the state of the field as possible. Nevertheless, given that our findings reported here do not in any way address the role of RBMX in the <italic>NORAD</italic> pathway, we do not think it is appropriate to further address that work in this manuscript.</p><p>In addition, as suggested by the reviewers, we have performed further experiments to investigate the localization of <italic>Norad</italic> in mouse cells. RNA FISH in MEFs clearly shows a predominantly cytoplasmic localization (new Figure 1C), in agreement with the localization of the human transcript reported in Lee et al. and Tichon et al. We also performed additional fractionation experiments in a total of four mouse cell lines (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1C), which yielded results that perfectly agree with our RNA FISH data and show ~80% cytoplasmic localization of <italic>Norad</italic> (equivalent to <italic>Actb</italic> mRNA) in all cell lines tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) PUM2 level in FLAG-tag experiment.</p><p>There is a surprising lack of PUM2 protein level change for the FLAG-tag PUM2 mouse experiment. This means that the authors' model is not definitive and they need to be more circumspect in their conclusions. (subsection “Enforced PUM2 expression phenocopies Norad loss of function”) The authors need to define how PUM2 is deregulated, if it is not overtly overexpressed.

Subsection “Enforced PUM2 expression phenocopies Norad loss of function”: The lack of alteration of PUM2 protein levels in these 7 tissues (even with the negative feedback mechanism) cannot be reconciled with the PUMILIO &quot;hyperactivity&quot; of the title.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed a number of new experiments that have further documented the expression and activity of FLAG-PUM2 in our transgenic mouse lines and provide additional evidence that these animals indeed represent a model of PUMILIO hyperactivity. First, as noted by the reviewers, we posited that the inability to detect an increase in PUM2 levels in bulk tissue in transgenic mice may be due to the masking of transgene induction in specific key cell types due to the complex mixture of cell types in a tissue. To address this model, we isolated MEF lines from transgenic animals to interrogate whether transgene expression is detectable in a more uniform cell population. These results, provided in the new Figure 7—figure supplement 1B, clearly demonstrate robust induction of FLAG-PUM2 protein and a corresponding increase in total PUM2 levels in <italic>Pum2; rtTA3</italic> MEFs from both transgenic lines. Thus, transgene activation leads to PUM2 overexpression in specific cell types. To demonstrate that transgene activation leads to PUM2 hyperactivity in vivo, we went a step further by performing RNA-seq in spleens of <italic>Pum2; rtTA3</italic> animals. This revealed robust repression of PUM2 targets in mice with transgene activation (new Figure 7—figure supplement 1D). These results provide clear evidence of PUM2 hyperactivity in dox-treated <italic>Pum2; rtTA3</italic> mice.</p><p>In addition to the new data demonstrating PUM2 hyperactivity in cells and tissues from transgenic mice, we would also like to emphasize that these in vivo studies are complemented by our data derived from overexpressing PUM1 and PUM2 in human and mouse cell lines (new Figure 7; Figure 7—figure supplement 2; Figure 7—figure supplement 3). These studies show that overexpression of PUM1 or PUM2 protein impairs mitochondrial function, providing further evidence to support the conclusion that PUMILIO hyperactivity drives the observed phenotypes. These new data are also consistent with our previously reported finding that overexpression of PUM2 protein is sufficient to drive genomic instability in human cell lines (Lee et al., 2016). On the basis of this body of evidence, we feel that it is justifiable to refer to “PUMILIO hyperactivity” in the title.</p></body></sub-article></article>
