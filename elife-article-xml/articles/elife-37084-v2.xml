poorly understood. Here, we identify FBXL19 as a CpG island-binding protein in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and show that it associates with the CDK-Mediator complex. We discover that FBXL19 recruits CDK-Mediator to CpG island-associated promoters of non-transcribed developmental genes to prime these genes for activation during cell lineage commitment. We further show that recognition of CpG islands by FBXL19 is essential for mouse development. Together this reveals a new CpG island-centric mechanism for CDK-Mediator recruitment to developmental gene promoters in ES cells and a requirement for CDK-Mediator in priming these developmental genes for activation during cell lineage commitment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>CpG islands</kwd><kwd>CDK-Mediator</kwd><kwd>ZF-CxxC</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>lineage commitment</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>110286/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feldmann</surname><given-names>Angelika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koseki</surname><given-names>Haruhiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>098024/Z/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klose</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>681440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klose</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001255</institution-id><institution>Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klose</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ZF-CxxC protein FBXL19 recruits kinase-associated Mediator to CpG islands of silent developmental genes in embryonic stem cells, which primes these genes for activation during differentiation and is required for embryonic development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multicellular development relies on the formation of cell-type-specific gene expression programmes that support differentiation. At the most basic level, these expression programmes are defined by cell signaling pathways that control how transcription factors bind DNA sequences in gene regulatory elements and shape RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII)-based transcription from the core gene promoter (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>]). In eukaryotes, the activity of RNAPolII is also regulated by a large multi-subunit complex, Mediator, which can directly interact with transcription factors at gene regulatory elements and with RNAPolII at the gene promoter to modulate transcriptional activation. The Mediator complex functions through regulating pre-initiation complex formation and controlling how RNAPolII initiates, pauses, and elongates. Therefore, Mediator is central to achieving appropriate transcription from gene promoters (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allen and Taatjes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Malik and Roeder, 2010</xref>]).</p><p>In mammalian genomes, CpG dinucleotides are pervasively methylated and this epigenetically maintained DNA modification is generally associated with transcriptional inhibition, playing a central role in silencing of repetitive and parasitic DNA elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klose and Bird, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schübeler, 2015</xref>). Most gene promoters, however, are embedded in short elements with elevated CpG dinucleotide content, called CpG islands, which remain free of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bird et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Illingworth and Bird, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Larsen et al., 1992</xref>). Interestingly, mammalian cells have evolved a DNA-binding domain, called a ZF-CxxC domain, which can recognize CpG dinucleotides when they are non-methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Voo et al., 2000</xref>). This endows ZF-CxxC domain-containing proteins with the capacity to recognize and bind CpG islands throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Blackledge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thomson et al., 2010</xref>). There are 12 mammalian proteins encoding a ZF-CxxC domain, most of which are found in large chromatin modifying complexes that post-translationally modify histone proteins to regulate gene expression from CpG islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Long et al., 2013a</xref>). This has led to the proposal that CpG islands may function through chromatin modification to affect transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blackledge et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>One of the first characterised ZF-CxxC domain-containing proteins was lysine-specific demethylase 2A (KDM2A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Blackledge et al., 2010</xref>). KDM2A is a JmjC-domain-containing histone lysine demethylase that removes histone H3 lysine 36 mono- and di- methylation (H3K36me1/2) from CpG islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Blackledge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tsukada et al., 2006</xref>). Like DNA methylation, H3K36me1/me2 is found throughout the genome and is thought to be repressive to gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carrozza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keogh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Peters et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, it was proposed that KDM2A counteracts H3K36me2-dependent transcriptional inhibition at CpG island-associated gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Blackledge et al., 2010</xref>). Sequence-based homology searches revealed that KDM2A has two paralogues in vertebrates, KDM2B and FBXL19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Katoh and Katoh, 2004</xref>). KDM2B, like KDM2A, binds to CpG islands and can function as a histone demethylase for H3K36me1/2 via its JmjC domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farcas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">He et al., 2008</xref>). However, unlike KDM2A, it physically associates with the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) to control how transcriptionally repressive polycomb chromatin domains form at a subset of CpG island-associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farcas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). These observations have suggested that, despite extensive similarity between KDM2A and KDM2B and some functional redundancy in histone demethylation, individual KDM2 paralogues have evolved unique functions. FBXL19 remains the least well characterized and most divergent of the KDM2 paralogues. Unlike KDM2A and KDM2B, it lacks a JmjC domain and, therefore, does not have demethylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Long et al., 2013a</xref>). Previous work on FBXL19 has suggested that it plays a role in a variety of cytoplasmic processes that affect cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, TGFβ signalling, and regulation of the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wei et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, it has also been proposed to have a nuclear function as a CpG island-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2017</xref>), but its role in the nucleus still remains poorly defined.</p><p>Here, we investigate the function of FBXL19 in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and show that it is predominantly found in the nucleus where it localizes in a ZF-CxxC-dependent manner to CpG island promoters. Biochemical purification of FBXL19 revealed an association with the CDK-containing Mediator complex and we discover that FBXL19 can target CDK-Mediator to chromatin. Conditional removal of the CpG island-binding domain of FBXL19 in ES cells leads to a reduction in the occupancy of CDK8 at CpG islands associated with inactive developmental genes. FBXL19 and CDK-Mediator appear to play an important role in priming genes for future expression, as these genes are not appropriately activated during ES cell differentiation when the CpG island-binding capacity of FBXL19 is abolished or CDK-Mediator is disrupted. Consistent with an important role for FBXL19 in supporting normal developmental gene expression, removal of the ZF-CxxC domain of FBXL19 leads to perturbed development and embryonic lethality in mice. Together, our findings uncover an interesting new mechanism by which CDK-Mediator is recruited to gene promoters in ES cells and demonstrate a requirement for FBXL19 and CDK-Mediator in priming developmental gene expression during cell lineage commitment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FBXL19 is enriched in the nucleus and binds CpG islands via its ZF-CxxC domain</title><p>FBXL19 shares extensive sequence similarity and domain architecture with the other KDM2 paralogues which are predominantly nuclear proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Blackledge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farcas et al., 2012</xref>]), yet the function of FBXL19 has largely been described in the context of cytoplasmic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wei et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we first examined the subcellular distribution of FBXL19 to understand whether it was unique amongst KDM2 paralogues in localizing to the cytoplasm. To achieve this, we generated a mouse ES cell line expressing epitope-tagged FBXL19 (FS2-FBXL19) and carried out immuno-fluorescent staining. This revealed that FBXL19 was almost exclusively nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). When we carried out subcellular biochemical fractionation, FBXL19 was also enriched in the nuclear fractions in agreement with the immuno-fluorescent staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, FBXL19 was found not only in the soluble nuclear extract but also in the insoluble nuclear pellet, which contains chromatin-bound factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This suggested that FBXL19 may associate with chromatin, like other ZF-CxxC domain-containing proteins.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37084.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FBXL19 binds CpG islands genome-wide via its ZF-CxxC domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic illustrating KDM2 protein domain architecture.

To achieve this, we carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) for epitope-tagged FBXL19 and compared its binding profile with those we have previously generated for KDM2A and KDM2B in mouse ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farcas et al., 2012</xref>). A visual examination of FBXL19 ChIP-seq signal revealed that it was highly enriched at both computationally predicted CpG islands and genomic regions that contain BioCAP signal, an experimental measure of non-methylated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blackledge et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We then identified all non-methylated CpG islands (NMIs) using BioCAP data (n = 27698) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Long et al., 2013b</xref>) and extended our analysis across the genome. We observed that FBXL19 ChIP-seq signal at NMIs was highly similar to that of KDM2A and KDM2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, FBXL19 ChIP-seq signal correlated well with the density of non-methylated CpG dinucleotides in NMIs, similarly to KDM2A and KDM2B, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>), and almost all FBXL19-occupied sites fell within NMIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Together these findings demonstrate that FBXL19 is a nuclear protein that binds to CpG islands, an observation supported by a recent independent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>KDM2A and KDM2B rely on defined residues in their ZF-CxxC domain to recognize non-methylated cytosine and bind CpG islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Blackledge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farcas et al., 2012</xref>). To determine whether the association of FBXL19 with CpG islands is dependent on this domain, we generated ES cell lines expressing either a mutant version of FBXL19, in which a key lysine residue was substituted to alanine (K49A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) to disrupt the recognition of non-methylated CpGs, or a truncated version of FBXL19, where the ZF-CxxC domain was deleted (ΔCXXC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Importantly, the expression levels of wild type (WT) and mutant FBXL19 transgenes were highly similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We then carried out ChIP-seq for epitope-tagged FBXL19 in these cell lines and compared the binding profiles of the mutant FBXL19 to that of WT FBXL19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This revealed a near complete loss of FBXL19 binding to chromatin when the ZF-CxxC domain was deleted and a slightly less dramatic effect in the K49A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). Together, these observations demonstrate that binding of FBXL19 to CpG islands relies on an intact and functional ZF-CxxC domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>FBXL19 interacts with the CDK-Mediator complex in ES cells</title><p>Our ChIP-seq analyses demonstrated that FBXL19 is targeted to CpG islands in a manner that is highly similar to KDM2A and KDM2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Although KDM2A and KDM2B localise to the same genomic regions and show a high degree of sequence conservation, they associate with different proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farcas et al., 2012</xref>). This raised the interesting possibility that FBXL19 might also have unique interaction partners. To investigate this, we affinity-purified epitope-tagged FBXL19 from ES cell nuclear extract and identified associated proteins by mass spectrometry (AP-MS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). This revealed that FBXL19 interacts with SKP1, a known F-box-binding protein that also associates with KDM2A and KDM2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farcas et al., 2012</xref>), and the nuclear proteasome activator PSME3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wójcik et al., 1998</xref>). Interestingly, we also identified multiple subunits of the Mediator complex that appeared to interact with FBXL19 in a sub-stoichiometric manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Biochemical purifications of Mediator have identified two distinct assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mittler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Taatjes et al., 2002</xref>). The first is characterized by the presence of the MED26 subunit which associates with the middle region of Mediator and this form of the complex interacts with RNAPolII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Näär et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paoletti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, a kinase module, composed of CDK8/CDK19, MED12/12L, MED13/13L, and CCNC, can bind to Mediator in a manner which is mutually exclusive with MED26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Taatjes et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, our FBXL19 purification identified subunits of the kinase-containing Mediator complex (CDK-Mediator), but not MED26 or RNAPolII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This suggests that FBXL19 interacts preferentially with CDK-Mediator, however, we cannot exclude the possibly it may also interact with MED26-Mediator. CDK8 and its paralogue CDK19 share 77% amino acid identity (89% similarity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Audetat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Galbraith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsutsui et al., 2008</xref>) and four out of the five peptides identified by mass spectrometry were common between the two proteins (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that FBXL19 is able to interact with both CDK8- and CDK19-containing Mediator complexes. Importantly, interaction with CDK-Mediator was also evident when we performed affinity-purification of endogenous FBXL19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). However, reciprocal immunopurifications of MED12 and CDK8 failed to yield detectable FBXL19 by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This is in agreement with our mass spectrometry analysis, which indicated that the association of FBXL19 with CDK-Mediator is sub-stoichiometric, and suggests that this interaction is likely weak, as opposed to stable, inside cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37084.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>FBXL19 interacts with the CDK-Mediator complex in ES cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A heatmap representing the empirically modified protein abundance index (emPAI) of identified FBXL19-interacting proteins by affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS).

To do so, we transiently expressed full length FBXL19 or versions of FBXL19 with individual domains removed and performed affinity purification followed by western blot analysis. Intact FBXL19 and a version with the ZF-CxxC domain removed interacted with CDK-Mediator, whereas removing the F-box domain resulted in a loss of this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Therefore, FBXL19 relies on its F-box, and not its capacity to bind non-methylated DNA, for its association with CDK-Mediator.</p><p>Based on a candidate approach, it was recently reported that FBXL19 could interact the RNF20/40 E3 ubiquitin ligase in ES cells and regulate histone H2B lysine 120 ubiquitylation (H2BK120ub1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). In our unbiased biochemical purification of FBXL19, we did not identify an interaction with RNF20/40 by AP-MS or by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Furthermore, we failed to observe any relationship between the ability of FBXL19 to associate with CpG islands and the levels of H2BK120ub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Therefore, the relevance of this proposed interaction remains unclear.</p><p>FBXL19 contains conserved F-box and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. F-box proteins are known to function as scaffolds and substrate recognition modules for the SKP1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) protein complexes that ubiquitylate proteins for degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Skaar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Skowyra et al., 1997</xref>). Based on the association of FBXL19 with SKP1 and PSME3, we speculated that FBXL19 might function as a SCF substrate-selector for CDK-Mediator, as has previously been observed for the related F-box-containing protein FBW7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, however, in our FBXL19 purifications, we did not detect the SCF complex components CUL1 and RBX1/2, which are required for ubiquitin E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Skaar et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Nevertheless, we investigated in more detail whether FBXL19 might regulate CDK-Mediator protein levels. Treatment of ES cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which sequesters SCF substrates on their substrate selector, did not lead to elevated levels of Mediator subunits in FBXL19 purifications as identified by AP-MS (unpublished observation). In addition, transient overexpression of FBXL19 did not cause an appreciable reduction in CDK-Mediator protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Based on these observations, we conclude that FBXL19 does not function as a SCF substrate selector for CDK-Mediator. This raised the interesting possibility that FBXL19 may function in a proteasome-independent manner with CDK-Mediator at CpG islands.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>FBXL19 recruits CDK-Mediator to chromatin</title><p>It has previously been shown that transcription factors can recruit the Mediator complex to enhancers and gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Poss et al., 2013</xref>), yet the complement of mechanisms by which Mediator is targeted to chromatin remains very poorly defined. Given that FBXL19 does not appear to regulate CDK-Mediator protein levels, we hypothesized that it might instead function to recruit CDK-Mediator to chromatin. To test this possibility, we took advantage of a synthetic system we have developed to nucleate proteins <italic>de novo</italic> on chromatin and test their capacity to recruit additional factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>). Fusion of the Tet repressor DNA-binding domain (TetR) to FBXL19 allowed the recruitment of FBXL19 to a short array of Tet repressor DNA binding sites (TetO), engineered into a single site on mouse chromosome 8 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To determine whether FBXL19 was sufficient to recruit CDK-Mediator to chromatin, we stably expressed TetR or the TetR-FBXL19 fusion protein in the TetO array-containing ES cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We then carried out ChIP for CDK-Mediator subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Consistent with our biochemical observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), when we examined the binding of CDK8 and MED12 over the TetO array, we observed an enrichment in the TetR-FBXL19 line. Furthermore, binding of MED4, which is part of the core Mediator complex, was also evident at the TetO array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This suggests that FBXL19 may be sufficient to recruit a holo-CDK-Mediator complex, in keeping with its biochemical co-purification with multiple components of both the CDK module and core Mediator complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Importantly, stable expression of TetR-KDM2A and TetR-KDM2B did not lead to CDK8 recruitment, indicating that this activity is unique to FBXL19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Further work will be required to determine the dynamics with which individual Mediator components are recruited to chromatin by FBXL19 as well as the precise composition of such complexes.

This raised the interesting possibility that FBXL19 may help to recruit CDK-Mediator to CpG islands in ES cells. To examine this, we first performed CDK8 ChIP-seq in ES cells and compared it to FBXL19 ChIP-seq. Unlike FBXL19, CDK8 occupancy was not restricted to CpG islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), with only 67.5% of CDK8 peaks overlapping with NMIs and CDK8 binding showing a limited correlation with BioCAP signal (Spearman correlation – 0.48, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is in line with previous studies demonstrating that the Mediator complex is recruited to both enhancers and gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kagey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Malik and Roeder, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, however, we observed enrichment of CDK8 at FBXL19 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) with 89.4% of FBXL19 peaks overlapping with CDK8 peaks and NMIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>) raising the possibility that FBXL19 may contribute to its occupancy at these sites. To directly test this, we developed an ES cell system in which the exon encoding the ZF-CxxC domain of FBXL19 is flanked by loxP sites (<italic>Fbxl19<sup>fl/fl</sup>)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and which expresses tamoxifen-inducible ERT2-Cre recombinase. Upon addition of tamoxifen (OHT), the ZF-CxxC-encoding exon is excised, yielding a form of FBXL19 that lacks the ZF-CxxC domain (FBXL19<sup>ΔCXXC</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and can, therefore, no longer bind CpG islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This model cell system allows us to specifically examine the CpG island-associated functions of FBXL19 without affecting its other proposed roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wei et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). Following removal of the ZF-CxxC domain of FBXL19, we observed some reductions in FBXL19 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), but importantly CDK8 levels were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

Therefore, sites that rely on FBXL19 for normal CDK8 binding and correspond to silent developmental gene promoters are also bivalent.

We therefore set out to examine the relationship between FBXL19, CDK8 and gene expression in more detail.

Together these new discoveries reveal that CpG islands and FBXL19 can interface with CDK-Mediator to orchestrate normal gene expression during lineage commitment.</p><p>Previously, another F-box protein, FBW7, was shown to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate selector for the MED13/13L subunit of CDK-Mediator and to regulate its stability through proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis et al., 2013</xref>). By controlling CDK-Mediator abundance, one could envisage how this might shape Mediator function in gene expression. FBXL19 also encodes an F-box domain and associates with SKP1, a central component of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. However, we do not find evidence that FBXL19 regulates CDK-Mediator stability via the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Instead, we discover that FBXL19 can recruit CDK-Mediator to chromatin and, more specifically, to CpG islands via its ZF-CxxC domain to support gene activation. Although we currently do not know the defined subunits and surfaces in CDK-Mediator that FBXL19 interacts with, our biochemical experiments indicate that this relies on an intact F-box domain in FBXL19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that FBXL19 could interact directly with MED13/13L given their recognition by the related F-box protein, Fbw7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, a key observation in our work is that FBXL19 appears to have functionally diverged from other F-box proteins during vertebrate evolution by acquiring a DNA-binding domain that allows it to recruit proteins to chromatin, instead of targeting them for ubiquitylation. This general feature is shared with the FBXL19 paralogue, KDM2B, which associates with and recruits the PRC1 complex to CpG islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farcas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). In agreement with our observations, a large-scale proteomics screen previously suggested that an interaction between FBXL19 and Mediator may also exist in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tan et al., 2013</xref>). Given that CDK8 can function as an oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Firestein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morris et al., 2008</xref>), it will be interesting to understand whether FBXL19 plays a role in targeting CDK-Mediator to CpG islands in non-embryonic tissues, and whether this activity may promote CDK8-driven tumorigenesis.</p><p>Individual Mediator subunits have been shown to interact with DNA-binding transcription factors that recruit the Mediator complex to specific DNA sequences in regulatory elements and support gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Black et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Blazek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fondell et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Malik and Roeder, 2010</xref>). In part, Mediator is thought to achieve this by bridging enhancer elements to the core gene promoter and RNAPolII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allen and Taatjes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jeronimo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Petrenko et al., 2016</xref>). However, in mammals these proposed mechanisms are extrapolated from studying only a subset of transcription factors and genes. Therefore, the defined mechanisms that shape Mediator occupancy on chromatin remain very poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence for a completely new gene promoter-associated CDK-Mediator targeting mechanism that relies on FBXL19 and CpG island recognition. Surprisingly, although FBXL19 localizes broadly to CpG islands throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we only observed a reliance on FBXL19 for CDK8 binding at a subset of sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Similarly, KDM2B binds broadly to CpG islands, yet has a specificity in shaping PRC1 recruitment and polycomb repressive chromatin domain formation at a subset of developmental genes in mouse ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farcas et al., 2012</xref>). We have previously suggested that this could result from ZF-CxxC domain-containing proteins broadly sampling CpG islands, with their activity or affinity for certain sites being shaped by local gene activity or chromatin environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Klose et al., 2013</xref>). In keeping with these general ideas, FBXL19 is required for appropriate CDK8 binding at bivalent genes in ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). In future work, it will be important to understand whether this unique chromatin state and/or the absence of transcriptional activity at these sites define the requirement for FBXL19 in CDK8 recruitment, or whether FBXL19 targeting occurs at most CpG islands sites but is masked through redundancy with transcription factor and gene activity-dependent targeting modalities.</p><p>Historically, CDK-Mediator has been associated with gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akoulitchev et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elmlund et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hengartner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Knuesel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pavri et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we were not surprised to observe that CDK8 occupied the promoters of repressed developmental genes in ES cells. While abrogating the CpG island-binding activity of FBXL19 or deletion of MED13/13L resulted in reduced CDK8 binding at these sites, it did not lead to an appreciable effect on gene expression in the ES cell state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). This suggests that CDK-Mediator is not required for the repression of these genes in ES cells. Instead, these genes fail to properly activate during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These observations are in line with several reports that support the idea that CDK-Mediator is also involved in gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alarcón et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Donner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hirst et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Donner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Galbraith et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, in the context of mouse ES cells, we propose that CDK-Mediator may be required to prime silent developmental genes for future gene activation through a mechanism that relies on the recognition of CpG island promoters by FBXL19. This priming could contribute to gene activation during differentiation through one of the several mechanisms by which CDK-Mediator has been proposed to affect gene transcription, including regulating RNAPolII pre-initiation complex assembly, polymerase pausing/elongation, or through mediating long range interactions with distal regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allen and Taatjes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belakavadi and Fondell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Donner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Galbraith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kagey et al., 2010</xref>). Clearly, understanding the defined mechanism by which FBXL19-dependent CDK-Mediator recruitment supports normal gene activation during differentiation remains an important question for future work.</p><p>Our finding that FBXL19 can target CDK8 to gene promoters and that this is required to prime the expression of developmental genes during ES cell differentiation is conceptually reminiscent of recent work in yeast and human systems which suggested that CDK8 is required for appropriate re-induction of inducible genes following an initial activation stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">D'Urso et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, CDK8 was found to associate with the promoters of inducible genes following initial activation, even in the absence of appreciable ongoing gene transcription, thereby acting as a form of transcriptional memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">D'Urso et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, this requirement for CDK8 in normal gene activation appears shared in the context of our developmental gene induction paradigm. However, we find that, in the case of developmental genes, previous gene activation may not be required for the recruitment of CDK8. Instead, this could be achieved by FBXL19 directly recognising and targeting CDK8 to CpG islands. Therefore, we prefer to view this as priming as opposed to memory. Nevertheless, collectively these observations point to an important role for CDK-Mediator binding to gene promoters prior to activation and as a way of supporting subsequent gene induction. This provides new evidence that the roles of CDK-Mediator in gene regulation are more complicated than simply conveying activation signals to RNAPolII through recruitment by transcription factors and suggests the complex may have evolved to play a unique role in regulating gene expression in stem cells and during development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Mouse ES cells were cultured on gelatine-coated dishes in DMEM (Thermo Fisher scientific) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (BioSera), L-Glutamine, beta-mercaptoethanol, non-essential amino acids, penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher scientific) and 10 ng/mL leukemia-inhibitory factor. <italic>Fbxl19<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> ES cells were treated with 800 nM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma) for 96 hr in order to delete the ZF-CxxC domain.

Biological replicates were randomly downsampled to the same number of reads for each individual replicate and merged for visualisation. Bigwig files were generated using MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) and visualised using the using the UCSC Genome Browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Raney et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Peak calling was performed using the MACS2 function with the ‘-broad’ option using the biological replicates with matched input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Peaks mapping to a custom ‘blacklist’ of artificially high genomic regions were discarded. Only peaks called in both replicates were considered. Differential analysis of CDK8 binding was done using DiffReps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shen et al., 2013</xref>) and the called differential regions were overlapped with CDK8 peaks. Changes in binding of log2FC less than −0.5 or more than 0.5 with adjusted p-value below 0.05 were considered significant.</p><p>Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Love et al., 2014</xref>), version 1.6.3, with R version 3.1.1. Counts were quantified using the summarizeOverlaps() function in R in the mode ‘Union’ and inter.feature = FALSE. Genes with an adjusted p-value of below 0.1 and a fold change of at least 1.5 were considered differentially expressed. Statistical analysis was performed using two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test. Gene ontology analysis was done using DAVID 6.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang et al., 2009</xref>). For CDK8 differentially bound peaks, all CDK8 peaks were provided as background. For misregulated genes analysis, all RefSeq genes were provided as background. ATAC peaks were obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">King and Klose (2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Accession numbers</title><p>ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data from the present study are available to download at GSE98756.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editor and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to crystallize our concerns going forward. The work presented was deemed important and interesting but key issues reduced enthusiasm for the manuscript considerably. Given that these revisions are substantial and likely to take a significant amount of time, we are currently declining the present version of the paper. That said, if you feel you can successfully address all the concerns raised, we will be open to consider a revised submission, which would be treated as a de novo submission but sent to the same editors and, if possible, referees for re-assessment.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers considered the manuscript to be strong, reporting a thorough characterization of FBXL19, the least-well studied of three proteins that contain a ZF-CxxC domain. The authors demonstrate that over-expressed FBXL19 accumulates in the nucleus, and that a majority of its genome-wide binding is at sites associated with CpG islands. Affinity purification of FS2-tagged FBXL19 indicated a physical association with CDK8-containing Mediator complex, and a TetR-FBXL19 fusion protein was able to recruit CDK8 to a chromosomally-integrated artificial TetO array, suggesting that FBXL19 can recruit CDK8 to chromatin. Conditional deletion of the ZF-CxxC domain of FBXL19 led to reduction of CDK8 binding at CpG islands in ES cells. Many of these sites are associated with silent developmental genes that are no longer activated during ES cell differentiation in the FBXL19 mutants. Finally, deletion of the ZF-CxxC domain was shown to be embryonic lethal in mice. Together, these findings suggest that FBXL19 may prime developmental genes for subsequent activation during differentiation, possibly involving recruitment of CDK8. Overall, this represents an interesting finding and potentially a novel role for CDK8. However, concerns about the degree to which this represents a significant advance over previous FBXL19 studies, some missing controls, and a lack of a direct test of CDK8 requirement for expression of these genes resulted in lessened enthusiasm for this manuscript.</p><p>The reviewers discussed these concerns and summarized their critiques into the following points.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A key conclusion of the manuscript is that CDK8-Mediator is required for induction of developmental genes regulated by FBXL19, but this is actually not proven in the manuscript. The authors should deplete CDK8 (and/or CDK19, see comment #2 below) and test for the impact on induction of FBXL19-dependent genes.</p><p>2) Throughout the paper, the authors refer to CDK8-Mediator. Given that there are two paralog kinases associated with the Mediator complex, CDK8 and CDK19, the authors should test for the presence of CDK19 and clarify whether the interaction is exclusive to CDK8-containing complexes or not. In Figure 2A, are the CDK8 peptides identified unique to CDK8 or could they map to CDK19 as well? In Figure 2C, please add western blot for CDK19. As for point #1 above, is CDK19 required for control of FBXL19-regulated genes? Additionally, the authors should demonstrate that in the &quot;EV&quot; control lane, at the similar molecular weight, these candidate hits didn't show up in the cut gel, or at least with significantly less numbers of peptides.</p><p>3) If the ZF-CxxC mediates the interaction between FBXL19 and chromatin, then which functional domain(s) on FBXL19 bind to CDK8-Mediator complex? Lee et al., claimed that the F-box is critical for the interaction between FBXL19 and RNF20. Does the same protein structure bind to CDK8?</p><p>4) Most of the findings are based on overexpression of FBXL19 – what is the level relative to endogenous FBXL19? High-level over-expression could drive nuclear accumulation and other observations (including Figure 3). Authors should provide data demonstrating the degree of overexpression produced in the key experiments.</p><p>5) FBXL19 binding to CpG islands and its requirement in ES differentiation has been described previously: (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28453857) &quot;Our genome-wide target mapping unveils the preferential occupancy of Fbxl19 on CpG island-containing promoters […]&quot; &quot;Moreover, we reveal that Fbxl19 is critical for proper differentiation of ES cells […]&quot; With respect to this, the authors should clarify the novelty of their results presented in the current manuscript.</p><p>6) The conclusion that FBXL19 does not appear to regulate CDK8-Mediator levels is not fully supported by the data. Figure 2—figure supplement 1H needs to be repeated so that CDK8 bands are not over-exposed as there does appear to be a change in amount/mobility when overexpressed -/+ MG132. Furthermore, there seems to be a noticeable increase of MED12 protein upon FBXL19 overexpression, which was even more obvious when cells were treated with MG132.</p><p>7) In Figure 4, CDK8 recruitment has only been tested for the FBXL19 ZF-CxxC deletion -is this recapitulated for depletion of the whole protein? Given that Figure 4B appears to show a decrease in the levels of the deletion protein this is an important point to verify.</p><p>8) The authors need to show that OHT treatment of the delCxxC ES line leads to reduced binding of FBXL19 in conditions used for CDK8 ChIPseq -several genes would be ok -these same genes should be used to validate CDK8 CHIPseq signal.</p><p>9) Supplemental tables with differential gene expression results should be provided -or at least working gene lists used to reach the conclusions in the manuscript. Full GO enrichment results should be included as supplementary tables so that specific gene lists can be examined.</p><p>10) Various figure panels are missing statistical tests: Figure 4C needs statistical tests, e.g. KS/Wilcoxon -See Figure 4E; Figure 4G needs statistical tests; Figure 4H and 4I need boxplots and need statistical tests eg KS/Wilcoxon as for E/F; Figure 4H-J should include FBXL19-bound groups; Figure 6B,E,F need statistical tests.</p><p>11) It is very nice that the authors showed that genome-wide chromatin binding of FBXL19 was completely lost when the ZF-CxxC domain was deleted or mutated. To further confirm that it is indeed this ZF-CxxC domain mediating interaction with the non-methylated CpG islands, some controls are necessary. For example, in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, the authors showed that almost all of the FBXL19 binding sites are overlapped with NMIs locations, with only 93 exceptions. Then are the signals at these 93 sites also changed in the FBXL19 mutant ChIPSeq data? When the cell DNA methylation levels are modulated, will the binding pattern of FBXL19 changed accordingly?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;FBXL19 recruits CDK-Mediator to CpG islands of developmental genes priming them for activation during lineage commitment&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The revised manuscript by Dimitrova et al., is an excellent report describing the characterization of FBXL19, a member of the ZF-CxxC domain-containing family of proteins, and its role in recruiting CDK-Mediator to developmental genes in stem cells.</p><p>As for other members of this family, the authors show that FBXL19 recognizes unmethylated CpGs in a ZF-CxxC-dependent manner. Unlike the lysine demethylases KDM2A and KDM2B in this protein family, FBXL19 lacks a JMJ-C domain. Instead, the authors report that FBXL19 interacts with the CDK-Mediator complex. The authors then embark on an experimental tour-de-force to demonstrate that FBXL19 is required for recruitment of CDK-Mediator to a subset of genes containing CpG islands in ES cells, mostly genes involved in lineage commitment. Interestingly, these genes are transcribed at low levels in ES cells when bound by FBXL19 and CDK-Mediator, but their induction is compromised in the absence of FBXL19. This indicates that FBXL19-CDK8-Mediator is required to 'prime' these genes in ES cells and their subsequent induction upon differentiation stimuli. Finally, the authors demonstrate that FBXL19 depletion is embryonic lethal. Overall, the manuscript is very well written, and the data is of excellent quality.</p><p>This is a new submission of a paper that was originally reviewed by the same referees and found to be lacking data to support some of the key conclusions. The Senior Editor opened up the possibility of a new submission without a precise timeline and the authors have taken the opportunity to address the major concerns raised in the original review. The referees are now supportive of publication of a revised manuscript addressing the following issues:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In AP-MS (Figure 2A), what is the background value of emPAI? Are there any other FBXL19-interacting proteins that show significantly high levels of emPAI in the list? How significant are the components of CDK-Mediator complex represented in all the hits?</p><p>2) In Figure 3, the authors demonstrated that FBXL19 was able to recruit CDK-Mediator complex, such as CDK8 and MED12, to artificially designed chromatin regions. What about CXXC-domain or F-box deletion mutants in this assay?</p><p>3) In Figure 4B, it is not very clear which band(s) are exactly indicated as full-length FBXL19 and which one(s) are CXXC deletion? Why are there double bands? Did the author use T7 antibody to detect the endogenously introduced protein?</p><p>4) In Figure 4C, what proportions of each group of CDK8 binding sites overlap with FBXL19? In theory, the author expects to see that CDK8 sites showing binding intensity changes upon tamoxifen treatment would tend to overlap more with FBXL19.</p><p>5) In Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, please use a Venn Diagram to show directly the number of peaks of CDK8, FBXI19 and NMI overlapping with each other. This would be more straightforward.</p><p>6 In Figure 5, please perform the same GSEA or functional annotation analysis on genes that are associated with unchanged CDK8 binding sites upon FBXL19 CXXC-domain deletion.</p><p>7) In Figure 6B, what is the result for genes that are associated with increased CDK8 binding signals in FBXL19 CXXC-domain deletion mutant upon RA-induced differentiation?</p><p>8) In Figure 6C, even though the authors claimed that those upregulated genes (889) in FBXL19 CXXC-domain deletion mutant upon RA treatment were not involved in developmental processes, it is still interesting to find that significantly more genes were activated upon CXXC-domain deletion. What explanation can the authors provide for this finding?</p><p>9) In Figure 7, the authors claim that FBXL19 relies on CDK-mediator complex to activate the specific set of developmental genes. Is it possible to test this hypothesis in the FBXL19 CXXC-deletion system they established in Figure 6? In wild-type ESC, depletion of MED13 will have similar effects as FBXL19 CXXC deletion, whereas in FBXL19 mutant, the effects would be much alleviated?</p><p>10) In Figure 8, why did heterozygous deletion of FBXL19 CXXC-domain show even better developmental status than the wild type?</p><p>11) The authors demonstrated that the CXXC-domain mediates the binding of FBXL19 at NMIs, where F-Box mediates its interaction with the CDK-Mediator complex. What about CDK8 chromatin binding or gene expression patterns upon F-Box deletion of FBXL19? Will the authors see the same results as what they found in CXXC-domain deletion mutant?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37084.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A key conclusion of the manuscript is that CDK8-Mediator is required for induction of developmental genes regulated by FBXL19, but this is actually not proven in the manuscript.

To disrupt CDK-Mediator we have developed a new cell system to remove MED13 and its closely related paralogue MED13L (both of which are expressed in mouse ES cells) in an inducible manner. We chose to delete both MED13 and MED13L because they are thought to play an interchangeable role in physically linking the CDK subunits to the core Mediator and to be required to form an intact CDK-Mediator complex (Kuesel et al., 2009; Tsai et al., 2013). To achieve this, we exploited gene targeting to insert loxP sites around essential exons in both MED13 and MED13L. We also engineered these cells to express a tamoxifen inducible form of Cre recombinase allowing inducible deletion of MED13/13L (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). In new Figure 7, we demonstrate that the addition of tamoxifen leads to complete loss of MED13/13L protein. Furthermore, we show by ChIP that CDK8 no longer occupies its target sites. We then examined FBXL19 target genes after loss of CDK-Mediator binding and found that they are no longer appropriately induced during differentiation (Figure 7D), in keeping with a requirement for CDK-Mediator in FBXL19dependent gene activation. We thank the reviewers for suggesting this important experiment as it now robustly supports and strengthens our key argument that FBXL19 recruits the CDK-Mediator complex to the CpG islands of inactive developmental genes to prime them for appropriate activation during differentiation. We have now edited the text throughout the manuscript to reflect these important new observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2)Throughout the paper, the authors refer to CDK8-Mediator. Given that there are two paralog kinases associated with the Mediator complex, CDK8 and CDK19, the authors should test for the presence of CDK19 and clarify whether the interaction is exclusive to CDK8-containing complexes or not. In Figure 2A, are the CDK8 peptides identified unique to CDK8 or could they map to CDK19 as well? In Figure 2C, please add western blot for CDK19. As for point #1 above, is CDK19 required for control of FBXL19-regulated genes?</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated by the reviewer, CDK8 has a highly similar paralogue, CDK19. As suggested, we have now examined our mass spectrometry results in more detail to determine if we find any peptides that also map to CDK19. From this analysis, we have identified five different peptides covering CDK8/CDK19. Four are common to both CDK8 and CDK19, and one is unique for CDK8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). In our original submission, we had referred to an interaction between FBXL19 and the CDK8-Mediator complex given the identification of a peptide unique to CDK8. However, we agree that this was an oversight as one cannot exclude the possibility that FBXL19 also associates with CDK19-containing Mediator complexes. In fact, given that CDK19 is also expressed in mouse ES cells and is thought to function interchangeably with CDK8, it seems likely that FBXL19 will also interact with CDK19Mediator. Our CKD8 antibody uniquely recognises CDK8, but we have been unable to source an antibody that specifically recognises CDK19, limiting our ability to test whether CDK19 also associates with FBXL19. An antibody with specificity to CDK19 (Atlas antibody HPA007053) has previously been published, but this is currently unavailable, and the company informed us that this is due to a loss of specificity in new batches. Given that we cannot exclude the possibility that FBXL19 also associates with Mediator complexes containing CDK19, we have now added a sentence describing this possibly in the text as follows (subsection “FBXL19 interacts with the CDK-Mediator complex in ES cells”):</p><p><italic>‘</italic>CDK8 and its paralogue CDK19 share 77% amino acid identity (89% similarity) (Audetat et al., 2017) and four out of the five peptides identified by mass spectrometry were common between the two proteins (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that FBXL19 is able to interact with both CDK8- and CDK19- containing Mediator complexes.’</p><p>Furthermore, because the FBXL19-associated Mediator complex could contain either CDK8 or CDK19, we have edited the text throughout the manuscript to replace ‘CDK8-Mediator’ with ‘CDK-Mediator’. In future work it will be interesting to understand in more detail if CDK8- and CDK19-containing Mediator complexes have redundant or unique roles in gene activation during differentiation.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37084.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>CDK8/19 peptide sequences identified by mass spectrometry.</title><p>A CDK8 unique peptide is indicated in red.

This was to overcome the limitations inherent to cutting bands from SDS-PAGE gels and the isolation of tryptic peptides from gel slices. Importantly, we only considered a protein to be an FBXL19 interactor in our mass spectrometry analysis if it was absent from matched EV control purifications analysed using the same in-solution approach. It would have been beneficial to have described this approach in more detail in the initial submission, so we have now expanded our description of these experiments in the revised Material and Methods. Furthermore, we validated that CDK-Mediator components were not found in the ‘EV’ control purifications by Western blot analysis (Figure 2C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) If the ZF-CxxC mediates the interaction between FBXL19 and chromatin, then which functional domain(s) on FBXL19 bind to CDK8-Mediator complex?

To address this, we performed transient overexpression of FBXL19 followed by co-immunoprecipitation comparing wildtype FBXL19 with versions of FBXL19 in which individual domains had been removed. We found that deletion of the F-box largely disrupted the interaction with CDK-Mediator, while removing the ZF-CxxC domain had little effect on this interaction. We have included these new observations in the revised manuscript (subsection “FBXL19 interacts with the CDK-Mediator complex in ES cells”, Figure 2—figure supplement 1E). We also attempted to determine whether the LRR domain of FBXL19 was required for this interaction but unfortunately removing this portion of the protein seemed to render it unstable (unpublished observations) limiting our capacity to draw any meaningful interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Most of the findings are based on overexpression of FBXL19 – what is the level relative to endogenous FBXL19? High-level over-expression could drive nuclear accumulation and other observations (including Figure 3).

Despite exhaustive efforts we have been unable to generate an antibody that recognizes the endogenous protein in cellular extracts by Western blot. Therefore, we have been unable to directly compare endogenous FBXL19 protein levels to the FBXL19 levels in transgene containing lines. Nevertheless, we are confident in the conclusions from our key experiments. We have validated that endogenous FBXL19 is in the nucleus and interacts with CDKMediator. This was demonstrated by immunoprecipitating endogenous FBXL19 protein from nuclear extracts and using Western blot to show that FBXL19 associates with CDK8 and MED12 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D), consistent with our transgene experiments (Figure 2).</p><p>Given that we know FBXL19 is in the nucleus and interacts with CDK-Mediator, tethering experiments in Figure 3 were used to test if de novo targeting of FBLX19 to naïve chromatin would result in recruitment of CDK-Mediator. This showed that FBXL19 binding was sufficient to recruit CDK-Mediator (Figure 3B), in agreement with our observations that when the capacity of FBXL19 to bind CpG island chromatin is disrupted, CDK8 is no longer appropriately recruited to a subset of CpG island-associated target genes (Figure 4).</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37084.022</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Fbxl19 overexpression levels.</title><p>RT-PCR showing the expression levels of FS2-Fbxl19 relative to endogenous Fbxl19 in the empty vector (EV) control line.

It reported that FBXL19 occupied CpG islands and appeared to play a role in cellular differentiation. However, we would like to point out that, although our observations were similar with respect to these two points, the main discoveries resulting from our careful and systematic study are completely distinct from that of the published study. In direct contrast to the published work, we find no evidence for any connection between FBXL19 and RNF20 using unbiased biochemistry and mass spectrometry (Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1F). Furthermore, using our conditional genetic ablation strategies we do not observe any effect of FBXL19 loss on H2BK120ub1 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1G). Therefore, we are unable to reproduce the central findings of the published study. In our opinion this severely limits and brings into question the validity and, therefore, the novelty of the published work. Our observations likely differ from those of the NAR study because we use unbiased as opposed to candidate-based (guess work) biochemistry and conditional knockout strategies as opposed to stable knockdown cell lines that are prone to indirect and secondary effects due to the long-term culture necessary for their generation. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that the wording of the indicated sentences could have been more inclusive and contrasting of the published work and have clarified this in the revised manuscript (Introduction, Results section, subsection “FBXL19 interacts with the CDK-Mediator complex in ES cells” and subsection “Removing the CpG island-binding domain of FBXL19 results in a failure to induce developmental genes during ES cell differentiation”).</p><p>We would also like to take this opportunity to clarify the novelty of our study and the importance of its central conclusions. (1) By using unbiased biochemical approaches, we discover a link between FBXL19 and CDK-Mediator in mouse ES cells. (2) Using conditional genetic ablation, de novo targeting strategies, and genomics, we go on to show that FBLX19 can recruit CDK-Mediator to chromatin and the CpG island promoters of silent developmental genes in ES cells. (3) In the absence of FBXL19, these genes are no longer appropriately activated upon differentiation, providing an explanation for why normal differentiation cannot be achieved in the absence of FBXL19. (4) In the revised study, based on the reviewer’s suggestions (point 1), we now demonstrate that FBXL19 target genes also rely on CDKMediator for their activation, validating our biochemistry and genomics. (5) Finally, we discover that loss of FBXL19 leads to abnormal development and early embryonic lethality, in agreement with the inability of cells to appropriately regulate gene expression during development.</p><p>Therefore, our discoveries are novel in describing a completely new modality by which FBXL19 and CpG islands prime genes for future expression. Furthermore, we provide compelling new evidence that CDKMediator can be recruited to gene promoters independently of classical transcription factors and transcription itself to prime CpG island-associated genes for activation. These new discoveries force us, and the field, to think differently about how CpG islands integrate and regulate gene expression, while also provide new insight into the poorly understood mechanisms by which CDK-Mediator is targeted to genes and functions to control gene expression. We believe these important points are now more clearly framed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The conclusion that FBXL19 does not appear to regulate CDK8-Mediator levels is not fully supported by the data. Figure 2—figure supplement 2H needs to be repeated so that CDK8 bands are not over-exposed as there does appear to be a change in amount/mobility when overexpressed -/+ MG132. Furthermore, there seems to be a noticeable increase of MED12 protein upon FBXL19 overexpression, which was even more obvious when cells were treated with MG132.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated these experiments based on the reviewer’s suggestions. We again failed to observe any significant difference in CDK8 protein levels following FBXL19 over-expression at lower exposure levels. We agree it appeared that MED12 levels may have increased slightly when FBXL19 was overexpressed in original Figure 2—figure supplement 1G. However, we believe this is an artefact resulting from inefficient transfer on the left had side of the gel. MED12 is a large protein (250KDa) and we previously have encountered difficulties efficiently transferring MED12 to membrane for Western blot analysis. We have now optimised our transfer of large proteins and fail to see any significant or reproducible alterations in MED12 levels (Figure 2—figure supplement 1H). MED12 is known to be regulated by the proteasome in ES cells (e.g. Buckley et al., 2012). In agreement with this, we observe an increase in MED12 levels after MG132 treatment in both FBXL19 overexpressing cells and in the control cells transfected with an empty vector. This effect is therefore not related to FBXL19. Finally, we have also included in the revised manuscript a Western blot analysis of MED13 (which is also part of the CDK module) and again we observe no change in protein levels following FBLX19 overexpression (Figure 2—figure supplement 1H). We conclude that FBXL19 does not regulate CDK module protein levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 4, CDK8 recruitment has only been tested for the FBXL19 ZF-CxxC deletion -is this recapitulated for depletion of the whole protein? Given that Figure 4B appears to show a decrease in the levels of the deletion protein this is an important point to verify.</p></disp-quote><p>We reasoned that conditionally removing the ZF-CxxC domain would be the most surgical way of disrupting binding of FBXL19 to CpG islands, without interfering other potential functions of FBXL19. We agree that deletion of the ZF-CxxC domain appears to cause some reduction in FBXL19 protein levels. We speculate that FBXL19 may be more rapidly degraded if not bound to chromatin (something we have observed for other ZF-CxxC domain containing proteins). Importantly, CDK8 proteins levels are unaffected in the ΔCxxC-FBXL19 cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F). We have now carried out a biochemical purification of ΔCxxC-FBXL19 and shown that it still interacts with CDK8-Mediator (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E). Given that ΔCxxC-FBXL19 does not bind to CpG islands (Figure 1) yet still interacts with CDK8, we conclude that reductions in CDK8 recruitment at FBXL19 targets genes is most likely explained by the loss of FBXL19 binding to CpG islands. Nevertheless, we now draw attention to the reduced protein levels of the ZF-CxxC deleted protein as follows (subsection “FBXL19 is required for appropriate CDK8 occupancy at a subset of CpG island-associated promoters”):</p><p>‘Following removal of the ZF-CxxC domain of FBXL19, we observed some reductions in FBXL19 protein levels (Figure 4B), but importantly CDK8 levels were unaffected (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors need to show that OHT treatment of the delCxxC ES line leads to reduced binding of FBXL19 in conditions used for CDK8 ChIPseq -several genes would be ok -these same genes should be used to validate CDK8 CHIPseq signal.</p></disp-quote><p>All commercially available antibodies for FBXL19 that we have tried fail to ChIP FBXL19 and our exhaustive attempts to generate our own FBXL19-specific antibody that works for ChIP have been unsuccessful (two separate epitopes and 4 rabbits). This has precluded us from carrying out the proposed experiment. However, we do observe a uniform loss of FBXL19 binding when the ZF-CxxC domain is removed in epitope-tagged transgene experiments (Figure 1) suggesting that FBXL19 binding to CpG islands relies on an intact ZF-CxxC domain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Supplemental tables with differential gene expression results should be provided -or at least working gene lists used to reach the conclusions in the manuscript.

We then examined FBXL19, BioCAP and CDK8 enrichment in these groups (Figure 4—figure supplement 1I). As observed when we analysed all CDK8 peaks (Figure 4H-J), we found that CDK8 peaks that are bound by FBXL19 have increased levels of FBXL19, CDK8, and BioCAP signal when compared to sites not bound by FBXL19. Furthermore, sites that rely on FBXL19 for CDK8 binding have broader peaks of FBXL19 enrichment. This is consistent with the fact that these are large CpG islands with broad BioCAP signal (Figure 4F, 4H). The majority peaks that show reduction of CDK8 binding in FBXL19<sup>ΔCXXC</sup> ES cells with FBXL19 peaks (519/783) while there is only a small overlap between FBXL19 binding and sites with increased CDK8 binding (90/379).

To further confirm that it is indeed this ZF-CxxC domain mediating interaction with the non-methylated CpG islands, some controls are necessary. For example, in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, the authors showed that almost all of the FBXL19 binding sites are overlapped with NMIs locations, with only 93 exceptions. Then are the signals at these 93 sites also changed in the FBXL19 mutant ChIPSeq data? When the cell DNA methylation levels are modulated, will the binding pattern of FBXL19 changed accordingly?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now compared the enrichment of WT FBXL19 and ΔCxxC FBXL19 at these 93 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3A</xref>), which corresponded to regions that were not associated with NMIs and observed a loss of binding of ΔCxxC FBXL19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3B</xref>). Importantly, these same 93 sites also show some BioCAP signal, albeit at a level much lower than is observed at NMIs. This suggests that these sites are very weak CpG islands which were not captured in our NMI peak set due to their low Bio-CAP signal.</p><p>Furthermore, to illustrate the relationship between FBXL19 binding and CpG-rich non-methylated DNA, we have examined BioCAP and FBXL19 signal across all ATAC-seq peaks in the mouse ES cell genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3B</xref>). ATAC-seq peaks represent a combination of regulatory elements that are CpGrich (CpG islands) or CpG-poor (usually distal regulatory elements). This provides the necessary contrast to illustrate the correlation of FBXL19 tracks with sites that contain CpG rich non-methylated DNA (BioCAP), consistent with a FBXL19 binding modality that is dependent on its ZF-CxxC domain.</p><p>We have not been able to examine FBXL19 binding in cells with altered DNA methylation levels as this would require recreation of a DNMT1 (or DNMT3A/B) null situation in our transgene containing cell line (we don’t use 5aza-C for this purpose as it causes extensive DNA damage due to covalent adducts which are formed between DNA and DNMT enzymes). However, when we have previously examined DNA methylation-deficient cells and the behaviour of the closely related KDM2A/B proteins, which have nearly identical CpG island binding patterns to FBXL19 (Figure 1D and 1E), we demonstrated that KDM2A/B occupancy is completely dependent on recognition of CpG-rich non-methylated DNA (Blackledge et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2012).</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37084.023</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>(A) A Venn diagram showing the overlap between FBXL19 peaks and NMIs; (B) Metaplot analysis of enrichment of WT FS2-FBXL19, ΔCxxC FS2-FBXL19, and EV control at FBXL19-occupied NMIs (solid line) and nonNMI (dashed line) regions; (C) Heatmaps showing enrichment of BioCAP, WT FS2-FBXL19, ΔCxxC FS2FBXL19 and EV control at DNA accessible regions measured by ATAC-seq.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-37084-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In AP-MS (Figure 2A), what is the background value of emPAI? Are there any other FBXL19-interacting proteins that show significantly high levels of emPAI in the list? How significant are the components of CDK-Mediator complex represented in all the hits?</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify these points, we have now included a table in the supplementary information (Figure 2—source data 1) detailing the AP-MS results. This includes the biological replicate FS2-FBXL19 purifications and matched empty vector (EV) controls. We limited analysis of our AP-MS data to proteins that were uniquely identified in the FBXL19 purifications (i.e. not the EV control). We have included a column highlighting the proteins that were identified in this screen and their associated emPAI scores in Supplementary file 1. Importantly, Mediator components feature heavily in this table, which is what prompted us to examine CDK-Mediator as a possible interaction of functional relevance. We have yet to validate whether other proteins in this table are bona fide interactors and, therefore, their relationship with FBXL19 and its function is not known.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 3, the authors demonstrated that FBXL19 was able to recruit CDK-Mediator complex, such as CDK8 and MED12, to artificially designed chromatin regions. What about CXXC-domain or F-box deletion mutants in this assay?</p></disp-quote><p>In these experiments we purposely used a version of FBXL19 in which the CxxC domain has a single substitution mutation (K49A) that prevents CpG island binding. We designed the experiment in this way to prevent the TetR-fusion protein from binding to CpG islands throughout the genome. This allowed us to focus our analysis on the artificial nucleation site. Although we have not tested a version of FBXL19 with its CxxC domain deleted, we believe that it would function in a very similar way to the K49A mutant as both proteins are deficient in CpG island binding and we have shown that ΔCxxC-FBXL19 retains its interaction with CDK-Mediator (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E).</p><p>In all of our artificial tethering experiments we generate clonal stable cell lines expressing the TetR-fusion proteins to ensure uniform expression within lines and comparable expression across test lines. Despite exhaustive efforts, we have been unable to generate stable cell lines expressing FBXL19 lacking the F-box. We are unsure why this is the case but speculate that FBXL19 without the F-box may be unstable or lead to a dominant negative influence that affects cell growth (negative selection). Therefore, we have not been able to examine how the F-box deletion behaves in our tethering experiments. Given that ΔF-box-FBXL19 does not interact with CDK-Mediator in transient overexpression IP experiments (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E), we assume that CDK8 and MED12 would not be recruited to chromatin by TetR-ΔF-box-FBXL19. However, we have been unable to directly test this possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 4B, it is not very clear which band(s) are exactly indicated as full-length FBXL19 and which one(s) are CXXC deletion?

We observe ‘double bands’ for FBXL19 and speculate that this may be due to post-translational modification. The closely related KDM2A and KDM2B proteins are also extensively post-translationally modified leading to doublets when examined by Western blot. Following tamoxifen treatment of <italic>Fbxl19<sup>CxxCfl/fl</sup></italic> cells to remove the CxxC domain, we observe a reduction in mobility for these double bands (with the top band shifting to the previous position of the bottom band).

While roughly 41% of all CDK8 peaks overlap with FBXL19 peaks, the overlap of down-regulated CDK8 peaks is about 66%. This is highlighted in the text in subsection “FBXL19 is required for appropriate CDK8 occupancy at a subset of CpG island-associated promoters”. On the other hand, we observed that only 23% of up-regulated CDK8 peaks overlap with FBXL19 peaks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, please use a Venn Diagram to show directly the number of peaks of CDK8, FBXI19 and NMI overlapping with each other.

This is consistent with Mediator playing a role in gene transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Figure 6C, even though the authors claimed that those upregulated genes (889) in FBXL19 CXXC-domain deletion mutant upon RA treatment were not involved in developmental processes, it is still interesting to find that significantly more genes were activated upon CXXC-domain deletion. What explanation can the authors provide for this finding?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a significant number of genes were more activated in the <italic>Fbxl19<sup>ΔCxxC</sup></italic> cells compared to wild type cells upon RA-induced differentiation and that this is potentially interesting. We have yet to find a compelling molecular explanation to link FBXL19 directly to these effects on gene expression. It remains possible that these gene expression changes are due to secondary transcriptional defects that manifest when cells attempt to execute a new expression programme in the absence of normal activation of silent, lineage commitment-associated genes when FBXL19 is not functional, or that FBXL19 plays other, as yet unidentified, roles in inhibiting gene expression. We have now added a sentence drawing attention to these points in the revised manuscript in subsection “Removing the CpG island-binding domain of FBXL19 results in a failure to induce developmental genes during ES cell differentiation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In Figure 7, the authors claim that FBXL19 relies on CDK-mediator complex to activate the specific set of developmental genes. Is it possible to test this hypothesis in the FBXL19 CXXC-deletion system they established in Figure 6? In wild-type ESC, depletion of MED13 will have similar effects as FBXL19 CXXC deletion, whereas in FBXL19 mutant, the effects would be much alleviated?</p></disp-quote><p>One could test whether inducible MED13/13L deletion in the <italic>Fbxl19<sup>CxxCfl/fl</sup></italic> background would not lead to any further effect on gene activation. However, this would require a significant amount of time to generate and characterise a new <italic>Med13<sup>fl/fl</sup>, Med13l<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, and <italic>Fbxl19<sup>CxxCfl/fl</sup> </italic>cell line. While this is an interesting experiment, we believe that the robust and extensive series of observations in Figure 6 and Figure 7 more than adequately support our conclusion that FBXL19 target genes rely on CDK-Mediator for activation during differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In Figure 8, why did heterozygous deletion of FBXL19 CXXC-domain show even better developmental status than the wild type?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not observed any significant difference between WT and heterozygous mutant embryos. It is common to have some stage variations until around 12 dpc, even within embryos of the same litter.

Will the authors see the same results as what they found in CXXC-domain deletion mutant?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting experiment and we hypothesize that disrupting the interaction between CDK-Mediator and FBXL19 via deleting the F-box domain would yield similar results to removing the CxxC domain. However, as described above in response to reviewer point 2, despite exhaustive efforts we have been unable to generate cell lines stably expressing FBXL19 with a deletion of the F-box, precluding us from addressing this point. It will be interesting in future work to see if we can engineer a cell line where we are able to remove the F-box in an inducible manner and examine the effects on CDK8 binding and induction of gene expression.</p></body></sub-article></article>
