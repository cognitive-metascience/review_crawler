size needed to sustain functionality. Breathing-related interneurons of the brainstem pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) that putatively comprise the core respiratory rhythm generator in mammals are derived from <italic>Dbx1</italic>-expressing precursors. Here, we show that selective photonic destruction of Dbx1 preBötC neurons in neonatal mouse slices impairs respiratory rhythm but surprisingly also the magnitude of motor output; respiratory hypoglossal nerve discharge decreased and its frequency steadily diminished until rhythm stopped irreversibly after 85±20 (mean ± SEM) cellular ablations, which corresponds to ∼15% of the estimated population. These results demonstrate that a single canonical interneuron class generates respiratory rhythm and contributes in a premotor capacity, whereas these functions are normally attributed to discrete populations. We also establish quantitative cellular parameters that govern network viability, which may have ramifications for respiratory pathology in disease states.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03427.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03427.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03427.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our first breath, moments after we are born, is the result of a pattern of activity in our brain that started in the embryo and will continue almost effortlessly until we die. Like other rhythmic activities, such as walking and swimming, breathing originates from circuits of neurons in the brain that generate patterns. These circuits pass messages to other cells that translate them into the physical movements required to take a breath. Interrupting these patterns by injury or illness can lead to breathing disorders or cause death.</p><p>Previous studies have identified a class of neuron, which all express a specific gene, that is necessary for breathing. Mice born without this class of cell failed to ever take a breath and died at birth. These neurons are found in part of the brainstem and can continue to generate rhythm even when this section of the brainstem is removed from newborn mice and cut into very thin slices. However, it is unclear how many of these neurons are needed to maintain a breathing rhythm.</p><p>Wang et al. used a laser to destroy the breathing rhythm-generating neurons in these slices one at a time and found that the rhythm of breathing in (i.e., inspiration) stopped after ∼15% of the neurons were destroyed. This suggests that a high percentage of these neurons must be maintained for breathing to continue normally.</p><p>Wang et al. also discovered that destroying the rhythm-generating neurons reduced the strength of the signals sent from the brainstem to trigger the movements that cause breathing in. This suggests that the same class of neurons also sends messages to the muscles involved in breathing; it was previously thought that a separate class of cell in the same part of the brain sent these messages.</p><p>Studies involving live animals are now needed to confirm the results. If confirmed, the findings may be used to develop new treatments for a number of breathing disorders. Medications that boost the signals sent to the muscles by these neurons might be useful for treating sleep apnea. Wang et al. also suggest that medications that boost rhythm generation might be useful for premature infants with breathing difficulties and people with drug-induced breathing problems. Moreover, finding ways to maintain breathing rhythms with fewer of these neurons may help those with neurodegenerative disorders, which cause cells in the brain to be lost.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03427.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03427.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>respiration</kwd><kwd>breathing</kwd><kwd>central pattern generator</kwd><kwd>two-photon microscopy</kwd><kwd>preBötzinger complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL104127</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Hanbing</given-names></name><name><surname>Kottick</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name><name><surname>Vann</surname><given-names>Nikolas C</given-names></name><name><surname>Picardo</surname><given-names>Maria Cristina D</given-names></name><name><surname>Akins</surname><given-names>Victoria T</given-names></name><name><surname>Del Negro</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS070056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xueying</given-names></name><name><surname>Hayes</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name><name><surname>Del Negro</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RES0018140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Revill</surname><given-names>Ann L</given-names></name><name><surname>Funk</surname><given-names>Gregory D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Laser-ablating neurons of a single genetic class reveals that Dbx1-derived interneurons comprise core respiratory rhythmogenic and premotor circuits and provides quantitative cellular parameters that govern network functionality</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Central pattern generator (CPG) circuits give rise to common behaviors such as swimming, walking, and breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grillner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grillner and Jessell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kiehn, 2011</xref>). To understand the cellular origins of these behaviors, key problems are to identify the rhythmogenic and premotor populations, and then quantify the requisite number of neurons to sustain functionality. We address these issues in the mammalian breathing CPG by cumulatively ablating a genetically identified interneuron population hypothesized to form the rhythmogenic core while monitoring effects on network output in real time.</p><p>The brainstem pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) putatively drives inspiratory breathing rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moore et al., 2013</xref>). These rhythms persist in reduced slice preparations that retain the preBötC and can be monitored via respiratory hypoglossal (XII) nerve discharge, providing a powerful in vitro model of breathing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lieske et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koizumi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Funk and Greer, 2013</xref>). Rhythmogenic preBötC interneurons are distinguished by glutamatergic transmitter phenotype or the expression of neuropeptides and peptide receptors, or their intersection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Funk et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gray et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guyenet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stornetta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wallén-Mackenzie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tan et al., 2008</xref>). Glutamatergic, peptidergic, and peptide receptor-expressing preBötC interneurons develop from a common set of precursors that express the homeobox gene <italic>Dbx1</italic> during embryonic development. <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived interneurons (hereafter Dbx1 neurons) in perinatal mice are inspiratory modulated, and <italic>Dbx1</italic>-null mice die at birth without ever breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Picardo et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we—and others—proposed that Dbx1 preBötC neurons comprise the core inspiratory rhythm generator, i.e., the Dbx1 core hypothesis.</p><p>Previously, we estimated the cellular mass critical for respiratory rhythm generation by laser-ablating preBötC inspiratory interneurons identified by Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. The destruction of ∼120 rhythmic neurons irreversibly stopped respiratory rhythmogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayes et al., 2012</xref>). However, inspiratory-modulated preBötC neurons may be excitatory or inhibitory. Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence changes cannot differentiate rhythmogenic glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Funk et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wallén-Mackenzie et al., 2006</xref>) from GABA- or glycinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuwana et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Winter et al., 2009</xref>), which influence sensory integration and coordinated patterns of muscle contraction for respiratory behaviors, but are non-rhythmogenic because inspiratory rhythms in vivo and in vitro do not require synaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feldman and Smith, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brockhaus and Ballanyi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuwana et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ren and Greer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujii et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Janczewski et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we predicted that the selective destruction of Dbx1 preBötC neurons, which are predominantly glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2010</xref>)—unlike locomotor Dbx1 neurons in lumbar spinal cord of which ∼70% express inhibitory transmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lanuza et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Talpalar et al., 2013</xref>)—would impair rhythmogenesis with a cell-ablation tally much lower than 120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayes et al., 2012</xref>). To test this prediction of the Dbx1 core hypothesis, we used photonics to map the positions of Dbx1 preBötC neurons, and then laser ablated them—one cell at a time—while continuously monitoring respiratory motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). As predicted, cumulative destruction of Dbx1 preBötC neurons progressively decreased respiratory frequency until rhythm ceased after ablation of ∼85 neurons. Surprisingly, cumulative Dbx1 cellular ablations also diminished the amplitude of respiratory XII nerve discharge, suggesting that Dbx1 preBötC neurons also influence motor output. In simulations that assign only rhythm-generating function to preBötC neurons, cumulative ablations decreased frequency and stopped rhythmogenesis but at much lower tallies and without perturbing the output amplitude. These ablation results and model-experiment discrepancies, combined with antidromic activation from the XII nucleus and axonal projection patterns, ascribe rhythm-generating and premotor roles to Dbx1 preBötC neurons. Thus, we demonstrate that one cardinal class of hindbrain interneurons serves two distinct roles in a key mammalian CPG; the data further establish quantitative cellular parameters that minimally ensure network functionality.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ablation of Dbx1 preBötC neurons precludes rhythmogenesis</title><p>Dbx1 neurons were detected and mapped within the preBötC, and then laser ablated individually, in sequence, while monitoring respiratory network functionality via XII motor nerve output. Experiments began with an ‘initialization phase’ that defined the domain for detection and ablation, which was bilateral. We used a <italic>Dbx1</italic> Cre-driver line (<italic>Dbx1</italic><sup><italic>CreERT2</italic></sup>) coupled with floxed reporter mice (<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor</italic><sup><italic>flox-stop-tdTomato</italic></sup>) to locate Dbx1 neurons via fluorescence. Viewed in the transverse plane of slices that expose the preBötC at their surface (i.e., preBötC-surface slices), Dbx1 neurons form a bilaterally symmetrical V-shape starting dorsally at the border of the XII motor nuclei and continuing ventrolaterally to the preBötC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Dorsally, the preBötC adjoins the semi-compact division of the nucleus ambiguus (scNA); the ventral border of the preBötC is orthogonal to the dorsal boundary of the principal sub-nucleus of the inferior olive (IOP<sub>loop</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruangkittisakul et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52a">2014</xref>). These spatial relationships visible in bright field or epifluorescence allow us to pinpoint the preBötC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At the cellular level, identifying putative rhythmogenic neurons on the basis of fluorescent protein expression alone is acceptable because the overwhelming majority of Dbx1 preBötC neurons are inspiratory (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Picardo et al., 2013</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03427.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dbx1 preBötC neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bright field (left) and fluorescence (right) images of the right half of a preBötC-surface slice preparation.

Nonetheless, an alternative explanation could involve the loss of excitatory drive (rather than destruction of CPG core circuitry). Dbx1 preBötC neurons express neurokinin-1 peptide receptors (NK1Rs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2010</xref>) that stimulate respiratory rhythmogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gray et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pagliardini et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballanyi and Ruangkittisakul, 2009</xref>). Monoaminergic and peptidergic raphé neurons project to, and receive feedback projections from, the preBötC to elevate excitability in the respiratory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ptak et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, laser ablation in the preBötC could break the link with the raphé and thus diminish excitatory drive. To test that idea, we exposed the lesioned preBötC to a bolus of neuropeptide substance P (SP, 1 mM) after the respiratory cycle period exceeded 120 s, which we previously determined was a reliable benchmark of a slice that would cease rhythmic function within 5–10 min without pharmacological intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayes et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>First, as a control, we applied SP to unlesioned preBötC-surface slices, which transiently increased respiratory frequency, i.e., lowered the cycle period from 4.7 s (SD 0.8 s, SEM 0.1 s) to 3.3 s (SD 0.5 s, SEM 0.1 s, average period computed for 25 cycles), and then equilibrated in 21 min (SD 4 min, SEM 2 min, <italic>n</italic> = 4 slices) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The regularity score was ∼1 throughout the bout, which is consistent with the stable rhythm expected in unlesioned slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Then, SP was injected into five preBötC-surface slices wherein the cumulative laser ablation of Dbx1 neurons caused 120 s of quiescence. SP transiently revived respiratory rhythm; the average cycle period was 1.7 s (SD 0.4 s, SEM 0.2 s, computed for 10 cycles after SP bolus injection) but the cycle period slowed down rapidly, surpassing the control period previously measured during the detection phase (4.7 s) within 3 min (SD 2 min, SEM 1 min). Cycle period continuously lengthened and fluctuated from cycle to cycle, and then the rhythm stopped altogether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Judged on the basis of equilibration time, the transient effects of SP were significantly briefer in lesioned slices (p=0.02, Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test). Furthermore, lesioned slices ultimately fell inexorably silent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig5">Figures 2A and 5C</xref>), whereas unlesioned slices maintained rhythmicity for 4–6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

If focal stimulation evoked EPSPs (not spikes) then the raster reports ‘EPSPs’; spikes are indicated by short vertical lines. From left to right, the number of stimulated units increments by one; five (or more) units evoked an inspiratory-like burst. A running-time histogram of network activity is shown at the bottom.

From the start to finish, the cumulative ablation sequence caused no major change in local metrics including cluster coefficient, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality. Global connectivity metrics such as the K-core, which has been applied to analyze rhythmic neural systems including the preBötC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwab et al., 2010</xref>), showed only modest changes that were incommensurate with the large changes in frequency observed in experiments and simulations. The number of strongly connected components in the model networks did not depart from unity, thus the underlying graph was not fractured and every constituent interneuron could be reached via a finite number of synaptic links from every other interneuron, even after the rhythm stopped. These calculations show that these relatively low numbers of cumulative cellular ablations do not disconnect or disintegrate the core CPG, which suggests that a breakdown in network structure cannot explain the impairment and cessation of rhythmic function. The alternative is that neurons and synapses confer non-linear functional properties to the underlying rhythmic system that are not captured by the graph connectivity alone (see ‘Discussion’).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Dbx1 preBötC neurons with premotor function</title><p>Lower cell ablation tallies perturbed and stopped the rhythm in simulations, and the aggregate burst magnitude did not decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We affirm this hypothesis using cell-specific, cumulative laser ablation experiments, which also help quantify the size of the Dbx1 preBötC population needed to defend inspiratory rhythmogenic function. Additionally, we provide unanticipated new evidence that Dbx1 preBötC neurons also serve in a premotor capacity. While the existence of Dbx1 premotor neurons in the preBötC is not a straightforward prediction of the Dbx1 core hypothesis, it does not contradict it. We propose that an inspiratory rhythmogenic core population co-localizes with a subpopulation of premotor neurons, and both have the same developmental-genetic lineage related to Dbx1. These results help elucidate the rhythmogenic and premotor components of a key mammalian CPG, and furthermore provide quantitative parameters that govern its functionality.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Photonic interrogation of CPG structure and function</title><p>Two-photon lasers can destroy cells of a well-defined class with minimal damage to surrounding tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eklöf-Ljunggren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we use this technique to study the contribution of Dbx1 neurons in slices that capture essential components of the breathing CPG and generate measurable motor nerve output. Target detection relies on native fluorescent protein expression. An overwhelming majority of Dbx1 neurons in the ventral medulla have a glutamatergic transmitter phenotype and inspiratory modulated firing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Picardo et al., 2013</xref>), so the Cre/lox Dbx1 reporter system is a reliable means to identify neurons with inspiratory function and target them for laser ablation.</p><p><italic>Dbx1</italic> is also expressed in rostral parts of the ventral respiratory column between the caudal pole of the facial nucleus and the preBötC along the anterior–posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray, 2013</xref>). The ventral respiratory column contains auxiliary inspiratory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ballanyi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes et al., 2007</xref>), which served as a control population. Laser ablating these neurons that do not have significant rhythmogenic function facilitates a comparative analysis of Dbx1 neuron ablations at the level of the preBötC. Laser ablation of Dbx1 neurons in the ventral respiratory column had a minor effect on XII motor output amplitude and negligible effects on frequency and regularity. These negative results show that laser–tissue interactions are not generally deleterious for respiratory function in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eklöf-Ljunggren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Dbx1 preBötC neurons form the inspiratory rhythmogenic core</title><p>Periodicity is the hallmark feature of an oscillator.

These data strengthen the proposal that Dbx1 neurons comprise the core inspiratory rhythm generator, which was originally based on <italic>Dbx1</italic> knockout mice that fail to breathe at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pierani et al., 2001</xref>), and an array of neuroanatomical and physiological criteria including glutamatergic transmitter phenotype, the expression of peptides and peptide receptors, strong inspiratory rhythmic phenotype, and the ability to synchronize the preBötC bilaterally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Picardo et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We previously laser-ablated rhythmic preBötC neurons identified by Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging.

The interpretability of these experiments suffered two caveats: the rhythm stopped after a delay of ∼30 min following the final target ablation, and furthermore, the transmitter phenotype of the ablated targets was unknown. In this study, use of the <italic>Dbx1</italic> Cre-driver line ensured that the target neurons were glutamatergic, a requisite characteristic for respiratory rhythmogenic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Funk et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ge and Feldman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wallén-Mackenzie et al., 2006</xref>). And here, destroying an average of 85 Dbx1 neurons stopped the XII motor rhythm in the midst of the ablation phase, before exhausting the target list, which suggests a more direct impact on the core rhythmogenic circuit. We cannot rule out the possibility that subsets of preBötC neurons generate ‘burstlets’ observable in local field recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>). However, there is no collective inspiratory motor output after sequential laser ablation of Dbx1 preBötC interneurons, which indicates that the CPG is nonfunctional. Here, the debilitating effects on respiratory rhythm generation at a much lower ablation tally suggest that the preBötC core in vitro is very sensitive to the loss of just a few constituent interneurons (i.e., &lt;100). This sensitivity to neuron loss may be accentuated in reduced slice preparations lacking excitatory and neuromodulatory drive from the rostral medulla and pons, as well as peripheral chemosensory and mechanosensory feedback via the vagus nerve. Extrinsic sources of drive raise preBötC network excitability and enhance respiratory rhythm. An acute sensitivity to neuron loss, such as we report for slices, may not apply to the preBötC network in vivo, but this remains to be tested via quantitative cellular ablation experiments with physiological monitoring in intact animal models.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Parameters of the preBötC rhythmogenic core</title><p>We detected an average of 705 Dbx1 target cells in preBötC-surface slices, but we conclude that a significant number were non-rhythmogenic. Some fraction of the detected targets can be discounted as <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived non-rhythmogenic glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2010</xref>). However, more significantly, some fraction manifests premotor function. The present evidence for premotor function in Dbx1 preBötC neurons with verified inspiratory discharge patterns (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figures 7 and 8D–F</xref>) is consistent with large-scale pressure ejections of biocytin in the preBötC region of another strain of <italic>Dbx1</italic>-reporter mice (<italic>Dbx1</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic></sup> knock-in), which labeled many midline-crossing axons as well as axons projecting to the XII nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>). Even 20 years ago it was recognized that a fraction of the excitatory neurons in the preBötC, and immediately dorsal to preBötC, had premotor functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Funk et al., 1993</xref>). Because laser ablations in preBötC-surface slices decreased XII magnitude (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2A and 3A</xref>), we propose that a non-negligible fraction of the ablated Dbx1 neurons were inspiratory modulated but non-rhythmogenic, and most likely constitute XII premotor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peever et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chamberlin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koizumi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Volgin et al., 2008</xref>). This scenario explains why there was a decline in XII motor output in experiments (deletion of Dbx1 premotor neurons causes motor output to decline) that was not mimicked by model simulations of a pure rhythmogenic circuit. It also explains why sequential ablations in simulations perturbed and stopped the rhythm at much lower cell ablation tallies; a significant fraction of the photonically ablated Dbx1 neurons were unrelated to rhythmogenesis per se.</p><p>Although we lack quantitative certainty, if we assume that each of the two caveats above (i.e., the existence of Dbx1 glia and premotor neurons) explains ∼10% of the detected targets, then the size of the essential preBötC core would be <italic>N</italic> = 705 – 2 [0.1 (705)] = 564, which is remarkably close to the estimate of ∼600 from adult rat studies that enumerated the population size based on NK1R expression in the preBötC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">1999</xref>). In our previous laser ablation study, we estimated population size to be ∼325 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayes et al., 2012</xref>), which probably underestimates the population size because incomplete fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> dye loading in slices precludes the detection of a significant fraction of the rhythmogenic preBötC network.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Physiological significance</title><p>Our data suggest that the preBötC contains rhythmogenic and premotor interneurons that both develop from <italic>Dbx1</italic>-expressing precursors.

In that regard, Dbx1 preBötC neurons appear to have more in common with excitatory Shox2 interneurons of the lumbar spinal cord (a subset of V2 interneurons), which contribute to locomotor rhythm generation and premotor circuits downstream of the rhythm-generating core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dougherty et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The present measurements imply that destroying on average <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>85</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of <italic>N =</italic> 564 Dbx1 preBötC neurons (15%) precludes spontaneous respiratory motor rhythm in vitro.

Thus, we conclude the ability of Dbx1 preBötC neurons to spontaneously generate rhythmic respiratory motor output in slice preparations is sensitive to deletion of 85 ± 1.96(20) Dbx1 interneurons, i.e., 8–22% of its core. Although it cannot function spontaneously post-lesion, the rhythmogenic preBötC core does not appear to be destroyed by piecewise lesioning. Peptide injections evoked irregular transient bursts in lesioned preBötC-surface slices. Also, measures of local and global connectivity in lesioned network models remained undiminished after cumulative cell deletions stopped and precluded rhythmic function. Therefore, we propose that preBötC function depends on non-trivial properties that emerge from non-linear synaptic and intrinsic membrane properties. Although such properties remain to be definitively determined, we advocate—and have explicitly modeled—a ‘group pacemaker’ rhythmogenic mechanism. In a group pacemaker, each constituent neuron forms recurrent connections with other constituent neurons in a network of finite size and amplifies excitatory drive via synaptically triggered inward currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rekling et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rekling and Feldman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rubin et al., 2009</xref>). If that is a viable explanation for rhythmogenesis, then it could account for the loss of spontaneous function in the laser ablation context. Far before the cell ablation tally destroys the underlying network and its connectivity, the removal of each constituent neuron that contributes to rhythmic burst generation through its ability to amplify synaptic drive has a profound and deleterious effect on network functionality. The likelihood that arrhythmic respiratory networks retain considerable numbers of constituent neurons and interconnectivity suggests that unraveling the cellular and synaptic mechanisms of rhythmogenesis and motor output could be exploited to restore functionality in lesioned slices and, to the extent that our observations apply in vivo, to develop clinical therapies that bolster respiratory function in pathological conditions of animal models or human patients.</p><p>Dbx1 respiratory neurons in the medulla represent excellent potential targets for pharmacological intervention or gene therapy to treat respiratory pathologies.

This routine detects particles using a threshold based on pixel intensity. It starts with a high value (near the maximum) and iteratively drops the threshold while accumulating particles (i.e., target ROIs) within a certain range of areas specified within the Ablator configuration. At first, with a high threshold, few local maxima are detected and the mask is small and sparse with ROIs. The routine then lowers the threshold by a user-defined increment and re-analyzes the image. As threshold decreases in steps, more ROIs become detectable. These newly detected ROIs are added to the mask, which expands the list of potential targets. The threshold is decreased incrementally over a number of partitions determined by the quotient of 4096 values of fluorescence intensity (for a 12-bit image) divided by the user-defined increment (above). As the detection process continues and threshold decreases incrementally, the smaller ROIs from prior iterations—which are fully contained in larger ROIs from the current iteration—are discarded, and the new larger ROIs are retained. Conversely, if a newly detected ROI at the current iteration envelopes two or more ROIs from a prior iteration, then the newly detected superset ROI is discarded and the multiple ROIs from the earlier iteration are retained. Thus the system avoids spuriously conflating two (or more) cells into a single target. After looping through all the partitions, the remaining set of ROIs is saved as the mask of potential target neurons for that focal plane.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Circularity test</title><p>Ablator evaluates the circularity of ROIs as part of the threshold-crossing algorithm.

The Ti:sapphire laser scans a 10 square micrometer spot centered on each target with 800-nm pulses at maximum intensity. The ablation is confirmed if fluorescence is detected in the band 560–615 nm, which reflects presumed water vapor in the cell cavity and excludes infrared reflections of the long-wavelength laser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).

Confirmed lesions add to a running tally. If lesion confirmation cannot be obtained, then the target selection algorithm does not advance and subsequent attempts are made to lesion the ROI. With each subsequent iteration, the scanning speed is decreased to improve the likelihood of lesioning the target. This loop repeats a total of five times. If confirmation of lesion cannot be ascertained after the fifth attempt, then it is deemed a failed lesion. Failed lesions do not contribute to the tally and their ROIs are removed from the list of targets to avoid reselection for the remainder of the experiment. A log file documents lesions by index number and time of confirmation. The XII rhythm is monitored and recorded continuously so its state can be directly correlated with the lesion tally in real time. Cell targets are destroyed in successful lesions so their effects are cumulative. The laser lesions are performed bilaterally in the preBötC. After a batch of lesions on one side, the robotic xy translation stage translates to the contralateral side and performs another batch, and then switches sides again, and so on until the targets are exhausted or the XII rhythm ceases.</p><p>We measured XII burst magnitude (amplitude and area) and computed cycle period (the interval between consecutive XII bursts) using LabChart software (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO).

As in the main text and the table above, parameters (<italic>n,</italic>p) represent the number of constituent neurons and connection probability. Here the networks are Erdős-Rényi static directed random graphs G(<italic>n,</italic>p) (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—supplement 1</xref>); that is, the nodes are not populated with dynamical models and the interconnections between nodes are simply static directed links (rather than dynamical synapses). Each network (static graph) below was subjected to 100 random deletions. During the ablation sequence, we computed the following global network metrics: K-core, the number of strongly connected components (SCC), and local network metrics: local cluster coefficient, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality. The initial (first) and final (last) values for the global and local measures are plotted side by side in the appropriate columns below. We also computed the initial in- and out-degree (i.e., the average number of directed connections in and out), percentage drop in the final average in-degree, and the percentage-drop of the final average out-degree. The ‘Ave.’ row reports average change (in percent) for K-core, SCC, cluster coefficient, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality, as well as the average in- and out-degree for initial and final states of the network. Definitions for the characteristic measures are elaborated in the ‘Materials and methods’.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors combine molecular-genetic, laser ablation, electrophysiological and computational experiments to determine whether Dbx1 glutamatergic neurons of the neonatal mouse pre-Bötzinger Complex represent the rhythmogenic core of the respiratory CPG. They show elegantly that they do indeed and that progressive removal of just a small percentage of the population stops rhythmicity (which can then be transiently restored by SP injection) confirming a long standing hypothesis. More surprisingly ablation of these neurons diminishes motor outflow, suggesting that some Dbx1 interneurons are premotor. They then show with a few examples that in contrast to the rhythmogenic interneurons, which project to the contralateral pre-Bot, interneurons in the Dbx1 population project ipsilaterally to the motor nucleus XII suggesting that they are premotor. Computational modeling suggests that a proportion of the Dbx1 interneurons are not involved in rhythmogenesis.</p><p>This paper is clearly written and well documented with convincing data. Each figure conveys important data. This work is a significant and necessary step forward from previous laser ablation studies by the same lab that identified potential rhythmogenic targets by Ca imaging [Hayes JA, Wang X, Del Negro CA. 2012. Cumulative lesioning of respiratory interneurons disrupts and precludes motor rhythms in vitro. PNAS 109(21): 8286-91].</p><p>There are concerns that should be addressed in revision by careful rewriting and with appropriate cautions on some of the conclusions.</p><p>1) A major concern is how the authors seem to extrapolate the findings on the numbers of neurons that when ablated lead to rhythm termination to the <italic>in vivo</italic> state. The conclusion that the “preBötC core is very sensitive to just a few constituent neurons (i.e. &lt;100)” may not be valid for the <italic>in vivo</italic> state of the preBötC network, a caveat that the authors should discuss in the text. Their own results with SP injection suggests that more excitation and/or modulation <italic>in vivo</italic> may make the rhythm generator immune to loss of 15% of the Dbx1 Interneurons. They should also draw back on their extrapolation of how these results relate to the loss of respiratory function in disease sates <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>2) The effects deletions of Dbx1 neurons on motor discharge appear to be only on amplitude and not on patterning of the motor outflow. By pattern the reviewers mean phase relations of MNs not just the number of MNs activated or their spike frequency. Careful rewriting should make this distinction clear. The authors do not demonstrate experimentally that these neurons are NOT part of the rhythm-generating kernel of excitatory neurons and hence are “non-rhythmogenic” Dbx1 premotoneurons or directly that they are premotor. This inference/hypothesis came from the excitatory network model. It is a reasonable hypothesis but at present we don't know enough about the spatial organization and projection patterns of these Dbx1 neurons. It is possible that some of these neurons have axon collateral projections within the preBötC and also contralaterally in addition to ipsilateral projections to the hypoglossal motor nucleus. Also the authors have not shown us that the 2 cells that they identified actually have synaptic connections with motor neurons.</p><p>3) We have appended the original reviews because they emphasize different aspects of the paper but are non-conflicting. They can be fruitfully used to revise the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic></p><p>The authors combine molecular-genetic, laser ablation, electrophysiological and computational experiments to determine whether Dbx1 glutamatergic neurons of the neonatal mouse pre-Bötzinger Complex represent the rhythmogenic core of the respiratory CPG.

This work is a significant and necessary step forward from previous laser ablation studies by the same lab that identified potential rhythmogenic targets by Ca imaging [Hayes JA, Wang X, Del Negro CA. 2012. Cumulative lesioning of respiratory interneurons disrupts and precludes motor rhythms in vitro. PNAS 109(21): 8286-91.].</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic></p><p>This is a technically elegant study testing the hypothesis that neurons developmentally expressing the Dbx1 transcription factor in the pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) constitute the core component of the inspiratory rhythm generator in rhythmically-active neonatal mouse slices obtained from Dbx1-Cre-tdtomato transgenic mice. While it has been established that the preBötC is the critical structure for inspiratory rhythm generation, the precise identity of the preBötC excitatory interneurons generating the inspiratory rhythm has not been established. This study therefore represents an important attempt to establish that neurons derived from Dbx1-expressing precursors constitute a critical glass of interneurons and also establish that Dbx1 expression at the level of the preBötC is a reliable marker for the rhythm generating neurons. Previous studies have suggested that Dbx1-expressing neurons are a superset of neurons in the mouse central nervous system and in respiratory-related regions of the medulla including premotor regions are largely glutamatergic neurons and in the preBötC express several phenotypes that are thought to be hallmarks of inspiratory rhythm-generating interneurons. Thus it has been hypothesized in the field that Dbx1-expression may be a reliable surrogate marker for the critical population of glutamatergic preBötC neurons.</p><p>The authors have effectively employed a previously developed laser-based ablation system to cumulatively photoablate the Dbx1-tdTomato neurons one neuron at a time, which perturbed the inspiratory rhythm, monitored by recording the hypoglossal motor output from the slice preparation, and surprisingly completely disrupted rhythm generation after ablating only ∼15% of the estimated total Dbx1-expressing neuronal population in the preBötC, from which the authors suggest that preBötC rhythm generating core is very sensitive to loss of just a few constituent interneurons. The authors also report reductions in the amplitude of the motor output, consistent with previous findings that a subpopulation of preBötC inspiratory neurons have axonal projections directly to the XII motor nucleus and verified here for Dbx1-expressing neurons, which suggests a premotor pattern formation function of a subset of preBötC neurons. Simulations with a particular model of preBötC excitatory rhythmogenic circuits (Rubin-Hayes model) predict only perturbations of network burst frequency, consistent with the idea that non-rhythmogenic inspiratory preBötC neurons may be subserving a premotor pattern formation function.</p><p>One major concern to be addressed is that the quantification of the size of the Dbx1 preBötC population required to maintain rhythmogenic function <italic>in vitro</italic> (∼15% of the total Dbx1 population) may not be representative of the situation operating in vivo because of major differences in the level of Dbx1 neuron excitation and hence ability of this network population to generate inspiratory rhythm in different states. There are sources of excitatory/neuromodulatory drive to the preBötC operating <italic>in vivo</italic> (e.g. RTN) that are absent in the slice preparations and the slices are in fact in a low excitation state (i.e., compared to the <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse, very low inspiratory discharge frequency dependent on elevated extracellular potassium for stable slow rhythm generation). The conclusion that the “preBötC core is very sensitive to just a few constituent neurons (i.e. &lt;100)” (and the authors suggestion that this may have ramifications for the loss of respiratory function in disease states) may not be valid for the <italic>in vivo</italic> state of the preBötC network, a caveat that the authors should discuss in the text. Have the authors effectively varied the state of excitation for example in the model network to gain insight into how level of excitation affects the critical mass of neurons required to sustain rhythmogenic function?</p><p>The results with the excitatory network model are instructive regarding perturbations of population burst frequency vs. amplitude with simulated single-cell ablation. The authors state (p. 8, para. 1) that some of their test simulation results substantiate that the model networks well represent the neonatal mouse preBötC in vitro.” In the experiments of Kam et al. 2013 cited, network bursts were generated after a substantial delay (200 - 300 ms) from the onset of neuronal activation. Does the present network model predict this temporal feature? Also the cellular burst generation and terminations mechanisms represented in the Rubin-Hayes model have not been verified experimentally, which should be noted in the Discussion. On the other hand, it could be that the type of test results used to make the claim about the model as a good representation may not be particularly sensitive to the actual burst generation and termination mechanisms incorporated.</p><p>An experimental issue to be addressed is that there is no information provided for the five slices studied in ablation experiments on the number of neurons ablated on each side of the slice.

They used a method to selectively and progressively ablate neurons in a slice preparation obtained from a transgenic mouse line in which cells of interest (Dbx-derived cells) are constitutively expressing a fluorescent marker (used to target these cells for the ablation procedure). They aimed to determine the impact of these ablations on network function in order to establish some quantitative cellular parameters controlling network functionality and test their “Dbx1 core hypothesis”. As predicted they found that after a progressive decrease in respiratory frequency (monitored through the recording of the XII nerve output), ablation of ∼85 cells led to the complete rhythm cessation. This effect was accompanied by a decrease in the motor output amplitude, suggesting a role of Dbx1-derived neurons in pattern formation.</p><p>While the paper is clearly written, easy to follow and the figures explicit I have a few concerns:</p><p>First the degree of novelty: the elegant method consisting in lesioning specific neuronal populations within a network and more specifically the respiratory network of the preBotzinger complex while monitoring the resulting motor output has been already presented (including all the methodological controls), (Hayes, 2012). And the important role of Dbx1-derived cells in constituting the core of the preBotzinger respiratory network has also been recently published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore the experiments dedicated to examine the effects of laser ablation of Dbx-derived respiratory neurons on the respiratory network function seem to only complement/confirm previous already published results, but do not really bring any novel results susceptible to significantly improve the current knowledge on respiratory rhythmogenesis.</p><p>Second I have a problem with the use of the word “pattern”. This might be only a semantic problem but it should be made clear what the authors mean with pattern. To my point of view “pattern” means the respective and relative organization of the different phases of a rhythmic activity. For example for the respiratory behavior this could include expiration vs inspiration phases, the distinction between the different sub-phases of the inspiration activity.... But, to me, the amplitude of the hypoglossal motor output recorded from a slice preparation is not a parameter that can be associated with patterning.

This is not completely true as Morgado-Valle (2010) provided evidence that some rhythmically active glycinergic neurons of the preBotC exhibit pacemaker properties and Winter (2009) showed that glycinergic neurons are significantly integrated in the preBotC network as they constitute half of the rhythmically active neuron in this network.

The conclusion that the “preBötC core is very sensitive to just a few constituent neurons (i.e. &lt;100)” may not be valid for the in vivo state of the preBötC network, a caveat that the authors should discuss in the text. Their own results with SP injection suggests that more excitation and/or modulation in vivo may make the rhythm generator immune to loss of 15% of the Dbx1 Interneurons. They should also draw back on their extrapolation of how these results relate to the loss of respiratory function in disease sates in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We addressed this critique in response to Reviewer #2 below. The most important revisions to the text, which pertain to this critique, are now found in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>2) The effects deletions of Dbx1 neurons on motor discharge appear to be only on amplitude and not on patterning of the motor outflow. By pattern the reviewers mean phase relations of MNs not just the number of MNs activated or their spike frequency. Careful rewriting should make this distinction clear. The authors do not demonstrate experimentally that these neurons are NOT part of the rhythm-generating kernel of excitatory neurons and hence are “non-rhythmogenic” Dbx1 premotoneurons or directly that they are premotor. This inference/hypothesis came from the excitatory network model. It is a reasonable hypothesis but at present we don't know enough about the spatial organization and projection patterns of these Dbx1 neurons. It is possible that some of these neurons have axon collateral projections within the preBötC and also contralaterally in addition to ipsilateral projections to the hypoglossal motor nucleus. Also the authors have not shown us that the 2 cells that they identified actually have synaptic connections with motor neurons</italic>.</p><p>The Reviewing editor is correct. We did not demonstrate that Dbx1 preBötC neurons with premotor functionality are <italic>not</italic> also part of the rhythmogenic core, but the model-experiment disparity suggests that this is the case. That is, we had to delete approximately twice as many cells in the experiments as in the simulations of a purely rhythmogenic network to cause rhythm cessation. If some Dbx1 neurons were simultaneously part of the rhythmogenic and premotor subsets, then two predictions would arise: 1) we would expect the experiments to decline in output amplitude, but not the simulations (a pure rhythmogenic setup), and 2) we would expect both simulations and experiments to require similar ablation tallies to stop the rhythm. Prediction 2 was clearly not observed.</p><p>It is also correct that we did not demonstrate synaptic connections with XII motoneurons. Our evidence for premotor function is based on: i) a decline in XII output after laser ablation, ii) antidromic activation from the XII nucleus. (Note, the XII nucleus is virtually homogenous containing &gt;95% motoneurons and only 5% GABAergic interneurons. Thus, it is highly probable that any axons antidromically activated via stimulation within the XII nucleus synapse on XII motoneurons.) And, iii) biocytin reconstruction showing axon trajectory toward/into the XII nucleus. These are indirect demonstrations, but taken together make a strong case in our view.</p><p>We further address this critique of ‘pattern’ in response to Reviewers #1 and #3, below.</p><p><italic>3) We have appended the original reviews because they emphasize different aspects of the paper but are non-conflicting. They can be fruitfully used to revise the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p><italic>[…] This paper is clearly written and meticulously documented with convincing data. Each figure conveys important data and the Discussion appropriately points out potential clinical implications. This work is a significant and necessary step forward from previous laser ablation studies by the same lab that identified potential rhythmogenic targets by Ca imaging [Hayes JA, Wang X, Del Negro CA. 2012.

PNAS 109(21): 8286-91]</italic>.</p><p>We thank Reviewer #1 for a supportive assessment.</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p><italic>[…] One major concern to be addressed is that the quantification of the size of the Dbx1 preBötC population required to maintain rhythmogenic function in vitro (∼15% of the total Dbx1 population) may not be representative of the situation operating in vivo because of major differences in the level of Dbx1 neuron excitation and hence ability of this network population to generate inspiratory rhythm in different states. There are sources of excitatory/neuromodulatory drive to the preBötC operating in vivo (e.g. RTN) that are absent in the slice preparations and the slices are in fact in a low excitation state (i.e., compared to the in vivo mouse, very low inspiratory discharge frequency dependent on elevated extracellular potassium for stable slow rhythm generation)</italic>. <italic>The conclusion that the “preBötC core is very sensitive to just a few constituent neurons (i.e. &lt;100)” (and the authors suggestion that this may have ramifications for the loss of respiratory function in disease states) may not be valid for the in vivo state of the preBötC network, a caveat that the authors should discuss in the text. Have the authors effectively varied the state of excitation for example in the model network to gain insight into how level of excitation affects the critical mass of neurons required to sustain rhythmogenic function?</italic></p><p>Recognizing that measurements <italic>in vitro</italic> may not map directly to the preBötC <italic>in vivo</italic>, we acknowledge in the edited version that our quantifications apply for <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions only. Furthermore, we acknowledge the caveats inherent in extrapolating our <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements to the <italic>in vivo</italic> condition. Some examples:</p><p>The sentence quoted above by Reviewer #2, and three additional sentences were modified as follows, “… the preBötC core <italic>in vitro</italic>, is very sensitive to the loss of just a few constituent interneurons (i.e., &lt;100).” This sensitivity to neuron loss may be accentuated in reduced slice preparations lacking excitatory and neuromodulatory drive from the rostral medulla and pons as well as peripheral chemosensory and mechanosensory vagal sensory feedback. Extrinsic sources of drive raise preBötC network excitability and enhance respiratory rhythm. An acute sensitivity to neuron loss, such as we report for slices, may not apply to the preBötC network <italic>in vivo</italic>, but this remains to be tested via quantitative cellular ablation experiments with physiological monitoring in intact animal models. (Discussion section)</p><p>And also in the Discussion section, “… unraveling the cellular and synaptic mechanisms of rhythmogenesis and motor output could be exploited to restore functionality in lesioned slices and, to the extent that our observations apply <italic>in vivo</italic>, to develop clinical therapies that bolster respiratory function in pathological conditions of animal models or human patients.”</p><p><italic>The results with the excitatory network model are instructive regarding perturbations of population burst frequency vs. amplitude with simulated single-cell ablation. The authors state (p. 8, para. 1) that some of their test simulation results substantiate that the model networks well represent the neonatal mouse preBötC in vitro.” In the experiments of Kam et al. 2013 cited, network bursts were generated after a substantial delay (200 - 300 ms) from the onset of neuronal activation. Does the present network model predict this temporal feature? Also the cellular burst generation and terminations mechanisms represented in the Rubin-Hayes model have not been verified experimentally, which should be noted in the Discussion. On the other hand, it could be that the type of test results used to make the claim about the model as a good representation may not be particularly sensitive to the actual burst generation and termination mechanisms incorporated</italic>.</p><p>Almost exactly matching the experimental results of Kam <italic>et al.</italic> (<italic>J Neurosci</italic> 33: 3332-8, 2013), our network-wide evoked bursts emerged with a delay of 200-300 ms. For example, in our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref> simulations, the five-cell stimulation evoked a network burst with a delay of 300.3 ms; and the six-cell stimulation evoked a network burst with a delay of 215.2 ms. 6 We respectfully point out that most of the mechanisms for burst initiation and termination in the Rubin-Hayes mathematical model (Rubin <italic>et al. PNAS</italic> 106: 2939-44, 2009) have in fact been experimentally tested.</p><p>Recurrent excitation: its role in initiating the inspiratory burst phase has been documented numerous times, including two canonical papers (Funk <italic>et al. J Neurophysiol</italic> 70: 1497-1515, 1993; Wallén-Mackenzie <italic>et al. J Neurosci</italic> 26: 12294-307, 2006) and three very recent papers (Kam <italic>et al. J Neurosci</italic> 33: 3332-8, 2013 [which used glutamate un-caging to trigger recurrent excitation]; Carroll &amp; Ramirez. <italic>J Neurophysiol</italic> 109: 285-95, 2013; Carroll <italic>et al. J Neurophysiol</italic> 109: 296-305, 2013).</p><p>CAN current: Prof. Ramirez’ group (Univ. Wash., Seattle) was the first to document the role of <italic>I</italic>CAN in preBötC bursting (Thoby-Brisson &amp; Ramirez. <italic>J Neurophysiol</italic> 86: 104-12, 2001), and then my lab characterized the current in some biophysical detail (Pace <italic>et al. J Physiol</italic> 582: 113-25, 2007; Crowder <italic>et al. J Physiol</italic> 582: 1047-58, 2007). Subsequently Dr. S. Mironov examined the respiratory burst-generating role of <italic>I</italic>CAN in a sequence of papers (Mironov <italic>J Physiol</italic> 586: 2277-91, 2008; Mironov &amp; Skorova. <italic>J Neurochem</italic> 117: 295-308, 2011; Mironov 591: 1613-30, 2013). Finally, my group recently demonstrated the influence of <italic>I</italic>CAN specifically in Dbx1 preBötC neurons (Picardo <italic>et al. J Physiol</italic> 591: 2687-703, 2013).</p><p>Burst termination: We demonstrated the role of the electrogenic Na-K ATPase pump current (<italic>I</italic>pump) in burst termination in two papers (Del Negro <italic>et al. J Physiol</italic> 587: 1217-31, 2009; Krey <italic>et al. Front Neural Circuits</italic> 4: 124, 2010). Furthermore, the paper by Krey <italic>et al.</italic> also showed the contributions of Na<sup>+-</sup>dependent K+ currents (<italic>I</italic>Na-K) and ATP-dependent K+ currents (<italic>I</italic>K-ATP), which are additional activity-dependent outward currents that can contribute to burst termination as predicted by the Rubin-Hayes modeling framework (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref> of that paper).</p><p>Cellular ‘pacemaker’ activity: In the original Rubin-Hayes model, intrinsic bursting was precluded by the parameters. In a follow-up study, we explored parameter space in the model and demonstrated that the Rubin-Hayes model could show Na<sup>+</sup>or Ca<sup>2+</sup>mediated intrinsic bursting activity (Dunmyre <italic>et al. J Comput Neurosci</italic> 31: 305-28, 2011), which was shown experimentally several times (e.g., Thoby-Brisson &amp; Ramirez. <italic>J Neurophysiol</italic> 86: 104-12, 2001; Pena <italic>et al. Neuron</italic> 43: 105-17, 2004; Del Negro <italic>et al. J Neurosci</italic> 25: 446-53, 2005).</p><p>The only aspect of the Rubin-Hayes model that has <italic>not</italic> yet been experimentally tested is the role of short-term synaptic depression, which also aids in burst termination in the model. My lab has been working on that problem for the last year and we are writing up the study now (although obviously we cannot cite it yet).</p><p>In the final sentence regarding the modeling, Reviewer #2 rightly questions whether the specific cellular mechanisms of the Rubin-Hayes model are important for laser ablation simulations. Presumably, if the laser ablation approach interrogates network properties, then the properties of the constituent cells may not matter. However, in our view, since the experiments are actually performed on preBötC interneurons, then the simulations should employ models that well represent preBötC neurons. Therefore, we would substitute our model for a Morris-Lecar generalized model or a stripped-down Hodgkin-Huxley generic model. For the preBötC, Rubin-Hayes is a model that we developed and thus advocate, but another contemporary model of preBötC neurons was published by Rybak’s group (Jasinski <italic>et al. Eur J Neurosci</italic> 37: 212-30, 2013), which builds on a model developed by Butera’s group (Toporikova &amp; Butera. <italic>J Comput Neurosci</italic> 30: 515-28, 2011). We are in the process of implementing this Jasinski-Rybak model to repeat the simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>. Unfortunately the published 7 paper by Jasinski <italic>et al.</italic> contains several typos and does not provide initial conditions and the code for the Jasinksi-Rybak model is not in the public domain – so it has taken my team several months just to correctly implement the single-cell version of the model and correctly reproduce the figures of their paper (to make sure the model is setup correctly). We have now begun replicating the simulations of the present study submitted to <italic>eLife</italic>, and we intend to publish the simulations of laser ablation using Jasinski-Rybak preBötC neuron models in a forthcoming project. We anticipate that Jasinski-Rybak will give similar results to Rubin-Hayes when integrated into network simulations and subjected to piecewise cellular ablations.</p><p><italic>An experimental issue to be addressed is that there is no information provided for the five slices studied in ablation experiments on the number of neurons ablated on each side of the slice. In the Materials and methods the authors state that “The domain can be bilaterally distributed like the preBötC and ventral respiratory column” and bilateral target maps are shown, but the authors should state how the targets were actually distributed in the experiments and any potential impact on the ablation results should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>We created a new supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>), which plots lesion tallies for preBötC-surface and control slices. It shows the total ablation tally as well as the individual tallies per side.</p><p>We now acknowledge the bilateral nature of target detection and laser ablation in the Results section..</p><p>Because Dbx1 preBötC neurons so often show commissural projections (Bouvier <italic>et al.

It is also true that our first laser ablation study (Hayes <italic>et al. PNAS</italic> 109: 8286-91, 2012) estimated core rhythm generator size, and established methodological controls. Nevertheless, the present study is novel and important in our view. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayes <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref> identified neurons by Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, which cannot differentiate glutamatergic rhythm-generating neurons from GABA/glycinergic non-rhythmogenic neurons because both neuron classes oscillate in sync with the inspiratory rhythm. Moreover, Bouvier <italic>et al.</italic> and Gray <italic>et al.</italic> did not attempt to quantify the size of the Dbx1 preBötC core population or test the robustness of its functionality. Therefore, the novelty of the present study is that we test the obligatory rhythmogenic role of the Dbx1 population while quantifying its size, and in doing so we avoid counting inhibitory neurons in our measurements.</p><p>An additional element of novelty in this study is that we found that Dbx1 preBötC neurons also serve in a premotor capacity. Bouvier <italic>et al.</italic> and Gray <italic>et al.</italic> did not discover that overlapping role for Dbx1 preBötC neurons. This last point is not just a new piece of information but rather a significant paradigm shift because in the respiratory CPG a single cardinal class of interneurons serves rhythm-generating and premotor functions, whereas these functions are ordinarily attributed to separate populations.</p><p><italic>Second I have a problem with the use of the word “pattern”.

Indeed, that would be consistent with the model we propose. We have not yet done the experiment in that way. Rather, we have taken the reverse approach and selectively laser ablated Dbx1 neurons with the domain set to the dorsal preBötC and even farther dorsally to the intermediate reticular formation (IRt). The prediction would be to degrade the amplitude of motor output without affecting frequency, and we have observed that result. These follow-up laser-ablation studies are not yet ready for publication and exceed the scope of the present manuscript in our view.</p></body></sub-article></article>
