neurons. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, leg motoneurons are organized as a myotopic map, where their dendritic domains represent the muscle field. Here, we investigate mechanisms underlying development of aspects of this myotopic map, required for walking. A behavioral screen identified roles for Semaphorins (Sema) and Plexins (Plex) in walking behavior. Deciphering this phenotype, we show that PlexA/Sema1a mediates motoneuron axon branching in ways that differ in the proximal femur and distal tibia, based on motoneuronal birth order. Importantly, we show a novel role for glia in positioning dendrites of specific motoneurons; PlexB/Sema2a is required for dendritic positioning of late-born motoneurons but not early-born motoneurons. These findings indicate that communication within motoneurons and between glia and motoneurons, mediated by the combined action of different Plexin/Semaphorin signaling systems, are required for the formation of a functional myotopic map.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11572.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11572.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11572.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells enable us to both sense the world around us and to move about it. The nerves responsible for movement are called motor neurons. While one end of a motor neuron stimulates the muscle it is connected to, the other end receives signals from nerves in the spinal cord that relay messages about movement from the brain. Motor neuron connections in the spinal cord, or its equivalent in insects, the ventral nerve cord, are organized into an arrangement known as a myotopic map, which reflects the anatomical arrangement of the muscles in the body. Much remains to be learnt about how these maps form.</p><p>Syed et al. have investigated how the myotopic map develops for motor neurons in the legs of fruit flies by reducing the function of chosen genes in the ventral nerve cord and asking how this affects the myotopic map. The experiments disrupted a signaling system called the Semaphorin signaling pathway that guides motor neurons to the right target muscle and consists of different receptor-signaling molecule pairs.</p><p>By looking for flies with an abnormal walk and with disrupted motor neuron organization, Syed et al. identified receptor-signal pairs that guide motor neurons to different leg muscles. Specific receptor-signal pairs also guide the organisation of motor neurons in the ventral nerve cord. This guidance depends on when neurons are ‘born’. While a receptor-signal pair targets early born neurons to one leg muscle, the same receptor-signal pair regulates a different aspect of guidance in late-born neurons. Cells called glia, which are related to neurons, also help to position the connections of late-born motor neurons in the ventral nerve cord.</p><p>Overall, the Semaphorin signaling system assists communication both within motor neurons and between glia cells and motor neurons during the formation of the myotopic map for leg motor neurons. These discoveries open new avenues of investigation into how else these cells communicate with each other to aid the development and organization of motor neurons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11572.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11572.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>semaphorin</kwd><kwd>motor neurons</kwd><kwd>myotopic map</kwd><kwd>neuron targeting</kwd><kwd>glia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NCBS-TIFR</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Syed</surname><given-names>Durafshan Sakeena</given-names></name><name><surname>Gowda</surname><given-names>Swetha B.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Reddy</surname><given-names>O Venkateswara</given-names></name><name><surname>VijayRaghavan</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reichert</surname><given-names>Heinrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>JC Bose Fellowship And CEFIRA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>VijayRaghavan</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Signaling from glia and nerves regulate the development of axonal and dendritic motor neuron architecture, needed for walking in the fruit fly species <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Motoneurons are key elements in the neural networks that generate behavior in all nervous systems. They represent the final common path for convergence of processed information from motor control circuitry in the central nervous system and from sensory feedback circuitry in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sherrington, 1906</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pearson, 1993</xref>). Moreover, as final common output channels, they represent exclusive control elements of muscle effectors that mediate behavioral action. For their correct function, motoneurons must acquire specific cellular architectures during development such that their input domains, usually manifest as dendrites, receive connections from appropriate pre-motor neurons, and their axonal output domains make connections to correct target muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jessell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arber, 2012</xref>). How motoneuron development is orchestrated to establish the appropriate and specific dendritic input and axonal output connectivity needed for behavioral action is a central and still important question in neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jefferis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dasen and Jessell, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Considerable insight into the mechanisms that control motoneuron structure has been obtained in the neurogenetic model system of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In this system, the developmental processes involved in generating appropriate dendritic and axonal morphology of different types of larval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Landgraf and Thor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mauss et al., 2009</xref>) and adult motoneurons have been studied extensively. For example, the specific architecture of the motoneurons that innervate the adult leg has been shown to depend on their lineage and birth order, in that the majority of the leg motoneurons are postembryonic lineal descendants of neuroblast 15, and these motoneurons manifest a birth order-specific neuroanatomical organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Truman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brierley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brierley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baek and Mann, 2009</xref>). In this lineage, early born motoneurons project their axons to proximal muscles in the leg segments and have dendritic arborization that extends toward the thoracic ganglion neuropile midline, whereas late born motoneurons innervate distal muscles in the leg segments and have dendritic arbors that are restricted to the lateral regions of the ganglionic neuropile. Thus, in terms of their central and peripheral nervous architecture, these leg motoneurons form a myotopic map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brierley et al., 2009</xref>). Although this myotopic map-specific targeting of leg motoneuron dendrites has been shown to require midline signaling through the Slit/Roundabout and Netrin/Frazzled signaling systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brierley et al., 2009</xref>), the mechanism underlying compartmentalization in terms of birth order and distinct axonal and dendritic targeting is poorly understood. In order to understand the guidance cues responsible for leg motoneuron development, we performed a behavioral screen for locomotor defects caused by targeting RNAi in motoneurons and identified Plexin and Semaphorin as candidates. In this study, we have investigated the development of specific axonal projections and dendritic arbors in leg motoneurons required for walking in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> mediated by Plexin/Semaphorin signaling system and, in doing so, discover novel cellular and molecular roles.</p><p>The Semaphorins (Sema) are a large family of transmembrane and secreted glycoprotein ligands that together with their Plexin (Plex) receptors are known to be involved in control of cell migration, dendritic topography and axon guidance in vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kolodkin et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yazdani and Terman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pasterkamp, 2012</xref>). Semaphorins and Plexins have evolutionarily conserved guidance function during nervous system development, and both transmembrane and secreted Semaphorin ligands can mediate a diverse set of repulsive and attractive guidance functions. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there are two Plexin receptors and five Semaphorin ligands. PlexinA (PlexA) strongly binds the Sema1a and Sema1b ligands while as Plexin B (PlexB) binds to Sema2a and Sema2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates and Whitington, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayoob et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lattemann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sweeney et al., 2011</xref>) (Sema5c is not expressed in the CNS). Both PlexA and PlexB have been shown to mediate a Sema-dependent repulsion of motor axons during embryonic development of body wall innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Winberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jeong et al., 2012</xref>). Whether or not Plexin/Semaphorin signaling is also involved in the development of the post-embryonically generated motoneurons that innervate the leg musculature is currently unknown.</p><p>We first carry out a behavioral screen for locomotor defects caused by targeted RNAi knockdown of Semaphorins and Plexins in leg motoneurons, which shows that knockdown of membrane-bound Plexins and Semaphorins results in abnormal walking gait. Based on this, we screen for corresponding neuroanatomical defects in the affected leg motoneurons. We find that motoneuron-specific knockdown of Sema1a or PlexA causes defective axonal defasciculation and targeting in motoneurons that innervate leg muscles and these phenotypes differ in proximal femur and distal tibia. In the femur, there occurs a reduction in axon branching and defasciculation of motoneurons, whereas an increase in axon branching of motoneurons occurs in the tibia. This suggests a compartment-specific activity of Plexin/ Semaphorin signaling system.</p><p>Larval and adult motoneuron dendrites in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, organized as a myotopic map, have been shown to utilize Robo-Slit and Netrin-Frazzled signaling systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brierley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mauss et al., 2009</xref>). The dendritic targeting of larval motoneurons is an active process that is independent of glial differentiation or target muscle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Landgraf et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Landgraf and Thor, 2006</xref>). In contrast, we find the role of glia in positioning dendrites of late born motoneurons that innervate distal muscles of tibia and occupy lateral regions of the thoracic neuropil in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We demonstrate that motoneuron-specific knockdown of PlexB or knockdown of Sema2a secreted from glial cells results in a shift of dendritic arborization toward the ganglionic midline in late born leg motoneurons. This is an important and novel difference, which may have general implications for dendritic patterning mechanisms.</p><p>These findings indicate that the integrative action of multiple Plexin/Semaphorin signaling systems mediate communication between glia and motoneurons and within motoneurons for the correct formation of axonal projections and dendritic arborization in leg motoneuron development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Motoneuron-specific knockdown of Plexin/Semaphorin signaling results in locomotor defects</title><p>To determine which elements of the Plexin/Semaphorin signaling system might be required for correct leg locomotor activity, we first carried out a behavioral screen for walking defects caused by targeted RNAi knockdown of Semaphorins and Plexins in leg motoneurons. In these experiments, the OK371-Gal4 driver was used to target UAS-RNAi knockdown to leg motoneurons; this Gal4 driver targets reporter gene expression to all motoneurons during embryonic and postembryonic development and in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mahr and Aberle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brierley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brierley et al., 2012</xref>). In these experiments, UAS-RNAi knockdown constructs for Sema1a and its receptor PlexA as well as for Sema2a and its receptor PlexB were used. To monitor their locomotor activity, flies were allowed to walk freely over a soot plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maqbool et al., 2006</xref>) and their resulting footprint patterns were documented and analyzed in knockdown versus control flies.</p><p>Locomotor defects were observed in RNAi-mediated knockdown of Sema1a, PlexA, and PlexB in leg motoneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In Sema1a knockdown experiments, flies showed uncoordinated walking activity with leg dragging. In PlexA knockdown experiments, flies showed uncoordinated walking, short steps or short steps with leg dragging. In PlexB knockdown experiments, flies walked with short steps and leg dragging. In Sema2a knockdown experiments, flies showed normal walking behavior. The frequency of occurrence of phenotypes is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>.

The absence of locomotor defects in our motoneuron-targeted Sema2a knockdown experiments (see above) suggests that Sema2a might not act in an autonomous manner on leg motoneuron development. Indeed, motoneuron-specific knockdown of Sema2a using the OK371-Gal4 driver did not result in peripheral axon projection defects in leg motoneurons (data not shown). To investigate the possibility that Sema2a might act on leg motoneurons in a non-cell autonomous manner, we first compared the expression pattern of Sema1a and Sema2a in the thoracic ganglia during postembryonic development using immunolabeling.</p><p>Throughout postembryonic development, both Sema1a and Sema2a are widely expressed throughout most of the developing thoracic ganglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–F</xref>).

However, Sema1a and Sema2a expression levels are significantly different at the ganglionic midline. Thus, whereas Sema1a expression decreases toward the midline and has its lowest level of expression there, Sema2a expression is highest at/and near midline where a peak in its expression level is manifest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This high level of expression in and around midline cells, many of which are glial in nature, suggests that Sema2a ligand secreted from these cells could affect leg motoneuron development within the thoracic ganglia and hence, influence the pattern of dendrite outgrowth in leg motoneurons in a non-cell autonomous manner.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11572.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Sema2a is highly expressed in the ganglionic midline and intermediate region.</title><p>Immunocytochemical analysis of expression of Sema1a and Sema2a in prothoracic ganglion at 25h APF (after puparium formation).

This phenotype was characterized by a shift of the dendritic arborizations toward the midline as well as by the formation of a prominent ectopic dendritic branch, which projects to the ganglionic midline. In this respect, late-born neurons in the knockdown experiment resemble early-born neurons in the wild type. To confirm this dendritic arborization phenotype, we used the VGN9281-Gal4 driver line to target PlexB knockdown to specific late-born motoneurons (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brierley et al., 2009</xref>). This resulted in the expected dendritic arborization phenotypes in targeted motoneurons, in that these late-born motoneurons, which normally restrict their dendritic arbors to lateral domains, mis-projected major dendritic branches toward the ganglionic midline (data not shown).</p><p>Targeted knockdown of Sema2a in leg motoneurons using the OK371-Gal4 driver had no effect on dendritic arbors of late-born or early-born motoneurons (data not shown). This corresponds to the lack of locomotor defects in behavioral experiments in which Sema2a RNAi was targeted to leg motoneurons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and supports the notion that Sema2a might not act cell autonomously in motoneurons. Since immunolabeling studies showed that Sema2a expression in the neuropile is most prominent in/and near midline (glial) cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we carried out a targeted knockdown of Sema2a in glial/midline cells using either the glial-specific Repo-Gal4 driver or the midline-specific Slit-Gal4 driver.</p><p>In both cases, Sema2a knockdown resulted in clear dendritic arborization defects of leg motoneurons. Moreover, these defects were observed in late-born motoneurons but not in early-born motoneurons. Thus, following targeted knockdown of Sema2a in glial cells, late-born motoneurons, which normally restrict their dendritic arbors to lateral domains, shift their dendritic arbors medially and mis-project major dendritic branches toward the ganglionic midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Comparable mis-projection phenotypes were seen in dendrites of late born motoneurons in animals of the genotype Sema2a/+; PlexB/+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Upon this dendritic mis-projection in late-born motoneurons, dendritic arborizations of these motoneurons acquired morphological characteristics of arborizations of normal early born neurons.</p><p>To investigate if overexpressing Sema1a (or Sema2a) in the midline repels dendritic arbors of early born motoneurons from the midline, with these motor neurons acquiring morphological characterists of late-born neurons, we carried out a targeted over-expression of Sema1a (or Sema2a) using the midline-specific Slit-Gal4 driver. In this case, the dendritic arborization of early born neurons appeared to be normal (data not shown).</p><p>Taken together these experiments indicate that PlexB/Sema2a signaling is required for the formation of correct dendritic projections of late-born leg motoneurons. Moreover, they imply that the requirement in these motoneurons is cell autonomous for PlexB and non-cell autonomous (i.e. glial/midline cell-derived) for Sema2a.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report, we analyze the role of the Plexin/Semaphorin signaling system in the formation of appropriate axonal and dendritic structures in the adult-specific leg motoneurons of Drosophila. Our findings reveal multiple roles of different Semaphorins and Plexins in axon guidance in the periphery and in dendritic targeting in the central neuropile for these motoneurons. In the following, we discuss the major implications of these findings.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Plexins and Semaphorins in motoneuron axon guidance</title><p>During development, motoneurons extend axons over relatively long distances from the thoracic ganglia to the numerous muscles located within their peripheral targets. During this process, multiple guidance cues act to ensure that the motoneurons establish their complex innervation patterns with high precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Raper and Mason, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011</xref>). As motoneurons navigate into the periphery, they often initially fasciculate with each other to form nerve branches and, once they reach their general target regions, defasciculate and exit their nerve branches to innervate specific muscles. Repulsive Semaphorin signaling through Plexin receptors has been implicated in this process in vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pasterkamp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2012</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Plexin/Semaphorin signaling has been studied in the development of the embryonically generated motoneurons that innervate the larval body wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Winberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayoob et al., 2006</xref>). Sema1a acting through PlexA has been shown to be important for the regulation of motoneuron axon defasciculation through axon-axon repulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Winberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2000</xref>). Similarly, Sema2a acting through PlexB is required for correct motoneuron axon defasciculation, but also has additional functions in motoneuron axon navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matthes et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayoob et al., 2006</xref>) implying that PlexA/Sema1a and PlexB/Sema2a have both shared and distinct function in motor axon guidance.</p><p>Our analysis of axonal targeting in leg motoneurons indicates that the PlexA/Sema1a signaling system is also required in postembryonic development of adult-specific motoneurons. Targeted knockdown of PlexA or Sema1a in leg motoneurons results in prominent defasciculation and targeting defects of their axons in the periphery. Interestingly, different types of defects are seen in the innervation of proximal versus distal leg muscles. In the innervation of the proximal femur muscles, PlexA/Sema1a knockdown results in phenotypes indicative of defective axon defasciculation and decreased branching. In contrast, in the innervation of the distal tibia muscles, PlexA/Sema1a knockdown results in phenotypes indicative of increased axonal branching. Thus, both decrease and increase of motor axon branching can result if PlexA/Sema1a action in leg motoneurons is impaired. At the cellular level, both these phenotypes may be due to defects in early born femur motoneurons which manifest a loss of appropriate proximal femoral innervation and gain tibial innervation. In addition, increased arborization of targeted late-born tibial motoneurons in the distal tibia is also likely to contribute to the observed phenotypes. These findings suggest that the same Plexin/Semaphorin signaling system might have multiple roles in motor axon guidance. Since these different effects appear to be motoneuron-specific, they may be linked to motoneuron birth-order.</p><p>An interesting feature of all the PlexA/Sema1a phenotypes observed in our experiments is that they are the result of knockdowns limited to motoneurons, either in their ensemble or in specific small sets. In all cases, the motoneurons that manifest these peripheral axonal defasciculation and targeting defects are the only cells in the leg that have impaired levels of PlexA/Sema1a. In this respect, the requirement of both PlexA and Sema1 for correct axonal targeting is autonomous to leg motoneurons. This suggests that PlexA/Sema1a signaling might be at the level of axon-axon interactions. A role of Plexin/Semaphorin signaling in axon-axon interactions has been documented in the developing visual and olfactory systems of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sweeney et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hsieh et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, cis-interactions between PlexA and Sema1a within the affected motoneuron axons might also be involved. In murine models, cis- interactions between Sema6A and PlexA4 have been shown to modulate the repulsive response to Sema6A in sympathetic and sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Haklai-Topper et al., 2010</xref>). While our experiments document an autonomous requirement of PlexA/Sema1a within the ensemble of leg motoneurons, they do not rule out the existence of PlexA/Sema1a signaling between outgrowing motor axons and their target muscles in the leg. Thus, it will be important to study both the expression and function of Plexin/Semaphorin signaling in the developing leg muscles.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Plexins and Semaphorins in motoneuron dendrite targeting</title><p>During development, motoneurons must not only project their axons to the appropriate postsynaptic target muscles, they must also ensure that their dendrites, as major input sites, are positioned correctly in the neuropile in order to receive the appropriate presynaptic drive from pre-motor interneurons and sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Parrish et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vrieseling and Arber, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arber, 2012</xref>). Although the mechanisms that control this type of targeted dendritogenesis are poorly understood, recent work on embryonic and adult-specific leg motoneurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> indicate that their dendrites are organized topographically as myotopic maps that reflect their innervation pattern in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Landgraf et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brierley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baek and Mann, 2009</xref>).</p><p>For leg motoneurons, the majority of which are generated post-embryonically in a single neuroblast lineage, a birth-order dependent pattern of dendritic targeting and of peripheral innervation has been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brierley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2012</xref>). Thus, early-born motoneurons, which innervate proximal muscle groups, position their dendrites in medial and lateral neuropile, while late-born motoneurons, which innervate distal muscle groups, elaborate their dendrites in the lateral neuropile only, and intermediate-born motoneurons target their dendrites to intermediate neuropile positions. Irrespective of their birth-order, all leg motoneurons initiate dendritogenesis synchronously and form their dendritic arbors in a targeted manner by growing into their appropriate area of innervation. Leg motoneuron dendrites attain their final architecture through targeted dendritogenesis. Apart from the intrinsic signaling cues, extrinsic cues could be implicated in this process. Although glia are known to secrete cues and neurotropic factors for axonal morphogenesis and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jacobs, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zlatic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klämbt et al., 1991</xref>), their role in regulation of dendritic morphology is relatively unexplored. While recent findings in vertebrates and invertebrates suggest that glia could play a role in dendritogenesis, the mechanism underlying these effects is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Procko and Shaham, 2010</xref>). Midline glia extend gliopodia during axonogenesis, and reducing their numbers also leads to the shift in neuropil during embryonic nervous system development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vasenkova et al., 2006</xref>) suggesting that these could also play a role in dendritogenesis. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms involved in dendritic development of leg motoneurons has focused on the role of Slit/Roundabout and the Netrin/Frazzled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brierley et al., 2009</xref>) signaling systems in controlling the precise targeting of motoneuron dendrites along the medio-lateral axis of the ganglionic neuropile. While Slit/Netrin could be derived from midline glia, the role of other midline cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kearney et al., 2004</xref>) has not been ruled out. In this context, the substantially broader expression pattern of Sema2a, compared to that of Slit (which is restricted to the midline) is pertinent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Dendritic targeting in larval motoneurons, which are of embryonic in origin is independent of glial differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Landgraf et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Landgraf and Thor, 2006</xref>). Our investigation of dendritic targeting of leg motoneurons in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> provides further insight into the role of glia in the control of dendritogenesis. Moreover, they identify PlexB/Sema2a as additional signaling system that mediates this control. Our data are in accordance with a model in which Sema2a is secreted from midline and other glial cells and acts through the PlexB receptor to restrict dendrites of late-born motoneurons to appropriate lateral neuropile domains. Loss of PlexB in these motoneurons as well as loss of Sema2a from glial cells, as seen by using both Repo-Gal4 and Slit-Gal4 drivers, results in a medial shift in dendritic arbors together with the mis-projection of dendrites toward the midline. As a result, the affected dendrites of late-born neurons acquire the topographic morphology of normal early-born neurons in the ganglionic neuropile. Since cells at/and near the ganglionic midline express high levels of Sema2a, and since targeted knockdown of Sema 2a specifically in glial cells using Repo-Gal4 results in the mis-positioning of late-born motoneuron dendrites, we postulate that glial cells provide the secreted Sema2a, which acts on dendrite targeting in late-born motoneurons. Thus, while the requirement of PlexB for dendrite targeting in late-born motoneurons is cell autonomous, the requirement of Sema2a is non-cell autonomous and presumably is provided through secretion from glial cells. We also observe a dorso-ventral gradient of Sema1a and Sema2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests a role in dorso-ventral patterning as well, an aspect which we have not examined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Multiple roles of Plexin/Semaphorin signaling systems in central and peripheral motoneuron circuitry development</title><p>Taken together, our findings indicate that two different Plexin/Semaphorin signaling systems act to play a range of roles in establishing the specific leg motoneuron architecture needed for appropriate motor circuitry. PlexA/Sema1a is required for correct peripheral axon guidance, and for both PlexA and Sema1a this requirement is motoneuron-specific. PlexB/Sema2a is required for correct central dendrite targeting, and while this requirement is motoneuron-specific for PlexB, the requirement for Sema2a in motoneurons is non-cell autonomous and likely involves glial cells. Interestingly, while PlexA/Sema1a appears to be required for both early-born and late-born motoneuron axon guidance, PlexB/Sema2a appears to be required for late-born, but not for early-born motoneuron dendritic patterning.</p><p>The relative independence of action of these two different Plexin/Semaphorin signaling systems in axon guidance and dendrite targeting of leg motoneurons suggests that both developmental processes could, in principle operate at separate times. This seems unlikely as timeline analysis indicates that both peripheral axonal outgrowth and central dendritic targeting of leg motoneurons occur at the same/overlapping times during postembryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brierley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2012</xref>). The molecular mechanisms that orchestrate this simultaneous formation of axonal and dendritic arbors are not known. Possible mechanisms include cell-intrinsic temporal modulation of transcription factors controlling guidance molecule expression as well as retrograde feedback from the innervated muscle targets as seen in the vertebrate spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vrieseling and Arber, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Enriquez et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our behavioral experiments indicate that specific experimental perturbations in the expression levels of the Plexin/Semaphorin signaling systems result in abnormal walking behavior. Moreover, they show that the same molecular perturbations also result in defective axonal and dendritic branching and arborization patterns in leg motoneurons. Although other effects of the Plexin/Semaphorin signaling systems on the neural circuitry for walking control may exist, the striking correlation between perturbation in leg motoneuron architecture and defective walking behavior provides further support for the idea that peripheral and central architecture is likely to be important for the function of the motoneurons involved in the neural circuitry for walking.</p><p>Although we did not observe any defective footprint pattern using the soot plate assay, following Sema2a knockdown in midline/glia using Repo-Gal4 or mid-line specific Slit-Gal4 (data not shown), we do not rule out the possibility of other intricate walking parameters e.g. speed, stance, swing-duration or stance linearity etc. being affected in this case. Given the conservation of molecular cues involved in the development of neuronal morphology and connectivity, further insight into the Plexin/Semaphorin-dependent mechanisms that operate in motoneuron development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is likely to be of general importance for understanding the basis of circuit formation in all parts of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pasterkamp, 2012</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains and genetics</title><p>The following fly strains were used;</p><p>OK371-Gal4,UAS-mCD8GFP, UAS-dicer; OK371-Gal4,UAS-mCD8GFP, Repo-Gal4, Slit-Gal4, VGN9281-Gal4,UAS-mCD8GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brierley et al., 2009</xref>), VGN6341-Gal4,UAS-mCD8GFP, R60B11-Gal4 (39238; Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center).

In brief, Syed et al. identified a role for Sema/Plexin signaling in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> motorneuron (MN) development by RNAi screening and behavioral gait analysis. Sema1/PlexA control innervation of proximal and distal leg muscles in a cell autonomous manner, Sema2a is likely secreted by midline glia and specifically affects late born MNs via neuronal PlexB. The authors show that Sema2a is highly expressed in the midline, thus preventing extension of dendritic arbors to medial positions. The data are considered to be uniformly high quality and sufficiently innovative and of broad enough appeal to justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>There are two areas that the reviewers consider necessary to unquestionably substantiate the author's major conclusions. First, there were concerns regarding the reliance on RNAi. All reviewers acknowledge the challenges that are faced by the authors, working with genes on the 4th chromosome and there was considerable dialogue on how best to substantiate these data within a reasonable timeline. Ideally, the authors would be able to use MARCM, allowing genetic analysis within small numbers of cells. However, it was acknowledged that this may not be a reasonable request due to the position of the genes on the 4th chromosome. Alternative controls are suggested below. Second, there was discussion about bringing the level of resolution down to individual or small numbers of axons, and extending the quantitative analysis of dendrite morphology.</p><p>1) All reviewers shared a concern about the reliance on RNAi-based phenotypes. It would be highly advisable to include some controls and additional allelic combinations to corroborate these interesting findings.</p><p>1A) The authors used Sema1a alleles and Sema1a/PlexA trans-heterozygous animals to corroborate the observed axonal phenotypes, which is helpful. Additional controls could be either rescue with an RNAi resistant transgene, antibody staining showing that RNAi indeed affects Sema1a/2a levels specifically, or the use of additional trans-heterozygous allelic combinations (if available). Since the authors have shown they can detect endogenous Sema1a/2a they could use quantitative immunohistochemistry to confirm the specificity of the RNAi knockdown.</p><p>1B) For the PlexB/Sema2a data, it is suggested that the authors look at phenotypes in trans-heterozygous mutant animals and Sema2a immunostainings in the glial Sema2a RNAi knockdown. It might also be feasible to overexpress Sema1a in the midline and look at early born MNs if they are in this case repelled and look more like late born MNs.</p><p>2) The dendrite phenotype due to glial Sema2a or neuronal PlexB knockdown is striking and interesting. Again, an allelic combination of Sema2a/PlexB would be helpful to solidify the phenotype. A more quantitative assessment of the MN dendrite phenotype caused by Sema2a/PlexB knockdown would also be desirable (e.g. total dendrite length vs abnormal branch extending towards the midline).</p><p>3) It would be an important extension to bring the level of analysis down to single cell resolution or sparse labeling. This could be achieved using GAL4 lines with appropriately sparse labeling in order to refine the analysis regarding over/underinnervation of early vs. late born MNs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11572.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>There are two areas that the reviewers consider necessary to unquestionably substantiate the author's major conclusions.

Second, there was discussion about bringing the level of resolution down to individual or small numbers of axons, and extending the quantitative analysis of dendrite morphology. 1) All reviewers shared a concern about the reliance on RNAi-based phenotypes. It would be highly advisable to include some controls and additional allelic combinations to corroborate these interesting findings. 1A) The authors used Sema1a alleles and Sema1a/PlexA trans-heterozygous animals to corroborate the observed axonal phenotypes, which is helpful. Additional controls could be either rescue with an RNAi resistant transgene, antibody staining showing that RNAi indeed affects Sema1a/2a levels specifically, or the use of additional trans-heterozygous allelic combinations (if available). Since the authors have shown they can detect endogenous Sema1a/2a they could use quantitative immunohistochemistry to confirm the specificity of the RNAi knockdown.</italic></p><p>Experiments done: To address the concern 1A, we have tested another trans- heterozygous allelic combination of Sema1a (Sema1a<sup>P1</sup>/Sema1a<sup>P2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I, J</xref>) to corroborate our findings. The phenotype observed is similar to Sema1a homozygous animals (Sema1a<sup>P2</sup>/Sema1a<sup>P2</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H</xref>), and the trans-heterozygous allelic combination (Sema1a<sup>P2</sup>/PlexA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K, L</xref>) and RNAi knockdowns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), where defective motor neuron axonal branching is observed. Decreased defasciculation and branching is seen in the proximal femur and increased axonal branching is observed in motor neurons that innervate tibia.</p><p>Furthermore, over expression of Sema1a and PlexA in both Femur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M-T</xref>) and tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M-T</xref>) show phenotypes ‘opposite’ to that seen in knockdowns and mutants. Finally, we have used multiple RNAi’s that target different regions of Sema1a and Plex A. All of them show similar phenotype upon RNAi induced knockdown in motor neurons.</p><p><italic>1B) For the PlexB/Sema2a data, it is suggested that the authors look at phenotypes in trans-heterozygous mutant animals and Sema2a immunostainings in the glial Sema2a RNAi knockdown. It might also be feasible to overexpress Sema1a in the midline and look at early born MNs if they are in this case repelled and look more like late born MNs.</italic></p><p>Experiments done: To address the concern 1B, we performed the following experiments;</p><p>i) We tested the dendritic targeting in Sema2a/PlexB trans-heterozygous mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Late-born motor neurons that normally restrict their dendritic arbors towards the lateral regions of the ganglionic neuropile, mis-project their dendrites towards the midline. The phenotype is similar to Sema2a knockdown in glia or Plex B knockdown in motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The Sema2a RNAi has been widely used by others and has been shown to reduce levels of Sema2a (Sweeney et al., Neuron, 2011).</p><p>ii) We over-expressed Sema1a in midline and looked at the dendritic arborisation of early born-motor neurons. These neurons normally project a major dendritic branch towards the midline. Following over-expression of Sema1a or Sema2a at the midline using midline specific Slit-Gal4 driver, we did not observe any effect on the dendritic arborisation of early born motor- neurons (data not shown).</p><p><italic>2) The dendrite phenotype due to glial Sema2a or neuronal PlexB knockdown is striking and interesting. Again, an allelic combination of Sema2a/PlexB would be helpful to solidify the phenotype. A more quantitative assessment of the MN dendrite phenotype caused by Sema2a/PlexB knockdown would also be desirable (e.g. total dendrite length vs abnormal branch extending towards the midline).</italic></p><p>Experiments done:Sema2a/PlexB trans-heterozygous allelic combination was tested as explained above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The phenotype is the extension of major primary dendritic branch towards the midline which is never observed in controls. This is striking that and is a Yes/No phenotype. It should be noted that in dye backfilling all secondary branches are not marked, so quantification in terms of pixel intensity will give variation and lead to artifacts.</p><p><italic>3) It would be an important extension to bring the level of analysis down to single cell resolution or sparse labeling. This could be achieved using GAL4 lines with appropriately sparse labeling in order to refine the analysis regarding over/underinnervation of early vs. late born MNs.</italic></p><p>Experiments done: To address concern 3, we had already shown, using the VGN6341-Gal4 driver that marks just 3-4 motor neurons that innervate femur (early born motor neurons) and 1-2 motor neurons that innervate tibia (late-born motor neurons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, in addition we have now used R60B11-Gal4 that marks 3-4 motor neurons that innervate femur and 2-3 motor neurons that innervate tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also used VGN 9281-Gal4 driver that marks a single motor neuron that innervates distal most muscle of the tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
