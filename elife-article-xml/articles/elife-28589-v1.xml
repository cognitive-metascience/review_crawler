from their surroundings. For mammal ancestors, anatomical clues suggest that endothermy originated during the Permian or Triassic. Here we investigate the origin of mammalian thermoregulation by analysing apatite stable oxygen isotope compositions (δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub>) of some of their Permo-Triassic therapsid relatives. Comparing of the δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> values of therapsid bone and tooth apatites to those of co-existing non-therapsid tetrapods, demonstrates different body temperatures and thermoregulatory strategies. It is proposed that cynodonts and dicynodonts independently acquired constant elevated thermometabolism, respectively within the Eucynodontia and Lystrosauridae + Kannemeyeriiformes clades. We conclude that mammalian endothermy originated in the Epicynodontia during the middle-late Permian. Major global climatic and environmental fluctuations were the most likely selective pressures on the success of such elevated thermometabolism.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28589.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28589.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28589.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>School textbooks often refer to “cold-blooded” and “warm-blooded” animals, but these terms are misleading. Rather than being cold, animals like reptiles have body temperatures that are mostly determined by their external environment and can actually achieve high body temperatures, for example, by basking in the sun. By contrast, “warm-blooded” mammals produce their own heat and typically maintain a body temperature that is warmer than their environment. As such, so-called warm-blooded animals are more accurately referred to as “endotherms” and cold-blooded animals as “ectotherms”.</p><p>Endothermic animals share several characteristics, including insulating layers – like fur or feathers – that keep the body warm, and a secondary palate that separates the mouth and nose for continuous breathing, even while eating. Many of these traits are seen in fossils belonging to a group of animals called the therapsids. Also known as the “mammal-like reptiles”, these animals are descended from ectothermic reptiles but are the ancestors of the endothermic mammals. They dominated the land between 270 and 220 million years ago, during periods of time called the Permian and the Triassic. They also survived two major mass extinction events, including the most devastating mass extinction in all of Earth’s history. However, when the ancestors of mammals became truly endothermic remains an open question. Previous studies that have tried to determine this by focusing on the physical characteristics of therapsids have not yet given a consistent date.</p><p>Rey et al. took a new approach to answer when endothermy first evolved in the mammal-like reptiles, and instead looked at the chemical makeup of minerals in over 100 fossils. Oxygen can exist in different forms called stable isotopes: oxygen-16 and the rarer and heavier oxygen-18. The ratio of these two isotopes in a fossil will depend on, among other things, where the animal lived and, importantly, its body temperature. Therefore, Rey et al. compared oxygen-containing minerals in the bones and teeth of therapsids to those of other animals that lived alongside them to look for signatures that indicated differences in body temperature and how it was regulated.</p><p>It appears that two different branches of the therapsid’s family tree independently became endothermic. One branch includes the mammals and their direct ancestors, while the second is more distantly related to mammals. Both became endothermic towards the end of the Permian Period, between about 259 and 252 million years ago. Based on these findings, Rey et al. suggest that endothermy allowed these animals to better cope with fluctuating climates, which helped them to be among the few species that survived the mass extinction event at the end of the Permian.</p><p>Going forward, these new findings can help scientists to understand which physical characteristics were necessary for endothermy to first develop and which helped to optimize it afterwards. Furthermore, they also suggest that endothermic animals are more able to survive fluctuations in climate, which could guide efforts to protect modern-day endangered species that are most at risk from the ongoing effects of climate change.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28589.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28589.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>therapsids</kwd><kwd>endothermy</kwd><kwd>stable isotopes</kwd><kwd>permo-triassic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004617</institution-id><institution>Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amiot</surname><given-names>Romain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Palaeontological Scientific Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubidge</surname><given-names>Bruce S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001321</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubidge</surname><given-names>Bruce S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Centre of Excellence in Palaeosciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubidge</surname><given-names>Bruce S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Basic Research Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012CB821900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amiot</surname><given-names>Romain</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Basic Research Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012CB821902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004795</institution-id><institution>Institut Universitaire de France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lécuyer</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two therapsid clades, dicynodonts and cynodonts, independently acquired and developed an endotherm-like thermoregulation during the Late Permian period, that probably helped them to survive the major global climate and environmental fluctuations of the end-Permian.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One key adaptation enabling tetrapods to cope with fluctuating climatic conditions was the acquisition of endothermy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Paaijmans et al., 2013</xref>). This character is defined here as the ability to actively produce body heat through metabolic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>). Its development and anchoring in populations constitutes a major step in vertebrate evolution because it modified the energy relationships between organisms and their environments. By actively raising and maintaining body temperature within a narrow range that allows optimal physiological and biochemical functioning, endothermic vertebrates are able to colonise environments with extreme thermal conditions, for example freezing at high latitudes and altitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Day et al., 2015</xref>). Endothermy is commonly associated with homeothermy, being the capacity to regulate the body heat through metabolic activity as well. This combination corresponds to one end of a gradient of thermoregulatory strategies observed in living animals. The other end of the spectrum is ectothermy combined with poïkilothermy which animals use as a thermoregulatory strategy to increase their body temperature toward optimal levels by using external heat sources. Their body temperature therefore traces that of their surroundings and is the most commonly occurring energy saving strategy. Amongst modern vertebrates, various thermoregulatory strategies have been adopted between these two end-members, such as regional endothermy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bernal et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Katz, 2002</xref>) or inertial homeothermy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">McNab and Auffenberg, 1976</xref>), and only birds and mammals fall within the endothermy end of the spectrum. It has been proposed that bird thermoregulation originated within non-avian dinosaurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Seebacher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amiot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Grady et al., 2014</xref>), or even earlier within basal archosauriforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Farmer and Carrier, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">de Ricqlès et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Seymour et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Summers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gower et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Legendre et al., 2016</xref>). Various approaches have been tried by many researchers to assess the origin of mammalian endothermy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">McNab, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett and Ruben, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Farmer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hillenius, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kemp, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Khaliq et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Owerkowicz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benoit et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Crompton et al., 2017</xref>). Some consider the appearance of endothermy to have either occurred during the transition from basal synapsid ‘pelycosaurs’ to therapsids, and to be either due to a shift in foraging ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hopson, 2012</xref>) or due to a response to the availability of a seasonally arid, savanna-like biome by the end of the Early Permian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kemp, 2006b</xref>).</p><p>How and why endothermy evolved in mammals remains a contentious issue, mostly because of the very low fossilization potential of anatomical and behavioural features associated with thermoregulation. Amongst the latter features, the presence of hair as an insulating integument is unequivocally associated with endothermy in all extant mammals. The oldest synapsid fossils preserved with fur imprints are <italic>Castorocauda</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ji et al., 2006</xref>) and <italic>Megaconus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). These early relatives of mammals were recovered from the Middle-Late Jurassic of China, implying that hair and fur appeared before ~165 Ma. The occurrence of retracted, fully ossified and non-ramified infraorbital canals (a structure associated with the presence of maxillary vibrissae) within non-mammaliaform Prozostrodontia, implies an older age of approximately 240 to 246 Ma for the occurrence of fur and hair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benoit et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><p>Another anatomical character interpreted as associated with endothermy is the bony secondary palate. This is a feature associated with efficient respiratory capabilities considered to be linked to the high energy required for elevated metabolic rates. In some Triassic non-mammaliamorph therapsids, bauriid therocephalians and cynodonts, a bony secondary palate is fully developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdala et al., 2014</xref>). It is noteworthy that a complete bony secondary palate is also present in dicynodonts, however it is primarily formed by the premaxilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">King, 1988</xref>) and not the maxilla as documented in therocephalians, cynodonts and extant mammals. Although a secondary osseous palate is ubiquitous in mammals, it also occurs in a few ectotherms (crocodiles, scincid lizards), thus questioning its direct link to endothermy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett and Ruben, 1986</xref>).</p><p>Almost all extant endotherms possess nasal turbinate bones covered with mucosa that reduce heat loss and moisten air during respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Owerkowicz et al., 2015</xref>). This feature, absent in extant ectotherms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Witmer, 1995</xref>), may have been present in therocephalian, cynodont and dicynodont therapsids, as postulated from bony ridges in the nasal cavities interpreted as supports for the turbinate complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hillenius, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Crompton et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A peculiar histological structure of fast-growing bone associated with highly vascularised woven-fibred matrix and primary osteons known as fibrolamellar bone (FLB), is another feature often used as evidence of a high metabolic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Montes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Legendre et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, several bone palaeohistological studies have addressed the quest for the presence of FLB in therapsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">de Ricqlès, 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Botha, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Botha and Chinsamy, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Olivier et al., 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ray et al. (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Olivier et al. (2017)</xref> analysed several therapsid groups (anomodont, gorgonopsian, therocephalian, cynodont) and found FLB in some genera (<italic>Aelurognathus</italic>, <italic>Pristerognathus</italic>, <italic>Tritylodon, Oudenodon, Lystrosaurus, Moghreberia</italic>), suggesting sustained fast growth, and thus elevated metabolic activity. The presence of FLB has also been demonstrated in some earlier non-therapsid synapsids such as <italic>Sphenacodon</italic>, <italic>Dimetrodon</italic> or even <italic>Ophiacodon</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Huttenlocker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Shelton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Shelton and Sander, 2017</xref>). However, FLB also occurs in a few ectotherms such as in some turtles and crocodilians, and is absent in small mammals and passerine birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bouvier, 1977</xref>), showing that FLB is mostly correlated with high growth rates, which does not always correlate to high metabolic rates. Therefore, these characters alone cannot be considered as definitive evidence of endothermy, leaving the question of the timing and selection pressure for the origin of mammal endothermy still heavily debated.</p><p>Because the oxygen isotope fractionation between bone or tooth phosphate and body fluids is temperature dependent, and phosphate has a strong resistance to diagenetic alteration, oxygen isotope compositions of therapsid apatite phosphate (δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub>) has been used in this pilot study to investigate the origin of mammalian endothermy. Indeed the δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> value of vertebrate apatite (bone, tooth) reflects both the oxygen isotope composition of the animal body water (δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>bw</sub>) and its body temperature (T<sub>b</sub>).

A parsimonious interpretation would imply rooting the origin of mammal endothermy within non-Eucynodontia Epicynodontia, between the end-Permian and the earliest Triassic. According to our results, the closest sampled relative of Eucynodontia, the late Permian basal cynodont (SAM-PK-K05339), was probably ectothermic. Therefore the origin of mammal endothermy could have taken place among ‘intermediate’ groups belonging to the Epicynodontia (such as <italic>Cynosaurus</italic> from the latest Permian or <italic>Thrinaxodon</italic> from the Early Triassic of South Africa) that have in the past been considered to have been endothermic, based on anatomical features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hillenius and Ruben, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benoit et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2016a</xref>).</p><p>In agreement with recent phylogenies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kemp, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Ruta et al., 2013</xref>), endothermic-like body temperature regulations seem to root sometime during the late Permian (Lopingian) independently within the L+K and Epicynodontia clades, the latter being at the origin of mammal endothermy.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis considers that both the L+K and Epicynodontia clades possessed a homologous endothermy inherited from their direct common ancestors, the basal Neotherapsida (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests that biochemical and physiological mechanisms enabling mammal endothermy, appeared at the base of the neotherapsids during the middle Permian, which is a conclusion recently published based on the paleohistology of some dicynodonts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Olivier et al., 2017</xref>). In our case, the absence of an endothermic signal in the sampled Permian therapsids could be due to an endothermy being only seasonal, linked to the presence of a cold season or to the reproduction period (as observed today in some reptile species; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Tattersall et al., 2016</xref>), which would not be visible in a bulk signal. Therefore, effective acquisition of mammal ‘true endothermy’ was expressed independently within these two lineages, possibly as a result of extrinsic factors.</p><p>Global and regional palaeoclimate reconstructions show a cooling trend toward the end-Permian, followed by an abrupt and intense warming at the Permian-Triassic Boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Rey et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, most of the therapsid clades which survived the end-Permian mass extinction were supposedly endothermic. It thus appears that climatic fluctuations may have acted as selective pressures which favoured or ‘activated’ elevated thermometabolic capabilities within therapsids, at the origins of mammal endothermy. A possible explanation could be the acquisition of a fast growth rate due to the high metabolic rate of the endothermy. According to a recent palaeohistology study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Botha-Brink et al., 2016</xref>), Early Triassic therapsids, such as <italic>Lystrosaurus</italic> or even therocephalians and cynodonts, had a high growth rate allowing them to reach reproductive maturity within a few seasons and compensate their shortened life expectancies.

From Xinjiang Province, two localities in the Jiucaiyuan Formation have been sampled and are considered Early Triassic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Metcalfe et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Calculation of palaeogeographic coordinates of the sampling sites was performed after careful selection of the magnetic poles of West Gondwana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Muttoni et al., 2001</xref>), North China ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">et al., 1992</xref>), South Jungar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Choulet et al., 2013</xref>) and the Alashan terrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Meng, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Yuan and Yang, 2015</xref>). The Apparent Polar Wander Path (APWP) of South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Torsvik et al., 2012</xref>) was used to constrain the palaeolatitudinal position of the South African and Lesotho fossil sites.

Silver phosphate was quantitatively precipitated in a thermostatic bath set at a temperature of 70°C. After filtration, washing with double deionized water and drying at 50°C, an aliquot of 300 μg of Ag<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> was mixed with 300 μg of nickelised carbon in a silver reaction capsule. Silver phosphate was then reduced into CO to measure its <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lécuyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Fourel et al., 2011</xref>). Each sample was heated at 1450°C by pyrolysis using a VarioPYROcube EA system (Elementar) interfaced to an IsoPrime isotope ratio mass spectrometer working in continuous flow mode at the UMR CNRS 5276 LGLTPE, University Claude Bernard Lyon 1.</p><p>Isotopic compositions are quoted in the standard δ notation relative to V-SMOW. Silver phosphate precipitated from standard NBS120c (natural Miocene phosphorite from Florida) was repeatedly analysed (δ<sup>18</sup>O = 21.71 ± 0.20‰; n = 30) along with the silver phosphate samples derived from the tetrapod remains. For the oxygen isotope analysis of apatite carbonate, about 10 mg of tooth or bone powder was pre-treated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Koch et al., 1997</xref>). Powders were washed with a 2% NaOCl solution to remove organic matter, then rinsed five times with double deionized water and air-dried at 40°C for 24 hr. Potential secondary carbonate was removed by adding 0.1 M acetic acid and leaving for 24 hr, after which the powder was again rinsed five times with double deionized water and air-dried at 40°C for 24 hr. The powder/solution ratio was kept constant at 0.04 g mL<sup>−1</sup> for both treatments. Stable isotope ratios were determined by using a Thermo Finnigan Gasbench II at the geochemistry laboratory of the Institute of Geology and Geophysics (Chinese Academy of Sciences, China). For each sample, an aliquot of 2 mg of pre-treated apatite was reacted with 5 drops of supersaturated orthophosphoric acid at 72°C for one hour under a He atmosphere before starting 10 measurement cycles of the isotopic composition of the CO<sub>2</sub> produced with a Finnigan MAT 253 continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The measured oxygen isotopic compositions were normalized relative to the NBS-19 calcite standard and have a reproducibility index better than ±0.2‰. Isotopic compositions are quoted in the standard δ notation relative to V-SMOW.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Robustness of the stable isotope record</title><p>Analysed materials consist of bone or tooth dentine, which is more porous than enamel with small and less densely inter-grown apatite crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Mills, 1967</xref>). Thus, their original stable isotope compositions are more prone to diagenetic alteration that may have taken place through precipitation of secondary minerals within and at the surface of bioapatite crystals, adsorption of ions on the surface of apatite crystals, or dissolution and recrystallization with isotopic exchange. The samples from South Africa have been previously tested for primary preservation through comparison between their δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> values, δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>c</sub> values and carbonate content on the basis of the following considerations: (1) the carbonate content in apatite of modern vertebrates typically ranges from less than 1% up to 13.4%. Thus, samples that have a carbonate content exceeding 13.4 wt% likely contain additional inorganic carbonate precipitated from diagenetic fluids, and would result in potentially biased δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>c</sub> values of apatite carbonate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); (2) In modern vertebrates, the oxygen isotope composition of apatite carbonate is higher than that of co-occurring apatite phosphate (7–9 ‰ in mammals), and up to 14.7‰ in sharks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Vennemann et al., 2001</xref>). Experimental ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">et al., 1967</xref>) and empirical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zazzo et al., 2004b</xref>) have shown that microbially-mediated diagenetic alteration of apatite phosphate results in a greater difference between δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>c</sub> and δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> values. Therefore, fossil samples exhibiting δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>c</sub>-δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> differences larger than 14.7‰ are most likely altered and can be disregarded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Inorganic alteration at low temperature has little effect on the δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> values of phosphates, even at geological time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lecuyer et al., 1999</xref>), so samples affected by inorganic diagenetic alteration of carbonates, (resulting either in a high overall carbonate content or anomalous δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>c</sub>-δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> differences), may still preserve the original oxygen isotope composition of their phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Using these two assessments, newly measured δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> values are considered to have preserved their original isotopic signatures and can be interpreted in terms of ecologies and physiologies.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28589.007</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Isotopic preservation assessment.</title><p>δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>c</sub>-δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> differences between teeth and bones plotted against the structural carbonate content (wt%) of apatite. Samples that have δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>c</sub>-δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> differences higher than 14.7‰ are considered doubtful as regards potential diagenetic alteration (see text). For carbonate contents (wt%) higher than 13.4%, the δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>c</sub> values are considered to be inherited from inorganic diagenetic processes. A high difference between δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>c</sub> and δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> is interpreted as the result of a microbially-mediated alteration of the apatite phosphate or too high δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>c</sub> values resulting from the addition of inorganic carbonate or isotopic exchange with an external source of inorganic carbon.

Please apply these general principles of scientific paper writing properly and reorganize and rationalize the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>General comments: This paper uses comparisons of stable oxygen isotope ratios of Permian-Jurassic non-mammalian synapsids to their contemporaries to try to infer when an endothermic metabolism arose in the lineage leading to mammals. The results are thought provoking, but I think a number of changes and additions will need to be made before the paper is ready to accept. I've made a number of comments and suggestions below, but a few general issues that must be addressed:</p><p>1) I am not an isotope geochemist, and I think it will be important for one to examine the paper. I'm not so worried about the analytic methods, which seem fairly standard, but I think it would be good to get a more informed perspective on the method the authors use to predict the expected magnitude of differences between ectotherms and endotherms. This is the foundation of everything else in the paper, so it is important to make sure that this is acceptable.</p><p>2) Assuming the method is acceptable, I strongly recommend that the authors conduct a sensitivity analysis using a range of plausible average temperatures and latitudinal gradients for each of their time periods of interest. Their results will be stronger if they are consistent across the plausible range of values, and it will remove any appearance of cherry-picking temperatures/gradients to get the results that they want.</p><p>3) The authors seem to play pretty fast and loose with the terms &quot;endothermy&quot; and &quot;ecothermy.&quot; A particular manifestation of this is the frequency with which they use bone histology (particularly the presence of fibrolamellar bone) as a correlate of endothermy. Although this was more common in earlier work on paleohistology, more recently the field has been much more circumspect about this relationship, with much more attention placed (rightly, in my opinion) on the implications of histology for growth rates/patterns. Elevated growth rates often are correlated with &quot;endothermy&quot; but this is not universally true. I think the authors need to be more thoughtful in their presentation of this relationship, and they also should provide more explicit, detailed definitions of &quot;endothermy&quot; and &quot;ecothermy&quot; at the start of the paper.</p><p>4) I recommended some changes to the discussion that would explore the link between endothermy and survivorship during the Permo-Triassic Mass Extinction (PTME) that would increase the broad interest and impact of the paper. Alternatively, the authors could provide a more detailed discussion of their results in the context of previous work and current ideas on the evolution of endothermy. Either way, much of what's in the current disucssion isn't very interesting (and I say this as someone who loves the intricacies of dicynodont taxonomy) and it undersells the paper.</p><p>5) There are a couple places in the main text and supplement that could be strengthened in terms of the references that are cited.</p><p>6) The writing style of the paper is good, but it could be improved upon. I recommend having Rubidge, Smith, and Viglietti go over the final version of the paper to clean things up and make sure the idiom is appropriate.</p><p>Abstract: mammals didn't exist in the Permian, so you should say something along the lines of &quot;endothermy evolved in the Permian ancestors of mammals.&quot;</p><p>Abstract: Cynognathia is a subclade of Eucynodontia, so I'm not sure what you mean here.</p><p>Abstract: change to &quot;originated in Epicynodontia during the…&quot;. Also, change to middle-late Permian.</p><p>Introduction opening sentence: this sentence is quite vague and is kind of meaningless as a result. Please be more specific about particular ways in which environmental changes affect vertebrates if you want to use this kind of example.</p><p>Introduction, first paragraph: as written, this paragraph provides something of a definition of endothermy. However, because endothermy is kind of a loaded term, and has been used in different ways by different authors, I suggest that you explicitly define what you mean by it so as to avoid any confusion.</p><p>Introduction paragraph two: again, defining endothermy will help to avoid confusion about what you mean by &quot;true endotherms.&quot;</p><p>In the same paragraph: I think you're kind of downplaying the amount of work on this subject. For example, McNab, 1978, Hillenius, 1992; 1994, Ruben, Hillenius, Kemp and Quick, 2012, Owerkowicz, Musinsky, Middleton and Crompton, 2015, all would be appropriate to cite here.</p><p>Introduction paragraph four: bony secondary palate would be a better term to use.</p><p>In the same paragraph: Dicynodonts also have a complete secondary palate, although it is formed primarily by the maxilla.</p><p>Introduction paragraph five: Owerkowicz, Musinsky, Middleton and Crompton, 2015, would be especially good to cite in the context of whether turbinates are necessary in the context of mammalian endothermy. Also Laaß (2011) presents some evidence of turbinals in <italic>Lystrosaurus</italic>, although I'm kind of skeptical as to whether that's actually what's visible in the scan.</p><p>Reports of fibrolamellar bone in synapsids go back farther than these studies. For example, de Ricqles reports fibroilamellar bone in some therapsids is in papers on bone histology from the 1970's.</p><p>Fibrolamellar bone is a lot more ubiquitous among therapsids than what you suggest here; if anything it's more common than not. There's even pelycosaur-grade synapsids like <italic>Sphenacodon</italic> and <italic>Ophiacodon</italic> that produce fibrolamellar bone for at least part of their ontogenies.</p><p>In addition to the fact that some non-ectothermic teterapods can produce fibrolamellar bone, and important point to make here is that the presence of fibrolamellar bone really is more a reflection of the rate at which bone tissue is being formed than endothermy in a strict sense. While the high growth rates required to produce fibrolamellar bone often are correlated with high metabolic rates, this is not always the case.</p><p>Introduction paragraph six: although the degree of resistance to diagenesis varies among tissues, with enamel being the more resistant by far.</p><p>Materials and methods section, subsection “Sample collection”: you should provide justification for why you're using these alternate dates. Also, looking at your supplementary table, it seems like some of your dates imply more precision than is actually the case. For example, as far as I know there aren't any published radiometric dates for the Burgersdorp Fm. If you're making the correlation to marine stages (and their dates) using tetrapod biostratigraphy, I would suggest caution in this case, given the recent dates from South America that have been published by Ottone et al., 2014 and Marsicano et al., 2016. In any case more information on the source of your dates should be provided.</p><p>Subsection “Robustness of the stable isotope record”: “contain” instead of “contains”.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: the colouration of the different parts of the plot doesn't seem to be explained. I understand that the dark orange area at the top right is the area that represents diagenesis, but do the other coloured regions have some meaning?</p><p>Subsection “Robustness of the stable isotope record”: does partial preservation of the isotopic signal require different interpretation than pristine preservation?</p><p>In the same subsection: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> is repeated here. Do you mean 2A, 3A, and 4A?</p><p>Would it be better to refer to the colours instead of light and dark gray? Since the journal is primarily an online publication the colour online/grayscale printed version seems like it isn't really a concern, and referring to the colours would help readers understand the figures.</p><p>Permian Therapsids general comment: I recommend reorganizing this section a little. I think it would be most logical to present the results subdivided by time (i.e., all middle Permian things first, then early late Permian, then latest Permian). Within each time bin, you can subdivide further by geographic area.</p><p>Early-Middle Triassic Therapsids general comment: as with the Permian taxa, I think it would be most useful to subdivide the results first by time and then by geography.</p><p>Subsection “Early to Middle Triassic therapsids”: because bone histology is really more a record of growth rates, it might be better to say something along the lines of &quot;…which is consistent with the elevated growth rates implied by the bone histology of <italic>Erythrosuchus</italic>.&quot;</p><p>I think the paragraph describing the results on the Chinese <italic>Lystrosaurid</italic> should be combined with the previous paragraph on the South African specimens. Also, <italic>Lystrosaurus</italic> is the only <italic>Lystrosaurid</italic> known from China, so I would say its safe to assume that it is <italic>Lystrosaurus</italic>.</p><p>In the same subsection and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> you make it seem like it is pretty certain that <italic>Lystrosaurus</italic> is an endotherm. However, in the supplement, you make it seem like there's actually a fair amount of uncertainty based on questions about the ecology of <italic>Lystrosaurus</italic> and the metaboloic status <italic>'Chasmatosaurus'</italic> (which is inferred from information on growth rates inferred from bone histological data from related taxa in South Africa). I think you need to better portray this uncertainty here, and also be sure to take it into account in the Discussion section of the paper.</p><p>Subsection “Middle to Late Triassic therapsids”: contemporary instead of co-existing</p><p>Discussion section and elsewhere: although wordier, something like &quot;the unnamed clade comprising Lystrosauridae + Kannemeyeriiformes&quot; would make more sense.</p><p>Discussion paragraph three: &quot;basal dicynodontoid&quot; would work better.</p><p>Discussion paragraph five: I don't really agree that this is a valid hypothesis. You have a fair number of Permian therapsids from different clades that are reconstructed as being ecothermic, and it seems implausible that you would have so many reversals to ecothermy. In the previous paragraph, you discuss a hypothesis based on a parsimony optimization of the character on the phylogeny. That is justified: you have a clear-cut optimality criterion and you are discussing the best hypothesis under that criterion. I don't think there's any method/optimality criterion that would support the number of reversals needed to account for all so many of your Permian therapsids being reconstructed as endotherms, so the argument is much less sound. If you're doing that, then you can pretty much make up whatever hypothesis you want because there's no constraint on what could be considered plausible.</p><p>In the same paragraph: biochemical instead of biochemicals</p><p>Discussion paragraph seven: assuming that <italic>Lystrosaurus</italic> was indeed an endotherm (see comments above and below), these observations are especially interesting in the context of the changes in growth and life history at the PTB noted by Botha-Brink et al., 2016, among others. This would be something interesting to explore further in the discussion, as well as a more general consideration of the role endothermy played in determining survivorship during the PTME. There's a couple obvious ways to get the space needed to do this. One would be to get rid of the previous paragraph, which I don't think is needed. Likewise, you could get rid of everything from paragraph two, and almost everything in paragraph three.</p><p>Concluding remarks: this is a really stilted way to say that most of your samples preserved an original signal that had not been diagenetically altered. I think you can get rid of most of this (see comments above).</p><p>General comment on the supplement: you should reorganize so that the first section is the one describing how you came up with your theoretical ranges of isotope values for taxa with different ecologies and thermophysiologies. That's the foundation for all of the interpretation of the fossil data you present in the paper and the supplement, so it deserves to go first. If space (or editorial largesse) allows, I would even suggest moving the information on how you calculated your expected ranges into the main text.</p><p>Appendix paragraph two: change heading to &quot;Stereospondyl amphibians.&quot; Also make this change in the first line of this paragraph. Also, does the fact it was amphibious complicate your comparisons between it and <italic>Lystrosaurus</italic>?</p><p>Appendix subsection “Pareiasaurid and bolosaurid parareptiles”: would the fact that <italic>Pareisaurus</italic> was an herbivore whereas <italic>Rhinesuchus</italic> was a faunivore make any difference here? I suppose the results for the older pareiasaurus would suggest not.</p><p>Appendix subsection “Lystrosaurid therapsids”: going along with my comments above about the identity of the Chinese material, I recommend changing the title of this section to &quot;<italic>Lystrosaurus</italic>.&quot;</p><p>In the same section: there is a much deeper history of debate in the literature about <italic>Lystrosaurus</italic> potentially being semi-aquatic that would be worth citing here: Broom 1903b, 1932; Watson 1912, 1913; Williston 1914; Brink 1951; Camp 1956; Cluver 1971; Kemp 1982; Hotton 1986; King 1991; King and Cluver 1991; Germain &amp; Laurin 2005; Ray et al. 2005; Botha-Brink and Angielczyk 2010</p><p>Your interpretation of <italic>Lystrosaurus</italic> as an endotherm seems a lot more uncertain here than you portray it in the text. This uncertainty has important implications for your the evolutionary scenarios you present in the Discussion section and considerations of the potential relationships between endothermy and the PTME. Therefore, I think you need to present this uncertainty more clearly in the main text (there you make it seem like <italic>Lystrosaurus</italic> is definitely an endotherm, which seems kind of misleading in the context of what's in the supplement).</p><p>Appendix subsection “Theroretical curves construction”: again, there doesn't seem to be any gray areas in the figures in the main text, so I would refer to the colours you use in those figures.</p><p>It would be good to have a citation for 37C being the average body temperature of terrestrial mammals.</p><p>In the same subsection: refer to colours for the main text figures.</p><p>General comment on the three time periods: estimates of global temperature and latitudinal thermal gradients obviously are not exact (especially when you're arbitrarily picking values for the latter in at least some cases). Because of this, it would be good to have more citations for where you're getting your values from, and justification for why you chose particular values/references. Likewise, it seems like it would be good to do a sensitivity analysis using a range of different (plausible) average temperatures and thermal gradients. Your results will seem a lot stronger if you consistently reconstruct your proposed endothermic taxa as endotherms across the range of plausible values than would be the case if you you have them come out as endotherms for certain combinations of values. Doing this will also avert criticisms that you are cherry-picking values to get the results you want.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>I have completed my review of Rey et al.'s manuscript, &quot;Oxygen isotopes suggest elevated thermometabolism within multiple Permo-Triasic therapsid clades'. This is a somewhat challenging paper to evaluate: The manuscript is exceptionally well written – clear, concise, scholarly, rationally organized; really a pleasure to read. And I see no reason to question the significance of the samples studied or the quality of the isotopic measurements. So, on these bases alone I would say the paper should be published with modest revisions. However, I do not believe several of the assumptions that underlie the interpretation of the isotopic data set are well justified, and therefore I don't consider the study to offer a strong new constraint on the question of therapsid physiology. On the third hand (!?!), the authors have looked at one of the few geochemical properties that potentially constrain body temperatures of these organisms, and I'm a strong believer that it is always worthwhile to publish possibly significant observations. So, I would like to see this paper published but encourage the authors to do some soul searching about some of their interpretations.</p><p>The two most important issues, in my mind, are the state of preservation of the samples, and the robustness of the models that are used as a reference frame for interpreting their findings.</p><p>First, there is evidence indicating that geochemical properties of ancient bone or dentin do not consistently constrain body temperature, except in rare cases of extraordinary preservation. Both are composed of fine-grained phosphate intermixed with organics, and demonstrably undergo diagenetic changes in oxygen isotope composition on geologically short time scales. It is asserted that phosphate resists such changes, but there is plenty of data showing this rule of thumb is often violated (see Stolper et al., 2016 for an example).</p><p>The authors have tried to avoid this by filtering the database for signs of alteration, but they do so with relatively simple, indirect metrics (percent carbonate and the phosphate-carbonate fractionation). I would have found it more compelling if they could have shown through microscopy and/or minor element mapping that they were studying well-preserved fabrics. Or if they had focused on only tooth enamel, which is generally much more resistant to alteration.</p><p>Second, the models of the oxygen isotope compositions of endotherm and ectotherm d18O values are based on two variables that strike me as poorly known or known to be false:</p><p>1) The assignments of taxa to terrestrial vs. semi-aquatic ecologies are essential to interpretations here, but my reading of the appendix suggests they are often debated and the choices made here involve an element of circular reasoning (i.e., they chose the one that leads to some simpler, preferred interpretation of the oxygen isotope data). This seems to me like a case where you really need to focus on unambiguous cases (e.g., marine reptiles, frogs, etc.).</p><p>2) It is assumed that ectotherms have growth temperatures equal to mean annual air temperatures, which are approximated with a linear dependence on latitude. These are both contraindicated by environmental data. Ectothermic tetropods generally have body temperatures well in excess of mean annual air temperature, particularly during their active seasons when they likely do most of their growth. For example, a recent survey of field-measured lizard body temperatures yielded a range of ~30-35 C across a wide range of latitudes and altitudes. And the earth's atmospheric temperature gradient is relatively gentle up to 60 ˚C, after which it really drops like a shot. The combination of these factors suggests to me that the authors have over estimated the contrast between ectotherm and endotherm d18O values, by perhaps a factor of two or more. These could have been improved on using modern field data (i.e., compare similar organisms in modern environments).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Oxygen isotopes suggest elevated thermometabolism within multiple Permo-Triassic therapsid clades&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Moreover, some of the taxa (such as <italic>Dicynodon, Diictodon</italic> and <italic>Oudenodon</italic>) are present at several localities, and need to be cited in results. For this reason we have kept this section under results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>General comments: This paper uses comparisons of stable oxygen isotope ratios of Permian-Jurassic non-mammalian synapsids to their contemporaries to try to infer when an endothermic metabolism arose in the lineage leading to mammals. The results are thought provoking, but I think a number of changes and additions will need to be made before the paper is ready to accept. I've made a number of comments and suggestions below, but a few general issues that must be addressed:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) I am not an isotope geochemist, and I think it will be important for one to examine the paper. I'm not so worried about the analytic methods, which seem fairly standard, but I think it would be good to get a more informed perspective on the method the authors use to predict the expected magnitude of differences between ectotherms and endotherms. This is the foundation of everything else in the paper, so it is important to make sure that this is acceptable.</italic> </p><p>We have now explained in the section “2.4” how the expected magnitude of differences between ectotherms and endotherms have been defined. We added the following sentence to provide more information in the text (a detailed explanation is provided in the Appendix 1): “To construct those theoretical areas, both the phosphate-water temperature scale from Lécuyer, Amoit, Touzeau and Trott, 2013 and the differences of stable oxygen compositions between mammals of various ecologies from Cerling et al., 2008 have been used.”</p><p><italic>2) Assuming the method is acceptable, I strongly recommend that the authors conduct a sensitivity analysis using a range of plausible average temperatures and latitudinal gradients for each of their time periods of interest. Their results will be stronger if they are consistent across the plausible range of values, and it will remove any appearance of cherry-picking temperatures/gradients to get the results that they want.</italic> </p><p>Following the reviewer’s request, we recalculated the areas of theoretical values for the difference between an endotherm and an ectotherm by using a range of plausible thermal latitudinal gradients. All three different gradients, 0.6°C\°L, 0.4°C\°L and 0.5°C\°L, are now with an uncertainty range of 0.1°C\°L to take into account the possible variation of this thermal latitudinal gradient within the periods selected. Therefore, we added in the Appendix 1 the following sentence: “In order to take into account the possible variations of the thermal gradient within the selected periods, an interval of ± 0.1°C/°L is added for each Main text figures.”</p><p><italic>3) The authors seem to play pretty fast and loose with the terms &quot;endothermy&quot; and &quot;ecothermy.&quot; A particular manifestation of this is the frequency with which they use bone histology (particularly the presence of fibrolamellar bone) as a correlate of endothermy. Although this was more common in earlier work on paleohistology, more recently the field has been much more circumspect about this relationship, with much more attention placed (rightly, in my opinion) on the implications of histology for growth rates/patterns. Elevated growth rates often are correlated with &quot;endothermy&quot; but this is not universally true.</italic> </p><p>We acknowledged the fact that this relationship is indirect and have thus added the following sentence in the Introduction: “However, FLB also occurs in a few ectotherms such as in some turtles and crocodilians, and is absent in small mammals and passerine birds(Bouvier, 1977), showing that FLB is mostly correlated with high growth rates, which does not always correlate to high metabolic rates.”</p><p><italic>I think the authors need to be more thoughtful in their presentation of this relationship, and they also should provide more explicit, detailed definitions of &quot;endothermy&quot; and &quot;ecothermy&quot; at the start of the paper.</italic> </p><p>We added the following paragraph in the Introduction:</p><p>“Endothermy is commonly associated with homeothermy, being the capacity to regulate the body heat through metabolic activity as well. This combination corresponds to one end of a gradient of thermoregulatory strategies observed in living animals. The other end of the spectrum is ectothermy combined with poïkilothermy which animals use as a thermoregulatory strategy to increase their body temperature toward optimal levels by using external heat sources. Their body temperature therefore traces that of their surroundings and is the most occurring saving strategy.”</p><p><italic>4) I recommended some changes to the discussion that would explore the link between endothermy and survivorship during the Permo-Triassic Mass Extinction (PTME) that would increase the broad interest and impact of the paper. Alternatively, the authors could provide a more detailed discussion of their results in the context of previous work and current ideas on the evolution of endothermy. Either way, much of what's in the current discussion isn't very interesting (and I say this as someone who loves the intricacies of dicynodont taxonomy) and it undersells the paper.</italic> </p><p>In order to make this important part of the paper more exciting we have extensively modified it and also added the following paragraph: “A possible explanation could be the acquisition of a fast growth rate due to the high metabolic rate of the endothermy. According to a recent palaeohistology study (Botha-Brink et al., 2016) Early Triassic therapsids, such as <italic>Lystrosaurus,</italic> therocephalians and cynodonts, had a high growth rate allowing them to reach reproductive maturity within a few seasons and compensate their shortened life expectancies. This adaptation might have enabled certain therapsids to survive the intense climatic change of that time and conquer the newly vacant niches.”</p><p><italic>5) There are a couple places in the main text and supplement that could be strengthened in terms of the references that are cited.</italic> </p><p>Numerous references have been added to address this comment.</p><p><italic>6) The writing style of the paper is good, but it could be improved upon. I recommend having Rubidge, Smith, and Viglietti go over the final version of the paper to clean things up and make sure the idiom is appropriate.</italic> </p><p>All three of them went through the manuscript after all the comments from the authors were applied.</p><p><italic>Abstract: mammals didn’t exist in the Permian, so you should say something along the lines of “endothermy evolved in the Permian ancestors of mammals.”</italic> </p><p>“[M]ammal” has been changed to “mammal ancestors”.</p><p><italic>Abstract: Cynognathia is a subclade of Eucynodontia, so I’m not sure what you mean here.</italic> </p><p>“Cynognathia and Eucynodontia” has been changed to “Eucynodontia”.</p><p><italic>Abstract: change to “originated in Epicynodontia during the…”. Also, change to middle-late Permian.</italic> </p><p>Changes have been made.</p><p><italic>Introduction opening sentence: this sentence is quite vague and is kind of meaningless as a result. Please be more specific about particular ways in which environmental changes affect vertebrates if you want to use this kind of example.</italic> </p><p>We have modified the sentence as follows: “Rapid environmental changes have played a major role in shaping the evolutionary history of terrestrial vertebrates not only as the major cause of mass extinctions but also favouring species with biological adaptations that allowed them to survive and oikilothe the altered ecosystems..”</p><p><italic>Introduction, first paragraph: as written, this paragraph provides something of a definition of endothermy. However, because endothermy is kind of a loaded term, and has been used in different ways by different authors, I suggest that you explicitly define what you mean by it so as to avoid any confusion.</italic> </p><p>We added the following paragraph in the Introduction: “Endothermy is commonly associated with homeothermy, being the capacity to regulate the body heat through metabolic activity as well. This combination corresponds to one end of a gradient of thermoregulatory strategies observed in living animals. The other end of the spectrum is ectothermy combined with oikilothermy which animals use as a thermoregulatory strategy to increase their body temperature toward optimal levels by using external heat sources. Their body temperature therefore traces that of their surroundings and is the most occurring saving strategy.”</p><p><italic>Introduction paragraph two: again, defining endothermy will help to avoid confusion about what you mean by “true endotherms.”</italic> </p><p>The sentence has been modified to: “Amongst modern vertebrates, various thermoregulatory strategies between these two end-members have been adopted, such as regional endothermy (Bernal, Dickson, Shadwick and Graham, 2001; Katz, 2002) or inertial homeothermy (McNab and Auffenberg, 1976), and only birds and mammals fall within the endothermy-end of the spectrum.”</p><p><italic>In the same paragraph: I think you're kind of downplaying the amount of work on this subject. For example, McNab, 1978, Hillenius, 1992; 1994, Ruben, Hillenius, Kemp and Quick, 2012, Owerkowicz, Musinsky, Middleton and Crompton, 2015, all would be appropriate to cite here.</italic> </p><p>This section has been rewritten and all the suggested references have been added.</p><p><italic>Introduction paragraph four: bony secondary palate would be a better term to use.</italic> </p><p>The term has been changed.</p><p><italic>In the same paragraph: Dicynodonts also have a complete secondary palate, although it is formed primarily by the maxilla.</italic> </p><p>We added the following sentence: “It is noteworthy that complete bony secondary palate is present in dicynodonts, the difference being that it is primarily formed by the premaxilla (King, 1988) whereas it is mostly the maxilla in therocephalians, cynodonts and extant mammals.”</p><p><italic>Introduction paragraph five: Owerkowicz, Musinsky, Middleton and Crompton, 2015 would be especially good to cite in the context of whether turbinates are necessary in the context of mammalian endothermy. Also Laaß (2011) presents some evidence of turbinals in Lystrosaurus, although I'm kind of skeptical as to whether that's actually what's visible in the scan.</italic> </p><p>The first reference has been added.</p><p><italic>Reports of fibrolamellar bone in synapsids go back farther than these studies. For example, de Ricqles reports fibroilamellar bone in some therapsids is in papers on bone histology from the 1970's.</italic> </p><p>We modified accordingly and added the following references: “(de Ricqlès, 1972, 1979; Botha, 2003; Botha and Chinsamy, 2001, 2004; Ray, Botha and Chinsamy, 2004; Olivier, Houssaye, Jalil and Cubo, 2017)”.</p><p><italic>Fibrolamellar bone is a lot more ubiquitous among therapsids than what you suggest here; if anything it's more common than not. There's even pelycosaur-grade synapsids like Sphenacodon and Ophiacodon that produce fibrolamellar bone for at least part of their ontogenies.</italic> </p><p>We modified the paragraph to: “Accordingly, several bone palaeohistological studies have have addressed the quest for the presence of FLB in therapsids (de Ricqlès, 1972, 1979; Botha, 2003; Botha and Chinsamy, 2001, 2004; Ray, Notha and Chinsamy, 2004; Olivier, Houssaye, Jalil and Cubo, 2017). Ray, Notha and Chinsamy, 2004 and Olivier, Houssaye, Jalil and Cubo, 2017 analysed several therapsid groups (anomodont, gorgonopsian, therocephalian, cynodont) and found FLB in some genera (<italic>Aelurognathus, Pristerognathus, Tritylodon, Oudenodon, Lystrosaurus, Moghreberia</italic>), suggesting sustained fast growth and thus elevated metabolic activity. The presence of FLB has also been demonstrated in some earlier non-therapsid synapsids such as <italic>Sphenacodon, Dimetrodon</italic> or even <italic>Ophiacodon</italic> (Huttenlocker, Rega and Sumida, 2010; Shelton, Sander, Stein and Winkelhorst, 2012; Shelton and Sander, 2015).”</p><p><italic>In addition to the fact that some non-ectothermic teterapods can produce fibrolamellar bone, and important point to make here is that the presence of fibrolamellar bone really is more a reflection of the rate at which bone tissue is being formed than endothermy in a strict sense. While the high growth rates required to produce fibrolamellar bone often are correlated with high metabolic rates, this is not always the case.</italic> </p><p>We have added the following sentence: “However, FLB also occurs in a few ectotherms such as in some turtles and crocodilians, and is absent in small mammals and passerine birds(Bouvier, 1977), showing that FLB is mostly correlated with high growth rates, which does not always correlate to high metabolic rates.”</p><p><italic>Introduction paragraph six: although the degree of resistance to diagenesis varies among tissues, with enamel being the more resistant by far.</italic> </p><p>The paragraph here explains the reason why the oxygen isotopic composition of the phosphate group is used. The difference between tissues is described later in “Materials and methods” as follows: “Analysed materials consist of bone or tooth dentine, which is more porous than enamel with small and less densely inter-grown apatite crystals (Mills, 1967)”.</p><p><italic>Materials and methods section, subsection “Sample collection”: you should provide justification for why you're using these alternate dates.</italic> </p><p>Since the submission of this manuscript, the alternative dates have become the official ones. We have modified the sentence to read: “All the sample localities have been correlated to the marine biostratigraphic stages using the absolute ages accepted by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (Cohen et al., 2013; updated 12/2016), with the Permo-Triassic and Guadalupian-Lopingian boundaries now considered to be at 251.90 ± 0.02 Ma (Burgess, Bowring and Shen, 2014) and 259.1 ± 0.5 (Zhong, He, Mundil and Xu, 2014) Ma, respectively.”</p><p><italic>Also, looking at your supplementary table, it seems like some of your dates imply more precision than is actually the case. For example, as far as I know there aren't any published radiometric dates for the Burgersdorp Fm. If you're making the correlation to marine stages (and their dates) using tetrapod biostratigraphy, I would suggest caution in this case, given the recent dates from South America that have been published by Ottone et al. (2014) and Marsicano et al. (2016). In any case more information on the source of your dates should be provided.</italic> </p><p>We intended to give an age value to every studied stratigraphic interval. However, as pointed out by the reviewer, not all formations have radiometric ages and in these instances we used biostratrigraphic correlation (and references) as explained in the text:</p><p>“Triassic age determination has been achieved by biostratigraphic correlation with Laurasian sequences (Hancox, Shishkin, Rubidge and Kitching, 1995; Rubidge, 2005; Abdala and Ribeiro, 2010).”</p><p>“The locality belongs to the “Red Beds inférieurs a or b” of the lower Elliot Formation which is currently regarded as latest Triassic (late Rhaetian) (Knoll, 2004).” “The locality is biostratigraphically correlated to the last segment of the Timezgadiouine Formation, considered to be Middle to early Late Carnian(Jalil, 1999).”</p><p>“The Dashankou locality, from Gansu Province, is biostratigraphically dated as Early Roadian (Liu and Rubidge, 2009; Liu, 2010). From Shanxi Province, sampled fossils originate from three localities in the Ermaying Formation which is considered to be Anisian (Liu, Li and Li, 2013). From Xinjiang Province, two localities in the Jiucaiyuan Formation have been sampled and are considered Early Triassic (Metcalfe et al., 2009).”</p><p><italic>Subsection “Robustness of the stable isotope record”: “contain” instead of “contains”.</italic> </p><p>The modification has been made.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: The colouration of the different parts of the plot doesn't seem to be explained. I understand that the dark orange area at the top right is the area that represents diagenesis, but do the other coloured regions have some meaning?</italic> </p><p>The arrows on the side describe the figure with all the upper section corresponding to phosphate diagenesis, and the part on the right corresponding to carbonate diagenesis. Therefore, the upper right part corresponds to both phosphate and carbonate diagenesis.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Robustness of the stable isotope record”: does partial preservation of the isotopic signal require different interpretation than pristine preservation?</italic> </p><p>Partial preservation means that some of the samples might have their isotopic compositions slightly modified by diagenesis, meaning that it is impossible to be 100% certain if the signal is completely original. With no way to quantify it, we interpret our data as preserved, acknowledging the possible slight alteration. Therefore, we modified the sentence as follows: “Using these two assessments, newly measured δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> values are considered to have preserved their original isotopic signatures and can be interpreted in terms of ecologies and physiologies”.</p><p><italic>In the same subsection: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> is repeated here. Do you mean 2A, 3A, and 4A?</italic> </p><p>The modification has been made to 2A, 3A and 4A.</p><p><italic>Would it be better to refer to the colours instead of light and dark gray? Since the journal is primarily an online publication the colour online/grayscale printed version seems like it isn't really a concern, and referring to the colours would help readers understand the figures.</italic> </p><p>We have now included colour as suggested and all the shades of grey have been changed to the corresponding colours.</p><p><italic>Permian Therapsids general comment: I recommend reorganizing this section a little. I think it would be most logical to present the results subdivided by time (i.e., all middle Permian things first, then early late Permian, then latest Permian). Within each time bin, you can subdivide further by geographic area.</italic> </p><p>The chosen subdivision has been made in order to avoid repetition and make reading easier. Accordingly we first listed the South African fossils because of their greater numbers and their possible occurrences in several AZ (eg. <italic>Diictodon</italic> and <italic>Oudenodon</italic> in both lower <italic>Daptocephalus</italic> AZ and <italic>Tropidostoma</italic> AZ). Some AZ are also linked together with the groups used for comparison (eg. stereospondyls).</p><p><italic>Early-Middle Triassic Therapsids general comment: as with the Permian taxa, I think it would be most useful to subdivide the results first by time and then by geography.</italic> </p><p>In this case we preferred to subdivide the results first by country with a link between South Africa and China, which included <italic>Lystrosaurus</italic> which is common to both. Division by time would cause the text to alternate between the South African and Chines fossils.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Early to Middle Triassic therapsids”: because bone histology is really more a record of growth rates, it might be better to say something along the lines of &quot;…which is consistent with the elevated growth rates implied by the bone histology of Erythrosuchus.&quot;</italic> </p><p>The sentence has been changed to: “<italic>Erythrosuchus</italic> was also endothermic which is consistent with the elevated growth rates implied by its palaeohistology”.</p><p><italic>I think the paragraph describing the results on the Chinese lystrosaurid should be combined with the previous paragraph on the South African specimens. Also, Lystrosaurus is the only Lystrosaurid known from China, so I would say its safe to assume that it is Lystrosaurus.</italic> </p><p>As suggested the paragraphs have been combined. As there is no more precise official identification for the Chinese fossil, we preferred to leave it as it is.</p><p><italic>In the same subsection and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> you make it seem like it is pretty certain that Lystrosaurus is an endotherm. However, in the supplement, you make it seem like there's actually a fair amount of uncertainty based on questions about the ecology of Lystrosaurus and the metaboloic status 'Chasmatosaurus' (which is inferred from information on growth rates inferred from bone histological data from related taxa in South Africa). I think you need to better portray this uncertainty here, and also be sure to take it into account in the Discussion section of the paper.</italic> </p><p>The Appendix paragraph mentions that the South African <italic>Lystrosaurus</italic> is either terrestrial-endotherm or semiaquatic-ectotherm, whereas the Chinese one is either terrestrial endotherm or terrestrial ectotherm. Considering that the South African and Chinese <italic>Lystrosaurus</italic> probably occupied the same ecological niche, the only common possibility is terrestrial endotherm.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Middle to Late Triassic therapsids”: contemporary instead of co-existing</italic> </p><p>Modification has been made.</p><p><italic>Discussion section and elsewhere: although wordier, something like &quot;the unnamed clade comprising Lystrosauridae + Kannemeyeriiformes&quot; would make more sense.</italic> </p><p>The sentence has been modified to: “the unnamed dicynodont clade comprising Lystrosauridae + Kannemeyeriiformes, abbreviated the “L+K” clade later,”</p><p><italic>Discussion paragraph three: &quot;basal dicynodontoid&quot; would work better.</italic> </p><p>Modification has been made.</p><p><italic>Discussion paragraph five: I don't really agree that this is a valid hypothesis. You have a fair number of Permian therapsids from different clades that are reconstructed as being ecothermic, and it seems implausible that you would have so many reversals to ecothermy. In the previous paragraph, you discuss a hypothesis based on a parsimony optimization of the character on the phylogeny. That is justified: you have a clear-cut optimality criterion and you are discussing the best hypothesis under that criterion. I don't think there's any method/optimality criterion that would support the number of reversals needed to account for all so many of your Permian therapsids being reconstructed as endotherms, so the argument is much less sound. If you're doing that, then you can pretty much make up whatever hypothesis you want because there's no constraint on what could be considered plausible.</italic> </p><p>We consider this second hypothesis still valid, as it does not involve reversal from endothermy to ectothermy, but that the characteristics for endothermy were present but not a full endothermy. Therefore, we added the following sentences: “This suggests that biochemical and physiological mechanisms allowing mammal endothermy, appeared at the base of the neotherapsids at any given time during the middle Permian which is a conclusion recently published based on the paleohistology of some dicynodonts (Olivier, Houssaye, Jalil and Cubo, 2017). In our case, the absence of an endothermic signal in the sampled Permian therapsids could be due to an endothermy being only seasonal, linked to a cold season or to the reproduction period (as observed today in some reptile species; Tattersall et al., 2016), which would not be visible in a bulk signal. Therefore, effective acquisition of mammal “true endothermy” was expressed within these two lineages, possibly as a result of extrinsic factors.”</p><p><italic>In the same paragraph: biochemical instead of biochemicals</italic> </p><p>Modification has been made.</p><p><italic>Discussion paragraph seven: assuming that Lystrosaurus was indeed an endotherm (see comments above and below), these observations are especially interesting in the context of the changes in growth and life history at the PTB noted by Botha-Brink et al., 2016, among others. This would be something interesting to explore further in the discussion, as well as a more general consideration of the role endothermy played in determining survivorship during the PTME. There's a couple obvious ways to get the space needed to do this. One would be to get rid of the previous paragraph, which I don't think is needed. Likewise, you could get rid of everything from paragraph two, and almost everything in paragraph three.</italic> </p><p>We included this hypothesis at the end of the Discussion: “A possible explanation could be the acquisition of a fast growth rate due to the high metabolic rate of the endothermy. According to a recent palaeohistology study (Botha-Brink et al., 2016) Early Triassic therapsids, such as <italic>Lystrosaurus,</italic> therocephalians and cynodonts, had a high growth rate allowing them to reach reproductive maturity within a few seasons and compensate their shortened life expectancies. This adaptation might have enabled certain therapsids to survive the intense climatic change of that time and conquer the newly vacant niches.”</p><p><italic>Concluding remarks: this is a really stilted way to say that most of your samples preserved an original signal that had not been diagenetically altered.</italic> </p><p>We deleted the offensive sentence and modified the second one as it follows: “Assuming that analysed samples have preserved their original isotope composition of phosphate, all the Permian therapsids analysed appear to have ectotherm-like thermoregulation and representatives of two Triassic therapsid clades are considered to have had endotherm-like thermoregulation: the Lystrosauridae + Kannemeyeriiformes and the Eucynodontia.”</p><p> <italic>I think you can get rid of most of this (see comments above).</italic> </p><p>We think that this hypothesis is still valid (see above).</p><p><italic>General comment on the supplement: you should reorganize so that the first section is the one describing how you came up with your theoretical ranges of isotope values for taxa with different ecologies and thermophysiologies. That's the foundation for all of the interpretation of the fossil data you present in the paper and the supplement, so it deserves to go first. If space (or editorial largesse) allows, I would even suggest moving the information on how you calculated your expected ranges into the main text.</italic> </p><p>The section “Theoretical curve construction” has been moved to the first section. However, to keep the “Materials and methods” section as simple as possible, we deliberately chose to keep the calculation of the theoretical range in the Appendix. We have now added the following sentence in the main text: “To construct those theoretical areas, both the phosphate-water temperature scale from Lécuyer, Amoit, Touzeau and Trotter, 2013 and the differences of stable oxygen compositions between mammals of various ecologies from Cerling et al., 2008, have been used.”</p><p><italic>Appendix paragraph two: change heading to &quot;Stereospondyl amphibians.&quot; Also make this change in the first line of this paragraph.</italic> </p><p>Changes have been made.</p><p><italic>Also, does the fact it was amphibious complicate your comparisons between it and Lystrosaurus?</italic> </p><p>Not really, the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref> are the comparison between a therapsid and an amphibious animal.</p><p><italic>Appendix subsection “Pareiasaurid and bolosaurid parareptiles”: would the fact that Pareisaurus was an herbivore whereas Rhinesuchus was a faunivore make any difference here?

Therefore, I think you need to present this uncertainty more clearly in the main text (there you make it seem like Lystrosaurus is definitely an endotherm, which seems kind of misleading in the context of what's in the supplement).</italic> </p><p>As mentioned above: The Appendix paragraph mentions that the South African <italic>Lystrosaurus</italic> is either terrestrial-endotherm or semiaquatic-ectotherm, whereas the Chinese one is either terrestrial endotherm or terrestrial ectotherm. Considering that the South African and Chinese <italic>Lystrosaurus</italic> probably occupied the same ecological niche, the only common possibility is terrestrial endotherm. We do not think that the text is misleading our interpretation of the ecology of <italic>Lystrosaurus.</italic></p><p><italic>Appendix subsection “Theroretical curves construction”: again, there doesn't seem to be any gray areas in the figures in the main text, so I would refer to the colours you use in those figures.</italic> </p><p>We replaced all the shades with their respective colours.</p><p><italic>It would be good to have a citation for 37C being the average body temperature of terrestrial mammals.</italic> </p><p>A reference has been added as follows: “For endothermic vertebrates, T<sub>b</sub> is assumed to be 37°C, the average T<sub>b</sub> of most extant placentals and possibly of the common ancestor of all extant mammals (Watson and Graves, 1988).</p><p><italic>In the same subsection: refer to colours for the main text figures.</italic> </p><p>We changed all the shades to their respective colours.</p><p><italic>General comment on the three time periods: estimates of global temperature and latitudinal thermal gradients obviously are not exact (especially when you're arbitrarily picking values for the latter in at least some cases). Because of this, it would be good to have more citations for where you're getting your values from, and justification for why you chose particular values/references. Likewise, it seems like it would be good to do a sensitivity analysis using a range of different (plausible) average temperatures and thermal gradients. Your results will seem a lot stronger if you consistently reconstruct your proposed endothermic taxa as endotherms across the range of plausible values than would be the case if you you have them come out as endotherms for certain combinations of values. Doing this will also avert criticisms that you are cherry-picking values to get the results you want.</italic> </p><p>In order to reinforce our interpretations, we extended our theoretical ranges by adding an uncertainty of ± 0.1°C/°L for each thermal gradient we used. Uncertainties may reflect the possible variations of temperature during each chosen timespan. No interpretations were affected by this increase in those theoretical ranges.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>I have completed my review of Rey et al.'s manuscript, &quot;Oxygen isotopes suggest elevated thermometabolism within multiple Permo-Triasic therapsid clades'. This is a somewhat challenging paper to evaluate: The manuscript is exceptionally well written – clear, concise, scholarly, rationally organized; really a pleasure to read. And I see no reason to question the significance of the samples studied or the quality of the isotopic measurements. So, on these bases alone I would say the paper should be published with modest revisions. However, I do not believe several of the assumptions that underlie the interpretation of the isotopic data set are well justified, and therefore I don't consider the study to offer a strong new constraint on the question of therapsid physiology. On the third hand (!?!), the authors have looked at one of the few geochemical properties that potentially constrain body temperatures of these organisms, and I'm a strong believer that it is always worth while to publish possibly significant observations. So, I would like to see this paper published but encourage the authors to do some soul searching about some of their interpretations.</italic> </p><p><italic>The two most important issues, in my mind, are the state of preservation of the samples, and the robustness of the models that are used as a reference frame for interpreting their findings.</italic> </p><p><italic>First, there is evidence indicating that geochemical properties of ancient bone or dentin do not consistently constrain body temperature, except in rare cases of extraordinary preservation. Both are composed of fine-grained phosphate intermixed with organics, and demonstrably undergo diagenetic changes in oxygen isotope composition on geologically short time scales. It is asserted that phosphate resists such changes, but there is plenty of data showing this rule of thumb is often violated (see Stolper et al., 2016 for an example).</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors have tried to avoid this by filtering the database for signs of alteration, but they do so with relatively simple, indirect metrics (percent carbonate and the phosphate-carbonate fractionation). I would have found it more compelling if they could have shown through microscopy and/or minor element mapping that they were studying well-preserved fabrics. Or if they had focused on only tooth enamel, which is generally much more resistant to alteration.</italic> </p><p>Admittedly enamel would be the best apatite to sample, but before its development in the Mammalia, enamel was just a thin layer and was possibly not sufficient to sample for the analysis. Moreover, some species did not have enamel at all (eg. <italic>Diictodon</italic>), or even teeth (eg. <italic>Oudenodon</italic>), therefore dentine and bone offer the best alternative. Much of the data presented in this manuscript has already been published (Rey et al., 2016) and showed a correlation with marine data from South China through the studied interval. Currently there is no method to demonstrate if diagenetic processes might have significantly altered the oxygen isotope compositions of the phosphate group. In their study, Pucéat et al., 2004 showed that recrystallization and Rare Earth Element fractionations are possible without altering oxygen isotope compositions.</p><p><italic>Second, the models of the oxygen isotope compositions of endotherm and ectotherm d18O values are based on two variables that strike me as poorly known or known to be false:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The assignments of taxa to terrestrial vs. semi-aquatic ecologies are essential to interpretations here, but my reading of the appendix suggests they are often debated and the choices made here involve an element of circular reasoning (i.e., they chose the one that leads to some simpler, preferred interpretation of the oxygen isotope data). This seems to me like a case where you really need to focus on unambiguous cases (e.g., marine reptiles, frogs, etc.).</italic> </p><p><italic>2) It is assumed that ectotherms have growth temperatures equal to mean annual air temperatures, which are approximated with a linear dependence on latitude. These are both contraindicated by environmental data. Ectothermic tetropods generally have body temperatures well in excess of mean annual air temperature, particularly during their active seasons when they likely do most of their growth. For example, a recent survey of field-measured lizard body temperatures yielded a range of ~30-35 C across a wide range of latitudes and altitudes. And the earth's atmospheric temperature gradient is relatively gentle up to 60 ˚C, after which it really drops like a shot. The combination of these factors suggests to me that the authors have over estimated the contrast between ectotherm and endotherm d18O values, by perhaps a factor of two or more. These could have been improved on using modern field data (i.e., compare similar organisms in modern environments).</italic> </p><p>Comparing isotope compositions to understand thermophysiology of fossil species have been already published a few times (Amiot et al., 2006; Barrick et al., 1994; 1996). Here, we used a theoretical framework based on extant species to increase the validity of our result. Nevertheless, we added a paragraph in the Discussion where we acknowledge the possible limits of this theoretical framework: “Such interpretations are based on a theoretical framework in which estimations had been made as accurately as possible, but may not entirely represent the complex ecologies or thermophysiologies of each analysed tetrapod or the environmental conditions where they lived. Therefore, even though we have confidence in these results, it is important to compare them with other palaeobiological proxies to increase their validity.”</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The paper presents an unexpected result, that endothermy arose more than once among lineages of synapsids. The paper is novel in basing this result on new isotopic data measured from fossil bones. The methods are difficult to get right, but the Lécuyer laboratory at Lyons leads the world in these methods, which adds credibility to the paper.</italic> </p><p><italic>The Abstract is not entirely clear about the key claim, that endothermy arose twice, independently, among Synapsida. If that is the claim, say so clearly. The last sentence needs revision.</italic> </p><p>We clarified this as follows:</p><p>“It is proposed that cynodonts and dicynodonts independently acquired constant elevated thermometabolism, respectively within the Eucynodontia and Lystrosauridae + Kannemeyeriiformes clades”.</p><p>The sentence has been changed to:</p><p>“We conclude that mammalian endothermy originated in the Epicynodontia during the middle-late Permian.

This is the key of the paper to argue the phylogenetic point.
