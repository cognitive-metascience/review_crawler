Enteric bacterial pathogens have developed strategies to sense bile as an environmental cue to regulate virulence genes during infection. We discovered that <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> VtrC, along with VtrA and VtrB, are required for activating the virulence type III secretion system 2 in response to bile salts. The VtrA/VtrC complex activates VtrB in the presence of bile salts. The crystal structure of the periplasmic domains of the VtrA/VtrC heterodimer reveals a β-barrel with a hydrophobic inner chamber. A co-crystal structure of VtrA/VtrC with bile salt, along with biophysical and mutational analysis, demonstrates that the hydrophobic chamber binds bile salts and activates the virulence network. As part of a family of conserved signaling receptors, VtrA/VtrC provides structural and functional insights into the evolutionarily conserved mechanism used by bacteria to sense their environment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15718.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15718.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15718.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When we eat a meal, bile salts in the intestine help the body to absorb molecules of fat. Certain bacteria that cause food poisoning in humans, such as <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic>, can also detect bile salts and use them to sense that they have reached the intestine of a suitable host. The bacteria then produce toxins that inflame the intestine; this can result in days of diarrhea. However, it was not clear how the bacteria detect the bile salt signal and how this triggers them to produce the toxins.</p><p>Li, Rivera-Cancel et al. now discover that not one, but two, genes are required for this process. The genes encode two proteins, called VtrA and VtrC, that interact to form protein ‘complex’ on the surface of the membrane that surrounds the bacterial cell. The two proteins create a barrel-like structure that can bind to bile salts and trigger the cell to produce the toxins.</p><p>Future experiments will aim to understand how the binding of bile salts to this protein complex causes an increase toxin production. A future challenge is to find out how other disease-causing bacteria sense environmental cues to produce toxins. With this knowledge, researchers might be able to design new drugs that could prevent the production of toxins to relieve symptoms of food poisoning and other illnesses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15718.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15718.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Vibrio</italic></kwd><kwd>Type III Secretion system</kwd><kwd>Bile salt receptor</kwd><kwd>pathogenesis</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99AI116948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salomon</surname><given-names>Dor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AC02-06CH11357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomchick</surname><given-names>Diana R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM094575</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grishin</surname><given-names>Nick V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grishin</surname><given-names>Nick V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI087808</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orth</surname><given-names>Kim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1561</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orth</surname><given-names>Kim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Microbial genetics and biophysical analyses provide insight into an evolutionarily conserved bile salt receptor complex used by pathogenic bacteria to sense their environment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bile is an important component of the human gastrointestinal tract that plays a major role in the emulsification and solubilization of lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Begley et al., 2005</xref>). Its main components are bile salts, cholesterol, and phospholipids that together possess antimicrobial activities, challenging the survival and colonization of both pathogenic and commensal bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Begley et al., 2005</xref>). There is increasing evidence that enteric bacterial pathogens can utilize bile as a signaling cue to regulate gene expression profiles during host infection. For example, <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> senses bile to repress the genes involved in invasion when growing in the intestinal lumen and induce their expression to promote invasion upon the penetration of the mucosal layer wherein the concentration of bile is decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prouty and Gunn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prouty et al., 2004</xref>). In <italic>Shigella spp</italic>., bile salts increase the pathogen's adherence and invasion of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pope et al., 1995</xref>). Bile also has important effects on the pathogenicity of <italic>Vibrio</italic> species, as observed in multiple studies with pathogenic strains of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gupta and Chowdhury, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schuhmacher and Klose, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krukonis and DiRita, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Faruque et al., 1998</xref>). <italic>V. cholerae</italic> produces two major virulence factors during infection, cholera toxin (CT) and toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP), and these factors are repressed by ToxT in the presence of bile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gupta and Chowdhury, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schuhmacher and Klose, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krukonis and DiRita, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Faruque et al., 1998</xref>). However, it was also reported that bile can activate the production of CT independent of ToxT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hung and Mekalanos, 2005</xref>). Non-O1/non-O139 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains that do not encode CT and TCP can cause gastroenteritis and utilize bile to activate a pathogenic type III secretion system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dziejman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> type III secretion system 2 (T3SS2) is induced specifically by bile salts during infection, resulting in acute gastroenteritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gotoh et al., 2010</xref>). Despite these important discoveries, the mechanism of sensing bile salts by pathogenic bacteria remains unknown. To investigate this mystery, we used <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> as a model to elucidate how <italic>Vibrio spp.</italic> sense bile salts as a signal to regulate the expression of virulence genes.</p><p><italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> is a globally-spread, Gram-negative, halophilic bacterial pathogen that inhabits marine and estuarine environments and is the world’s leading cause of acute gastroenteritis due to the consumption of raw or undercooked seafood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang and Orth, 2013</xref>). During recent years, rising temperatures in the ocean has contributed to this pathogen’s worldwide dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nair et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Velazquez-Roman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McLaughlin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O'Boyle and Boyd, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daniels et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> is also the causative agent of the devastating shrimp disease Acute Hepatopancreatic Necrosis Disease (AHPND) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Over the last decade, enormous progress has been made to elucidate virulence factors used by this pathogen and tools are available to study virulence mechanisms at the genetic and biochemical levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Souza Santos et al., 2015</xref>). As part of its virulence repertoire, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> encodes two T3SSs: the cytotoxic T3SS1 and the enterotoxic T3SS2. T3SSs encode needle-like secretion apparatuses used to deliver bacterial effector proteins, called Vops, which allow <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> to invade and kill infected host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makino et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galán and Wolf-Watz, 2006</xref>). Each T3SS delivers a specific set of Vops into a host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broberg et al., 2011</xref>). For example, the T3SS1 exclusively secretes VopQ, VopR, VPA0450 and VopS and uses the effectors to orchestrate a multifaceted host cell death. This system is found in all strains of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, and therefore is proposed to be important for bacterial survival in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broberg et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>T3SS2 is present in clinical isolates of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and is a key bile salt-induced virulence system that causes enterotoxicity and symptoms associated with gastroenteritis during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hiyoshi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ritchie et al., 2012</xref>). Bile salts not only induce Vops, such as VopA and VopC, but also the needle-like secretion apparatus, including components such as T3SS2 translocon VopD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang and Orth, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Trosky et al., 2004</xref>). In <italic>V. parahaemolyticus,</italic> the activation of T3SS2 by bile salts is regulated by two transmembrane ToxR-like transcription factors, VtrA (VPA1332) and VtrB (VPA1348) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gotoh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kodama et al., 2010</xref>). Homologues of VtrA and VtrB, named VttRA and VttRB respectively, have been identified in T3SS-containing non-O1/non-O139 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains and function in a similar way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam et al., 2010</xref>). Despite the identification of these transcription factors, the molecular mechanism underlying bile salts sensing and T3SS2 signal propagation by <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is unknown.</p><p>Here, we identify VtrC (VPA1333) from <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> as a previously unrecognized component necessary for bile salt sensing and T3SS2 activation. <italic>vtrC</italic> is constitutively co-transcribed with <italic>vtrA</italic> as an overlapping 3’ open reading frame. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the periplasmic domains of the transmembrane proteins, VtrA and VtrC, form a functional complex that binds bile salts to activate VtrA’s cytoplasmic DNA binding domain, which in turn induces T3SS2 via the downstream transcription factor VtrB. The structure of VtrA/VtrC periplasmic domains reveals an obligate heterodimer where VtrC recruits structural elements from VtrA to complete a β-barrel with a hydrophobic inner chamber that binds bile salts. A co-crystal structure of the VtrA/VtrC heterodimer with a bile salt reveals that ligand binding occurs in the hydrophobic inner chamber of VtrC, similar to that found for the family of monomeric calycins. Mutations of residues within the hydrophobic chamber that are important for bile salt-binding disrupt bile salt activation of T3SS2. Collectively, we uncover a mechanism by which bacteria can sense bile salts, and reveal how an evolutionarily conserved receptor senses an environmental cue to induce the production of virulence factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>V<italic>trC</italic> is conserved in various bacterial species with V<italic>trA</italic>-like genes and encodes a predicted transmembrane protein</title><p><italic>vtrC</italic> (<italic>vpa1333</italic>) is a previously uncharacterized gene in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> that is located directly downstream of <italic>vtrA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

PSI-BLAST analysis with the predicted VtrC protein sequence revealed that it is conserved in various <italic>Vibrio</italic> and related species, as well as in <italic>Moritella</italic>.

The eight β-strands of VtrC form a β-sheet meander that folds into itself to form a β-barrel with a small space between the first and last β-strands (Aβ and Iβ) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). The β-barrel is lined on the inside by hydrophobic side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and is covered on one side by the short α-helix (Fα) and an adjacent disordered loop, which could not be modeled in its entirety due to the poor electron density of this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The Hβ-Iβ loop is particularly rich in aromatic side-chains, promoting us to hypothesize that this loop could be involved in binding the steroid ring structure of bile acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Despite the lack of sequence similarity to proteins of known function, VtrC shares structural similarity with lipocalins, fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), avidins, metalloprotease inhibitors (MPIs), and other members of the calycin superfamily of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flower et al., 2000</xref>).

Comparison of the overall VtrC structure with other calycins suggests that it adopts a new fold within the superfamily. VtrC falls in between the lipocalins, which include a C-terminal helix that packs against the barrel on the corresponding VtrA interacting surface; and the FABPs, which include a β-hairpin insertion into the typical 8-stranded β-barrel in the position of the VtrC disordered loop. Interestingly, VtrA/VtrC would be the first member of this family that is an obligate dimer and not only binds a hydrophobic ligand but also transmits a signal upon binding.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-15718-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15718.013</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of the VtrA/VtrC heterodimer.</title><p>Rotation of VtrA/VtrC heterodimer demonstrates the binding cavity of the beta-barrel.

Interestingly, the N-terminus of the VtrA periplasmic domain, leading to the transmembrane helix, contacts VtrC Gβ and is in close proximity to the aromatic-rich Hβ-Iβ loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), leading us to hypothesize that these residues might be involved in signal transmission across the membrane in response to ligand binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The VtrA/VtrC complex binds bile salt</title><p>Based on the structural similarities between the monomeric calycins and the VtrA/VtrC heterodimer, we predicted that VtrA/VtrC complex could bind bile salts.

We first tested whether the VtrA/VtrC periplasmic domain heterodimer could bind bile salts using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Negative power deflections were observed throughout the titration of the bile salt TDC into the VtrA/VtrC solution. These results indicated that TDC binds to the VtrA/VtrC heterodimer in an exothermic manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 315.4 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

The crystal structure was solved via molecular replacement by using our original VtrA/VtrC heterodimer as a search model, and refined to a resolution of 2.10 Å. The model reveals three VtrA/VtrC heterodimers in the asymmetric unit, each with clear electron density for one TDC molecule bound inside the β-barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A fourth TDC molecule mediated lattice contacts between VtrA chain A and its symmetry mate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). An analysis of the macromolecular interfaces found in this crystalline lattice by the web server PDBePISA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</xref>) indicated that the heterodimer is the only stable quaternary structure in solution. Although the three heterodimers in the asymmetric unit are highly similar, average root mean squared deviations (RMSD) of 0.5 Å for VtrA and 0.6–1.5 Å for VtrC indicates that there are differences in the VtrC monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A,E</xref>). RSMD values of 0.4–0.5 Å for VtrA and 1.2–1.9 Å were obtained by superimposing each of the TDC-bound heterodimers to the apo structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B-–E</xref>), indicating that the overall fold is maintained but there are considerable changes in the VtrC monomer. The largest differences between the VtrA/VtrC-TDC and the apo heterodimers are in the VtrC disordered loop and Fα that follows it. In the VtrA/VtrC-TDC heterodimer, the disordered loop has been displaced by the TDC molecule and is now observable in two out of the three heterodimers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Residues Thr122 and Ser123, which were in the disordered loop in the apo structure, now form part of Fα in two of the TDC-bound heterodimers. Remarkably, one of these residues (Ser123) now forms a hydrogen bond with the 12α-hydroxyl group of TDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The main chain amide between F150 and Tyr151 (Hβ-Iβ loop) coordinates the 3α-hydroxyl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), which is present in all bile salts, suggesting that this interaction is important for specificity towards bile salts. Several VtrC residues in the binding pocket maintain hydrophobic interactions with TDC, including the side chains of Phe150 with steroid ring A and Tyr81 with the hydrophobic part of the bile acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Mutations of the VtrA/VtrC complex with the bile salt TDC</title><p>Based on our co-crystal structure of VtrA/VtrC with TDC, the role of several residues that contact the bile salt were investigated for their ability to affect the binding of bile salts and activation of the T3SS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The mutation of His50, located at the top of the hydrophobic cleft, to an arginine residue is expected to produce steric hindrance by insertion of a large side chain into the bile salt binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). When VtrC-H50R was expressed in the <italic>vtrC</italic> deletion strain and bile salts were added, the T3SS2 could not be induced as indicated by the lack of expression and secretion of the T3SS2 effector VopA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, lanes 5 and 11). We also changed Tyr81 to an alanine residue, which we predicted would disrupt bile salt binding by eliminating the interaction between the Tyr81 aromatic ring and the bile salt side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). When VtrC-Y81A was expressed in the <italic>vtrC</italic> deletion strain and bile salts were added, the T3SS2 was not induced as indicated by the lack of expression and secretion of VopA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, lanes 6 and 12).

Deciphering how bacteria use bile as a signal to regulate the expression of virulence genes is essential to our understanding of disease mechanisms and also can offer insights for designing novel therapeutic strategies. Bile salt-induced T3SSs are the primary virulence factor in many <italic>Vibrio</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broberg et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, we uncovered a previously unidentified component of a widespread, conserved signaling platform that is essential for bile salt sensing and activation of virulence factors in <italic>Vibrios</italic>. Our biochemical data and the structural analysis demonstrated that the periplasmic domains of the inner membrane proteins VtrA and VtrC form a stable complex that functions as a receptor for bile salts.</p><p>The crystal structure of the VtrA/VtrC complex reveals that their periplasmic domains form a obligate heterodimer where VtrC folds into an open eight-stranded β-barrel and VtrA adopts a mixed α/β structure whereby one of its a β-strands contributes to the formation of the β-barrel. The VtrA/VtrC heterodimer fold is similar to members of the calycin superfamily, which contain eight to ten-stranded β-barrels that often bind hydrophobic molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flower et al., 2000</xref>). Calycins have low sequence similarity, but relatively high structural conservation. They can be subdivided into several families based on structural details characteristic of each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flower et al., 2000</xref>). Calycin families are markedly different in their distribution among biological kingdoms, cellular localization, and function, e.g.: (1) FABPs are cytosolic proteins involved in lipid homeostasis in animals, (2) MPIs are bacterial proteins that are secreted into the periplasm to inhibit metalloproteases, (3) lipocalins are found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and they are mostly extracellular or attached to the outer membrane and bind a variety of ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flower et al., 2000</xref>). In terms of structure, VtrC does not seem to cluster with any particular family and it forms its own clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Although calycins have been found to form complexes with other proteins, our inspection of the available structures of complexes did not reveal any arrangement that resembled that of the VtrA/VtrC obligate heterodimer. This complex is unique for this family because it is formed from two proteins and it is a complex that transmits a signal upon binding its ligand.</p><p>Interestingly, members of the FABP family have been found to bind bile salts. This is exemplified by human and porcine ileal lipid binding proteins (ILBPs), and their NMR structures in complex with taurocholate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kurz et al., 2003</xref>) and glycocholate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lücke et al., 2000</xref>), respectively. Analogous to VtrC's disordered loop and short α-helix, FABPs have a helix-turn-helix motif that forms a lid over one side of the barrel and is proposed to act as a portal for ligand access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Storch and McDermott, 2009</xref>). In the case of FABPs, it has been suggested that ligand binding induces subtle conformational changes that promote protein-membrane or protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Storch and McDermott, 2009</xref>). We observe a similar scenario for the VtrA/VtrC obligate heterodimer bound to bile salts where, upon binding bile salt, it appears an unstructured loop is translocated from the inside of the hydrophobic chamber to the outside of the chamber, where it becomes structured. Future studies will focus on how a conformational change during bile salt binding may induce a switch in the VtrA/VtrC interaction that will result in activation of the VtrA cytoplasmic transcription activator domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>The closest example with regard to complex formation and function is the GrlR/GrlA complex, a regulator of the T3SS-encoding locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) in enterohaemorrhagic and enteropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains (EHEC and EPEC, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Padavannil et al., 2013</xref>). GrlR is a cytosolic lipocalin that represses the LEE repressor GrlA by binding to its helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain. Similar to <italic>vtrA</italic> and <italic>vtrC, grlR</italic> and <italic>grlA</italic> are transcribed from a bicistronic operon, although the order of the lipocalin and transcriptional regulator genes is reversed in the latter pair. Analytical ultracentrifugation and the structure of GrlR in complex with the GrlA HTH domain revealed a heterotrimeric complex where a GrlR dimer binds one GrlA HTH monomer (PDB ID: 4KT5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Padavannil et al., 2013</xref>). It has been shown that the inner cavity of GrlR binds lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jobichen et al., 2009</xref>). However, the role of lipid binding in this system is unknown. Although GrlR and VtrC have analogous roles regulating T3SS through their interaction with a transcription factor, they do so from different cellular compartments at different stoichiometries, and their binding partners (GrlA HTH domain and VtrA periplasmic domain, respectively) have different folds.</p><p>Several signaling features of VtrA/VtrC appear to parallel two other pairs of regulatory proteins found in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, ToxR/ToxS and TcpP/TcpH, which control the expression of numerous virulence factors including CT and TCP. First, the genes encoding the proteins in each pair are arranged in bicistronic operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miller et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Häse and Mekalanos, 1998</xref>). Second, VtrA/ToxR/TcpP and VtrC/ToxS/TcpH have the same cellular localization and membrane topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miller et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Häse and Mekalanos, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller et al., 1987</xref>). Third, VtrC, ToxS and TcpH affect the activity of VtrA, ToxR and TcpP, respectively. On this last point, we showed that VtrA and VtrC form a complex in vivo both before and after T3SS2 activation and in vitro through their periplasmic domains.</p><p>Our data supports a model in which VtrA and VtrC form a complex both in the absence and presence of bile salts. Upon binding bile salts to the hydrophobic chamber in the VtrA/VtrC complex, the cytoplasmic DNA binding domain of VtrA is activated and in turn induces VtrB to activate the T3SS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The specific changes caused by binding bile salts and their effects on the VtrA DNA-binding domain are yet to be determined. Although VtrA contains no cysteine residues in its periplasmic domain, it is still possible that bile salts increase VtrA activity by inducing its dimerization or oligomerization, similar to what has been proposed for the ToxR/ToxS and TcpP/TcpH systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ottemann and Mekalanos, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15718.019</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model for bile salts sensing and T3SS2 regulation in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>.</title><p>In the absence of bile salts, VtrA (green) and VtrC (blue) form a complex where the VtrA cytoplasmic DNA binding domain is kept inactive.

The differences between T3SS gene representation in these bacteria demonstrate this system's diversity and imply that the T3SS may be evolving in response to different living environments. Based on surrounding genes, this bile salt receptor complex may have adapted in other species to bind other hydrophilic ligands. For example, in the ten strains that lack a <italic>vtrB</italic> homolog but possess a <italic>vtrA/vtrC</italic> pair, the gene downstream of the <italic>vtrA/vtrC</italic> operon encodes a putative sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase.

Additionally, we have found that a family of monomeric lipid binding calycin domain proteins has expanded to include an obligate heterodimer that binds bile salts and can be used to transmit a signal.

Due to widespread nature and strong conservation of the VtrB helix-turn-helix sequence in many transcription factors, we required VtrB orthologs to: 1. be the top-scoring hit in the respective genomes, 2. retain the predicted C-terminal transmembrane helix and 3. be in close proximity to the VtrA/VtrC gene pair. Representatives from each sequence family were aligned using the MAFFT server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/">http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/</ext-link>).</p><p>To calculate the structure-based distance tree, representative structures were chosen from the lipocalins/streptavidin group in the Evolutionary Classification Of protein Domain structures (ECOD) database. We chose structures with bound ligands, when available, from the main branches of the calycin superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flower et al., 2000</xref>): lipocalins (1kt7:1–175, 2aco:10–177), triabin (4n7c:3–176), fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) (1o1v: 1–126, 3wvm:0–132), streptavidin (2f01:14–134), and metalloprotease inhibitor (MPI) (1jiw:1–105, chain I). We also included the HRI1 N-terminal domain structure (HRIN-like; 3rby:1–151) with a unique binding site that traverses the lipocalin-like barrel core, as well as the VtrC structure. The representative lipocalin-like domains were compared pairwise all-against-all using DaliLite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holm and Park, 2000</xref>). Pairwise DaliLite Z-scores (Z<sub>AB</sub>) were transformed to distances by comparing to self DaliLite Z-scores (Z<sub>AA</sub>, Z<sub>BB</sub>) using the following equation: -ln(Z<sub>AB</sub>/(0.5*Z<sub>AA</sub>+0.5*Z<sub>BB</sub>)). The structure-based tree was produced using the FITCH program (with global optimization) of the Phylip package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Felsenstein, 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> strains using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN 74134).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Losick as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alejandro Buschiazzo (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers and editor found the work intriguing. However, there was unanimity in the feeling that the manuscript did not provide an understanding of bile recognition in the investigated signal transduction pathway. Moreover, there were several technical and conceptual issues that are detailed in the comments presented below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Li P et al. report the discovery of a new protein (VtrC) as an essential element to regulate type three secretion system 2 in Vibrio. VtrC is shown to form a complex with VtrA, which is responsive to bile (a known inductor of T3SS2, ultimately modulating virulence). VtrA and VtrB had already been identified as essential T3SS2 regulators, but the mechanism of bile sensing and signal transduction remains unknown, and this is the main question the authors want to address.</p><p>After identifying VtrC, the authors demonstrate that vtrA and vtrC belong to a single operon and, elegantly, that deletion of vtrC specifically affects T3SS2 and bile sensitivity.</p><p>VtrC is further characterized as a bitopic membrane protein, which led to uncovering periplasmic interaction with VtrA in vivo (co-IP). Not affecting vtrA transcription, VtrC appears to be critical for VtrA protein stability.</p><p>1) Why didn't the authors raise an antibody against the whole periplasmic (or intracellular) domain of VtrA? (VtrA might be expressed in the absence of VtrC, but that last short segment is being degraded, or that epitope is conformational and sensitive to VtrC binding?)</p><p>2) The crystal structure of the VtrA/VtrC complex represents an important contribution, confirming the association between both proteins.</p><p>Some concerns about the crystallographic data (the authors' feedback is important):</p><p>• for a 2-wavelength MAD phasing, 0.25 seems a suspiciously low FOM figure (what can you say about the three Se sites that were not found with direct methods, on the final refined model?)</p><p>• Rfree in principle seems high (almost 30%) for a 2.7Å resolution structure. No electron density is shown. Were there any difficulties throughout refinement? Is electron density good throughout the asymmetric unit? (please include a supplementary figure with best and worst ED map regions)</p><p>• Stereochemical rmsd figures for bond lengths and angles are extremely low. Why? Were extra-tight restraints used during refinement? if yes, why?</p><p>Please briefly address these points in the Materials and methods.</p><p>3) Are there other, alternative, heterodimer architectures (or yet, tetrameric organizations etc) in the cubic packing? Please cite the next best inter-protomer buried interface surface, ruling out otherwise ambiguous oligomeric choices.</p><p>4) The structural data don't seem to contribute all that much into a mechanistic understanding. Particularly, the ligand-binding site cannot be pinpointed as the authors admit. Did the authors attempt crystallizing the complex in the presence of TDC or other potential ligands? Make this explicit. Structurally assessing how VtrA-VtrC recognizes bile would be a major mechanistic insight (see next).</p><p>5) TDC is used as the sole ligand assayed by ITC, based on a previous report, but bile is really heterogeneous. The authors would benefit of incubating the complex with bile, then purifying and crystallizing (also MS can be helpful), attempting to see and/or identify ligands, which may not be TDC. Actually, the authors claim that TDC binds with nM affinity, which is somewhat misleading. KD is actually on the low microM range (i.e. nearer microM than nM, in contrast to most FABPs used as reference in Richieri et al. 2000 Biochemistry). &quot;Nanomolar&quot; should thus be changed to &quot;low μM&quot; in the Abstract and Discussion. Maybe other bile components bind tighter and are relevant physiologically?</p><p>6) Structural data would also be valuable to understand the critical role of interacting residues in the VtrA/VtrC interface.

It had previously been shown that the proteins VtrA and VtrB were necessary for bile-mediated induction of the T3SS2 system, and VtrA activated VtrB in response to bile. This paper identifies a new component of this system, VtrC, that is in the membrane associated with VtrA. The authors crystalize the periplasmic interacting domains of VtrA and VtrC, in the absence of bile, and show the complex binds bile. This is a nice manuscript that definitely increases our understanding of this process, but I feel the authors overstep a bit in terms of the novelty of this work and their conclusions that they provide mechanistic insight into this process. Therefore, my enthusiasm is somewhat tempered.</p><p>1) The authors state that &quot;the mechanism of bile sensing by these bacteria remains elusive&quot;. From the introduction, it would seem that not bile responsive proteins have been identified, or the impact of bile on these proteins elucidated. However, in Vibrio cholerae ToxT binding to bile inhibits its ability to bind target promoters, and as the authors state in the discussion bile has been shown to induce disulfide bonds in ToxR.</p><p>2) The authors don't really uncover the mechanism of VtrAC bile sensing, but just another important component of the system. For instance, I was surprised that the authors did not use the crystal structure to engineer mutations that would be predicted to disrupt the interaction or disrupt the binding to bile. Moreover, no structures are determined with bile, and they only identify the structure of the periplasmic domains, so how bile binding is transduced to changes in DNA binding affinity is not understood. They clearly make important advances, but this manuscript does not provide the mechanism of bile sensing.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Bile Salt Receptor Complex Activates a Pathogenic Type III Secretion System&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>There some questions about the processing of the diffraction data, which should be addressed before the manuscript can be accepted for publication. These questions are as follows:</p><p>The authors should be aware that the F432 cubic space group is extremely rare in protein crystal structures (~200 entries belonging to it, among the &gt;10<sup>5</sup> structures in the PDB). So, although possible to encounter, as with any unusual discovery, one should be extra cautious to avoid mistakes.</p><p>For the next few comments, you might want to check whether your space group assignment was correct (or could there be a form of pseudo-symmetry?). Pseudo-symmetry often results in regions of the alleged ASU with weak electron density and greater difficulty in model building. This is why I had asked previously about how good the electron density is, not only in the good parts, but also in the bad ones (the authors misunderstood replying only with the obvious: that density is better in the core and worse in the flexible solvent-exposed regions). A mistake in the space group could end up being worrisome in giving parts of the model wrong (even on top of parts that are right). The new structure in complex with TDC, is in part reassuring (a confirmation with different packing), but some figures of its own, also raise questions.</p><p>Issues that have remained unanswered:</p><p>1) Phasing FOM too low: 0.25 is suspicious for a MAD experiment. Could be explained because of too little anomalous signal (e.g. only two methionines for approx. 200 residues – probably a quite tough phasing scenario). Again, my point was to think (and test!) whether there is a lower symmetry possibility to integrate the data in, and then see if shelxd works better. Straightforward tests that you can also perform to scrutinize this SG assignment: a) use ccp4 program zanuda to analyze your cubic data, it will systematically test for lower compatible space group choices (and also perform some initial refinement for each, to have comparative figures); b) reintegrate the cubic data in P1, and perform mol replacement now that you have a solution (which is maybe completely right, or at least partially right for sure), searching for as many hetero-dimers as you calculate according to the triclinic unit cell volume: if a solution is found, than you can analyze if the packing indeed conforms to a such highly symmetric space group as F432.</p><p>2) Maybe it is cubic, end of story.</p><p>3) But, if alternative choices do appear, not only shelxd might give better FOM, but actually maps may turn out better (in the bad parts, if there were); final refined average B factors closer to Wilson B (this is a definitely strange behavior reported in your table); better <italic>Rmerge</italic> statistics (also high, not only in the high resolution shell, but also in the low res – I know high multiplicity is here at play, so I do not want to say this is necessarily wrong: just look closely and critically at it, to avoid mistakes).</p><p>4) I would strongly advise against including hydrogen atoms in the refinements. Else, explain really well why you think it's OK to include them. This goes also for the orthorhombic form with TDC. The validation reports seem clear in that you have included them: to support a refinement strategy with independent H atoms you would need ultra-high resolution (i.e. better than 1.2Å) or a neutron light source for the diffraction experiment.</p><p>5) The nominal resolution for the new orthorhombic structure is probably not 2.1Å: very low completeness of the data (57% high res shell). Please reconsider this. Actually, please elaborate as to why completeness drops significantly comparing the processed data vs those used for refinement.</p><p>It is suggested to reduce/simplify subsection “The VtrA/VtrC complex is an obligate heterodimer”; it's enough there to indicate that only 2 Se-Met out of the 5 present in the protein complex, were ultimately seen to be ordered in the refined model, hence contributing proportionally little to the measured anomalous signal in the first place (likely explaining the low FOM figure at the phasing step, previous to density modification).</p><p>In this context it is rather misleading to state that the 2 Se-Met &quot;were used for refinement&quot;, actually you are probably talking here about their use to solve the substructure of anomalous scatterers for subsequent protein phasing purposes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15718.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Li P et al. report the discovery of a new protein (VtrC) as an essential element to regulate type three secretion system 2 in Vibrio. VtrC is shown to form a complex with VtrA, which is responsive to bile (a known inductor of T3SS2, ultimately modulating virulence). VtrA and VtrB had already been identified as essential T3SS2 regulators, but the mechanism of bile sensing and signal transduction remains unknown, and this is the main question the authors want to address.</italic> </p><p><italic>After identifying VtrC, the authors demonstrate that vtrA and vtrC belong to a single operon and, elegantly, that deletion of vtrC specifically affects T3SS2 and bile sensitivity.</italic> </p><p><italic>VtrC is further characterized as a bitopic membrane protein, which led to uncovering periplasmic interaction with VtrAin vivo (co-IP). Not affecting vtrA transcription, VtrC appears to be critical for VtrA protein stability.</italic></p><p><italic>1) Why didn't the authors raise an antibody against the whole periplasmic (or intracellular) domain of VtrA? (VtrA might be expressed in the absence of VtrC, but that last short segment is being degraded, or that epitope is conformational and sensitive to VtrC binding?)</italic></p><p>We made a peptide antibody to the most antigenic region of VtrA found on its C-terminus and used this reagent in many of our studies. We agree with the reviewer that the possibility exists that the C-terminal fragment of VtrA could be degraded and we would miss this with our antibody. To avoid confusion, we have rephrased the following sentence &quot;Taken together, VtrC appears to function upstream of VtrB through a mechanism that may involve stabilizing VtrA.&quot; to &quot;Thus, VtrC appears to function upstream of VtrB via a signaling cascade including VtrA. The observed disappearance of VtrA in the absence of VtrC could support a direct physical interaction between VtrA and VtrC.&quot; This hypothesis is then validated by our structural studies with the VtrA/VtrC complex.</p><p><italic>2) The crystal structure of the VtrA/VtrC complex represents an important contribution, confirming the association between both proteins.</italic></p><p><italic>Some concerns about the crystallographic data (the authors' feedback is important):</italic></p><p> <italic>• for a 2-wavelength MAD phasing, 0.25 seems a suspiciously low FOM figure (what can you say about the three Se sites that were not found with direct methods, on the final refined model?)</italic> </p><p>We have included the following explanation in the Results:</p><p>“The structure was solved by multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing using anomalous signals from selenomethionine and refined to a resolution of 2.70 Å using native data from an isomorphous crystal. Two of the five methionines, VtrA Se-Met 210 at the interface with VtrC and VtrC Se-Met 49, were used for refinement. Another two methionines showed no electron density and we presume they are highly disordered because they are N-terminal methionines. The final missing Se-Met is Se-Met 115 from VtrC, which is in the disordered loop that covers the β-barrel.”</p><p>The quoted Figure of Merit (FOM) of 0.25 was calculated at the end of phasing and thus is not inflated due to assumptions made during density modification.

Several factors contribute to the R<sub>free</sub> value observed in this structure, including the high solvent content (66%), the presence of a significant percentage of disordered and therefore unmodeled residues at the N-termini of both VtrA and VtrC as well as the disordered loop of VtrC (9% of all residues in the asymmetric unit), a lack of sidechain density for a significant number of residues on the solvent-exposed surface of the heterodimer, as well as significant differences in the mean B-values between VtrA and VtrC (62 Å2 vs. 77 Å2, respectively). Despite these issues, the observed R<sub>free</sub> is within acceptable limits for the observed high resolution limit of the data (Kleywegt G.J. and Brünger A.T. (1996) Checking your imagination: applications of the free R value. <italic>Structure</italic><bold>4</bold>:897-904). The “best” electron density map regions correspond to the hydrophobic core of each monomer, while the “worst” regions correspond to the surface of the heterodimer that is exposed to the bulk solvent.</p><p> <italic>• Stereochemical rmsd figures for bond lengths and angles are extremely low.

Given the medium-low resolution of the dataset plus the high solvent content (as discussed in the previous point) as well as the excellent geometry of the final model, it appears that PHENIX has done an appropriate job in this case.</p><p><italic>3) Are there other, alternative, heterodimer architectures (or yet, tetrameric organizations etc) in the cubic packing?

Previously, Gotoh et al. (2010) established that bile salts are the component of bile that activates the T3SS2. We have recapitulated this data, and shown that the bile salt TDC is an activator of this system. Therefore, we used TDC for our biophysical analysis of the VtrA/VtrC complex.</p><p><italic>Actually, the authors claim that TDC binds with nM affinity, which is somewhat misleading. KD is actually on the low microM range (i.e. nearer microM than nM, in contrast to most FABPs used as reference in Richieri et al. 2000 Biochemistry). &quot;Nanomolar&quot; should thus be changed to &quot;low μM&quot; in the Abstract and Discussion. Maybe other bile components bind tighter and are relevant physiologically?</italic></p><p>In Richieri's paper, they tested FABPS from different sources against a variety of fatty acids by the ADIFAB fluorescence method.

This particular phasing experiment utilized 1 Se site for 108 amino acids (as density for only 216 amino acids was observed and modeled by the final rounds of refinement), hence the chosen phasing method was MAD and not SAD. Data processing and phasing was performed in the graphical user interface of <italic>HKL3000,</italic> with autocorrections implemented to correct for systematic errors such as radiation damage and absorption, and to apply <italic>B</italic>-factor sharpening (Borek D, Dauter Z, Otwinowski Z.

We have found the multiple corrections applied in the autocorrections routine of <italic>HKL3000</italic> to be critical to our success in phasing numerous difficult anomalous phasing projects. In this case, only the first wavelength (anomalous peak) was chosen for the heavy atom search, as more extensive radiation damage had occurred during the data collection for the second wavelength (inflection point).

Density for only two methionines was observed in the map from the final rounds of model refinement for the native protein (due to disorder of the N-terminal methionines from both monomers of the heterodimer, and the remaining missing methionine is located in the short disordered loop of five residues in VtrC). Both wavelengths were used for phasing in <italic>MLPHARE</italic>, with a resulting FOM of 0.25 for the complete resolution range from 35.7 – 2.60 Å. This compares well with the estimate of anomalous signal calculated in <italic>PHENIX</italic>:<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15718.023</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15718.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15718.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15718-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig></p><p>In this table, the FOM estimate if the sub-structure (i.e., the Se sites) is solved is 0.3 (+/- 0.1).

Thus we believe that this model and space group are correct.</p><p><italic>Straightforward tests that you can also perform to scrutinize this SG assignment: a) use ccp4 program zanuda to analyze your cubic data, it will systematically test for lower compatible space group choices (and also perform some initial refinement for each, to have comparative figures); b) reintegrate the cubic data in P1, and perform mol replacement now that you have a solution (which is maybe completely right, or at least partially right for sure), searching for as many hetero-dimers as you calculate according to the triclinic unit cell volume: if a solution is found, than you can analyze if the packing indeed conforms to a such highly symmetric space group as F432.</italic> </p><p>The authors performed this test, and a screenshot of the log file is shown below.

The data was scaled in <italic>HKL3000</italic> using the autocorrections routine, which performs extensive <italic>B</italic>-factor sharpening; only the sharpened <italic>B</italic>-factors were originally reported. The unsharpened Wilson <italic>B</italic>-factors for all datasets are now included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. For the SeMet and native F432 structures, the unsharpened Wilson <italic>B</italic>-factors are 77.6 to 79.0, very similar with the observed mean <italic>B</italic>-values for the refined model.</p><p>It is a well-known consequence of high multiplicity (in the case of the native model, 36-fold) that the values for <italic>Rmerge</italic> will be artificially higher than expected, even though the merged data are improved by averaging more observations. This is the reason that reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> are values for <italic>Rpim</italic>, the precision indicating <italic>R</italic>-factor (Evans P.R. (2011) An introduction to data reduction: space group determination, scaling and intensity statistics. <italic>Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr</italic> <bold>67</bold>:282-92.), which estimates the data quality after merging. These values are roughly a factor of 6-fold lower than the <italic>Rmerge</italic> values, and we think these values more accurately reflect the quality of the native data set. In addition, the CC<sub>1/2</sub> value for the highest resolution shell (0.934) generously exceeds that recommended as a suitable high-resolution cutoff limit (Diederichs K. and Karplus P.A. (2012) Linking crystallographic model and data quality. <italic>Science</italic> 336:1030-1033).</p><p><italic>4) I would strongly advise against including hydrogen atoms in the refinements. Else, explain really well why you think it's OK to include them. This goes also for the orthorhombic form with TDC. The validation reports seem clear in that you have included them: to support a refinement strategy with independent H atoms you would need ultra-high resolution (i.e. better than 1.2Å) or a neutron light source for the diffraction experiment.</italic> </p><p>Modern methods of macromolecular crystallographic refinement encourage the inclusion of hydrogen atoms at ALL resolutions. These hydrogen atoms are not located independently in an electron density map and refined independently of the non-hydrogen atoms in the model; rather, they are placed in geometrically idealized conformations with relation to the non-hydrogen atoms they are covalently bonded to and during positional refinement they are tied to their bonded atoms. These are thus known as “riding hydrogen atoms” and they have been used for decades in small-molecule refinements (especially in cases where hydrogen atoms are not explicitly observed in the electron density maps). Since 2010 the program authors of <italic>PHENIX</italic> have encouraged users to incorporate riding hydrogen atoms into their refinement protocols (Adams P.D., <italic>et al.</italic> (2010) PHENIX – a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution. <italic>Acta Crystallographica D Biol Crystallogr</italic> <bold>66</bold>:213–221; Afonine PV, Mustyakimov M, Grosse-Kunstleve RW, Moriarty NW, Langan P, Adams PD (2010) Joint X-ray and neutron refinement with phenix.refine. <italic>Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr</italic> <bold>66</bold>:1153-63.), and in fact, <italic>REFMAC</italic> adds the riding hydrogen atoms by default (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/html/refmac5/keywords/restraints.html">http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/html/refmac5/keywords/restraints.html</ext-link>). The reasons for including riding hydrogen atoms in refinement are two-fold: 1) the hydrogen atoms actually exist in the molecules and contribute to the X-ray scattering at low resolution, so their inclusion in the refinement improves the agreement between <italic>F<sub>obs</sub></italic>and <italic>F<sub>calc</sub></italic> at low resolution; and 2) their inclusion improves the geometry of the refined model, as they are used to analyze clashes due to van der Waals repulsions. Jane and David Richardson have shown the utility of this method with the <italic>MolProbity</italic> server, which requires hydrogen atoms for the all-atom contact analysis it performs for validation of macromolecular structures (Chen et al. (2010) MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography. <italic>Acta Crystallographica D Biol Crystallogr</italic> <bold>66</bold>:12-21.).</p><p>The two major refinement packages handle riding hydrogen atoms differently. <italic>REFMAC</italic> utilizes implicit hydrogen atoms and does not automatically write them out to the resulting PDB file (although the user may choose to explicitly to write them out), and <italic>PHENIX</italic> automatically includes them in the resulting PDB file. The user would actively need to remove the hydrogen atoms from a file generated by the <italic>PHENIX</italic> refinement program prior to PDB deposition. The authors of this work have chosen to include all atoms used to calculate the structure factors that are deposited along with the model coordinates in the PDB, thus statistics for the riding hydrogen atoms appear in the PDB validation report.</p><p><italic>5) The nominal resolution for the new orthorhombic structure is probably not 2.1Å: very low completeness of the data (57% high res shell). Please reconsider this. Actually, please elaborate as to why completeness drops significantly comparing the processed data vs those used for refinement.</italic> </p><p>This dataset displays significant anisotropy, which results in the relatively low completeness in the highest resolution shell during data collection (79.4%). Anisotropic diffraction was corrected to adjust the error model and to compensate for a radiation-induced increase of non-isomorphism within the crystal. These corrections were applied to the data during scaling in the autocorrections routine of <italic>HKL3000</italic> and thus are responsible for the difference in completeness between the data collection and refinement (Borek D, Dauter Z, Otwinowski Z. (2012) Identification of patterns in diffraction intensities affected by radiation exposure. <italic>J Synchrotron Radiat</italic> <bold>20</bold>:37-48; Borek D, Cymborowski M, Machius M, Minor W, Otwinowski Z.

(2007) The many faces of radiation-induced changes. <italic>J Synchrotron Radiat</italic> <bold>14</bold>:24-33.).</p><p>The resolution chosen as the refinement limit (2.10 Å) was chosen carefully and is consistent with current practices.</p><p>a) The I/σ(I) is greater than 1.0 and less than 3.0;</p><p>b) The percentage completeness in the highest resolution shell is greater than 50%;</p><p>c) The CC<sub>1/2</sub> in the highest resolution shell is 0.754, and greater than 0.5 (this value for all datasets has been included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>;</p><p>d) The multiplicity in the highest resolution shell is greater than 2.0;</p><p>e) The electron density map, the refinement statistics and the model stereochemical parameters degrade in quality when the highest resolution limit used for refinement is 2.15 Å.</p><p>It is current practice to include data from resolution shells that in the past were ignored due to a high percentage of weak data and/or lower than 100% completeness due to anisotropy (Diederichs K. and Karplus P.A. (2012) Linking crystallographic model and data quality. <italic>Science</italic> <bold>336</bold>:1030-1033; Weiss M.S. (2001) Global indicators of X-ray data quality. <italic>J Appl Cryst</italic> <bold>34</bold>:130-135; Diederichs K. and Karplus P.A. (1997) Improved <italic>R</italic>-factors for diffraction data analysis in macromolecular crystallography. <italic>Nat Struct Mol Biol</italic> <bold>4</bold>:269-274.). In this case, inclusion of the data in resolution shells to 2.10 Å actually improves the model and refinement statistics, which are excellent, and thus the authors have not changed the upper resolution limit for the structure with the bile salt.</p><p><italic>It is suggested to reduce/simplify subsection “The VtrA/VtrC complex is an obligate heterodimer”; it's enough there to indicate that only 2 Se-Met out of the 5 present in the protein complex, were ultimately seen to be ordered in the refined model, hence contributing proportionally little to the measured anomalous signal in the first place (likely explaining the low FOM figure at the phasing step, previous to density modification).</italic> </p><p><italic>In this context it is rather misleading to state that the 2 Se-Met &quot;were used for refinement&quot;, actually you are probably talking here about their use to solve the substructure of anomalous scatterers for subsequent protein phasing purposes.</italic></p><p>Indeed the wording that should have been used in this case was “Two of the five methionines, VtrA Se-Met 210 at the interface with VtrC and VtrC Se-Met 49, were used for phasing.” This sentence, plus the following two sentences, were added in response to the previous reviewer questions regarding how the structure could have been phased with only two selenomethionine sites. Thus we will replace these three sentences with the following shorter, clearer sentences:</p><p>“Two of the five selenomethionines were used for phasing. The two N-terminal methionines and Se-Met 115 in the loop that covers the β barrel of VtrC were not observed in the final electron density map and were not included in the final model.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
