speciation, the tempo and pattern of divergence at the genomic level remain unclear. We examine genome-wide divergence of putatively single-copy orthologous genes (POGs) in 20 allopatric species/variety pairs from diverse angiosperm clades, with 16 pairs reflecting the classic eastern Asia-eastern North America floristic disjunction. In each pair, &gt;90% of POGs are under purifying selection, and &lt;10% are under positive selection. A set of POGs are under strong positive selection, 14 of which are shared by 10–15 pairs, and one shared by all pairs; 15 POGs are annotated to biological processes responding to various stimuli. The relative abundance of POGs under different selective forces exhibits a repeated pattern among pairs despite an ~10 million-year difference in divergence time. Species divergence times are positively correlated with abundance of POGs under moderate purifying selection, but negatively correlated with abundance of POGs under strong purifying selection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genetic divergence</kwd><kwd>allopatric/geographic speciation</kwd><kwd>transcriptome sequencing</kwd><kwd>eastern Asia-eastern North America floristic disjunction</kwd><kwd>molecular evolution</kwd><kwd>positive selection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-442161</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Yibo</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Wenbin</given-names></name><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>Jenny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-442280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Shichao</given-names></name><name><surname>Soltis</surname><given-names>Pamela S</given-names></name><name><surname>Soltis</surname><given-names>Douglas E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-024629</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Shichao</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yun-peng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The genomic architecture of allopatric species is a mosaic of many conserved genes and a few adaptive ones, reflecting balance between conservation of ancestral functions and evolution of new features.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Identifying the factors driving divergence is a key research topic of speciation genomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wolf and Ellegren, 2017</xref>). Although there has been progress in identification of individual speciation genes and genomic islands of divergence in speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nosil and Feder, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Renaut et al., 2013</xref>), it remains an open question as to whether there are general genomic patterns and processes of molecular evolution accompanying the divergence of species. Natural selection and drift are recognized as the major processes promoting divergence. However, the relative roles of these processes, the proportion of the genome affected by natural selection, and the strength of selection in generating genomic divergence have remained poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kimura, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Noor and Bennett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett and Hoekstra, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nosil and Feder, 2013</xref>). A few recent studies have uncovered repeated patterns of genomic divergence driven by selection in species formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gagnaire et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnegard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Renaut et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soria-Carrasco et al., 2014</xref>) and suggested that divergence may often result from changes at a relatively small subset of genes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conte et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Geographic speciation is a common driving force in generating biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coyne and Allen Orr, 1998</xref>). Given sufficient time and/or selection pressures, genomic divergence between allopatric populations is expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coyne and Allen Orr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nosil, 2008</xref>). However, how genes diverge over time at a genomic scale after major geographic isolation that completely interrupts gene flow has remained an unanswered question. Meta-analyses of closely related species that span a range of time scales of geographic isolation will be, therefore, particularly beneficial for gaining insights into this question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nosil et al., 2009</xref>). Such studies might allow us to reconstruct how genomic divergence unfolds as speciation proceeds through time.</p><p>Putatively orthologous (single-copy) genes (POGs) identified in RNA-seq data sets of closely related species offer a valuable genome-wide window on molecular divergence of a unique subset of the genome following speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Smet et al., 2013</xref>). Investigating how these genes diverge during speciation and subsequent evolution contributes an important perspective to speciation genomics. Such studies may illuminate the functional divergence of the allopatric genomes and the underlying ecological forces that shape them. The forests of eastern Asia (EA) and eastern North America (ENA) share 65 genera of seed plants with closely related species occurring in the two areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boufford and Spongberg, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wen et al., 2016</xref>). This well-known floristic disjunction is a major phytogeographic pattern of the Northern Hemisphere and has been known since the time of Linnaeus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wen, 1999</xref>). The origins of the disjunction and impact on plant evolution have been investigated over the past 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xiang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xiang and Soltis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donoghue and Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manos and Meireles, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qian et al., 2017</xref>). Many of these genera are small with one to a few species. Previous analyses using mainly plastid and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) DNA sequence markers revealed that the divergence times of disjunct sister species in EA and ENA varied greatly from the Miocene to the Pleistocene or even more recently (15 mya to &lt;2.0 mya), although some disjunct clades in the two areas diverged earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Milne and Abbott, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donoghue and Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harris et al., 2013</xref>). These genera therefore represent different stages of allopatric divergence and are ideal for studying genomic divergence associated with geographic speciation.</p><p>In this paper, we compare the divergence patterns of genes identified as POGs in leaf transcriptomes of 20 allopatric species/variety pairs (or taxon pairs), all but four of which represent the EA-ENA floristic disjunction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The 20 taxon pairs we compared span a range of divergence times (20-23, 26-28), mostly representing sister species or varieties; however, in a few cases, the selected species represent sister clades of one vs. two species (<italic>Calycanthus, Gelsemium, Sassafras</italic>), one vs. a few species (<italic>Hamamelis</italic>), or two or three vs. a few species (<italic>Cornus</italic>-1, <italic>Liquidambar</italic>).</p><p>We examined the pattern of variation of synonymous substitutions (<italic>Ks</italic>; the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site), nonsynonymous substitutions (<italic>Ka</italic>; the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site), and the ratio (<italic>Ka</italic>/<italic>Ks</italic>) for each POG within each taxon pair using a custom pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>) and compared the patterns among taxon pairs representing these diverse angiosperm lineages. The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions (<italic>Ka/Ks</italic>) is probably the most common measure of selection pressure and for identifying positive selection (<italic>Ka/Ks</italic> &gt; 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang, 2003</xref>) in molecular evolutionary studies. The method is known to be a conservative approach to call positive selection on a gene as it uses an average <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratio across all nucleotide sites. We also examined the relative proportions of genes under different levels of selection forces and identify and annotate genes under strong positive selection based on the <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> values (&gt;2). Finally, we tested if the level of molecular divergence at synonymous sites (as measured by <italic>Ks</italic> at the peak frequency) reflects the relative divergence time of the species pair. Results from such analyses will illuminate the genomic pattern of genetic divergence of these genes under geographic isolation, and may also shed light on a small window of genomic divergence that unfolds as speciation proceeds through time. Furthermore, this study will provide a ‘genome-wide’ view of evolutionary divergence of species exhibiting the EA-ENA phytogeographic pattern, in comparison to previous understanding based on a few gene regions. The POGs examined in this study represented 52–68% of the total orthologous gene families in the transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>We stress that the POGs in leaf transcriptomes analyzed here are putative orthologs between the two species of each biogeographic pair found in the transcriptomes by OrthoMCL followed by customized scripts (see Methods below). It is possible, therefore, that some of these genes may have more than one copy in the genome (as a small gene family), but only one of them was expressed to a detectable level in the leaf. In such cases, it is possible that the two single-copy transcripts from the taxon pair may represent paralogous copies of the low-copy gene family, making the gene comparison non-orthologous. However, we think the likelihood of non-orthology of these genes is probably very low because in each case the two taxa are either sister species or intraspecific taxa, or represent the products of recently diverged sister clades where conservation of expression of a gene copy may be expected. We therefore do not think that the low probability of non-homology will affect our conclusions derived from thousands of putatively orthologous comparisons. However, we do want to make it clear that the discussion and conclusions about ‘genome-wide’ pattern of evolutionary divergence and processes in this paper are restricted to these genes of the genome. Nonetheless these POGs represent a significant portion of the gene families expressed in the transcriptome of each species (52%–68%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of the rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions provides a useful tool for understanding the mechanisms of DNA sequence evolution. A ratio of nonsynonymous (<italic>Ka</italic>) to synonymous (<italic>Ks</italic>) nucleotide substitutions greater than one is a common method for identifying positive selection in molecular evolutionary studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang, 2003</xref>). We are aware that uncertainty in <italic>Ka</italic>/<italic>Ks</italic> ratios is high when <italic>Ks</italic> is zero or close to zero. This uncertainty may lead to inflation of <italic>Ka</italic>/<italic>Ks</italic> ratios or false identification of genes under strong positive selection due to a high, infinite, or undefined <italic>Ka/K</italic>s value. To minimize this problem, we removed genes with <italic>Ks</italic> = 0 and genes with <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> = 99 for all analyses and only focused on genes with <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> &gt; 2 as candidates of strong positive selection for gene annotation analysis. Our detailed examination of the <italic>Ka</italic> and <italic>Ks</italic> data (see Discussion below) provided evidence supporting the candidate genes under positive selection detected in the study are unlikely artifacts of small <italic>Ks</italic>. Further, the Ka/Ks &gt; 2 ratios in these genes are unlikely a result of saturation of synonymous substitutions. Saturation of synonymous substitutions is often expected at deeper phylogenetic levels. We further used alternative method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wagner, 2007</xref>) to check for signals of positive selection in these genes with <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> &gt; 2. This method detects variation clusters of aggregated nucleotide substitutions that are too closely spaced to be observed by chance alone (violating the prediction from neutral evolution). Both the <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> and variation cluster methods may underestimate the number of genes under positive selection because some genes with <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> &lt; 1 may be under positive selection at only a few sites and these sites may not be necessarily clustered in the gene. However, our goal is not to determine exactly how many POGs are under positive selection, and this caveat does not affect our comparisons of average selection pressures among genes or comparisons of general patterns of gene divergence across species pairs. The genes identified as under positive selection by both methods are likely the true positive selection genes and will provide top candidates for future studies for their functions in driving allopatric divergence in these taxa.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The number of POGs in the leaf transcriptomes of the 20 biogeographic taxon pairs varies from 8596 to 15161 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The pattern we observed indicates that in each of the taxon pair, including the 16 EA-ENA pairs, most of the genes show shallow divergence or evolve slowly at a similar rate, while a small proportion of the genes evolve faster. This suggests that the molecular divergence in the POGs is generally low after geographic speciation. The peak frequency range of <italic>Ks</italic>, <italic>Ka</italic>, and <italic>Ka</italic>/<italic>Ks</italic> values revealed substantial differences in the magnitudes among genera, indicating that the taxon pairs have diverged to different extents, likely reflecting their relative timing of divergence and/or varying selection pressures among different genera. Evidence from divergence time estimation supported this prediction as discussed below.</p><p>Divergence time estimation using the global phylogeny with DNA sequences of the seven POGs shared by all of the studied species demonstrates variation in times of divergence among genera. Biogeographic pairs with similar <italic>Ks</italic> values of peak frequency diverged at similar geological times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The divergence times of taxon pairs fall into the window of the mid-Miocene to the Pleistocene, largely similar to previously reported times of divergence for these taxa (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiang et al., 2000</xref>; see summary in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Milne and Abbott, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ian Milne, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wen et al., 2010</xref>). Although the dates for some pairs were previously estimated to be older than obtained here (e.g., <italic>Cornus-1, Cornus-2, Liriodendron</italic>, <italic>Liquidambar</italic>, and <italic>Sassafras</italic>), those dates also fall in the Miocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wen et al., 2010</xref>). Divergence times similar to those estimated in this study have also been reported for <italic>Cornus</italic> and <italic>Liriodendron</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiang et al., 2000</xref>). The major pattern of divergence revealed here by analyses of many nuclear genes for the 16 EA-ENA disjunct taxon pairs is consistent with the previous mega-synthesis of studies of individual lineages that were largely based on ITS and/or a few plastid gene sequences or non-coding markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donoghue and Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harris et al., 2013</xref>). Both showed a major pattern of the Miocene or more recent disjunction of the EA and ENA sister species/varieties.</p><p>The divergence times estimated for the EA-NA (ENA, WNA, or NA) disjunct pairs in this study support the importance of a geographical connection through the Bering Land Bridge (BLB) and perhaps also long-distance dispersal (LDD) to explain a part of the EA-ENA floristic similarity. Geological evidence indicates that the BLB was available as a floristic connection throughout most of the Paleogene and Neogene and closed for the potential migration of terrestrial organisms between 7.4 and 4.8 mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marincovich and Gladenkov, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Graham, 2018</xref>), while the North Atlantic Land Bridge (NALB) broke up in the early Eocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marincovich et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tiffney, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The disjunction of the EA-NA taxon pairs may have occurred through vicariance (the break-up of what was once a continuous distribution by different climatic cooling or geological events occurring during the Neogene) or founder event (which could have occurred across the BLB to generate a new distribution or could have been a rare LDD event). Gene flow could stop around the time of migration simply because of geographic distance. Even though the BLB might still have been available, pollen and/or seed flow might have been limited given the geographic distance and high latitude of BLB (long, cold winter with short days). Divergence then could have occurred due to either selection or drift if the founder populations were small. On the other hand, if local populations were large and generation times were long, populations would not diverge very quickly under even limited gene flow and a physical break in the distribution. In such cases, divergences might post-date the end of the BLB and other barriers, for example, if disjunctions were formed by vicariance. At present, our data do not permit distinguishing between the alternative hypotheses of vicariance and LDD in establishing the EA-NA disjunction in these taxa. However, the fact that 65 genera of seed plants exhibit this disjunction and the availability of NALB and BLB for migration argue for vicariant origins of these taxa and the similar flora; LDD for this number of taxa representing a range of life histories does not seem parsimonious, and may only play a minor role in formation of the similar flora in EA and ENA. Development of phylogeny-based methodology that models speciation under the different scenarios is needed for testing these hypotheses.</p><p>Our analyses also revealed a repeated pattern of divergence of POGs among the taxon pairs in allopatric speciation. That is, we observed the same order of relative abundance of POGs under various selection pressures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), disregarding the relative timing of species isolation (i.e., differences in <italic>Ks</italic> value of peak abundance and divergence time), including those conspecific pairs. Specifically, we found a tiny portion of the POGs are under strong positive selection or putatively evolve neutrally, while most of the POGs are under purifying selection pressures. Although the <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratio and variation cluster both have low power for detecting positive selection (leading to underestimation of number of positive selection genes), this pattern is likely true due to functional constraint of protein coding genes. The observed pattern further suggests that most of the molecular evolution (or DNA substitution) in the POGs was neutral (or synonymous). The deciduous forests in eastern Asia and eastern North America are situated at similar latitudes, and both China and the United States have an eastern coast line; thus, they may have similar regional climatic and ecological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">E. Ricklefs et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, there are presumably low divergence pressures for gene functional evolution in the two areas. One would therefore expect most genes to evolve slowly under purifying selection to conserve ancestral functions and the observed excess synonymous substitutions (in comparison to non-synonymou substitutions) in these genes were results of elimination of nonsynonymous substitutions by natural selection while the neutral synonymous substitutions were fixed by genetic drift. On the other hand, although eastern Asia and eastern North America share similarities in general climate, there must be differences in micro-abiotic and biotic environments between the two regions which could have driven diversifying evolution of some genes in the sister lineages for local adaptation, speciation, and subsequent divergence.</p><p>Our results are consistent with these predictions. A dominant majority of the POGs examined in this study were under strong purifying selection pressures and only a tiny portion of the genes (0.6%–2%) were potentially under ‘strong’ positive selection (<italic>Ka/Ks</italic> &gt; 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Annotation of these genes evolving under strong positive selection in the EA-ENA taxon pairs pointed to potential abiotic and biotic agents of selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>; also see discussion below). The observation of this same pattern in non-EA-ENA taxon pairs suggests that this ‘conservatism’ pattern of gene evolution may be a rule for allopatric speciation of any organism, which allows conservation of the ancestral system as well as opportunities for modification of the ancestral system during speciation. The conserved order of gene abundance, as observed in all taxon pairs in this study, may be essential to maintaining a balance between the ability to preserve the ancestral biological system and the ability to evolve new features that are beneficial for new adaptation. Although genome-wide conservation of genes may have been predicted in the past, we present here empirical evidence from thousandths of putative orthologous genes supporting this evolutionary pattern of conservatism in geographic speciation across a wide array of angiosperm lineages. The repeated pattern of variation of relative abundance of POGs under different selection pressures among taxa may represent a genomic ‘rule’ that can be tested by examining all gene families in the transcriptomes or genomes of the studied taxa. It is allied with a hypothesis that molecular evolution in the allopatric taxa is mostly neutral involving mostly silent nucleotide substitutions in the genome. This hypothesis may be further tested by examining molecular evolution of genes in additional plant lineages to determine if it is supported and is a rule. Study of three pairs of sunflower species that diverged along latitudinal or longitudinal gradients similarly showed a repeated pattern of genomic divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Renaut et al., 2014</xref>), with evidence implying that both purifying and divergent selection contributed to repeatable patterns of divergence and that repeated genome evolution may have resulted from both similar selective pressures and shared local genomic landscapes.</p><p>Our observation of the length of time of species isolation is positively correlated with the abundance of genes under moderate pressure of purifying selection (0.1 &lt; <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> &lt; 0.5), but negatively correlated with the abundance of genes under strong pressure of purifying selection (<italic>Ka/Ks</italic> &lt; 0.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggests that as geographic isolation or divergence proceeded in time (within the time window of divergence of the species pairs studied), the purifying selection pressures of some genes may have shifted from high intensity during early geographic isolation to lower intensity at the later stage of isolation. The shift might be attributed to changes of evolutionary trajectories of the gene at some sites where replacement substitutions are favored for modification of the ancestral functions leading to relevant morphological/ecological divergence between the species pairs. Alternatively, a relaxed purifying selection intensity of some genes could be simply a result of accumulation of slightly deleterious nonsynonymous substitutions rather than adaptive evolution. The increase of <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratios with time observed in our study is unlikely an artifact of saturation at silent sites of these genes because saturation of silent sites may be expected in comparisons of deep phylogenetic lineages (e.g., family or higher ranks) and unlikely to occur in species/variety pairs. Time-dependent shift of purifying selection intensity have also been reported in study of yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elyashiv et al., 2010</xref>). The model developed for evolution of purifying selection in this study revealed that most, but not all changes, could be explained by systematic shifts in the efficacy of selection. An observation of a weak negative relationship between <italic>Ks</italic> peak values and abundance of genes under positive selection pressure (<italic>Ka/Ks</italic> &gt; 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) in our study also suggests that as time of isolation proceeded, pressure of positive selection for some genes might have also relaxed to a lower <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> values due to accumulation of mutations at synonymous sites in the genes. Study in mammal genomes also indicated that positive selection is often episodic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kosiol et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p> Unfortunately, our study cannot track the evolutionary fate of specific genes within a taxon pair through time to provide direct evidence for these explanations on the observed relationships. Nonetheless, we examined <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> values of the 79 POGs shared by 90% or more taxon pairs that diverged at different times to see if the same orthologous genes exhibit a relationship between variation of <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> values and time. A simple scattered plot in excel for the divergence times and the <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> values (with <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> values = 0, 99 removed) of the 79 POGs shared by 90% or more taxa revealed that eight of these genes had a correlation at <italic>r</italic> &gt; 0.5, among which two correlations were positive and six were negative (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). The <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratios of POGs that showed a correlation with times were all smaller than 1.0 (all &lt;0.5 except for a couple of cases). These data provide another line of indirect evidence congruent with the hypothesis that some genes may have indeed shifted the pressure of purifying selection (intensified or relaxed) during the evolutionary divergence of the taxon pair. When only including <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratios smaller than 0.5 in the analysis of these 79 POGs, the number of genes showing correlation with time increased (9 positive and seven negative relationships with <italic>r</italic> &gt; 0.5; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). The relationships are strong in a few genes for either pattern. This observation suggests, perhaps, the presence and elimination of slightly deleterious nonsynonymous substitutions play a major role in the changes of <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratios. Lack of correlation between <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratios and time for most of the 79 POGs also suggests that the evolutionary fate of most of these POGs is more taxon-specific independent of time. Although most of them were under purifying selection, a handful cases were under putative positive selection with (<italic>Ka/Ks</italic> &gt; 1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>) which are more found in the aquatic <italic>Nelumbo</italic> and <italic>Saururus</italic> genera.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Genes under strong positive selection</title><p>The number and predicted functions of genes under strong positive selection (<italic>Ka</italic>/<italic>Ks</italic> &gt; 2) varied among the disjunct pairs, and a large proportion of the GO terms are unique to a single genus, suggesting that the divergence and evolutionary adaptation of the species in each genus has been likely facilitated by different molecular mechanisms and biological processes. For example, among the 20 lineages we examined, the aquatic eudicot <italic>Nelumbo</italic> has the largest proportion of its POGs under positive selection and the smallest proportion of POGs under purifying selection, while the reverse is found in the terrestrial twining vine <italic>Gelsemium,</italic> a member of the asterid clade Gentianales. The two species of <italic>Nelumbo, N. nucifera</italic> (EA) and <italic>N. lutea</italic> (ENA), differ in four features of their reproductive structures, including tepal color and persistence, receptacle color, and fruit shape. Gene annotation identified 12 genes under strong positive selection for response to stimulus, nine for regulation of gene expression, seven for developmental process, eight for DNA-templated transcription, and eight for cellular lipid metabolic process. These genes may be interesting for future investigation into their roles in observed morphological divergence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). In <italic>Gelsemium</italic>, 12 morphological characters in reproductive structures (including inflorescence size, floral shape/size, fruit and seed morphology, etc.; see list in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wyatt et al., 1993</xref>) and two vegetative structures (petiole length and leaf shape) differ between the two disjunct species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wyatt et al., 1993</xref>). Gene annotation for strong positive selection genes in this genus identified two for plastid organization, two for photosynthesis (light reaction), three for response to stress, two for establishment of localization in the cell, three for oxidation-reduction process, two for response to light stimulus, three for proteolysis, two for regulation of biological quality, two for negative regulation of metabolic process, three for signal transduction, and two for RNA processing, among others. The biological processes involving the positively selected genes all differ between the two genera except for DNA metabolic process, which was common to both, involving seven genes in <italic>Nelumbo</italic> and two genes in <italic>Gelsemium</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p><p>It is difficult to decipher if there is any link between the positively selected genes and morphology without additional evidence, but these genes may serve as candidates for further detailed population genetics and evo-devo studies to test their roles. Many of the positively selected genes could also have been involved in divergence of cryptic characteristics that are unknown, and thus serve as a guide for future investigation. The GO terms of these genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) support that possible ecological/environmental pressures or selection agents that differ between the growing habitats of the taxon pairs in EA and ENA or other areas may have driven the extent of divergence in these genera. For example, the positive selection genes (<italic>Ka/Ks</italic> &gt; 2) with GO terms in our study are enriched for immunity/stimuli responses. Similar case is also found in positive selection genes in mammals which were enriched for a wide variety of functions related to immunity and defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kosiol et al., 2008</xref>). Identification of the specific sites under positive selection in these genes would be helpful to guide future studies on the potential functional consequences of selection. Unfortunately, our comparisons of two sequences for each gene in each taxon pair did not have the power for such analysis. Further analyses of these genes with increased taxon/population sampling will be needed to identify the particular sites of selection.</p><p>The single GO term common to all 20 taxon pairs was annotated to integral component of membrane (ICM) and was most abundant among the cell component terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>, row in bright red). This also suggests that a potential common regional force acting on these taxa resulted in the adaptive evolution of ICM genes, which may be involved in some of the common biological processes, such as signaling associated with host-microbe interactions and responses to various stimuli. When examining the names of these integral cell membrane component genes, they seem to vary among taxa, and it is difficult to determine if they are involved in similar biological processes in different taxa, without additional evidence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). These positively selected genes of integral cell membrane component provide candidates for future studies to understand the causes and consequences of their molecular evolution.</p><p>Recent studies have revealed repeated patterns of genomic divergence associated with species formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pereira et al., 2016</xref>). Such patterns was considered as evidence suggesting that natural selection tends to target a set of available genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pereira et al., 2016</xref>). Our study found a set of genes was targeted for strong positive selection in each taxon pair, suggesting that these genes may play a role for the allopatric divergence of the studied taxon pairs. Although the set of genes differed among taxon pairs, 12 were shared by 10–15 pairs and one of them was share by all pairs. Whether these common targets reflect shared biological processes unique to the allopatric divergence of the studied taxa or general to allopatric or even sympatric divergence of all taxa need to be tested by further studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Uncertainty in gene copy, orthology, Ka/Ks estimation, and divergence time estimation</title><p>We stress that the POGs in leaf transcriptomes analyzed here are putative orthologs between the two species of each biogeographic pair found in the transcriptomes by OrthoMCL followed by analyses using customized scripts (see Methods below). As discussed above, some of them may represent paralogous copies of the low-copy gene family, but such cases are expected to be uncommon due to the close relationship between the compared taxa of each pair. In these taxon pairs, conservation of expression of a gene copy in the same tissue of the same growth stage is likely. Rare cases of non-homology of POGs would not affect the conclusions derived from thousands of putatively orthologous comparisons. OrthoMCL is known to perform reasonably well in identifying orthologous genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altenhoff and Dessimoz, 2009</xref>). Unfortunately, we do not have genome sequences for any pairs of taxon to confirm the orthology via phylogenetic analyses of gene families. We conducted phylogenetic analyses of the seven POGs shared among the 20 taxon pairs and 79 POGs shared by &gt;90% taxon pairs, respectively, using raxml. The results showed all taxon pairs were grouped as sister taxa in each of the gene trees, in accordance with the expectation that the sequence pairs are orthologous genes. Otherwise, we would have observed separation of sister taxa on the gene tree.</p><p>We are aware that uncertainty in <italic>Ka</italic>/<italic>Ks</italic> ratios is high when <italic>Ks</italic> is zero or close to zero. This uncertainty may mislead the identification of genes under strong positive selection as discussed above. In our data, most of the genes (except a few) with <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> &gt; 2 had <italic>Ks</italic> &gt; 0.005 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp12">Supplementary file 12</xref>). Our plots of the <italic>Ks</italic> vs. <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> values in each taxon pair show that the genes with <italic>Ka</italic>/<italic>Ks</italic> &gt; 2 have a range of <italic>Ks</italic> values from small to large in all taxon pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig22">22</xref>), indicating the candidate genes under positive selection detected in the study are unlikely artifacts of small <italic>Ks</italic>.</p><p>We also recognize that the divergence times of each taxon pair calculated using BEAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drummond and Rambaut, 2007</xref>) and the global phylogeny including all 20 pairs may be somewhat underestimated due to sparse sampling of a deep phylogeny containing both very long and short branches and few calibrations only at deep nodes (see Methods and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiang et al., 2011</xref>) that may fall beyond the smoothing capability of BEAST. However, the results are very similar to previous estimates based on <italic>rbcL</italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiang et al., 2000</xref>). Despite the possible bias, the influence may be similar across the tree and does not renter their suitability for correlation analyses conducted in the study because the relative order of divergence of the species pairs estimated here is expected to be consistent. Although the divergence times may have been underestimated, we do not think it will not render the implication of a major pattern of BLB migration for the studied taxa because the divergence time need to be ~20–40 million years older for migration across the North Atlantic land bridge.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our comparative analyses of putative single-copy or low-copy genes from transcriptome data of 20 angiosperm lineages in Eurasia and North America reveal a consistent pattern of molecular divergence following allopatry, supporting a potential universal conservatism rule of genomic architecture governing the evolution of these genes. Our data of temporal isolation in the Neogene (or more recent) of the 16 EA-ENA taxon pairs also support an important role of the Bering Land Bridge for intercontinental migration of these taxa. We also identified a total of over 200 genes with annotation under putative strong positive selection following allopatric speciation across these genera, with some annotated to biological processes responding to various stimuli, providing a pool of candidates for future studies to understand the link between speciation and molecular and morphological divergence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sampling, RNA extraction, and transcriptome sequencing</title><p>Leaf materials were collected from wild or cultivated plants grown in botanical gardens or arboreta (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>) and flash frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and stored at −80°C until RNA extraction was conducted. Total RNA was then extracted from this tissue using the CTAB method of Jordon-Thaden et al.

For each species, prior to contig assembly, reads with poor quality were deleted from the data set, following the standard protocol of Illumina sequencing. Specifically, raw reads were trimmed at the 3’ end when the Phred quality score of a read dropped below Q = 20 (or 0.01 probability of error) for two consecutive bases. All 5’ and 3’ stretches of ambiguous ‘N’ nucleotides and sequences of less than 20 bp were removed from sequence trimming using CLC Genomics Workbench 4.6.1 (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark). Reads of each species were assembled into contigs by Trinity software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grabherr et al., 2011</xref>). Then, for each taxon pair, POGs were identified using orthoMCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2003</xref>) and custom Perl scripts as follows. Generally, default parameters were selected for each step of this gene-selection pipeline. “OrthoMCL starts with reciprocal best hits within each transcriptome/genome as potential in-paralog/recent paralog pairs and reciprocal best hits across any two genomes as potential ortholog pairs. Related proteins are interlinked in a similarity graph. Then MCL (Markov Clustering algorithm,Van Dongen 2000; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.micans.org/mcl">www.micans.org/mcl</ext-link>) is invoked to split mega-clusters’. The key steps in OrthoMCL included (1) ‘orthomclFilterFasta’ step: the program removes low-quality sequences with sequence length &lt;30 bp and percent stop codons &gt; 20%; (2) ‘blastall’ step: the program runs all-v-all Blastn with filtered sequences in the above step with default parameters ‘-v 100000 -b 100000 m 8 -e 1e-5’; (3) ‘orthomclPairs step: the program finds pairs of proteins that are potential orthologs, in-paralogs, or co-orthologs; (4) the ‘mcl’ program split mega-clusters into the final OrthoMCL ortholog groups; and (5) the ortholog groups file is outputted by OrthoMCL. In the ortholog groups file for a taxon pair, if a gene group contains a single gene from each taxon, this group was then picked as a ‘single-copy ortholog group’ using a custom Perl script. We refer here to these genes as putative orthologs (i.e. POGs) and note that they are ‘single-copy’ in the context of the comparisons – i.e., transcriptomes of a single tissue in a single taxon pair – and thus may not truly be single-copy genes within either of the taxa in each comparison. Each ‘single-copy’ ortholog of a taxon pair was further analyzed by scanning the ortholog groups file using the protein sequence-based ESTScan software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lottaz et al., 2003</xref>) for CDS. The CDS sequences of each single-copy ortholog were aligned and converted into PAML format by MAFFT software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>) and custom Perl scripts. The Perl scripts and complete pipeline (GDMET – Genome Duplication and Molecular Evolution by Transcriptome Sequences) developed for these data analyses is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ybdong919/GDMETS/releases">https://github.com/ybdong919/GDMETS/releases</ext-link>.

First, the single-copy or low-copy gene names of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> shared by seed plants or flowering plants were downloaded from the respective publications. Second, the dataset including all cDNA sequences of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> was downloaded from its genome database (TAIR10: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arabidopsis.org/">https://www.arabidopsis.org/</ext-link>). Then the cDNA sequences of the single-copy or low-copy gene of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> shared by seed plants or flowering plants were selected out from the dataset of all cDNA using gene names by Perl script. Finally, the cDNA sequences from each of the 20 taxon-pairs were mapped against the selected gene cDNA sequences of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> by Blast program, and those that were mapped by the cDNA from each of the 20 taxon pairs were selected and recorded by Perl script.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Molecular analyses of POGs – rate of substitution, selection, and gene annotation</title><p>To examine the level of molecular divergence and identify genes under positive selection following geographic isolation, synonymous substitutions per site (<italic>Ks</italic>), nonsynonymous substitutions per site (<italic>Ka</italic>), and the ratio (<italic>Ka</italic>/<italic>Ks</italic>) were calculated for each POGs with estimated standard error (SE) in each taxon pair. The ‘yn00’ model in the PAML package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang, 2007</xref>) was used to calculate <italic>Ks</italic>, <italic>Ka</italic>, and their ratio values. A complete pipeline (GDMET) was developed for these data analyses (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ybdong919/GDMETS/releases">https://github.com/ybdong919/GDMETS/releases</ext-link>). The yn2000 method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang and Nielsen, 2000</xref>) estimated synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates with corrections for multiple substitutions at the same site and takes into account of transition/transversion rate bias, base/codon frequency bias.</p><p>To test if the level of sequence divergence at synonymous sites observed in most genes is reflective of the relative divergence time of a taxon pair, the relationship between divergence time estimated using genes shared among taxon pairs and the global phylogeny including all taxon pairs (see below for details) and <italic>Ks</italic> values at the peak frequency in each taxon pair was evaluated using a CORREL function in Excel. The <italic>Ks</italic> values of POGs in each taxon pair were divided into groups of segments that span 0.01 units (e.g., 0–0.01, 0.01–0.02, 0.02–0.03…). The medium value of the <italic>Ks</italic> range with the highest frequency (referred to as ‘<italic>Ks</italic> value at peak frequency’) was used for the correlation analyses with medium value of the estimated divergence time. This comparison involved potential overlap of some data (i.e., the synonymous substitutions), because the gene pool with the <italic>Ks</italic> value that is most frequent in the transcriptome data may include the genes used for divergence time dating. Although the divergence time analysis used total substitutions (including both <italic>Ka</italic> and <italic>Ks</italic>) in the selected genes (seven shared by all 20 taxon pairs and 79 shared by 90% or more taxon pairs; see details below), we realize that overlapping of the <italic>Ks</italic> data can reduce the stringency of the analysis, if present. Nonetheless, the analysis can show if the phylogeny and total substitutions-based divergence time is correlated with the level of <italic>Ks</italic> divergence from pair-wise comparison. If they are correlated, it will suggest that the divergence time estimated with all characters in a small set of genes that are common among taxon pairs can be predicted by the most frequent <italic>Ks</italic> value from pair-wise comparisons of the genome-wide set of genes in the taxon pair, and both reflect the divergence level of the taxon pair.</p><p>To explore the variation pattern of selection pressures of POGs within the genome, we calculated the relative abundance of genes under different ranges of selection pressures. To gain insights into how the variation pattern has changed over time, we examined relationships of the <italic>Ks</italic> values at peak frequency and divergence time with the abundance of genes under different selection intensities (i.e., <italic>Ka</italic>/<italic>Ks</italic> values in different ranges) by correlation analysis using CORREL function in Excel to obtain correlation coefficients. In a few taxon pairs, two consecutive <italic>Ks</italic> ranges have very similar frequencies. We then re-ran the correlation analyses using a modified <italic>Ks</italic> value for comparison, as follows. The modified <italic>Ks</italic> is the middle value of the <italic>Ks</italic> range of the two frequencies if they differ by &lt;10% of the combined frequency, e.g., if <italic>Ks</italic> 0.01–0.02 had a frequency of 21%, <italic>Ks</italic> 0.02–0.03 had a frequency of 19%, the <italic>Ks</italic> in &quot;peak frequency&quot; was determined as 0.02. The difference between 21% and 19% is 2%, less than 10% of 21%+19% (40%). The results using modified <italic>Ks</italic> show no changes in the trends of relationships reported using <italic>Ks</italic> at peak frequency.</p><p>The POGs with <italic>Ka</italic>/<italic>Ks</italic> values greater than two were annotated by Blast2Go v5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conesa et al., 2005</xref>). First, Blastx-fast was used to identify similar, potentially homologous sequences from the green plants (No. taxa: 33,090, Viridiplantae) subset of the non-redundant protein database. A value of 1.0E-5 was assigned to Blast expectation value (E-value), while the other arguments were default. All IDs of these similar sequences were matched against the Gene Ontology (GO) database. Based on the information from Blast and mapping, the most plausible Gene Ontology terms were assigned to the input sequences. We further executed the InterPro step in parallel to the Blast step to identify protein domains and families from the InterPro collection of databases. The functions based on domains and families were merged to the functions from the Blast hits of gene sequences and gene mapping (for details of gene mapping, see introduction of Blast2GO, as described above).</p><p>The POGs with <italic>Ka</italic>/<italic>Ks</italic> values greater than two in each taxon pair were also analyzed with variation cluster method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wagner, 2007</xref>) to see how many of these genes also contain significant signal of clustered substitutions, a deviation from neutral molecular evolution and expectation of positive expectation. For each pair of these POG sequences considered, we inferred a codon-preserving local alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith and Waterman, 1981</xref>), removed alignment gaps and identified all positions that differed in that alignment using a custom perl script.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Vincent Savolainen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors utilize comparative transcriptomics to estimate the role of evolution in singleton conserved genes following major geological events that lead to isolation by distance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The utilization of <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> as a strict threshold to call positive selection across species with different evolutionary histories and separation times was considered potentially suspect and possibly creating some of the main conclusions. Some support for this claim and/or alternative approaches for these comparisons should be provided.</p><p>2) The observation by the authors that the relationship between <italic>Ka</italic> and <italic>Ks</italic> can invert at lower <italic>Ks</italic> is at some conflict with the published literature. The reviewers were wondering if this may be a bias in the data or if there are other avenues in the data that also support this. For example, does this trend hold up if individual POGs are followed across time?</p><p>3) A much tighter editing in the entire manuscript to reflect the potential bias that is incorporated via the use of POGs. The reviewers understood this choice to allow rate estimation, but it is still a biased set of genes that could be greatly influencing any and all evolutionary conclusions.</p><p>4) The figure presentation was not optimal and needs significant work to engage with the reader. I should note that all three reviewers commented on how the present figure presentations will undercut the potential impact of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors work to understand how geographic isolation has influenced genome wide evolution. To do this, they looked at the divergence of single-copy orthologues as these are the most directly comparable. This used transcriptome sequencing to identify the orthologues between species. I have some concerns about the methodology and how this may have influenced the claims and observations in this manuscript. These concerns are such that it is not clear how many of the claims and observations are linked to the use of POGs versus an approximation of the whole selective processes influencing these species.</p><p>I worry about the bias that using POGs introduces into the general conclusions derived from this work. POGs are by definition likely under a completely different selective schema than non-POGs. Previously work has shown that POGs are biased towards processes like developmental regulators and primary metabolism that are likely under purifying selection. In contrast, non-POGs are biased towards disease and biotic interaction loci that are potentially under different selective pressures. As such, it is not clear if using POGs provide any ability to discuss evolutionary processes at the species level. Instead, the discussion should be limited to what the POGs have experienced. At the start of the Discussion section, this limitation is implicit in that the discussion is always about the POGs. But then the discussion starts moving to whole genome and entire species level discussions without caveating that the POGs might provide a biased view. I don't think it is possible to use the POGs evolution to make any claims about whole genome events or whole species processes. The POGs are a list that is a priori biased towards genes that are under strong purifying selection and they exclude the majority of genes that may be under diversifying or other non-purifying selection processes.

The POGs are useful for estimating relative divergence time but absolute is fuzzier given the bias in selective events linked to POGs. Further, this bias in selective events means that it is only possible to compare selective forces on POGs and not selective forces on the whole genome.</p><p>The use of transcriptomics to sequence genes makes it hard to really ascertain if the identified positive selection is really positive or possibly an artifact of duplication, sub-functionalization and inaccurate POG identification. Some ascertainment of bias the transcriptome introduces above genome sequence identification of POGs would be needed to determine how much technical vs biological signal is present in the positive selection data. There is some effort to address these concerns in the Discussion section however this section is separate from the rest of the discussion so that a reader would have to make it to the end to realize that there are concerns.

Specifically, the authors indicate that it remains an open question &quot;how genome [have diverged] over time after geographic isolation has halted gene flow&quot;. The major findings include: (1) &gt;90% of genes are under purifying selection, (2) divergence time estimates, which are based on synonymous substitution rates, correlates positively and negatively with proportions of genes under moderate and strong purification selection, respectively, (3) 200 genes under strong positive selection, few are shared across species.</p><p>The authors reasoned that findings (1, 3) may indicate maintenance of a balance between the ability to conserve ancestral functions and the ability to evolve new features beneficial for new adaptations. In some of the earliest cross-species comparative genomics studies in early 2000s, this has been noted. Thus, it is not clear what the significance of this finding is beyond the fact that the specific species have not been examined in this context. The connection between geographic isolation over time and the evolutionary rate of genes – initially genes are experiencing strong purifying selection, then this selection is relaxed – is intriguing. But there is one line of evidence supporting this claim, indirectly. I have suggested alternative approach that may be more informative. Below are details on the above points as well as other thoughts on the manuscript.</p><p>- Results section: It is too simplistic to use the <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> value over a threshold to call genes that are under positive selection. Particularly, as the authors pointed out, the species pairs have diverged quite recently where &quot;most genes&quot; (define what most means) have <italic>Ka</italic> &lt; 0.04. The fewer the sites are used to infer substitution rates, the corresponding variances for the estimates will be larger and render the estimates unreliable. Thus, the criteria for calling genes with positive selection needs to be more stringent and the authors need to incorporate considerations of variance of estimates to provide statistical support for their calls. This is a point the authors concur in their discussion. But by just removing extreme values, the underlying issue on the reliability of estimates remain unaddressed.</p><p>- Related to the point above, in the Results section, the authors conducted gene set enrichment analysis of potentially positively selected genes. Given I am not convinced that the genes the authors focused on are truly under position selection, I cannot evaluate the results of enrichment analysis.</p><p>- Results section, Figure 5: The authors use BEAST to infer divergence time and then try to determine the relationships between inferred divergence time and <italic>Ks</italic> – it is not clear what the purpose is as these two estimates are confounding. My understanding is that BEAST uses prior probability based on sequence evolution rate estimates to infer posterior probability of a divergence time estimate. The underlying assumption and considerations for <italic>Ks</italic> estimation and the evolutionary rate considered as prior in BEAST are similar. So, these two sets of values are dependent. In the, the authors went on and suggest that this pattern &quot;revealed a repeated genome-wide pattern of divergence of POGs among the taxon pairs in allopatric speciation…&quot; Given the confounding nature of <italic>Ks</italic> and divergence time estimate, I am not sure if such conclusion is justified.</p><p>- Results section, Figure 6: here is the core finding for the authors' claim on the relationships between divergence time and selection pressure. It is clear that, using these species pairs, the earlier diverging (peak <italic>Ks</italic>, not sure why the more accurate divergence time estimate not used here) ones tend to have larger proportion of genes under stronger selection. The effect size of the correlation is rather remarkable. One unclear aspect of the analysis is whether the genes examined are the same across species pairs. It was noted that there are few orthologous genes that are 1-to-1 among most species pairs. Thus, it is likely the analysis is done using all available pairs. If that is the case, how should one compare one species pair to another?</p><p>- Related to the point above, the patterns based on proportions are difficult to interpret. A direct way to demonstrate the authors' point is by examining the evolution rate of EACH orthologous gene pair and show that a gene experienced stronger purifying selection initially than later on the selection was relaxed. Since this is central to the authors' major point, this should be demonstrated. In addition to potentially providing support for the authors' claim, it will provide some resolution to the study in which genes contribute to the patterns, particularly if the authors follow up with gene set enrichment analysis on those exhibit the expected patterns.</p><p>- Discussion section: The authors discussed a few of the caveats in the study which is helpful. Aside from the point on rate estimate raised earlier, I am not sure that I agree with the authors' assertion that &quot;the likelihood of non-orthology of these genes is probably very low…&quot; using transcriptome-based inference. The arguments are not supported by quantitative information and is hand-wavy. It will be useful to bring in comparative genomic studies as reference points. Otherwise, it remains a potential thorny issue in their methodology.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper looks at the evolution of genes in pairs of species that have been isolated geographically. To do so, the authors selected 20 pairs that have a South East Asia versus North America disjunction and calculated the ratio of nonsynonymous versus synonymous substitutions across their transcriptomes. This is a clever approach. Strikingly, they found some sort of constancy in the results, with that &gt;90% of the genes examined being under purifying selection and &lt;10% being under positive selection. This is what we would expect, but it is a nice way to show it, using comparative analyses and large datasets. I would think people have looked at this in model organisms (mice, humans), but not throughout wild plant species. I think it would definitely make a great contribution to <italic>eLife</italic>, although I think the author could make more of a general point by adding other pairs of taxa, such as those from a North to South America disjunction, or South America versus Africa disjunction, or maybe even using species that have colonised island versus mainland sisters. I think the text could be made clearer to the readers, e.g. explaining, what is the expectation of <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratio under positive or purifying selection (I would also use <italic>Kn</italic> rather than <italic>Ka</italic> for nonsynonymous substitutions). I noted there are some custom scripts used here, have they been made available as supplementary information or in a public repository? For the dating exercise, did I understand correctly that the tree was built and dated with BEAST using 7 POGs shared by all taxa, and then the dates were plotted against <italic>Ks</italic> for the other genes to avoid circularity? Finally, I think the figures could be made much nicer (artwork); there are also many inconsistencies in the reference section; but I would recommend acceptance pending concerns above have been taken into account.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45199.057</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors utilize comparative transcriptomics to estimate the role of evolution in singleton conserved genes following major geological events that lead to isolation by distance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The utilization of Ka/Ks as a strict threshold to call positive selection across species with different evolutionary histories and separation times was considered potentially suspect and possibly creating some of the main conclusions.

We will further clarify the effectiveness of <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> in examining the pattern of variation of selection pressure on genes and comparing it among lineages in the revised manuscript. Previous studies have indicated that data from the various lineages provide parallel evidence on molecular evolution following allopatric divergence. A potential concern, though, may be the accuracy of <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> estimation (e.g., potential saturation of <italic>Ks</italic> in taxon pair separated by older times and very small <italic>Ks</italic> value in taxon pairs separated recently – leading to inflated <italic>Ka/Ks</italic>). We cleared this concern in the manuscript (please see methods and discussion in line 637-666). For the time scale of divergence across species pairs, we have explained that saturation of <italic>Ks</italic> is unlikely or rare (please see discussion section). We removed <italic>Ks</italic> = 0 data points in all of the analyses. Furthermore, we examined the distribution of <italic>Ks</italic> for genes with <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> &gt;2 and found the <italic>Ks</italic> values varied in a range, not clustered near zero).</p><p>We provide support for the claim of <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> to identify positive selection and alternative approaches for comparisons as below:</p><p>1) The main finding is the pattern observed among lineages and identification of a small subset of genes under strong positive selection with <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> &gt;2. Comparison of the rates of fixation of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations provides a powerful tool for understanding the mechanisms of DNA sequence evolution. The ratio of nonsynonymous (<italic>Ka</italic> or <italic>dN</italic>) to synonymous (<italic>Ks</italic> or <italic>dS</italic>) nucleotide substitutions is considered probably the most common method for identifying positive selection (<italic>Ka/Ks</italic>&gt;1) (Yang, 2003) in molecular evolutionary studies. The method is known to be a conservative approach to call positive selection on a gene as it uses an average <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratio across all nucleotide sites. It is possible that some genes have an overall <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> &lt;1 but some sites might have positive selections with <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> &gt;1. This limitation does not affect the comparison of the pattern of variation of molecular divergence across lineages. The ratio of <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> values were used to partition the genes into arbitrary categories different in selection pressures.</p><p>2) For identification genes under positive selection, we took caution to call only those with <italic>Ka/Ks</italic>&gt;2 and annotated them to provide candidates under strong positive selection for future studies. We did revise to apply an alternative method (variation cluster) to confirm signals of positive selections in the candidate genes (Wagner, 2007; see more below).</p><p>3) The Yn2000 model in codeml of PAML applied in the study is a maximum likelihood method for estimation of <italic>dN</italic> and <italic>dS</italic>. As stated by the authors “the ML method, which accounts for both the transition bias and the codon usage bias, should be the preferred method for estimating <italic>dS</italic> and <italic>dN</italic> between two sequences.” (Yang and Nielson, 2000). This method has been widely used for detecting positive selection in genes. Another common method for detecting positive selection is examining the allele frequency spectrum of the gene in the population. – this is based on population data, not feasible to our study.</p><p>4) “Two broad classes of approaches exist to identify positive selection (Kreitman, 2000; Bamshad and Wooding, 2003). They both rely on predictions made by the neutral theory of molecular evolution (Kimura, 1983). The first approach compares the incidence of two different classes of genetic change within genes (Li, 1997; Kreitman, 2000), synonymous (silent) changes, which are likely to be neutral, and nonsynonymous or amino acid replacement changes, which are more likely subject to selection. Specifically, the ratio <italic>N/S</italic> of the number of nonsynonymous (<italic>N</italic>) to synonymous (<italic>S</italic>) changes per gene, or the ratio <italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>s</sub> of the fraction of nonsynonymous (<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub>) to synonymous changes (<italic>K</italic><sub>s</sub>) per nonsynonymous and synonymous site, can give an indication of positive selection. A ratio <italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>s</sub> significantly greater than one, for example, indicates an excess of amino acid replacement substitutions over (neutral or weakly selected) silent substitutions. It indicates positive selection. Many variations of this class of test exist. They differ in the amount of sequence data and computational resources required (Suzuki and Gojobori, 1999; Suzuki, 2004; Massingham and Goldman, 2005; Pond and Frost, 2005; Zhang et al., 2005). The second class of tests relies on predictions made by the neutral theory for allele or haplotype frequencies (Kreitman, 2000; Bamshad and Wooding, 2003) within and among populations. For example, in a genomic region where positive selection has swept a mutation to high frequency, one would expect a low amount of sequence diversity, an excess of rare alleles, and a greater amount of linkage disequilibrium than predicted by the neutral theory (Bamshad and Wooding, 2003). Selection acting on one population but not others can lead to a greater than expected degree of population differentiation. Test statistics, such as Tajima's <italic>D</italic>, Fu's <italic>W</italic>, Wright's <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub>, and many others, exploit information in these patterns (Fu, 1996; Tajima, 1989; Kreitman, 2000). The distinction between such tests is not sharp, and some tests (McDonald and Kreitman, 1991) arguably fall into both categories.” (Wagner, 2007).</p><p>5) &quot;Rapid Detection of Positive Selection in Genes and Genomes Through Variation clusters?” was developed for detecting positive selection for pairs of sequences by Wagner, (2007). It “…detects <italic>variation clusters</italic> of aggregated nucleotide substitutions that are too closely spaced to be observed by chance alone and that thus violate the predicted distribution of substitution spacing for neutral variation.”. We ran this method for genes with <italic>dN/dS</italic> &gt; 2 for all species pairs to see if how many of them contain significant signals of substitution clustering.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The observation by the authors that the relationship between Ka and Ks can invert at lower Ks is at some conflict with the published literature. The reviewers were wondering if this may be a bias in the data or if there are other avenues in the data that also support this. For example, does this trend hold up if individual POGs are followed across time?</p></disp-quote><p>We observed a weak negative trend between <italic>Ks</italic> and the enrichment of <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> genes with <italic>Ka/Ks</italic>&gt;1, suggesting as divergence time increased, enrichment of this category of genes may decrease due to the change of selection pressure on some genes. This may be a result of accumulation of synonymous substitution in the gene.</p><p>We did not observe revert relationship between <italic>Ka</italic> and <italic>Ks</italic>. We observed that at low <italic>Ks</italic> (recent divergence time within 10 million years) and at the range of <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> within 0.5 or below, the relationship between the gene enrichment and time is reversed (positive for 0.1 &lt;<italic>Ka/Ks</italic> &lt;0.5; negative for <italic>Ka/Ks</italic>&lt;0.1). So we speculated an explanation for these observations: some genes relaxed the purifying selection force from strong force. We do not have direct evidence to support this within a species pair. We examined the POG shared by different taxa diverged at different times as suggested by the reviewer 3, and did find that some genes with <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> &lt;0.5 (or regardless the <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> values) showed a positive relationship between the <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> values and the divergence time. But many did not show a correlation. The common genome-wide pattern of POG evolution is likely an outcome of both gene and taxon specific effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A much tighter editing in the entire manuscript to reflect the potential bias that is incorporated via the use of POGs. The reviewers understood this choice to allow rate estimation, but it is still a biased set of genes that could be greatly influencing any and all evolutionary conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the text extensively and made clear that the study examined one set of genes and the pattern found was a “genome-wide” pattern of these genes. We reorganized the manuscript and moved the discussion of caveats of the study to the front. An inspection of our transcriptome data showed that a majority (~60%-80%) of the ortholog groups (gene families) identified in our study were the POGs examined, indicating the POGs represent a significant portion of the transcriptome. We added this information to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The figure presentation was not optimal and needs significant work to engage with the reader. I should note that all three reviewers commented on how the present figure presentations will undercut the potential impact of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments. We have redrawn the first three figures to break down the composite figure of all lineages to 20 individual small figures. We think the new figures showed much clearer distribution of the <italic>Ka, Ks</italic>, and <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> values in each taxon pair.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors work to understand how geographic isolation has influenced genome wide evolution. To do this, they looked at the divergence of single-copy orthologues as these are the most directly comparable. This used transcriptome sequencing to identify the orthologues between species. I have some concerns about the methodology and how this may have influenced the claims and observations in this manuscript. These concerns are such that it is not clear how many of the claims and observations are linked to the use of POGs versus an approximation of the whole selective processes influencing these species.</p><p>I worry about the bias that using POGs introduces into the general conclusions derived from this work. POGs are by definition likely under a completely different selective schema than non-POGs. Previously work has shown that POGs are biased towards processes like developmental regulators and primary metabolism that are likely under purifying selection. In contrast, non-POGs are biased towards disease and biotic interaction loci that are potentially under different selective pressures. As such, it is not clear if using POGs provide any ability to discuss evolutionary processes at the species level. Instead, the discussion should be limited to what the POGs have experienced. At the start of the Discussion section, this limitation is implicit in that the discussion is always about the POGs. But then the discussion starts moving to whole genome and entire species level discussions without caveating that the POGs might provide a biased view.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewer referring to previous work reporting annotated gene functions of probably true single copy genes based on genome information. Some or many of the genes we studied may represent non-single copy genes (or low copy gene families). Our annotation of genes under positive selection revealed some of the genes were involved in biological processes responding to environmental stimuli.</p><p>Previous studies showed that the genome does not evolve in a homogeneous manner. Different type of genes and different portion of the genome may experience different evolutionary processes. Purifying selection, positive selection, and neutral evolution are all evolutionary processes. Evolutionary process is not restricted to positive selection. Our study examined molecular divergence and evolution of POGs to provide a view of divergence of the species in these genes. Thanks, the reviewer reminding that we take care to be clearer about the interpretation. Evolution of non-POGs can be examined in the future through analyses of each gene families across the genome to understand the evolution of those genes. Together, the data will provide a more complete view of molecular evolution of these species.

In the, the authors went on and suggest that this pattern &quot;revealed a repeated genome-wide pattern of divergence of POGs among the taxon pairs in allopatric speciation…&quot; Given the confounding nature of Ks and divergence time estimate, I am not sure if such conclusion is justified.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer may misunderstand the analyses and the points. The “repeated genome-wide pattern of divergence of POGs among the taxon pairs in allopatric speciation…&quot; refers to the relative enrichment/abundance of genes under different selection pressures, not relative to the divergence time estimations.</p><p>BEAST uses both <italic>dN</italic> and <italic>dS</italic> in estimating the divergence time of a portion of the genes shared by all the taxa (7 and 79 respectively). The purpose of comparing the divergence time and <italic>dS</italic> in peak frequency (in considering all POGs in a species pair, not just those shared among all taxon pairs) was to see if <italic>dS</italic> values that are most abundant in a species pair reflect the relative level of species isolation. The two data sets are not confounding. The genes with <italic>dS</italic> in peak frequencies are not the same genes used for divergence time dating.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Results section, Figure 6: here is the core finding for the authors' claim on the relationships between divergence time and selection pressure. It is clear that, using these species pairs, the earlier diverging (peak Ks, not sure why the more accurate divergence time estimate not used here) ones tend to have larger proportion of genes under stronger selection. The effect size of the correlation is rather remarkable. One unclear aspect of the analysis is whether the genes examined are the same across species pairs. It was noted that there are few orthologous genes that are 1-to-1 among most species pairs. Thus, it is likely the analysis is done using all available pairs. If that is the case, how should one compare one species pair to another?</p></disp-quote><p>The same genes may be under different selection pressures in different lineages. The group of genes under the same category of selection pressures may be different among taxon pairs. This does not prevent one to compare abundance of genes under different pressures and reported the observed pattern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Related to the point above, the patterns based on proportions are difficult to interpret. A direct way to demonstrate the authors' point is by examining the evolution rate of EACH orthologous gene pair and show that a gene experienced stronger purifying selection initially than later on the selection was relaxed. Since this is central to the authors' major point, this should be demonstrated. In addition to potentially providing support for the authors' claim, it will provide some resolution to the study in which genes contribute to the patterns, particularly if the authors follow up with gene set enrichment analysis on those exhibit the expected patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer may have misunderstood the manuscript. We reported the pattern (the abundance of genes &gt;0.1, &lt;0.5 were positively related to the divergence time, and abundance of genes with <italic>dN/dS</italic>, 0.1 negatively related to divergence times) and attempted to speculate a plausible explanation for this pattern of early divergence of the gene. We thought it is indirect evidence suggesting a scenario about relaxing of selection pressure of genes as evolution proceed in time. However, this relaxing of selection pressure may occur in different genes independently in different taxon pairs. This scenario does not predict that each orthologous gene will relax the selection pressure. Nonetheless, it is interesting to examine some orthologous genes shared among taxon pairs since the <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> variation of a gene through time cannot be tracked within a species pair. We examined the <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratio for 79 orthologous genes shared in 90 or more taxon pairs. We did a scattered graph between the divergence times and the <italic>dN/dS</italic> values that are less than 0.5 for each of the 79 genes to see if there are genes showing a trend of positive relationship between the two variables. Among these genes, a majority of them do not show apparent trend of relationship (with R squares &lt;0.05), while 21 of them show a trend of positive relationship and 16 showing a trend of negative relationship. The relationships are strong in a few genes in either pattern. The analyses were done by removing <italic>dN/dS</italic> values = 0 or 99, and those &gt;0.5.</p><p>The observation of increase of the proportion of genes in the category of 0.1&lt;<italic>ks/Ks</italic>&lt;0.5 only suggests probably selection relaxation of some genes during this early diverging stage. Beyond this level of purifying divergence, we did not observe a strong relationship between time and gene enrichment.</p><p>We have revised the manuscript and added these analyses in. The observation of a negative relationship between <italic>Ks</italic> in peak abundance (reflecting time) and enrichment of genes with <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> &gt;1 in our study was also reported in previous studies in mammals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Discussion section: The authors discussed a few of the caveats in the study which is helpful. Aside from the point on rate estimate raised earlier, I am not sure that I agree with the authors' assertion that &quot;the likelihood of non-orthology of these genes is probably very low…&quot; using transcriptome-based inference. The arguments are not supported by quantitative information and is hand-wavy. It will be useful to bring in comparative genomic studies as reference points. Otherwise, it remains a potential thorny issue in their methodology.</p></disp-quote><p>OrthoMCL performs well in identifying orthologous genes (Chen et al., 2007; Altenhoff and Dessimoz, 2009). We have reworded the text and cited references to support the argument. The transcript pairs were from the same tissue (leaf samples) collected in the same season. The assumption is that for recently diverged sister species, it is more likely that the same copy of genes are expressed in the same tissue during the same growing season as a result of gene functional conservation. We therefore cautiously call them putative orthologous single copy genes. Comparative genome sequences can confirm if the POGs are truly single copy. Only gene genealogy from phylogenetic analyses can confirm the orthology of genes from different taxa. Unfortunately, we do not have genome sequences for any pairs of taxon at the moment. Results of phylogenetic analyses of POGs shared among taxa showed all taxon pairs were grouped as sister taxa, suggesting that the sequence pairs are likely orthologous genes. Otherwise, we would have observed separation of sister taxa on the gene tree. We checked on the gene tree for each of the 7 genes shared by all 20 taxon pairs, and in all cases, the two sequences from the same taxon pair were grouped as sisters. These results provide evidence concordant with orthology of the sequence pairs. Most sequence pairs were highly similar (as evidenced by the low <italic>Ks</italic> values). We also did the same analyses for the 79 genes shared by 90% or more taxon pairs and found the same result. We believe the probability of non-homology of the sequence pairs is low. Comparative genome analyses of 20 angiosperms identified single copy orthologous genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The paper looks at the evolution of genes in pairs of species that have been isolated geographically. To do so, the authors selected 20 pairs that have a South East Asia versus North America disjunction and calculated the ratio of nonsynonymous versus synonymous substitutions across their transcriptomes. This is a clever approach. Strikingly, they found some sort of constancy in the results, with that &gt;90% of the genes examined being under purifying selection and &lt;10% being under positive selection. This is what we would expect, but it is a nice way to show it, using comparative analyses and large datasets. I would think people have looked at this in model organisms (mice, humans), but not throughout wild plant species. I think it would definitely make a great contribution to eLife, although I think the author could make more of a general point by adding other pairs of taxa, such as those from a North to South America disjunction, or South America versus Africa disjunction, or maybe even using species that have colonised island versus mainland sisters.</p></disp-quote><p>That would be a future study. Unfortunately, we do not have data for those pairs at the moment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think the text could be made clearer to the readers, e.g. explaining, what is the expectation of Ka/Ks ratio under positive or purifying selection (I would also use Kn rather than Ka for nonsynonymous substitutions).</p></disp-quote><p>We inserted new text in the Introduction to explain this. <italic>Ka</italic> is a standard symbol for rate of nonsynonymous substitutions in textbook.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I noted there are some custom scripts used here, have they been made available as supplementary information or in a public repository?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, they are deposited on a website and the URL is provided in the method (https://github.com/ybdong919/GDMETS.git.).
